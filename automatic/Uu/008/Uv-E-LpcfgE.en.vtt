 Dr. Jose Nart is a specialist in 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.230
 dentistry and belongs to the doctors the 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.329
 select circle of doctors closeup 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.429
 Spain level of expertise in the 

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:16.169
 treatment of periodontitis us 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.169
 will explain the details of this method 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.359
 Periodontitis is the most 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 frequent of the human being or one of the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.150
 more frequent and it seems that the more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.550
 frequent from the age of 35 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.320
 the present is a bacterial infection 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.450
 caused by bacteria that we do not know very 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.520
 well which are that destroys the support 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.930
 of the tooth the gum and the bone that are 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 supporting and holding teeth 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.660
 the first symptom that identifies the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.839
 population in general is the bleeding of 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.789
 gums or gingivitis when brushing 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.760
 especially or also in a way 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.609
 spontaneous and then other symptoms are the 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.289
 Mobility of teeth movement 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.670
 of the gum up or down 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:09.430
 leaving longer teeth 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.280
 mobility in the teeth and migration of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.110
 the teeth and opening of spaces between 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.810
 the teeth what we call spaces 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.740
 blacks or embrasures between the teeth 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.619
 then it can be also 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 bad taste odor halitosis o 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.070
 phlegmons 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.130
 we have no definitive evidence to 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.140
 answer this answer to this question 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.700
 some studies show that after 10 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 years of stable coexistence between 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
 Couples 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.530
 some of these many bacteria these 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.240
 bacteria from a patient to his partner he 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 convey the reality is that all 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.260
 we have all we have the bacteria 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.750
 that cause periodontitis to levels 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.190
 low and it's the overgrowth when 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.680
 we allow the bacterial plaque to 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.200
 accumulate in larger numbers what generates 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.659
 if we have more or less susceptibility 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.759
 genetic infection so bacteria 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.050
 is fundamental but then it depends on the 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.050
 susceptibility of the individual 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.250
 the treatment of periodontitis has 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.490
 three parts one is the part 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.440
 systemic anti-infective we say 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.730
 where we do and who we give motivate 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.500
 to the patient and we give instructions 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.440
 oral hygiene with if you want you have 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.170
 deep the bases to reduce the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.620
 bacterial load the second infection 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.410
 part is to finish eliminating 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.240
 bags or regenerate the gum or bone 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.970
 if possible with small 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.980
 surgical interventions or minimally 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.630
 invasive are very conservative the 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.830
 third part would be the maintenance that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.830
 it is absolutely necessary 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.870
 today we have studies 30 years after 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.580
 treatment of periodontitis where the 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.420
 tooth maintenance is very high 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 above 99% at 30 years 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.830
 the treatment of periodontitis does not 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.849
 it works well maintenance patients 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.150
 what are they that have proven to be 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.349
 susceptible must commit to open 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.980
 a lifetime maintenance that 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.720
 consists of hygiene is every 46 months of 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.270
 two and three if you want the year for the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 rest of his days we have us 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.580
 reduce the level of bacteria in your 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.580
 mouths
