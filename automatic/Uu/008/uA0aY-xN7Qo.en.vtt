00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.830 

dislike<00:01:07.910> of<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.570> part

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.420 

I<00:01:11.869> guess<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.860> can<00:01:13.010> say<00:01:13.250> that<00:01:13.280> and<00:01:15.280> making<00:01:16.280> that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
I guess you can say that and making that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.190 
I guess you can say that and making that
videos<00:01:16.909> kind<00:01:17.360> of<00:01:17.420> like<00:01:17.540> it<00:01:17.690> again

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.499 

spur-of-the-moment<00:01:21.200> video<00:01:22.000> I'm<00:01:23.000> still<00:01:23.329> new

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
spur-of-the-moment video I'm still new

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.270 
spur-of-the-moment video I'm still new
to<00:01:23.540> making<00:01:23.930> videos<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.500> things<00:01:24.649> like<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:24.920> I

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
to making videos and things like that I

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.550 
to making videos and things like that I
guess<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.759> should<00:01:25.909> have<00:01:26.000> waited

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
guess I should have waited

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.300 
guess I should have waited
probably<00:01:28.100> some<00:01:28.400> some<00:01:29.000> pros<00:01:29.210> out<00:01:29.450> there<00:01:30.310> except

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
probably some some pros out there except

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.389 
probably some some pros out there except
throwing<00:01:31.610> all<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.880> cons<00:01:32.119> out<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.079> go<00:01:33.229> pro<00:01:33.530> you

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
throwing all the cons out and go pro you

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.170 
throwing all the cons out and go pro you
know<00:01:34.579> pretty<00:01:35.180> much<00:01:36.040> in<00:01:37.040> a<00:01:37.280> nutshell<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.880> didn't

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
know pretty much in a nutshell I didn't

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.719 
know pretty much in a nutshell I didn't
like<00:01:38.299> the<00:01:38.420> product<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:39.140> didn't<00:01:39.710> like<00:01:39.920> what

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
like the product I didn't like what

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.999 
like the product I didn't like what
would<00:01:40.820> happen<00:01:40.880> to<00:01:41.299> you<00:01:41.390> here<00:01:41.689> we<00:01:42.229> wash<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.649> with

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
would happen to you here we wash it with

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.109 
would happen to you here we wash it with
something<00:01:43.250> I<00:01:43.729> guess<00:01:44.210> you<00:01:44.509> can<00:01:44.720> say<00:01:45.070> that<00:01:46.119> the

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
something I guess you can say that the

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.250 
something I guess you can say that the
white<00:01:47.299> residue<00:01:47.750> came<00:01:48.679> from<00:01:49.509> it

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
white residue came from it

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.620 
white residue came from it
that<00:01:52.410> mixing<00:01:53.130> with<00:01:53.400> baby<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:54.120> ecostyler<00:01:54.600> gel

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
that mixing with baby the ecostyler gel

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.200 
that mixing with baby the ecostyler gel
with<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.710> swab<00:01:55.980> natural<00:01:56.580> shampoo<00:01:57.060> and

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
with the swab natural shampoo and

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.740 
with the swab natural shampoo and
conditioner<00:01:57.690> it<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:59.010> it<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.270> didn't<00:02:00.600> go

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
conditioner it just is it just didn't go

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.700 
conditioner it just is it just didn't go
all<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.350> that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
all of that

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.800 
all of that
so<00:02:02.799> it's<00:02:03.610> just<00:02:03.729> like<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.150> eco<00:02:04.510> styler<00:02:04.720> gel

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
so it's just like you to eco styler gel

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.719 
so it's just like you to eco styler gel
moisturizer<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:06.070> that's<00:02:06.340> why<00:02:06.490> they<00:02:06.580> say

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
moisturizer and that's why they say

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.980 
moisturizer and that's why they say
don't<00:02:06.880> do<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.270> because<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.690> get<00:02:07.840> my
