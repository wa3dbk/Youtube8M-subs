craft<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.610> hobby<00:01:17.729> store<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:19.290> one<00:01:19.530> has<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
craft and hobby store this one has a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.649 
craft and hobby store this one has a
little<00:01:20.159> gate<00:01:20.369> on<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.759> which<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> what<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> latch

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
little gate on it which is what a latch

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.109 
little gate on it which is what a latch
hook<00:01:21.840> does<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.770> keep<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.610> crochet<00:01:23.970> hook

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
hook does to keep it like a crochet hook

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
hook does to keep it like a crochet hook
but<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.630> actually<00:01:25.049> traps<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.530> yarn<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:26.009> there

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
but it actually traps that yarn in there

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.270 
but it actually traps that yarn in there
so<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.790> bury<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.330> inside<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.890> keep

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
so when you bury it inside it will keep

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240 
so when you bury it inside it will keep
closed<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.509> won't<00:01:30.659> fall<00:01:30.930> off<00:01:30.960> which<00:01:31.950> if

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
closed and it won't fall off which if

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.890 
closed and it won't fall off which if
you<00:01:32.400> have<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> hard<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.240> crochet<00:01:33.659> hooks
