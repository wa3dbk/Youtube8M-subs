00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
lower limits if you will and so we're

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:04.930 
lower limits if you will and so we're
not<00:01:03.800> even<00:01:03.920> seeing<00:01:04.280> much<00:01:04.550> in<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> way<00:01:04.820> of

not even seeing much in the way of

not even seeing much in the way of

lightning with these thunderstorms

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.290 
lightning with these thunderstorms
because<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.400> those<00:01:07.520> thunderstorms<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.240> the

because of those thunderstorms in the
Gulf<00:01:08.480> Coast<00:01:08.540> but<00:01:09.440> we<00:01:09.530> expect<00:01:09.620> another<00:01:10.340> round

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700

after this round we're probably going to

about 6-7 p.m. today and that shows that

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.690 
about 6-7 p.m. today and that shows that
showers<00:02:03.500> over<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.770> area<00:02:04.100> if<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.430> get<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
showers over the area if we get out to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.840 
showers over the area if we get out to
midnight<00:02:05.180> we<00:02:05.450> see<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.930> final<00:02:06.410> round<00:02:07.040> coming

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
midnight we see the final round coming

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.270 
midnight we see the final round coming
with<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.300> front<00:02:08.569> as<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.349> coming<00:02:09.530> across<00:02:09.800> the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
with the front as it's coming across the

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.550 
with the front as it's coming across the
Lower<00:02:10.759> Mississippi<00:02:11.060> River<00:02:11.720> Valley<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.200> in

Lower Mississippi River Valley and in
the<00:02:12.680> upper<00:02:12.920> atmosphere<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.700> closed

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
the upper atmosphere that closed

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.560 
the upper atmosphere that closed
is<00:02:14.620> opening<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.160> into<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.640> wave<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.210> that<00:02:16.390> will

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
is opening up into a wave and that will

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.780 
is opening up into a wave and that will
be<00:02:16.720> moving<00:02:17.350> across<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> Mississippi<00:02:18.760> River

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790

Valley that is on by about one a.m. or
so<00:02:26.620> now<00:02:27.370> looking<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.910> some<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.300> parameters

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
so now looking at some of the parameters

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.440 
so now looking at some of the parameters
the<00:02:29.230> Cape<00:02:29.440> values<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:30.040> up<00:02:30.070> for<00:02:30.970> late<00:02:31.270> this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
the Cape values go up for late this

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.960 
the Cape values go up for late this
afternoon<00:02:31.710> so<00:02:32.710> we<00:02:32.920> expect<00:02:33.250> another<00:02:33.520> round<00:02:33.820> of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
afternoon so we expect another round of

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.550 
afternoon so we expect another round of
showers<00:02:34.030> and<00:02:34.510> thunderstorms<00:02:34.570> but<00:02:35.320> they<00:02:35.500> do

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
showers and thunderstorms but they do

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.730 
showers and thunderstorms but they do
fall<00:02:36.010> off<00:02:36.220> pretty<00:02:36.550> dramatically<00:02:37.230> by<00:02:38.230> midnight

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
fall off pretty dramatically by midnight

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.640 
fall off pretty dramatically by midnight
but<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.430> there's<00:02:39.790> still<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.360> front<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:41.440> deal

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
but the there's still the front to deal

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.820 
but the there's still the front to deal
with<00:02:41.890> as<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.160> can<00:02:42.370> see<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> surface<00:02:42.910> low<00:02:43.240> over

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
with as you can see the surface low over

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.790 
with as you can see the surface low over
Southeast<00:02:44.830> Missouri<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:46.410> Felicity<00:02:47.410> values

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
Southeast Missouri and Felicity values

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.400 
Southeast Missouri and Felicity values
are<00:02:48.160> highest<00:02:48.970> well<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.780> our<00:02:49.810> north<00:02:49.930> where<00:02:50.380> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
are highest well to our north where the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.700 
are highest well to our north where the
dynamics<00:02:50.980> are<00:02:51.160> more<00:02:51.880> prevalent<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.560> do

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
dynamics are more prevalent but we do

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.160 
dynamics are more prevalent but we do
have<00:02:53.920> some<00:02:54.370> low<00:02:54.640> Hill<00:02:54.850> icity<00:02:55.180> values<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:55.870> some

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
have some low Hill icity values and some

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.140 
have some low Hill icity values and some
but<00:02:56.530> we'll<00:02:56.740> have<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:56.920> watch<00:02:57.280> what<00:02:57.310> happens

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
but we'll have to watch what happens

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.250 
but we'll have to watch what happens
with<00:02:58.390> these<00:02:58.690> with<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.680> storms<00:03:00.010> continuing<00:03:00.820> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
with these with the storms continuing to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.170 
with these with the storms continuing to
develop<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.850> move<00:03:03.850> through<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.150> area

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
develop and move through the area

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.050 
develop and move through the area
helping<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> stabilize<00:03:05.080> the<00:03:05.380> atmosphere<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
helping to stabilize the atmosphere that

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.210 
helping to stabilize the atmosphere that
short<00:03:07.390> wave<00:03:07.570> moves<00:03:07.900> by<00:03:08.140> Monday<00:03:08.710> so<00:03:08.770> that

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
short wave moves by Monday so that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.650 
short wave moves by Monday so that
should<00:03:09.490> be<00:03:09.520> bringing<00:03:10.180> in<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.540> the

should be bringing in to the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.390 
should be bringing in to the
precipitation<00:03:11.170> across<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.830> area<00:03:11.980> Monday

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
precipitation across the area Monday

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.600 
precipitation across the area Monday
morning<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.740> we<00:03:14.740> should<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.130> then<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.370> couple

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
morning and we should have then a couple

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.050 
morning and we should have then a couple
of<00:03:15.790> good<00:03:16.000> days<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.680> we<00:03:17.680> see<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.920> trough<00:03:18.250> carving

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
of good days as we see a trough carving

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.430 
of good days as we see a trough carving
out<00:03:19.210> we've<00:03:19.510> been<00:03:19.660> seeing<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:19.990> trough<00:03:20.230> over

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
out we've been seeing this trough over

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.130 
out we've been seeing this trough over
the<00:03:20.590> last<00:03:20.800> several<00:03:21.130> runs<00:03:21.840> carving<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:22.930> trough

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
the last several runs carving a trough

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.690 
the last several runs carving a trough
out<00:03:23.350> over<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.800> eastern<00:03:24.370> half<00:03:24.520> of<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.610> country

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
out over the eastern half of the country

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.730 
out over the eastern half of the country
not<00:03:25.060> especially<00:03:25.390> deep<00:03:25.900> but<00:03:26.170> at<00:03:26.260> least<00:03:26.410> a

not especially deep but at least a

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.130 
not especially deep but at least a
cooler<00:03:27.730> trough<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.540> should<00:03:28.810> bring<00:03:29.020> a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
cooler trough and that should bring a

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.050 
cooler trough and that should bring a
surface<00:03:29.500> high<00:03:29.620> pressure<00:03:29.650> into<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.190> area<00:03:30.490> so

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
surface high pressure into the area so

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.360 
surface high pressure into the area so
tuesday<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.900> then<00:03:32.080> again<00:03:32.320> on<00:03:32.350> wednesday<00:03:33.160> we

tuesday and then again on wednesday we

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.600 
tuesday and then again on wednesday we
expect<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> see<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:35.460> surface<00:03:36.460> high<00:03:36.580> pressure

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
expect to see the surface high pressure

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.870 
expect to see the surface high pressure
in<00:03:37.060> place<00:03:37.090> with<00:03:37.630> good<00:03:38.350> weather<00:03:38.560> for<00:03:38.880> central

Alabama and for much of the southeastern
United<00:03:41.980> States<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:43.120> see<00:03:43.390> another<00:03:44.190> strong

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
United States we see another strong

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.040 
United States we see another strong
impulse<00:03:47.830> moving<00:03:48.220> through<00:03:48.520> the<00:03:48.550> flow<00:03:48.910> in<00:03:49.720> that

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
impulse moving through the flow in that

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.740 
impulse moving through the flow in that
big<00:03:50.350> trough<00:03:50.680> over<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.850> eastern<00:03:52.300> Great<00:03:52.540> Lakes

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
big trough over the eastern Great Lakes

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.170 
big trough over the eastern Great Lakes
and<00:03:52.990> that<00:03:53.890> will<00:03:54.040> be<00:03:54.160> dragging<00:03:54.610> another<00:03:54.910> cold

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
and that will be dragging another cold

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.720 
and that will be dragging another cold
front<00:03:55.270> into<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.720> area<00:03:56.050> on<00:03:56.230> Thursday<00:03:56.920> so<00:03:57.490> once

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
front into the area on Thursday so once

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.280 
front into the area on Thursday so once
again<00:03:57.850> we<00:03:58.090> are<00:03:58.120> introducing<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:58.870> chance<00:03:59.110> for

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
again we are introducing a chance for

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.570 
again we are introducing a chance for
showers<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.800> don't<00:03:59.950> think<00:04:00.130> it's<00:04:00.250> going<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.460> be

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
showers I don't think it's going to be

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.950 
showers I don't think it's going to be
an<00:04:00.700> all-day<00:04:00.850> rain<00:04:01.240> kind<00:04:01.540> of<00:04:01.660> thing<00:04:01.810> but

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
an all-day rain kind of thing but

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.470 
an all-day rain kind of thing but
certainly<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.380> chance<00:04:02.890> for<00:04:03.130> showers<00:04:03.520> primarily

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
certainly a chance for showers primarily

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.170 
certainly a chance for showers primarily
during<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.080> probably<00:04:05.920> late<00:04:06.670> morning<00:04:07.090> into

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
during the probably late morning into

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.830 
during the probably late morning into
the<00:04:07.360> afternoon<00:04:07.450> hours<00:04:08.070> Friday<00:04:09.210> we<00:04:10.210> come<00:04:10.540> under

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
the afternoon hours Friday we come under

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.890 
the afternoon hours Friday we come under
slight<00:04:11.110> ridging<00:04:11.530> but<00:04:11.740> we're<00:04:11.920> watching<00:04:12.490> this

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
slight ridging but we're watching this

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.330 
slight ridging but we're watching this
trough<00:04:13.900> moving<00:04:14.260> in<00:04:14.530> out<00:04:14.740> of<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.100> southern

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
trough moving in out of the southern

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.630 
trough moving in out of the southern
Rockies<00:04:15.760> and<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:17.440> means<00:04:17.920> that<00:04:18.160> Friday<00:04:18.400> will

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
Rockies and that means that Friday will

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.610 
Rockies and that means that Friday will
probably<00:04:19.210> be<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:19.420> day<00:04:19.630> with<00:04:19.810> only<00:04:19.930> just<00:04:20.230> a<00:04:20.320> small

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
probably be a day with only just a small

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.310 
probably be a day with only just a small
risk<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.160> showers<00:04:21.580> but<00:04:22.240> we<00:04:22.419> will<00:04:22.660> see<00:04:22.930> then

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
risk of showers but we will see then

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.600 
risk of showers but we will see then
that<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:25.330> trough<00:04:26.140> moved<00:04:26.500> by<00:04:26.710> on<00:04:27.010> Saturday<00:04:27.550> so

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
that that trough moved by on Saturday so

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:28.320 
that that trough moved by on Saturday so
once<00:04:28.000> again

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
once again

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.409
