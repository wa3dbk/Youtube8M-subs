00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.469
Hello and welcome to the vegan corner.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:07.715
When it comes to Italian food,
we've got you covered as we are Italians.

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:12.296
In fact, today's recipe is one of the most
famous preparations in the whole world:

00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:13.456
tomato sauce.

00:00:13.616 --> 00:00:16.466
We're sure you already know
how to prepare tomato sauce.

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:20.521
However, what you probably don't know
is how to prepare a tomato sauce without oil,

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:24.318
which still tastes fantastic enough
to suit an Italian palate.

00:00:24.556 --> 00:00:28.197
The ingredients needed to spread the
delicate aroma of Italy all over your house

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:30.407
are in the description down below.

00:00:31.413 --> 00:00:34.130
To begin with,
slice the garlic as you desire.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.640
You have a few options here:
you can finely mince the garlic,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.971
slice it, or leave it in bigger chunks,

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:42.908
so that they can be removed
when the sauce is finished.

00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:45.056
Many Italians leave the clove untouched

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.316
to easily remove it at the end
of the cooking process.

00:00:48.657 --> 00:00:52.440
Next, place a saucepan over
a medium heat and pour in the oil.

00:00:52.643 --> 00:00:57.621
You're probably thinking that adding oil to an
oil-free dish is slightly counter-productive.

00:00:57.631 --> 00:01:02.781
And you're right, but we promise that every drop
will be removed during the following steps.

00:01:03.327 --> 00:01:07.779
Tip in the garlic and gently fry
until it acquires a light brown colour.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:11.131
This will add a toasted
garlic note to the final sauce,

00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:15.047
which is what turns a regular
tomato sauce into a special one.

00:01:16.007 --> 00:01:18.285
As soon as the garlic
is of the right colour,

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:20.730
turn off the heat to stop
the cooking process

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.690
and to eliminate any risk
of burning the garlic.

00:01:23.732 --> 00:01:27.145
Tilt the pan and let all the oil
collects on one side.

00:01:29.635 --> 00:01:34.277
Once all the oil is on one side of the pan,
absorb it with a piece of kitchen paper

00:01:34.287 --> 00:01:38.000
and you would have fried garlic without oil!
How easy was that?

00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:44.962
Now turn the heat back on medium,
tip in the tomatoes,

00:01:44.997 --> 00:01:47.557
break them into
smaller pieces and stir.

00:01:48.482 --> 00:01:52.982
We are using tinned tomatoes here,
but feel free to use fresh tomatoes instead.

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:57.658
It is worth nothing, however,
that very few Italians use fresh tomatoes.

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:01.196
This is as if we waited
for fresh tomatoes to become available,

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:04.694
we would only be able to make
our favourite dishes during the summer.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:07.966
That would make the rest
of the year a very sad time for us,

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:10.826
so we really are grateful
for tinned tomatoes.

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:16.227
It's also near-impossible to get fresh tomatoes
that are of the same ripeness as tinned ones.

00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:20.970
Remember that whole tomatoes are
always a better choice than chopped ones,

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.030
so always buy whole ones
when you have the option.

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:29.849
Bring the sauce to a simmer, lower the heat
to the minimum and cover the pan with a lid.

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.771
Make sure to leave the pot partially
uncovered to let the steam escape:

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:38.281
this will concentrate the sauce,
and the flavour, overtime.

00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:42.322
Cook the sauce for 5 minutes
over the lowest heat.

00:02:44.015 --> 00:02:48.565
Once the time has elapsed, turn off the heat,
remove the lid and stir the sauce.

00:02:51.635 --> 00:02:55.742
Turn the heat on again, bring the sauce
back to a simmer, place the lid back on

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:59.052
and cook for additional 5 minutes
over the lowest heat.

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:03.350
You might be wondering why we are turning
the burner on and off before stirring.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.644
Obviously we are just
testing that it works!

00:03:05.654 --> 00:03:09.495
Well, not really, it's actually
down to the fact that the sauce is so thick

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:13.665
that whilst boiling it literally projects
tomato sauce all over the kitchen

00:03:13.675 --> 00:03:16.225
and we'd rather avoid that.
Wouldn't we?

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:20.026
Once the time is up,
repeat the whole process one last time

00:03:20.036 --> 00:03:22.786
and turn off the heat
to complete the sauce.

00:03:23.283 --> 00:03:27.628
15 minutes of total cooking time is generally
enough for small quantities of sauce,

00:03:27.638 --> 00:03:31.685
but if you are planning on making more,
or if your tinned tomatoes are more watery,

00:03:31.695 --> 00:03:34.394
the sauce might require
a little longer cooking

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:37.354
and possibly a little
higher heat under the pan.

00:03:38.223 --> 00:03:42.076
Just stick to our rules and
your sauce will end up spot on.

00:03:49.132 --> 00:03:53.740
There is one last very important step to
turn the sauce into something really Italian,

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.205
which is to add a few torn basil leaves.

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:59.343
3 of them should do
for this quantity of sauce.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.040
Once the last ingredient has been added,
stir one last time to complete the sauce.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:07.083
The basil will cook
with the residual heat of the tomatoes

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.093
so there is no need for
the burner to be on here.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:14.679
And there you have it,

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.202
this is what we consider to be a
perfectly prepared traditional Italian sauce,

00:04:19.282 --> 00:04:21.897
ready to be used
in any dish that requires it.

00:04:21.907 --> 00:04:24.853
We were able to serve
this sauce to several Italians

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:30.063
and none of them was able to understand how a
sauce could be that good without using any oil.

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:33.442
