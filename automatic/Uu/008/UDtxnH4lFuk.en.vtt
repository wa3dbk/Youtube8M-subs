00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
so what we want to do to verify all this

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.970 
so what we want to do to verify all this
is<00:05:33.270> click<00:05:33.780> settings<00:05:34.170> then<00:05:34.410> the<00:05:34.680> settings

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
we can see that we've got our firmware

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.150 
we can see that we've got our firmware
version<00:05:40.650> 2.1<00:05:41.580> update<00:05:42.000> 1<00:05:42.510> the<00:05:43.170> baseband<00:05:43.560> is<00:05:43.950> the

version 2.1 update 1 the baseband is the

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.610 
version 2.1 update 1 the baseband is the
