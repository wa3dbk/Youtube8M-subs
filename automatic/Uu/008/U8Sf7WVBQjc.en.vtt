that<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.230> having<00:03:27.590> the<00:03:27.709> controls<00:03:28.100> way<00:03:28.370> over

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
that to the having the controls way over

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.259 
that to the having the controls way over
there<00:03:28.970> basically<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.890> wires<00:03:31.100> go<00:03:32.060> down

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
there basically the wires go down

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.050 
there basically the wires go down
underground<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:34.190> come<00:03:34.670> up<00:03:34.700> the<00:03:35.090> pillars

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.949 

and<00:03:39.860> basically<00:03:40.860> go<00:03:41.280> up<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.790> Pistons<00:03:42.180> which

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
and basically go up to the Pistons which

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.500 
and basically go up to the Pistons which
if<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.260> remember<00:03:43.650> are<00:03:43.830> right<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.250> here<00:03:44.640> then

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
if you remember are right in here then

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.119 
if you remember are right in here then
what<00:03:45.690> I've<00:03:45.810> done<00:03:46.080> is<00:03:48.019> add<00:03:49.019> another<00:03:49.260> little

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
what I've done is add another little

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.420 
what I've done is add another little
contraption<00:03:50.819> which<00:03:51.209> is<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:52.019> TNT<00:03:52.560> dispenser

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
contraption which is the TNT dispenser

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.569 
contraption which is the TNT dispenser
and<00:03:53.670> if<00:03:54.569> you<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:55.129> you<00:03:56.129> know<00:03:56.250> there's<00:03:56.400> no

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
and if you know you know there's no

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.569 
and if you know you know there's no
there's<00:03:57.180> no<00:03:57.329> great<00:03:57.659> way<00:03:57.840> to<00:03:57.870> dispense<00:03:58.709> TNT<00:03:59.310> so

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
there's no great way to dispense TNT so

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.390 
there's no great way to dispense TNT so
what<00:03:59.730> I've<00:03:59.879> done<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.480> basically<00:04:01.099> used<00:04:02.099> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
what I've done is basically used a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.250 
what I've done is basically used a
gravity<00:04:03.060> system<00:04:03.480> with<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.079> sand<00:04:05.780> to<00:04:06.780> where

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.900 

let's<00:04:10.260> see<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.470> think<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.980> will<00:04:11.129> fit<00:04:11.370> seven

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
let's see I think it will fit seven

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.530 
let's see I think it will fit seven
total<00:04:12.329> TNT<00:04:13.319> let<00:04:14.250> me<00:04:14.370> get<00:04:14.910> up<00:04:15.000> here<00:04:15.180> so<00:04:15.209> I<00:04:15.359> don't

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
total TNT let me get up here so I don't

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.810 
total TNT let me get up here so I don't
fall<00:04:15.690> off<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:17.729> just<00:04:17.910> pile<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.359> sand<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:19.019> and

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
fall off and I just pile the sand in and

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.379 
fall off and I just pile the sand in and
then<00:04:20.820> I<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:21.180> put<00:04:21.830> fill<00:04:22.830> this<00:04:23.310> up<00:04:23.520> with<00:04:23.639> TNT

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
then I can put fill this up with TNT

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.590 
then I can put fill this up with TNT
here<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.490> basically<00:04:26.490> what<00:04:26.699> happens<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.300> the

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
here and basically what happens is the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.590 
here and basically what happens is the
button<00:04:28.320> which<00:04:28.919> is<00:04:28.949> over<00:04:29.400> next<00:04:29.760> to<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.270> switch

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
button which is over next to the switch

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.629 
button which is over next to the switch
is<00:04:32.060> wired<00:04:33.060> up<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.449> here<00:04:33.810> as<00:04:33.960> well<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:34.560> let<00:04:35.520> me

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
is wired up to here as well and let me

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.520 
is wired up to here as well and let me
see<00:04:35.820> if<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.030> can<00:04:36.180> do<00:04:36.300> this<00:04:36.449> without<00:04:36.600> falling<00:04:37.320> and

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
see if I can do this without falling and

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.940 
see if I can do this without falling and
dying<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:38.070> would<00:04:38.370> be<00:04:38.490> funny<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:42.479> button

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
dying that would be funny that button

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.920 
dying that would be funny that button
wires<00:04:43.950> up<00:04:44.280> to<00:04:44.430> here<00:04:44.729> at<00:04:44.940> which<00:04:45.120> each<00:04:45.450> time<00:04:45.900> I

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
wires up to here at which each time I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.580 
wires up to here at which each time I
use<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.349> basically<00:04:47.419> pushes<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.810> sand<00:04:49.200> further

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
use it basically pushes the sand further

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.490 
use it basically pushes the sand further
and<00:04:49.830> further<00:04:49.950> out<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.550> each<00:04:51.030> time<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.990> TNT

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
and further out and each time the TNT

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.040 
and further out and each time the TNT
gets<00:04:52.800> pushed<00:04:53.070> farther<00:04:53.340> out<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:54.330> connects<00:04:54.810> with

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
gets pushed farther out it connects with

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.529 
gets pushed farther out it connects with
this<00:04:55.289> lever<00:04:55.650> which<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.979> turned<00:04:56.370> on<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.849> when

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
this lever which is turned on so when

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.870 
this lever which is turned on so when
the<00:04:57.630> TNT<00:04:57.990> gets<00:04:58.200> pushed<00:04:58.410> out<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.650> this<00:04:59.010> block<00:04:59.310> it

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
the TNT gets pushed out to this block it

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.120 
the TNT gets pushed out to this block it
automatically<00:05:00.450> activates<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:01.289> drops<00:05:01.889> down

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
automatically activates and drops down

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.589 
automatically activates and drops down
into<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.880> death<00:05:03.030> Bowl<00:05:03.560> fun<00:05:04.560> fun<00:05:04.830> fun<00:05:05.599> the

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
into the death Bowl fun fun fun the

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.710 
into the death Bowl fun fun fun the
wiring<00:05:07.940> seriously<00:05:08.940> got<00:05:09.180> really<00:05:09.810> messy

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
wiring seriously got really messy

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.450 
wiring seriously got really messy

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
the Pistons up there wired so that the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.790 
the Pistons up there wired so that the
this<00:05:36.860> chute<00:05:37.190> will<00:05:37.520> close<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:38.470> then<00:05:39.470> the<00:05:39.590> mobs

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
this chute will close and then the mobs

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.100 
this chute will close and then the mobs
will<00:05:40.100> be<00:05:40.220> diverted<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.730> this<00:05:41.090> plank<00:05:41.420> and<00:05:41.810> drop

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
will be diverted to this plank and drop

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.620 
will be diverted to this plank and drop
off<00:05:42.320> into<00:05:42.530> the<00:05:43.430> murder<00:05:43.670> Bowl<00:05:43.910> or<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.420> death

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
off into the murder Bowl or the death

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.150 
off into the murder Bowl or the death
Bowl<00:05:44.870> whatever<00:05:45.680> you<00:05:45.800> want<00:05:45.950> to<00:05:46.010> call<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.310> and

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
Bowl whatever you want to call it and

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.050 
Bowl whatever you want to call it and
second<00:05:49.160> to<00:05:49.460> that<00:05:49.760> I<00:05:50.150> have<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.660> button<00:05:50.990> which

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
second to that I have the button which

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.440 
second to that I have the button which
powers<00:05:53.060> the<00:05:53.800> TNT<00:05:55.030> dispenser<00:05:56.030> I<00:05:56.060> guess<00:05:56.330> you

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
powers the TNT dispenser I guess you

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.210 
powers the TNT dispenser I guess you
could<00:05:56.600> call<00:05:56.630> it<00:05:56.780> the<00:05:57.110> pusher<00:05:57.560> that<00:05:57.590> pushes<00:05:58.100> the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
could call it the pusher that pushes the

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.570 
could call it the pusher that pushes the
TNT<00:05:58.580> off<00:05:58.730> the<00:05:58.880> edge<00:05:58.970> so<00:05:59.440> there<00:06:00.440> is<00:06:00.740> quite<00:06:01.340> a
