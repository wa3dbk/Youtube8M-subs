bag I do not recommend it because it's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670

it's<00:01:34.530> almost<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.250> made<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.729> them

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
it's almost as if it was made for them

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.770 
it's almost as if it was made for them
okay<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.009> open<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.689> you'll<00:01:39.689> see

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
okay so when you open it up you'll see

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
okay so when you open it up you'll see
that<00:01:40.579> there's<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.640> little<00:01:41.790> bit<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.030> velcro<00:01:42.180> here

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
that there's a little bit of velcro here

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.929 
that there's a little bit of velcro here
to<00:01:42.689> keep<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.049> lid<00:01:43.259> closed<00:01:44.009> even<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
to keep the lid closed even when it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.980 
to keep the lid closed even when it's
not<00:01:45.090> clipped<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.799> top<00:01:47.009> flap<00:01:47.509> has<00:01:48.509> a

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
not clipped on and the top flap has a

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.140 
not clipped on and the top flap has a
nice<00:01:49.829> air

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
nice air

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.780 
nice air
so<00:01:53.710> moving<00:01:54.710> on<00:01:54.980> I<00:01:55.310> will<00:01:56.270> mention<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.050> straps

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
so moving on I will mention the straps

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.840 
so moving on I will mention the straps
the<00:01:58.790> straps<00:01:59.120> are<00:01:59.390> extremely<00:02:00.320> thick<00:02:00.850> durable

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
the straps are extremely thick durable

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.060 
the straps are extremely thick durable
they<00:02:02.330> seem<00:02:02.660> they're<00:02:03.260> some<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.830> best

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
they seem they're some of the best

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.860 
they seem they're some of the best
quality<00:02:04.220> straps<00:02:04.730> I've<00:02:04.910> ever<00:02:05.120> encountered<00:02:05.330> on

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
quality straps I've ever encountered on

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.040 
quality straps I've ever encountered on
a<00:02:05.900> bag<00:02:06.280> maybe<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.430> haven't<00:02:07.850> had<00:02:08.000> anything<00:02:08.270> this

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
a bag maybe I haven't had anything this

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.690 
a bag maybe I haven't had anything this
expensive<00:02:09.560> before<00:02:09.950> but<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.369> am<00:02:10.400> definitely

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
expensive before but I am definitely

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.250 
expensive before but I am definitely
impressed

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
impressed

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.070 
impressed
they<00:02:13.130> are<00:02:13.280> rubberized<00:02:13.610> on<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.420> inside<00:02:14.780> so

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
they are rubberized on the inside so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.600 
they are rubberized on the inside so
that<00:02:15.260> when<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.650> rests<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.100> your<00:02:16.190> shoulder<00:02:16.580> it

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
that when it rests on your shoulder it

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.520 
that when it rests on your shoulder it
does<00:02:16.760> not<00:02:16.940> slip<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.660> think<00:02:18.200> that's<00:02:18.320> a<00:02:18.410> great

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
does not slip I think that's a great

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.010 
does not slip I think that's a great
feature<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:19.550> also<00:02:19.820> worth<00:02:20.090> noting<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.570> the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
feature it's also worth noting that the

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.990 
feature it's also worth noting that the
d-rings<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.680> all<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.950> hardware<00:02:22.190> are<00:02:22.430> plastic

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
d-rings and all the hardware are plastic

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.350 
d-rings and all the hardware are plastic
which<00:02:23.660> initially<00:02:24.620> might<00:02:24.800> seem<00:02:25.070> as<00:02:25.250> if<00:02:25.360> that's

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
which initially might seem as if that's

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
which initially might seem as if that's
a<00:02:26.710> cost-cutting<00:02:27.710> measure<00:02:28.010> but<00:02:28.370> if<00:02:28.460> you<00:02:28.550> think

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
a cost-cutting measure but if you think

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.430 
a cost-cutting measure but if you think
about<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.150> fact<00:02:29.360> that<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.660> camera<00:02:29.870> bag<00:02:30.230> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
about the fact that the camera bag is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.430 
about the fact that the camera bag is
made<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:31.190> house<00:02:31.570> sensitive<00:02:32.570> camera<00:02:32.930> equipment

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
made to house sensitive camera equipment

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.710 
made to house sensitive camera equipment
plastic<00:02:33.980> is<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.220> better<00:02:34.490> choice<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:35.570> it's

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
plastic is a better choice because it's

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.330 
plastic is a better choice because it's
not<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.110> scratch<00:02:36.260> your<00:02:36.530> stuff<00:02:36.770> so<00:02:37.280> I

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
not going to scratch your stuff so I

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.010 
not going to scratch your stuff so I
think<00:02:37.430> that's<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.790> great<00:02:37.910> addition<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.900> have

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
think that's a great addition you have

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.990 
think that's a great addition you have
the<00:02:39.140> two<00:02:39.290> front<00:02:39.530> pockets<00:02:39.740> and<00:02:40.160> two<00:02:40.490> small<00:02:40.790> side

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
the two front pockets and two small side

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.330 
the two front pockets and two small side
pockets<00:02:41.480> are<00:02:42.080> two<00:02:42.290> small<00:02:42.560> pockets<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.220> the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
pockets are two small pockets on the

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.190 
pockets are two small pockets on the
side<00:02:43.520> which<00:02:43.730> would<00:02:43.850> be<00:02:43.940> great<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.690> lens

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
side which would be great for a lens

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.010 
side which would be great for a lens

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.200 

d-rings<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.550> back<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:34.050> might<00:03:34.320> be<00:03:35.210> you

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
d-rings on the back so it might be you

could clip it on here and tether the bag
to<00:03:38.430> something<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:38.880> the<00:03:39.060> back<00:03:39.210> of<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.450> chair<00:03:39.480> or

one other really cool feature which

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.100 
one other really cool feature which
isn't<00:03:46.650> exactly<00:03:47.600> high-tech<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:48.930> it's

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
isn't exactly high-tech but it's

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.500 
isn't exactly high-tech but it's
definitely<00:03:49.380> smart<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.160> this<00:03:50.520> across<00:03:51.360> the

definitely smart is this across the

rings<00:04:01.710> are<00:04:02.070> attached<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.670> so<00:04:03.420> when<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.660> hold
