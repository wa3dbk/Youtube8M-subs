00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.420
 when we arrived he did not say anything to us and 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.610

 what acrobatics movement is the most 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.069
 complicated for you to do 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.430

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.800

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.060
 complicated of what you want to get to a 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:31.539
