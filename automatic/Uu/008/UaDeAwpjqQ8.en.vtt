until one is absolutely done because it

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.030 
until one is absolutely done because it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
start once more the center of the face

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690

with<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> top<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.710> nose<00:01:58.890> drawing

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
with just the top of the nose drawing

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.649 
with just the top of the nose drawing
very<00:02:00.000> clearly<00:02:00.450> defined<00:02:02.090> silhouettes<00:02:03.090> lines

very clearly defined silhouettes lines

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 
very clearly defined silhouettes lines
and<00:02:04.049> then<00:02:04.619> some<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.070> gradual<00:02:05.549> gradient

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and then some very gradual gradient

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.280 
and then some very gradual gradient
lines<00:02:06.119> around<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> rest<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.869> face<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
and some very very strong eyebrow lines

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.869 
and some very very strong eyebrow lines
now<00:02:14.980> there<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:16.219> possibility<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.700> leaving

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
now there is the possibility of leaving

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.729 
now there is the possibility of leaving
the<00:02:17.120> eyebrows<00:02:17.480> transparent<00:02:18.260> you<00:02:18.469> know<00:02:18.590> just

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
the eyebrows transparent you know just

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:19.929 
the eyebrows transparent you know just
with<00:02:18.920> an<00:02:18.980> outline<00:02:19.310> they<00:02:19.489> cuddle<00:02:19.730> them<00:02:19.819> in

with an outline they cuddle them in
green<00:02:20.180> later<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.290> tend<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.769> make<00:02:21.889> solid

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
green later I just tend to make solid

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.220 
green later I just tend to make solid
black<00:02:22.849> eyebrows<00:02:23.299> because<00:02:23.599> they<00:02:23.959> make<00:02:24.109> him

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
black eyebrows because they make him

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.739 
black eyebrows because they make him
look<00:02:24.319> more<00:02:24.530> theatrical<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:25.249> then<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.180> crow's

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
look more theatrical and then the crow's

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.319 
look more theatrical and then the crow's
feet<00:02:26.959> themselves<00:02:27.280> can<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.430> fairly

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
small area they've been given because of

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:41.649 
small area they've been given because of
the<00:02:41.030> rest<00:02:41.209> of<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:41.359> facial<00:02:41.510> features

the rest of the facial features

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.470 
the rest of the facial features
squishing<00:02:42.560> them<00:02:42.709> in<00:02:42.859> like<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.340> they've<00:02:44.299> got

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
squishing them in like that they've got

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.879 
squishing them in like that they've got
quite<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.780> long<00:02:45.169> angular<00:02:46.040> style<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.519> them<00:02:47.889> in

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
quite a long angular style to them in

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.199 
quite a long angular style to them in
fact<00:02:49.069> in<00:02:49.219> this<00:02:49.310> drawing<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.730> occurred<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.030> me

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
fact in this drawing it occurred to me

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.199 
fact in this drawing it occurred to me
that<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.689> eyes<00:02:50.840> were<00:02:51.169> perhaps<00:02:51.319> too<00:02:51.680> long<00:02:51.889> and

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
that the eyes were perhaps too long and

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.569 
that the eyes were perhaps too long and
reminded<00:02:53.209> myself<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.780> add<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.590> small<00:02:54.889> area<00:02:55.370> of

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
reminded myself to add the small area of

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:56.949 
reminded myself to add the small area of
pink<00:02:55.849> flesh<00:02:56.090> found<00:02:56.359> in<00:02:56.449> the<00:02:56.540> corner<00:02:56.840> of<00:02:56.870> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
pink flesh found in the corner of the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.569 
pink flesh found in the corner of the
eye<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.349> don't<00:02:57.560> know<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.769> technical<00:02:57.919> names<00:02:58.370> for

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
eye I don't know the technical names for

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.869 
eye I don't know the technical names for
that<00:02:58.699> either<00:02:59.500> then<00:03:00.500> adding<00:03:00.859> in<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:01.189> the<00:03:01.699> lips

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
that either then adding in the the lips

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.550 
that either then adding in the the lips
of<00:03:01.969> the<00:03:02.030> stage<00:03:02.299> is<00:03:02.449> very<00:03:02.629> exciting<00:03:03.109> because<00:03:03.139> it

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
of the stage is very exciting because it

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.559 
of the stage is very exciting because it
really<00:03:03.859> brings<00:03:04.069> the<00:03:04.280> face<00:03:04.430> alive<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:05.030> having

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
really brings the face alive and having

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.309 
really brings the face alive and having
done<00:03:05.689> that<00:03:05.930> you<00:03:06.769> can<00:03:06.799> really<00:03:07.959> know<00:03:08.959> exactly

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
done that you can really know exactly

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.379 
done that you can really know exactly
what<00:03:09.409> you're<00:03:09.500> doing<00:03:09.530> with<00:03:09.859> those<00:03:10.389> there's

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
what you're doing with those there's

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.020 
what you're doing with those there's
chin<00:03:11.959> word<00:03:12.139> lines<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:13.250> here<00:03:13.459> I've<00:03:13.549> also<00:03:13.730> added

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
chin word lines and here I've also added

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.580 
chin word lines and here I've also added
in<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.239> cleft<00:03:14.569> of<00:03:14.659> the<00:03:14.719> chin<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.169> made<00:03:15.379> sure

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
in the cleft of the chin and made sure

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.140 
in the cleft of the chin and made sure
that<00:03:15.709> because<00:03:16.069> his<00:03:16.370> mouth<00:03:16.609> is<00:03:16.790> playing<00:03:17.030> out

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
that because his mouth is playing out

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.819 
that because his mouth is playing out
words<00:03:17.419> it'll<00:03:17.870> tighten<00:03:18.139> the<00:03:18.319> skin<00:03:18.530> quite

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
words it'll tighten the skin quite

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:19.899 
words it'll tighten the skin quite
severely<00:03:19.129> on<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.340> bottom<00:03:19.579> of<00:03:19.639> the<00:03:19.699> chin

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
severely on the bottom of the chin

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.879 
severely on the bottom of the chin
meaning<00:03:20.599> that<00:03:20.930> will<00:03:21.109> get<00:03:21.229> quite<00:03:21.439> a<00:03:21.470> good<00:03:21.650> idea

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:21.889 
meaning that will get quite a good idea

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.170 
meaning that will get quite a good idea
of<00:03:21.979> the<00:03:22.129> shape<00:03:22.310> of<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.639> skull<00:03:22.909> bone

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
of the shape of the skull bone

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.179 
of the shape of the skull bone
underneath<00:03:23.659> that<00:03:23.959> so<00:03:24.590> you'll<00:03:24.709> have<00:03:24.769> a<00:03:24.829> flat

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
underneath that so you'll have a flat

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.189 
underneath that so you'll have a flat
bottom<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.729> chin<00:03:25.939> and<00:03:26.120> then<00:03:26.689> going<00:03:26.870> along

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
bottom of the chin and then going along

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.289 
bottom of the chin and then going along
again<00:03:27.650> very<00:03:27.919> severely<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.669> sign<00:03:28.879> of<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> chin

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
again very severely the sign of the chin

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.839 
again very severely the sign of the chin
upwards<00:03:29.750> into<00:03:30.439> those<00:03:30.709> lines<00:03:33.549> this<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:34.699> where

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
upwards into those lines this is where

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.550 
upwards into those lines this is where
it<00:03:34.909> becomes<00:03:35.030> clear<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.870> jungles<00:03:36.229> facial

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
it becomes clear that the jungles facial

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.949 
it becomes clear that the jungles facial
the<00:03:36.859> Joker's<00:03:37.220> facial<00:03:37.579> muscles<00:03:37.879> really<00:03:38.419> don't

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
the Joker's facial muscles really don't

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.559 
the Joker's facial muscles really don't
follow<00:03:39.319> the<00:03:39.500> normal<00:03:39.829> rules<00:03:40.159> of<00:03:40.459> human<00:03:41.180> physics

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
that is once they're frowning towards

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
that the top of those arching eyebrows

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.759 
that the top of those arching eyebrows
have<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.720> birdie<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.169> push<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.530> flesh

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
have the birdie to push the flesh

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.059 
have the birdie to push the flesh
upwards<00:03:49.549> so<00:03:50.090> we<00:03:50.209> can<00:03:50.329> look<00:03:50.479> both<00:03:51.069> it's

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
upwards so we can look both it's

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.219 
upwards so we can look both it's
slightly<00:03:52.370> angry<00:03:52.879> and<00:03:53.150> slightly<00:03:53.719> amused<00:03:54.139> at

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:54.229 
slightly angry and slightly amused at

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:56.559 
slightly angry and slightly amused at
the<00:03:54.290> same<00:03:54.530> time<00:03:54.799> so<00:03:55.609> we've<00:03:55.819> got<00:03:56.030> ridges<00:03:56.540> of

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
the same time so we've got ridges of

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.240 
the same time so we've got ridges of
flesh<00:03:56.989> being<00:03:57.259> pushed<00:03:57.530> upwards<00:03:57.859> toward<00:03:58.099> the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
flesh being pushed upwards toward the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.789 
flesh being pushed upwards toward the
forehead<00:03:58.810> also<00:03:59.810> here<00:04:00.019> fill<00:04:00.229> in<00:04:00.379> that<00:04:00.590> very

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
forehead also here fill in that very

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.039 
forehead also here fill in that very
sharp<00:04:01.159> angular<00:04:01.609> edge<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.269> the<00:04:02.359> jawbone<00:04:02.780> and

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
sharp angular edge of the jawbone and

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.009 
sharp angular edge of the jawbone and
tapered<00:04:03.949> upwards<00:04:04.629> so<00:04:05.629> that<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.840> flows

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
tapered upwards so that it flows

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.979 
tapered upwards so that it flows
naturally<00:04:06.349> into<00:04:07.189> the<00:04:07.310> ear<00:04:07.519> which<00:04:08.359> is<00:04:08.629> itself

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
naturally into the ear which is itself

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.629 
naturally into the ear which is itself
not<00:04:09.259> too<00:04:09.530> petite<00:04:09.859> and<00:04:10.159> in<00:04:10.250> some<00:04:10.430> cases

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639 
not too petite and in some cases

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.379 
not too petite and in some cases
slightly<00:04:11.150> elfin<00:04:11.539> I<00:04:12.879> think<00:04:13.879> for<00:04:14.030> me<00:04:14.120> this<00:04:14.269> is

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
slightly elfin I think for me this is

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:17.800 
slightly elfin I think for me this is
probably<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.870> most<00:04:15.370> amusing<00:04:16.810> entertaining

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
probably the most amusing entertaining

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.199 
probably the most amusing entertaining
stage<00:04:18.680> of<00:04:18.859> thinking<00:04:19.310> which<00:04:19.699> is<00:04:19.729> the<00:04:20.000> hair

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
stage of thinking which is the hair

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.779 
stage of thinking which is the hair
because<00:04:20.599> it<00:04:20.779> just<00:04:21.019> it's<00:04:21.349> so<00:04:21.650> wild<00:04:21.919> there's<00:04:22.610> so

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
because it just it's so wild there's so

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:23.680 
because it just it's so wild there's so
much<00:04:22.820> one<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.270> do

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
much one can do

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.390 
much one can do
I<00:04:23.750> tend<00:04:24.260> to<00:04:24.320> start<00:04:24.590> with<00:04:24.710> the<00:04:24.770> very<00:04:25.010> front

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
I tend to start with the very front

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.090 
I tend to start with the very front
hairs<00:04:25.730> because<00:04:26.450> they<00:04:26.810> will<00:04:26.960> then<00:04:27.200> be<00:04:27.560> foremost

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
hairs because they will then be foremost

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.640 
hairs because they will then be foremost
in<00:04:28.310> terms<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.450> cameras<00:04:29.990> view<00:04:30.050> so

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
in terms of the cameras view so

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.110 
in terms of the cameras view so
everything<00:04:31.070> behind<00:04:31.370> will<00:04:31.700> have<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.910> tuck

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
everything behind will have to tuck

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.090 
everything behind will have to tuck
below<00:04:32.450> them<00:04:32.630> or<00:04:32.720> behind<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.110> motel<00:04:33.470> but

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
below them or behind the motel but

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.620 
below them or behind the motel but
really<00:04:34.370> just<00:04:34.400> following<00:04:34.940> those<00:04:35.060> lines<00:04:35.330> from

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
really just following those lines from

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.510 
really just following those lines from
the<00:04:35.690> front<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.110> widow's<00:04:36.350> peak<00:04:36.530> back<00:04:37.040> into<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
the front the widow's peak back into the

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.370 
the front the widow's peak back into the
duck<00:04:37.730> curve<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.240> then<00:04:38.600> scooping<00:04:39.020> around<00:04:39.260> the

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
duck curve and then scooping around the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.830 
duck curve and then scooping around the
ear<00:04:39.560> it<00:04:40.340> takes<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.700> while<00:04:40.850> because<00:04:41.090> you<00:04:41.360> in<00:04:41.600> this

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
ear it takes a while because you in this

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.670 
ear it takes a while because you in this
style<00:04:42.020> of<00:04:42.170> really<00:04:42.590> drawing<00:04:43.400> clumps<00:04:43.850> of<00:04:43.970> hair

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
style of really drawing clumps of hair

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.440 
style of really drawing clumps of hair
rather<00:04:45.680> than<00:04:45.980> in<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.550> anime<00:04:46.820> style<00:04:47.030> even<00:04:47.300> the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
rather than in the anime style even the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.570 
rather than in the anime style even the
animated<00:04:47.870> series<00:04:47.900> style<00:04:48.530> merely<00:04:49.490> the

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
animated series style merely the

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.540 
animated series style merely the
silhouette<00:04:49.970> of<00:04:50.000> hair<00:04:50.590> but<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.650> think<00:04:51.920> that<00:04:52.130> this

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
silhouette of hair but I think that this

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.190 
silhouette of hair but I think that this
really<00:04:52.940> does<00:04:53.090> exaggerate<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.630> wildness<00:04:54.200> of

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
really does exaggerate the wildness of

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.170 
really does exaggerate the wildness of
not<00:04:55.070> only<00:04:55.220> his<00:04:55.400> hair<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:55.790> his<00:04:55.880> overall

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
not only his hair but his overall

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.380 
not only his hair but his overall
personality<00:04:56.510> on<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:58.490> inking<00:04:58.790> stage<00:04:59.030> I<00:04:59.060> feel

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
personality on the inking stage I feel

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.030 
personality on the inking stage I feel
it's<00:04:59.540> best<00:04:59.720> to<00:04:59.930> work<00:05:00.110> from<00:05:00.410> the<00:05:00.650> center

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
it's best to work from the center

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
it's best to work from the center
outward<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.900> as<00:05:03.080> not<00:05:03.260> to<00:05:03.500> at<00:05:04.400> the<00:05:04.760> ultimate

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.590 
outward so so as not to at the ultimate
stage<00:05:05.450> I'll<00:05:05.750> end<00:05:06.350> up<00:05:06.530> with<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.770> lack<00:05:06.950> of<00:05:06.980> space

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600

case has been inked which is for me a

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.630 
case has been inked which is for me a
hell<00:05:42.410> of<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.620> job<00:05:42.650> I'm<00:05:43.040> sure<00:05:43.190> it's<00:05:43.370> easier<00:05:43.610> for

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:43.640 
hell of a job I'm sure it's easier for

hell of a job I'm sure it's easier for
some<00:05:43.940> people<00:05:44.080> I<00:05:45.080> find<00:05:45.590> it<00:05:45.680> very<00:05:45.710> difficult<00:05:45.919> to

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
some people I find it very difficult to

we have small folds of material not too

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.600 
we have small folds of material not too
deep<00:06:06.410> because<00:06:06.890> what<00:06:07.160> we're<00:06:07.250> doing<00:06:07.400> here<00:06:07.580> is

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
deep because what we're doing here is

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.540 
deep because what we're doing here is
very<00:06:07.850> thick<00:06:08.620> jacket<00:06:09.620> material<00:06:10.010> so<00:06:10.220> it<00:06:10.310> won't

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
very thick jacket material so it won't

to science so I believe that you

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.580 
wouldn't be able to see that much

generally because there isn't that much

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.040 
generally because there isn't that much
