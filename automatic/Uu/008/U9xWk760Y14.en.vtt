is tolerance justice and profit please
bear<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:13.139> mind<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.469> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.190> series<00:00:15.000> based

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
bear in mind that this is a series based

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.750 
bear in mind that this is a series based
on<00:00:15.690> information<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.890> developers<00:00:17.550> have

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
on information that the developers have

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.820 
on information that the developers have
released<00:00:18.150> previous<00:00:18.779> total<00:00:19.140> war<00:00:19.320> games<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
released previous total war games and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.609 
released previous total war games and
history<00:00:20.460> books<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.660> faction<00:00:22.140> may<00:00:22.289> play

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
history books so the faction may play

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.710 
history books so the faction may play
slightly<00:00:23.160> different<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.730> how<00:00:24.000> I'm<00:00:24.269> describing

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
slightly different to how I'm describing

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.529 
slightly different to how I'm describing
so<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> first<00:00:25.890> category<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> early

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
so the first category is the early

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.060 
so the first category is the early
faction<00:00:28.080> strength<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> believe<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
faction strength and I believe that this

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.099 
faction strength and I believe that this
is<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> moderately<00:00:30.000> strong<00:00:30.269> area<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
is a moderately strong area for the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.870 
is a moderately strong area for the
Parthian<00:00:31.619> because<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.219> only<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.610> one

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
Parthian because they only have one

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.569 
Parthian because they only have one
starting<00:00:33.420> region<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.320> landlocked<00:00:34.890> but<00:00:35.340> are

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
starting region and a landlocked but are

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
starting region and a landlocked but are
relatively<00:00:36.329> far<00:00:36.600> away<00:00:36.899> from<00:00:36.960> any<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
relatively far away from any of the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
relatively far away from any of the
other<00:00:38.040> major<00:00:38.340> factions<00:00:39.030> but<00:00:39.300> even<00:00:39.660> though

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
other major factions but even though

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
other major factions but even though
they<00:00:39.930> only<00:00:40.140> have<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.440> single<00:00:40.739> settlement<00:00:41.489> given

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
they only have a single settlement given

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.459 
they only have a single settlement given
the<00:00:42.000> units<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.420> they've<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> defend<00:00:43.260> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the units that they've got to defend it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.740 
the units that they've got to defend it
it<00:00:43.620> should<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.890> quite<00:00:44.370> easy<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.760> defend<00:00:45.239> from

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it should be quite easy to defend from

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.850 
it should be quite easy to defend from
enemy<00:00:46.260> attacks

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
enemy attacks

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
enemy attacks
now<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> lake's<00:00:47.460> category<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.239> their

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
now the lake's category is their

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
now the lake's category is their
expansion<00:00:49.350> strengths<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> believe<00:00:50.579> that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
expansion strengths and I believe that

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
expansion strengths and I believe that
this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.030> moderate<00:00:51.449> area<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.320> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this is a moderate area for the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.330 
this is a moderate area for the
Parthians<00:00:53.670> because<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.690> order<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.050> unite<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
Parthians because in order to unite the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.880 
Parthians because in order to unite the
whole<00:00:56.850> entire<00:00:57.420> region<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.140> parthia<00:00:58.649> they'll

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
whole entire region of parthia they'll

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.349 
whole entire region of parthia they'll
have<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.309> influence<00:01:00.020> client<00:01:01.020> states<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
have to influence client states of the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.359 
have to influence client states of the
Seleucids<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.660> particular<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.589> faction<00:01:05.100> called

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
Seleucids in particular a faction called

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.070 
Seleucids in particular a faction called
the<00:01:05.549> path<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.060> her<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.420> think<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.840> said<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the path of her I think I said that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.399 
the path of her I think I said that
correctly<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.670> could<00:01:08.970> lead<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.869> war

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
correctly and this could lead to a war

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
correctly and this could lead to a war
with<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> Seleucid<00:01:11.520> Empire<00:01:11.640> who<00:01:12.240> at<00:01:12.510> this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
with the Seleucid Empire who at this

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.100 
with the Seleucid Empire who at this
moment<00:01:12.840> are<00:01:13.640> absolutely<00:01:14.640> massive<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.360> may

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
moment are absolutely massive and may

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.010 
moment are absolutely massive and may
pose<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:17.040> extremely<00:01:17.850> large<00:01:18.030> threat<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pose an extremely large threat to the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.800 
pose an extremely large threat to the
path<00:01:19.229> ends<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.100> you'll<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.360> consider

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
path ends so you'll have to consider

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.660 
path ends so you'll have to consider
your<00:01:22.200> expansion<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:23.130> more<00:01:24.119> detail<00:01:24.630> than<00:01:25.200> other

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
your expansion in more detail than other

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
your expansion in more detail than other
factions<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.150> partings<00:01:27.600> also<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> good

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
factions the partings also have a good

factions the partings also have a good
starting<00:01:28.950> position<00:01:29.189> placing<00:01:30.060> them<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.869> good

starting position placing them in a good

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.440 
starting position placing them in a good
area<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.950> expand<00:01:32.490> because<00:01:32.850> there<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.329> lot

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
area to expand because there are a lot

do this they must take care from the

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
idea will be to take the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940 
idea will be to take the

numbers build up your economy from that

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.949 
numbers build up your economy from that
and<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:17.560> try<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:17.950> incur<00:02:18.640> on<00:02:18.970> Seleucid

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.080 
and then try to incur on Seleucid
territory<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.769> next<00:02:21.040> category<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.670> their

territory the next category is their

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.240 
territory the next category is their
late<00:02:22.450> faction<00:02:23.170> strength<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:23.920> believe<00:02:24.220> that

late faction strength and I believe that

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.940 
late faction strength and I believe that
this<00:02:24.489> is<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:25.090> moderately<00:02:25.959> strong<00:02:26.230> area<00:02:26.620> again

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
this is a moderately strong area again

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.920 
this is a moderately strong area again
for<00:02:27.250> Parthia<00:02:27.700> because<00:02:28.120> they're<00:02:28.330> a<00:02:28.360> heavily

cavalry cavalry focused faction and they

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.500

believe that this is a moderate area for

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:42.669 
the Parthians again because they use a

and<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.239> believe<00:04:19.510> again<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.229> this<00:04:20.380> is<00:04:20.440> a

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
and I believe again that this is a

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.730 
and I believe again that this is a
moderate<00:04:21.219> area<00:04:21.640> for<00:04:21.969> the<00:04:22.390> Parthians<00:04:23.110> because

moderate area for the Parthians because

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.230 
moderate area for the Parthians because
they<00:04:23.919> have<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.070> heritage<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.789> was<00:04:24.880> left<00:04:25.120> to

they have a heritage that was left to
them<00:04:25.390> by<00:04:25.599> the<00:04:25.659> Persian

to the sea unless they can use the lake

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.830 
to the sea unless they can use the lake
that's<00:04:59.440> beside<00:04:59.980> them<00:05:00.220> and<00:05:00.490> they<00:05:01.030> can<00:05:01.600> only

utilize<00:05:02.380> land<00:05:03.130> trading<00:05:03.790> only<00:05:03.940> which<00:05:04.450> means

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
utilize land trading only which means

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.470 
utilize land trading only which means
possibly<00:05:05.440> having<00:05:05.800> to<00:05:05.950> use<00:05:06.550> trade<00:05:06.940> routes<00:05:07.210> that

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
possibly having to use trade routes that

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.870 
possibly having to use trade routes that
also<00:05:07.930> go<00:05:08.140> through<00:05:08.440> enemy<00:05:08.920> territory<00:05:08.950> so<00:05:09.760> I'd

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
also go through enemy territory so I'd

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.150 
also go through enemy territory so I'd
say<00:05:10.060> the<00:05:10.210> difficulty<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.140> play<00:05:11.380> as<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.920> path

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
say the difficulty to play as the path

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.850 
say the difficulty to play as the path
ends<00:05:12.460> would<00:05:12.730> be<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:13.420> medium<00:05:14.140> difficulty

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
ends would be a medium difficulty

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.430 
ends would be a medium difficulty
because<00:05:15.640> of<00:05:15.970> their<00:05:16.270> location<00:05:16.990> their
