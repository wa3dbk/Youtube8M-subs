00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
on the eye makeup challenge I think I

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.550 
on the eye makeup challenge I think I
started<00:00:02.429> well<00:00:02.850> but<00:00:03.720> then<00:00:03.929> I<00:00:04.049> kind<00:00:04.319> of<00:00:04.380> lost

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
started well but then I kind of lost

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.349 
started well but then I kind of lost
myself<00:00:04.799> because<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:05.730> should<00:00:06.060> have<00:00:06.180> focused

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
myself because I should have focused

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.080 
myself because I should have focused
more<00:00:06.629> on<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.649> eyes<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.220> went<00:00:08.429> like<00:00:08.849> three

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
more on the eyes that I went like three

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.540 
more on the eyes that I went like three
old<00:00:09.389> face<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.650> said<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.250> weren't

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
old face and they said they weren't

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.970 
old face and they said they weren't
expecting<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.300> so<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.900> think<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.530> was<00:00:13.799> my

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
expecting that so I think that was my

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.320 
expecting that so I think that was my
mistake<00:00:14.309> melee

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.530

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
I make it but I I don't know at the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.780 
I make it but I I don't know at the
moment<00:00:27.140> I<00:00:27.590> didn't<00:00:27.920> think<00:00:27.980> about<00:00:28.220> that<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:28.700> I

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790
