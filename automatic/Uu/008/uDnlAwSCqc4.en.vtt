think it's really valuable I've been
lucky<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.680> just<00:00:44.710> sit<00:00:45.160> in<00:00:45.220> the<00:00:45.280> audience<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.790> I

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
lucky to just sit in the audience and I

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.910 
lucky to just sit in the audience and I
often<00:00:46.060> tell<00:00:46.390> people<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:46.870> it's<00:00:47.410> probably<00:00:47.740> the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
often tell people that it's probably the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.340 
often tell people that it's probably the
one<00:00:48.130> event<00:00:48.400> in<00:00:49.090> my<00:00:49.240> life<00:00:49.450> that<00:00:49.840> I<00:00:49.870> don't<00:00:50.140> just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
one event in my life that I don't just

that<00:00:52.750> it's<00:00:52.890> gymnastics<00:00:53.890> for<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.190> brain<00:00:54.430> that

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
that it's gymnastics for the brain that

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.640 
that it's gymnastics for the brain that
it<00:00:54.820> totally<00:00:55.030> feels<00:00:55.330> into<00:00:55.690> message<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.230> way

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
when this many people can come together

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.550 
when this many people can come together
with<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.120> common<00:01:11.360> sense<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.810> values<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:12.200> belief
