anymore and so farmers started looking

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.969 
anymore and so farmers started looking
for<00:02:00.970> alternatives<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.720> that's<00:02:02.200> where<00:02:02.530> ASD

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
for alternatives and that's where ASD

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.590 
for alternatives and that's where ASD
came<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.520> said<00:02:03.670> well<00:02:03.850> maybe<00:02:04.090> we<00:02:04.270> should

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
came in and said well maybe we should

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.770 
came in and said well maybe we should
try<00:02:04.960> a<00:02:05.890> different<00:02:06.340> crop<00:02:06.610> altogether<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.420> and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
try a different crop altogether and and

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.940 
try a different crop altogether and and
we<00:02:07.960> started<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:08.349> organic<00:02:08.769> vegetables

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950
