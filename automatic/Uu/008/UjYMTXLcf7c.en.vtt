00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
every race as I can it's been a little

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.049 
every race as I can it's been a little
bit<00:00:30.480> tough<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.019> testing<00:00:31.579> mainly<00:00:32.579> learning

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
bit tough the testing mainly learning

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
bit tough the testing mainly learning
the<00:00:33.120> tracks<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.899> been<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> lot<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> fun

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
the tracks but it's been a lot of fun

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.670 
the tracks but it's been a lot of fun
and<00:00:35.340> we're<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.030> too<00:00:36.630> far<00:00:36.660> off<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.350> by

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and we're not too far off so I think by

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.740 
and we're not too far off so I think by
the<00:00:37.980> time<00:00:38.070> race<00:00:38.399> time<00:00:38.610> comes<00:00:38.850> we'll<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.210> right

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the time race time comes we'll be right

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.190 
the time race time comes we'll be right
there<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.340> haven't<00:00:41.340> rode<00:00:41.820> much<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.300> Indy<00:00:43.170> or

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
there I haven't rode much at Indy or

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
there I haven't rode much at Indy or
Austin<00:00:43.800> but<00:00:43.980> obviously<00:00:44.520> those<00:00:44.670> are<00:00:44.730> going<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
Austin but obviously those are going to

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.520 
Austin but obviously those are going to
be<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> tracks<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.629> looking<00:00:46.320> forward

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
be the tracks that I'm looking forward

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.049 
be the tracks that I'm looking forward
to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.739> most<00:00:46.890> just<00:00:47.160> because<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.610> home<00:00:47.789> crowd

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.850 
to the most just because my home crowd
will<00:00:48.210> be<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.480> it'll<00:00:49.079> be<00:00:49.140> nice<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.350> be<00:00:49.649> the

only American and go race in America but

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.439 
only American and go race in America but
outside<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> America<00:00:53.250> would<00:00:53.789> say<00:00:54.059> probably

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
outside of America would say probably

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.479

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the most time there ever since the first

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.430 
the most time there ever since the first
test<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.370> November<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> felt<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.809> family<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440

whole team is really great to work with

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.320 
whole team is really great to work with
and<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:04.379> enjoyed<00:01:05.070> hanging<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:05.790> them<00:01:06.000> not

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and I enjoyed hanging out with them not

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.670 
and I enjoyed hanging out with them not
only<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> track<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.229> away<00:01:07.409> from<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
only at the track but away from the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
only at the track but away from the
track<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.040> dinner<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.479> very<00:01:09.630> good

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
track at dinner and so it's a very good

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.320 
track at dinner and so it's a very good
fit<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> I'm<00:01:11.369> excited<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.820> start<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> season

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.690 

we<00:01:15.330> worked<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.930> lot<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.530> suspension<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
we worked a lot on the suspension and

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.749 
we worked a lot on the suspension and
the<00:01:17.729> chassis<00:01:18.290> because<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.310> many<00:01:20.490> things

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the chassis because it's the many things

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.330 
the chassis because it's the many things
to<00:01:20.970> find<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> base<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.380> be<00:01:22.860> good<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.220> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to find the base and we be good on the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.570 
to find the base and we be good on the
bike<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.500> that's<00:01:25.500> why<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:25.710> didn't

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
bike so that's why we didn't

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.170 
bike so that's why we didn't
mini<00:01:26.880> labs<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.510> I<00:01:27.720> think<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.230> team<00:01:28.850> got<00:01:29.850> mini

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
mini labs and I think the team got mini

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.410 
mini labs and I think the team got mini
information<00:01:30.870> to<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.650> decision<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.270> would<00:01:33.270> like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
information to for decision I would like

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.460 
information to for decision I would like
to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.210 
to
to<00:01:35.250> fight<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> podiums<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.040> finish<00:01:38.040> like

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to fight for the podiums and finish like

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.220

this<00:01:38.250> guitar<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> think<00:01:39.420> will<00:01:39.660> be<00:01:39.810> very<00:01:39.840> happy

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
this guitar I think will be very happy

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.700 
this guitar I think will be very happy
because<00:01:41.420> at<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> moment<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.200> test<00:01:43.560> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
because at the moment to the test a

because at the moment to the test a
little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.070> difficult<00:01:44.510> I'm<00:01:45.860> writing<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> lot

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little bit difficult I'm writing a lot

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.100 
little bit difficult I'm writing a lot
so<00:01:48.260> on<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.740> big<00:01:49.920> track<00:01:50.190> on<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.090> go<00:01:51.630> kart<00:01:51.870> track
