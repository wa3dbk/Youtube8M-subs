hey<00:00:00.989> guys<00:00:01.199> I<00:00:01.410> just<00:00:01.469> wanted<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:01.949> introduce<00:00:02.129> you

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
hey guys I just wanted to introduce you

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.730 
hey guys I just wanted to introduce you
to<00:00:03.030> something<00:00:03.870> I<00:00:04.049> picked<00:00:04.290> up<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
to something I picked up from the

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.400 
to something I picked up from the
internet<00:00:05.069> it's<00:00:05.609> these<00:00:05.819> they<00:00:06.750> are<00:00:06.899> wireless

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
internet it's these they are wireless

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.900 
internet it's these they are wireless
charging<00:00:07.799> modules<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:08.429> you've<00:00:08.550> got<00:00:08.730> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
charging modules so you've got the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.990 
charging modules so you've got the
transmitter<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:09.929> receiver<00:00:10.610> there<00:00:11.610> from<00:00:11.790> seed

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
transmitter and receiver there from seed

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.120 
transmitter and receiver there from seed
studio<00:00:12.540> they're<00:00:13.080> pretty<00:00:13.290> cheap<00:00:13.349> about<00:00:13.860> five

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
studio they're pretty cheap about five

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490 
studio they're pretty cheap about five
pounds<00:00:14.540> and<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.990> means<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.350> can

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
pounds and it means that you can

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.400 
pounds and it means that you can
wirelessly<00:00:16.800> power<00:00:17.520> your<00:00:17.850> devices<00:00:18.449> now<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.289> you

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
wirelessly power your devices now if you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.099 
wirelessly power your devices now if you
had<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.529> WIPO<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:21.060> had<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> lipo<00:00:21.600> charging

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
had a WIPO and you had a lipo charging

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.140 
had a WIPO and you had a lipo charging
you<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.470> charge<00:00:22.800> your<00:00:23.160> device<00:00:23.460> up<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.029> it

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
you could charge your device up so it

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.509 
you could charge your device up so it
could<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.420> embedded<00:00:24.900> or<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.949> might<00:00:26.099> just<00:00:26.130> want

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
could be embedded or you might just want

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.920 
could be embedded or you might just want
to<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> lamp<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.720> put

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
to have a lamp that you just put

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.439 
to have a lamp that you just put
somewhere<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> specific<00:00:28.830> place<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.670> then

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
somewhere in a specific place and then

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.299 
somewhere in a specific place and then
it<00:00:30.539> lights<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.990> well<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:31.619> can<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.099> for

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
it lights up well these can do that for

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:32.630 
it lights up well these can do that for
you

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.569 
you
they<00:00:32.969> take<00:00:33.239> 12<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> 13<00:00:34.680> volts<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.399> they

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
they take 12 to 13 volts in and they

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.470 
they take 12 to 13 volts in and they
kick<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.940> 5<00:00:36.360> volts<00:00:36.780> at<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.710> distance<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.340> around

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
kick out 5 volts at a distance of around

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.560 
kick out 5 volts at a distance of around
20<00:00:39.480> millimeters<00:00:40.670> maximum<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.329> they<00:00:42.450> go

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
20 millimeters maximum and they go

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.450 
20 millimeters maximum and they go
through<00:00:42.780> objects<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.860> wireless<00:00:44.070> so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
through objects because it's wireless so

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.580 
through objects because it's wireless so
I'll<00:00:45.120> just<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.480> how<00:00:45.629> they<00:00:45.780> work<00:00:45.809> no

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
I'll just show you how they work no

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.900 
I'll just show you how they work no
other<00:00:46.770> information<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.610> be<00:00:47.670> given

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
other information is going to be given

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.580 
other information is going to be given
about<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.270> really<00:00:48.510> apart<00:00:49.200> from<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.440> they

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
about these really apart from that they

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
about these really apart from that they
kick<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:49.980> about<00:00:50.820> six<00:00:51.270> hundred<00:00:51.390> milliamps

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
kick out about six hundred milliamps

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.170 
kick out about six hundred milliamps
maximum<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.160> awful<00:00:53.460> lot<00:00:53.640> more<00:00:53.969> than

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
maximum which is an awful lot more than

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.049 
maximum which is an awful lot more than
you<00:00:54.270> need<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.690> most<00:00:54.809> projects<00:00:55.789> right<00:00:56.789> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you need for most projects right so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.209 
you need for most projects right so
here's<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.480> transmitter<00:00:58.379> I've<00:00:58.770> put<00:00:59.010> on<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
here's the transmitter I've put on the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.560 
here's the transmitter I've put on the
floor<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.820> put<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.210> an<00:01:00.329> acrylic

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
floor and I put a bit of an acrylic

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.110 
floor and I put a bit of an acrylic
sheet<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.320> top<00:01:01.520> it's<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.699> into<00:01:03.000> one

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
sheet over the top it's right into one

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.289 
sheet over the top it's right into one
of<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.530> these<00:01:04.530> jacks<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:05.939> use<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
of these these jacks that you can use to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.679 
of these these jacks that you can use to
plug<00:01:06.450> into<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.700> plug<00:01:08.700> adapter<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
plug into a plug adapter so if I just

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
plug into a plug adapter so if I just
plug<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.409> coming<00:01:10.740> for<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.400> 12<00:01:11.670> volt

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
plug that in it's coming for a 12 volt

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.690 
plug that in it's coming for a 12 volt
adapter<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.530> got<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.010> transmitter

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
adapter and I've got the transmitter

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.800 
adapter and I've got the transmitter
here<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:16.229> that's<00:01:16.470> why<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.799> up<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:21.299> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
here and that's why it up to this so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.890 
here and that's why it up to this so
it's<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.770> Arduino<00:01:23.400> Leonardo<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> all

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
it's just a an Arduino Leonardo so all

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.480 
it's just a an Arduino Leonardo so all
the<00:01:25.049> powers<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.530> onto<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> breadboard<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
the powers going onto the breadboard and

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.789 
the powers going onto the breadboard and
it's<00:01:27.030> connected<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.960> little<00:01:28.229> stepper<00:01:28.500> motor

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's connected to a little stepper motor

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.969 
it's connected to a little stepper motor
so<00:01:29.360> if<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.509> just<00:01:30.780> sort<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.290> hover<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> over

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so if I just sort of hover this over

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.950 
so if I just sort of hover this over
here<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.060> place<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.810> it's

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
here you can just place it because it's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.649 
here you can just place it because it's
on<00:01:34.079> top<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.650> critic<00:01:35.369> you'll<00:01:36.090> see<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> this

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
on top of a critic you'll see that this

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.679 
on top of a critic you'll see that this
starts<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> move<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> second

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.760 

it's<00:01:43.079> going<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> catch<00:01:43.530> isn't<00:01:43.799> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 

so<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> power<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.700> coming<00:01:47.850> through<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.689> I

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
so the power is coming through and if I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.639 
so the power is coming through and if I
just<00:01:48.869> move<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.740> slightly<00:01:50.189> off<00:01:50.490> to<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> side

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
just move it slightly off to the side

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.649 
just move it slightly off to the side
you'll<00:01:52.649> see<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.189> lights<00:01:53.430> dim<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
you'll see that the lights dim and the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.850 
you'll see that the lights dim and the
Leonardo's<00:01:55.110> tell<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.649> got<00:01:55.799> enough

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
Leonardo's tell me it's not got enough

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.660 
Leonardo's tell me it's not got enough
power<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:58.470> if<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.799> bring<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.130> back<00:02:01.670> with

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
power and if I just bring it back with

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.200 
power and if I just bring it back with
power<00:02:02.939> again<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.979> start<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.549> same<00:02:05.789> process

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
power again and I start the same process

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.779 
power again and I start the same process
again<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.860> get<00:02:08.220> some<00:02:08.429> other

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
again now if I just get some other

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.620 
again now if I just get some other
things<00:02:09.269> if<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.160> use<00:02:11.160> this<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.510> bit<00:02:12.510> of

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
things if I use this little bit of

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.949 
things if I use this little bit of
plastic<00:02:13.140> which<00:02:14.010> is<00:02:14.250> from<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.150> SD<00:02:15.420> card<00:02:15.450> holder

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
plastic which is from an SD card holder

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.050 
plastic which is from an SD card holder
I<00:02:16.019> think<00:02:16.230> if<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.560> place<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.220> top

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.550 

that's<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.209> bit<00:02:21.360> too<00:02:21.510> much<00:02:21.540> for<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.260> doesn't

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that's a bit too much for it it doesn't

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.580 
that's a bit too much for it it doesn't
like<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.830> distance<00:02:23.640> oh<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:27.630> about<00:02:27.959> works

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
like that distance oh just about works

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.009 
like that distance oh just about works
so<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.580> voltage<00:02:29.940> drops<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.480> further<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.900> is

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
so the voltage drops the further it is

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.940 
so the voltage drops the further it is
away<00:02:32.030> right<00:02:33.030> I'll<00:02:33.239> try<00:02:33.590> getting<00:02:34.590> rid<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.739> that

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
away right I'll try getting rid of that

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.130 
away right I'll try getting rid of that
and<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.459> acrylic<00:02:35.790> sheet<00:02:36.030> we'll<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.959> use

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and the acrylic sheet we'll just use

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.190 
and the acrylic sheet we'll just use
this<00:02:37.760> CD<00:02:38.760> case

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.580 

no<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.280> doesn't<00:02:47.459> seem<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.849> like<00:02:47.879> that<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
no it doesn't seem to like that so the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.380 
no it doesn't seem to like that so the
whole<00:02:49.739> two<00:02:49.980> centimeter<00:02:50.640> distance<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.209> think

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
whole two centimeter distance I think

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.530 
whole two centimeter distance I think
his<00:02:51.830> it's<00:02:52.830> perhaps<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.340> little<00:02:53.430> bit<00:02:53.730> overstated

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
his it's perhaps a little bit overstated

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.690 
his it's perhaps a little bit overstated
so<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.379> like<00:02:55.620> we<00:02:55.739> moved<00:02:55.980> around<00:02:56.129> too<00:02:56.519> much

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
so it's like we moved around too much

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.670 
so it's like we moved around too much
and<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.330> likes<00:02:57.569> being<00:02:57.810> pretty<00:02:58.050> centralized

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
and it likes being pretty centralized

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.180 
and it likes being pretty centralized
but<00:02:58.920> they<00:02:59.459> work<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.620> amount<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.860> current

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
but they work and the amount of current

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.350 
but they work and the amount of current
that's<00:03:02.370> kicking<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:02.790> is<00:03:02.910> more<00:03:03.060> than<00:03:03.239> enough

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
that's kicking out is more than enough

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.780 
that's kicking out is more than enough
to<00:03:03.599> drive<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.959> motor<00:03:04.290> which<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.790> it's

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
to drive this motor which is it's

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.089 
to drive this motor which is it's
getting<00:03:06.030> a<00:03:06.090> little<00:03:06.330> bit<00:03:06.420> warm<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.860> runs

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
getting a little bit warm and that runs

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.040 
getting a little bit warm and that runs
at<00:03:08.280> 100<00:03:08.790> milliamps<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.480> whatever<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.870> board

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
at 100 milliamps and whatever the board

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.190 
at 100 milliamps and whatever the board
takes<00:03:10.410> as<00:03:10.620> well<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:12.690> working<00:03:12.870> quite<00:03:13.170> well

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
takes as well so it's working quite well

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.470 
takes as well so it's working quite well
so<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.549> should<00:03:14.730> pick<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.180> there<00:03:15.360> only

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
so you should pick one up there only

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.500 
so you should pick one up there only
about<00:03:15.599> 5<00:03:15.989> pounds
