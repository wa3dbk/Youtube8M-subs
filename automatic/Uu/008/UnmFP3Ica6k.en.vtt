00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.779
 especially for gamers 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.500
 this time with the presentation of a 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.579
 USB key 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.650
 the usb key kronus max and yes you have 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.379

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.879
 your xbox 360 you just bought a 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.260
 xbox one and you realize that 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.449
 the joystick does not work on your 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.559
 new console and well know that it 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.940
 is possible to operate 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.570
 any joystick on any 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.089
 which machine 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.750
 and yes so a joystick a pad ps cap 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:55.210
 on a xbox 360 a wii controller on a 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.649
 pc finally any machine can 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.030
 receive any controller thanks 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.770
 to this little usb stick 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.780
 we will see how it works all of 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.609
 suite and here is the usb key a little 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.530
 more in detail with easy its side 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.259
 a micro usb port that will allow you 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.970
 to connect the key a computer for 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.320
 including making updates to the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.380
 firmware and make the key compatible 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.610
 with a maximum of peripherals 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.530
 you especially have to be able to configure the 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.420
 key with this little port because there is a 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.649
 software that is downloadable and which 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.170
 will allow you to configure your 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.670
 joysticks modified for example the buttons 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.220
 the order of the buttons or the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.539
 feel of a steering wheel or generate a 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.599
 combo by pressing a single key 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.000
 in short all this is possible on the face 

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:34.720
 before you have a digital display and 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.190
 a little button 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.470
 here you will be able to navigate between 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.750
 different profiles up to eight profiles 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.729
 can be saved in the key on 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.810
 the back so you have the usb input 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.780
 which will allow you to plug 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.929
 any wired controller and for 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.880
 the wireless controllers and the key 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.479
 connects devices 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.420
 bluetooth 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.640
 so everything that is dual shock and the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 web can be connected directly to 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.759
 the device key 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.319
 like the xbox 360 steps that them 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.860
 operate on wifi technologies 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.840
 and although you will have to plead the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.739
 device here is their wifi receiver 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.940
 from microsoft and here and plug it in 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.500
 directly and well at the back of the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.959
 key and then you will connect 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
 directly the xbox 360 controllers without 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.540
 wire 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.760
 so here we are going to do and now a 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.770
 little is so connecting on the xbox 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.640
 one is the game that their instinct 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.440
 so the xbox 360 arcade gamepad for that 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.120
 I need the USB key that I have 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.150
 connected on the xbox one via a 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.920
 extends the little light indicates that he 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.120
 is waiting for a connection so we 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:48.670
 will plug the controller right away 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:51.190
 arcade on the usb port hop so here is the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.070
 has connected the indication zero indicates 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.560
 that this is the player number 1 so we 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.820
 will test that right now 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.820
 we see it works 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.319
 now we will do the same test with 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.999
 a second usb key so a second 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.139
 usb key plugged into a second port of 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.409
 the xbox and one 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:23.459
 this time I'm going to plug the 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.780
 receptor therefore Wi Wi receptor 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.170
 xbox 360 wireless controllers 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.129
 no xbox 360 controller here is one 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.519
 wing waiting for connection on branch 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:40.889
 the receiver and that's it connected 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.780
 honest lady and taken care of on the 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.609
 port number 1 so this is the second 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.609
 player and we will test it right away 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.239
 I 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.659
 in a works fine and there is 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.049
 really no latency 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.730
