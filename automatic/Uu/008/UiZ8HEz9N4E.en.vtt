00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.600
 hello to everyone 6 and we met 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:14.030
 in the minecraft snapshot 3 023 bs 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.320
 published yesterday pretty late and say that 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.150
 a version was also published yesterday 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.950
 leave the link that you analyze about the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.930
 version in the description that I recommend 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.119
 a lot to see that it's a snap if you've 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.100
 attracted much criticism from the community of 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.720
 youtube and especially minecraft because 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.430
 have made changes that were 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.470
 unnecessary I recommend a lot to see it what 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.480
 I say and well this version I have 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.250
 said it was published quite late and it was 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.080
 bringing an error fixing because 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.820
 the version that made a mistake with the 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.320
 golden apple and it was not generated 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.200
 life correctly was like 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.910
 searched what is regenerated correctly what 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.980
 that I had to regenerate and what I 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.360
 money dump aside fix that mistake 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.129
 also in making a change the mass 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.289
 golden and is basically charging the apple 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.789
 gold you will not give feedback about 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.289
 signs that you are going to give feedback 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.590
 where will I put in survival mode for 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.230
 that you see it game mode but there we are 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.750
 and I take it and as you see it gives me 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 regeneration 2 apart also implemented 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.120
 a new 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.640
 xo how could we say this a new 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.950
 the word a new as you see here what 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.750
 they make in the word or more a new power 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.460
 so to speak, come on, it's not going to come out 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.990
 the correct word but good and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 basically that if we have the apple of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.950
 gold the normal and everything I wanted to say 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.260
 now the normal golden apple does not the 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.330
 delighted is just going to give a 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.100
 real life driver you see here 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.570
 and this driver because of what he does 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.190
 as you see here below is that it gives you two 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.390
 more hearts your character is 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.610
 quite good because as you see now 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.160
 we have 12 12 hearts as long as 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.290
 let's take this golden apple and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.210
 it really is like a suit of armor 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.710
 apart that if you put on the armor is 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.420
 saying gives you more life and even the 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.880
 hearts is pretty good but with 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.470
 owner and everything as you will understand is 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.900
 rather better let's put a 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:57.280
 armor so we can see how we are from 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.260
 We are going strong and as you can see you have all the 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.850
 armor and 12 hearts is pretty 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.470
 well really quite cool this and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.090
 like adventure quite a minute and a half 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.010
 I think it was good, we can try it 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.520
 new so you can see how long it is going to 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.600
 take apple apple manzanita 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.420
 where are you apple man here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 let's take the putting in shape is 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.670
 I look silly 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.670
 there we are 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.219
 one minute and 30 exactly 30 minute 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:29.299
 for a minute and a half and a minute and 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.469
 half if I do not confuse myself I would like 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.909
 comment is that this change seems to me 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:36.530
 it seems pretty good to me since you know 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:38.060
 that yesterday in the 13 w 23 a were mixed 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.650
 the regeneration portions both in 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.260
 level 1 as well as level 2 have been reduced 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.689
 50% the effect of each of the two 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.939
 two is now reduced by 50% and many people 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.620
 only here a lot of people go and good 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.239
 apart it also made a change and it's 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.879
 who has now introduced a new 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.220
 mechanism for zombies ie 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.900
 now the zombies will continue to be generated 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.030
 when you do not look towards them that is to say 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.709
 if we put ourselves in the creative moment 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.079
 I'm going to catch a zombie zombie spam 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.120
 ok pos and you are fighting with a 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.189
 zombie and you're fighting face to face with 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.409
 he will put time line so that he does not 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.639
 burn the poor thing that grieves me master of you 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:12.639
 please come now 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.730
 when you're fighting with a zombie and 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.500
 are you looking if the post around you 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.960
 zombies began to appear while you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.760
 do not look and they will go for you because in addition to 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.050
 improve the artificial intelligence of 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.330
 the zombies and now they can see you from 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.400
 32 blocks that is a pass from far 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.750
 that from 32 blocks will be able to see you and 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.640
 attack you and as you see I will put the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.290
 survival so you can see that they will start 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.300
 go out many everywhere less less 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.950
 that I am protected with my driver 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.110
 health two operate from the south we saw 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.150
 how much I have left then second voucher 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.209
 how am I struggling with this and now what 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.770
 normal is that we keep seeing and fighting 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.260
 with the other men will begin to appear 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.400
 around this also depends on the 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.780
 difficulty in which you are playing to see 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.080
 if it appears that they want it now 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.730
 trolling and does not appear and also depends 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.160
 what game mode are you playing in 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.160
 in it and if it is normal then hinder the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.560
 bully series have another from pakapaka come 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.880
 so you go buddy studies look there 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.830
 no one would see us as you have just been 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.020
 appeared her friend and how is that 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.459
 quite far away they seem more like before 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.690
 is testing and has appeared a 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.030
 amount looks 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.010
 Here are two we will stand with them 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.480
 showing that they appear behind me 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
 now 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.740
 well, they do not seem normal but 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.420
 that appear before and is tested but has 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.190
 appeared there two of santomera of this one 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.440
 and like me they are watching me and is 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.690
 going for my guide even there is the 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.970
 zombie veneta for me but all those who 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.520
 there is clear example here are already what they have 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.330
 done in improving the system 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.640
 difficulty men now like 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.190
 they appear a good bunch I have a lot 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.570
 of others and also now they are more 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.580
 smart for that reason they see you 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.990
 from 32 blocks and well here that is 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.000
 well is one of the nations of today 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.020
 I recommend yesterday I will put it to be 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.020
 by insect 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.039
 die all come to die and now more 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.360
 guys comment down here what has 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.550
 seemed like this change with the apple to me 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.410
 I like it a lot since they have changed 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.389
 quite the regeneration position 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.970
 because the apple now acts better 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.169
 way in this change but I think that at 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.759
 final what in the feedback that 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:11.050
 changed in yesterday's version will end 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.060
 even removing it completely because 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.590
 Many people have criticized that change 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.810
 of the regeneration potential as 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.580
 health and they are also changes 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.840
 unnecessary at this point and good 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.090
 guys I say goodbye here with my armor 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.069
 super cool and nothing more guys there is the 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.380
 the cabral zombie or in the folk vials the 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.060
 the slender or as you want to call the 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.580
 inter maintains that it will not be the word 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.289
 he's pissed around and nothing else 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.880
 guys like and favorites and even the video 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.510
 it helps a lot to spread the video and I do not 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.170
 wet in the next video to another 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.170
 goodbye
