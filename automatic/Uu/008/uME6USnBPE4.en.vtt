and<00:01:59.030> then<00:01:59.660> I<00:01:59.690> begin<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.350> go<00:02:00.530> down<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.700> shaft<00:02:02.000> of

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
and then I begin to go down the shaft of

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.810 
and then I begin to go down the shaft of
the<00:02:02.390> hair<00:02:02.630> all<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.380> way<00:02:03.590> down<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.370> ends

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
the hair all the way down to the ends

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.510 
the hair all the way down to the ends
and<00:02:05.000> once<00:02:05.510> I<00:02:05.660> get<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.200> ends<00:02:06.530> instead<00:02:07.370> of

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
and once I get to the ends instead of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.609 
and once I get to the ends instead of
tying<00:02:07.850> it<00:02:08.090> off<00:02:08.360> I<00:02:08.660> know<00:02:08.780> some<00:02:09.110> people<00:02:09.229> tie<00:02:09.560> it

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
tying it off I know some people tie it

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.040 
tying it off I know some people tie it
off<00:02:09.890> but<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.550> don't<00:02:10.850> do<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.270> because<00:02:11.450> I<00:02:11.750> want

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
off but I don't do that because I want

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.530 
off but I don't do that because I want
to<00:02:12.140> protect<00:02:12.590> my<00:02:12.860> ends<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.640> instead<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.180> tying

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
to protect my ends so instead of tying

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.890 
to protect my ends so instead of tying
it<00:02:14.720> off<00:02:14.960> I<00:02:15.230> go<00:02:15.680> right<00:02:16.010> back<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.910> then<00:02:17.510> come

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
it off I go right back up and then come

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470 
it off I go right back up and then come
down<00:02:17.930> until<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.890> thread<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.400> finished<00:02:19.880> this

down until the thread is finished this

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.930 
down until the thread is finished this

need<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> knot<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.630> because<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.320> do<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:25.190> you

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
need to knot it because you do when you

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.310 
need to knot it because you do when you
cut<00:02:25.490> it<00:02:25.610> out<00:02:25.700> with<00:02:25.760> scissors<00:02:26.000> or<00:02:26.720> if<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.990> pull

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
cut it out with scissors or if you pull

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.980 
cut it out with scissors or if you pull
it<00:02:27.410> out<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.460> might<00:02:28.760> damage<00:02:29.210> your<00:02:29.390> end<00:02:29.720> so

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
it out you might damage your end so

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.690 
it out you might damage your end so
you're<00:02:30.140> running<00:02:30.410> that<00:02:30.560> risk<00:02:30.800> and<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.340> is<00:02:31.520> why

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
you're running that risk and that is why

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.210 
you're running that risk and that is why
I<00:02:31.730> just<00:02:32.180> go<00:02:32.360> back<00:02:32.600> up<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.200> down<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.950> up<00:02:34.040> and

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
I just go back up and down and up and

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.700 
I just go back up and down and up and
down<00:02:34.430> until<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.970> thread<00:02:35.270> is<00:02:35.420> finished<00:02:35.750> after

down until the thread is finished after
that<00:02:37.370> you're<00:02:37.850> going<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.090> do<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.330> rest<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
that you're going to do the rest of the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.440 
that you're going to do the rest of the
head<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.020> course<00:02:39.320> but<00:02:39.830> if<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.460> have<00:02:40.790> really

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
head of course but if you have really

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.810 
head of course but if you have really
really<00:02:41.480> sensitive<00:02:42.170> hair<00:02:42.610> if<00:02:43.610> you're

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
really sensitive hair if you're

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.970 
really sensitive hair if you're
sensitive<00:02:44.090> around<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.600> area<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.290> your<00:02:45.680> edges

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
sensitive around this area on your edges

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.440 
sensitive around this area on your edges
a<00:02:46.010> lot<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.280> people<00:02:46.580> are<00:02:46.730> eyes<00:02:47.000> one<00:02:47.210> of<00:02:47.240> those

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
a lot of people are eyes one of those

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.660 
a lot of people are eyes one of those
people<00:02:47.660> and<00:02:47.990> what<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.650> is<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.100> get<00:02:49.490> the

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
people and what I do is I get the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.150 
people and what I do is I get the
section<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.240> I<00:02:50.720> pull<00:02:50.990> it<00:02:51.110> down<00:02:51.530> instead<00:02:52.010> of

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
section and I pull it down instead of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.490 
section and I pull it down instead of
pulling<00:02:52.400> back<00:02:52.910> or<00:02:53.420> towards<00:02:54.020> the<00:02:54.080> center

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
pulling back or towards the center

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.890 
pulling back or towards the center
because<00:02:54.800> usually<00:02:54.980> when<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.880> grab<00:02:56.390> it<00:02:56.600> you're

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
because usually when you grab it you're

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.930 
because usually when you grab it you're
going<00:02:57.080> to<00:02:57.170> go<00:02:57.350> somewhere<00:02:57.710> towards<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.490> center

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
going to go somewhere towards the center

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.640 
going to go somewhere towards the center
but<00:02:59.690> um<00:02:59.900> I<00:03:00.410> clip<00:03:01.100> down<00:03:01.570> towards<00:03:02.570> my<00:03:02.660> ear<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.560> I

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
but um I clip down towards my ear and I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.560 
but um I clip down towards my ear and I
started<00:03:04.040> wrap<00:03:04.280> that<00:03:04.580> way<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.090> way<00:03:05.390> my

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
started wrap that way so that way my

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.290 
started wrap that way so that way my
hair<00:03:05.810> isn't<00:03:06.230> damaged<00:03:06.770> around<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.000> edges

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
hair isn't damaged around the edges

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.699 
hair isn't damaged around the edges
because<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.570> just<00:03:08.750> pull<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.050> back<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.470> start

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
because if I just pull it back and start

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.420 
because if I just pull it back and start
wrapping<00:03:10.130> it<00:03:10.400> will<00:03:11.090> pull<00:03:11.780> my<00:03:12.020> edges<00:03:12.410> out<00:03:12.590> so

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
wrapping it will pull my edges out so

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.720 
wrapping it will pull my edges out so
that's<00:03:14.330> pretty<00:03:14.600> much<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.080> I<00:03:15.470> usually<00:03:16.100> let<00:03:16.489> my

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
that's pretty much it I usually let my

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.850 
that's pretty much it I usually let my
hair<00:03:17.000> dry<00:03:17.150> overnight

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
hair dry overnight

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.580 
hair dry overnight
and<00:03:18.100> then<00:03:18.280> style<00:03:18.550> it<00:03:18.760> in<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.030> morning<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.170> if

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
and then style it in the morning but if

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.620 
and then style it in the morning but if
you<00:03:20.770> don't<00:03:21.010> put<00:03:21.220> too<00:03:21.370> much<00:03:21.400> products<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.480> can

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
you don't put too much products you can

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.240 
you don't put too much products you can
get<00:03:22.750> away<00:03:22.900> with<00:03:23.350> having<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.770> properly

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
get away with having it properly

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.980 
get away with having it properly
stretched<00:03:24.580> within<00:03:24.910> three<00:03:25.150> or<00:03:25.240> four<00:03:25.420> hours<00:03:25.780> if

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990
