00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
Samsung hm 1610 Bluetooth headset it's a

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.129 
Samsung hm 1610 Bluetooth headset it's a
budget-conscious<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.760> price<00:00:09.269> only<00:00:09.420> at<00:00:09.630> $40

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
budget-conscious one price only at $40

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.140 
budget-conscious one price only at $40
so<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.679> going<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:10.889> cost<00:00:11.040> it<00:00:11.219> too<00:00:11.400> much<00:00:11.639> it

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
so it's not going to cost it too much it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.180 
so it's not going to cost it too much it
offers<00:00:12.450> only<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.719> miniscule<00:00:13.290> set<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.710> features

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
offers only a miniscule set of features

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.849 
offers only a miniscule set of features
such<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:14.719> multi-point<00:00:15.719> technology<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.680> got

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
such as multi-point technology you got

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.640 
such as multi-point technology you got
also<00:00:17.160> streaming<00:00:18.090> audio<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> even<00:00:19.140> win<00:00:19.619> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650

also streaming audio and even win a
noise<00:00:19.980> reduction<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.390> those<00:00:21.510> who<00:00:21.570> don't

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
noise reduction so for those who don't

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.359 
noise reduction so for those who don't
want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.990> pay<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.380> much<00:00:22.560> money<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.160> might

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
want to pay that much money this might

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.910 
want to pay that much money this might
be<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.699> ideal<00:00:24.150> solution<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.680> terms

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
be the ideal solution for you in terms

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920 
be the ideal solution for you in terms
of<00:00:26.099> design<00:00:26.460> there<00:00:26.970> isn't<00:00:27.300> really<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.570> much

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
of design there isn't really that much

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.540 
of design there isn't really that much
to<00:00:28.080> say<00:00:28.289> about<00:00:28.410> it's<00:00:28.859> just<00:00:29.099> like<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.369> any

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to say about it's just like your any

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
to say about it's just like your any
other<00:00:29.760> typical<00:00:30.060> looking<00:00:30.539> headset<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.260> there

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
other typical looking headset out there

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.350 
other typical looking headset out there
you've<00:00:31.679> got<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:31.800> hard<00:00:32.160> lines<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:33.000> curves

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
you've got some hard lines some curves

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.930 
you've got some hard lines some curves
to<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:34.350> normal<00:00:34.770> size<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.489> could<00:00:35.730> tell

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to it it's normal size so you could tell

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.670 
to it it's normal size so you could tell
it<00:00:36.360> doesn't<00:00:36.540> really<00:00:36.750> stand<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.290> when<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it doesn't really stand out when you

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.369 
it doesn't really stand out when you
hold<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.430> have<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.879> your<00:00:39.059> ear

hold it when you have it in your ear

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
hold it when you have it in your ear
it's<00:00:40.379> constructed<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.950> plastic<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.550> have

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
it's constructed of plastic you have

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
it's constructed of plastic you have
this<00:00:41.850> black<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> blue<00:00:42.629> finish<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> which

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this black and blue finish to it which

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
this black and blue finish to it which
does<00:00:43.890> well<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.399> keeping<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> keeping<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
does well and keeping it and keeping a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.389 
does well and keeping it and keeping a
low<00:00:45.629> profile<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.469> doesn't<00:00:46.680> stand<00:00:46.860> out<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
low profile so it doesn't stand out and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.760 
low profile so it doesn't stand out and
it's<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.719> weight<00:00:48.989> but<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's it is like weight but the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
it's it is like weight but the
construction<00:00:50.340> feels<00:00:50.789> pretty<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
construction feels pretty good it

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
construction feels pretty good it
doesn't<00:00:51.989> necessarily<00:00:52.500> come<00:00:52.559> off<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:53.010> being

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
doesn't necessarily come off as being

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.479 
doesn't necessarily come off as being
cheap<00:00:53.750> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.440> its<00:00:55.590> facade<00:00:55.949> the

even though includes an ear hook it's
not<00:01:31.259> something<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.950> necessary<00:01:32.549> just

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
not something that's necessary just

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.700 
not something that's necessary just
because<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> eat<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.540> ear<00:01:34.079> gel<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.470> here<00:01:34.619> in

because to eat the ear gel right here in

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.499 
because to eat the ear gel right here in
the<00:01:34.770> earpiece<00:01:35.009> provides<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.790> really<00:01:36.240> solid
