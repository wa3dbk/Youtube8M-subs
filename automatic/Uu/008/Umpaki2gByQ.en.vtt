00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.899
 let's calculate the limit when n tends to 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:08.920
 infinite minus in the cube plus 2 n 1 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.600
 party n square plus 2 in minus 1 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.210
 let's observe that we have to calculate the 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.869
 limit of a succession that is a 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 quotient of polynomials and for that in 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:26.450
 first place we will divide up and down 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.400
 by the highest degree of the numerator 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.890
 and denominator observe that the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 polynomial of the numerator has grade 3 the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 polynomial of the denominator has grade 2 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.660
 then have it divided up and down 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.989
 by in the bucket 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.690
 then we would have less in the cube more 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.300
 2 n 1 match in the cube then we divide 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.300
 each of the addends with in the cube 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.220
 and below the same thing we ask you to put in the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.550
 cube then we divide each of the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.320
 added by n to the cube 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.230
 and now what we do is simplify 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.620
 each of the fractions that appear 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.840
 in the numerator and denominator 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.270
 let's note that less in the split cube 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.120
 in the cube that at least between plus minus 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.690
 and in the cube / n cube is one is not left 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.710
 minus one plus two in the party in the 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:33.229
 cube up we have n down we have n 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.060
 exponent the one from below wins because it has 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.740
 three up one wins by two of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.310
 difference what we put in the square 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.610
 in high two down and up we put the 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.840
 2 that we have this 2 was plus 1 game 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.840
 in the bucket, it is already 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.100
 match in the square match in the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.100
 Cube 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.380
 there are no more numbers between more plus n 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 square up exponent two down 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.330
 exponent 3 channel below by one of 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.940
 difference then we would have up nothing 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.460
 then we put a 1 n high match to 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:10.860
 has won by 1 difference in high 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:13.290
 to 1 that is n + 2 match n up in the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.420
 cube down so down by two of 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.940
 difference in the square 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.880
 here we have put and I guess you were 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.190
 all nervous in squares in the cube 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.290
 and here minus a 1 match per n 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.850
 and now once we have simplified 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.340
 everything that has n down tends to zero 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.310
 simply if you give values ​​to the n 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.500
 for the big ones you will see like two matches 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.880
 in the box is a very small number 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 practically zero all this tends to 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.890
 zero tends to zero tends to zero 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.860
 tends to zero and here we will leave a 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.160
 thing that we already know that as numbers do not 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.490
 can leave but that is allowed to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.319
 appear when we are calculating 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:04.480
 limits 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:07.480
 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 means 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.610
 when we calculate limits 1 divided 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.620
 between something very small if it's with numbers 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.730
 1 match 0 does not exist but with limits 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.890
 it means 1 match and 0 something is taken very 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.040
 small very small infinitely 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.040
 small 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:28.139
 and as we know a number divided between 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:30.180
 something that is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 etc. 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.689
 something tiny these infinite is very 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.519
 big is infinity infinite and now 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.430
 we have to look at what sign we have 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.200
 let's see we go to the beginning only 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.870
 you have to look at the ones in this greater 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.709
 degree of the numerator and denominator in 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.750
 the numerator we have less in the cube 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.430
 least in the denominator we have in 4 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.010
 plus 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.200
 that means that as the sen is of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.060
 higher degree are those that dominate the 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.829
 situation in the sense that when in 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.680
 It's very big, it tells us what 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.450
 occurs the above polynomial above 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.420
 tends to minus infinity and the one below 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.430
 tends more infinite and now in the case 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.730
 that we have at least between infinity 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.450
 more as we know is less then this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.030
 limit is less infinite that would be the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.030
 result of the proposed limit
