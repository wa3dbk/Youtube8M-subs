 mystic who no longer has to do his 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.790
 evidence in such a society 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 he won the selection prize 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 this year has just won 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.550
 of the octave price douesnel in front of six of 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.600
 his opponents the day this diary where 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 they will be worthy had declared that his 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.110
 horse was not yet 100% we the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.469
 doubt who has further progress on this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 exit 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.949
 the autostart departure will not ask him 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 problem there is a good number in the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.910
 short car it is a fulcrum all 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.270
 actually indicated to succeed the leap 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 a guy of heripré timoko severino still 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.780
 hereditary rolling the latest winners 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.790
 of this continental criterion 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 I will ask him number four wins 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.090
 the filly is out of shape he remains 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.500
 on two consecutive wins including one 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.540
 obtained in the price marcel laurent 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.720
 in front of many of his rivals of the day 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.550
 where that day she evolve on a 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.450
 course 2100 meters autostart as 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.400
 Sunday is also a choice 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.520
 priority it has a hint of 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.460
 very sharp final speed the 5 facial 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.140
 is paying attention to this to this protected of 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.740
 thierry duvaldestin of origin and 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.410
 Italian this horse has potential he has 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.160
 finished third of the prize marcel laurent 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.420
 where he ended well that day behind 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.560
 victory know that he was railroaded to 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 the occasion of this outing 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.550
 this time it will be deferré of the four 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.009
 feet and this for the first time in his 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.830
 career a good number behind the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.310
 car the adriv d'enrico beloeil who 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.350
 know well 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.250
 in short the horse in my opinion has not hurt 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.660
 of assets in his game in any case he has 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.020
 been prepared accordingly for this 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.330
 race 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.940
 it's his goal in December 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.140
 the number 5 pate in the is the outsider very 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.950
 valid from this criterion 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.810
 continental 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.920
 then I will remember the 1 princess 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.869
 claw that comes to prove its shape in 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.009
 winning in Italy in a group at the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.869
 number 1 should not ask him 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.430
 problem because it knows how to start quickly and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.830
 in my opinion this filly and points that 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.050
 were the previous mentioned 3 vaniqa 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.220
 we do not present it at most 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.220
 high level she already has 11 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.840
 wins including 4 got at group level 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.180
 a bag also that she owns in 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.220
 one on 6 the best time of the peloton 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.989
 on the course that interests us so 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.250
 number 3 valves and real kadio also 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.380
 to keep in good rank 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.760
 the sis in this event his voltigeurs 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.709
 dermit I would have preferred 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.599
 if you miss a longer trip 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.460
 breath that said it's none other than the 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.380
 Devil 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.480
 winner of the last four-year criterium 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.070
 and as such he deserves credit for the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.380
 places I would be wary of the number 13 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 recent dolphin dream travels from 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.590
 mystical village in the octave price 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.090
 douesnel this horse should a new 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.590
 times traced a good end of race and he 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.900
 should be wary as the 15 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.950
 vikings duval in my opinion who is promised 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.420
 to a bright future at this level of 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.250
 competition riding hard on the effort there 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.600
 can be speeded up in 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.140
 first millimeters but if the lured 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.690
 selective 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.580
 he should be able to finish well this is a 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.740
 horse of the future that I prefer this 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.610
 however on the courses of holding 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.710
 summary figure the 2 4 5 as 3 6 13 and 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.510
 15 following the vincennes program in the 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.340
 second the 211 vikings airness me 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.960
 seems again and a train 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.340
 priority choice I had it 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.180
 indicated during his last victory on 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.010
 horse won well 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.020
 christophe hamel always present at 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.430
 well he kept one at best 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.410
 for this period 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.030
 and for this meeting the horse will be 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.800
 new barefooted four feet short 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.220
 it's in its place and logically on the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.130
 podium 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.350
 he is a serious rival for the 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.270
 new blood in this event it's 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.490
 vulcain of wendel recent fourth of 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.780
 price octave douesnel a group 2 the 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.730
 horse is not immune to a 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.980
 incartade but he is late in winning 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.540
 the 208 royal val which remains on two 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.630
 2nd places at this level can complete 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.950
 the podium 211 200 9 208 in the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.810
 third the price emile riotteau a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.790
 group of we will meet again starting on 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.230
 310 vision at age it comes to prevail 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.460
 this level again she 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.590
 looks like the mare to beat 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.870
 I will not ask 308 valls castellet a 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.280
 redeemed she has just been disqualified 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.900
 but it is much better than that 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.180
 she is formidable when she evolves 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.790
 barefoot better therefore placed in 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.230
 good rank in the seventh game that's 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.970
 that he says the beak esteem a lot the blood 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.980
 nine to delio jocelyn on horseback he 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.780
 preserve on horseback who keeps him 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.670
 horse stays on a success nothing 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 opposes a confirmation however one 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.750
 will oppose him two more cider the 713 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.820
 Harlequins at fault for his return 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.440
 most recently my luc raise tension 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.330
 always said well this horse 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.620
 quality that he has preserved the horse 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.860
 deserves to be redeemed he can 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.289
 have a nice rating 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.550
 whose trio do we know it 3 strong alpha which 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.990
 also remains on a disqualification 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.449
 deserves to be redeemed 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.919
 it's training 2 christian bigeon 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.259
 always formidable during the meeting 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.930
 winter race as well to vincennes 2e 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.819
 3rd and 7th words also on the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.819
 meeting ii at rouen mauquenchy in the 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.800
 5th homeland corriere confident that 518 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.270
 very old barbes the horse stays on 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.860
 a good second place in laval 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.180
 he will try to confirm the favor of 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.680
 this good commitment to the earnings cap 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.870
 he is in any case a rival 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.189
 serious for the 515 tina pretty which 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.039
 proved it was competitive at this 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:08.229
 level it smells 18 515 in meeting 2 to 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.199
 Rouen still wheeled honda 6th 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.909
 attention 602 adios amigo I could see 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.439
 his last victory at mons and a cap 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:16.659
 held with great ease 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.529
 the horse here starts on our soil with 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.990
 strong claims 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.250
 he won at gaza needed the right he 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.659
 won to mons on the left 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.240
 in short no problem at that level a son 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.009
 denard of beval which in my opinion is announced 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.840
 formidable on the occasion of his debut 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.340
 on our floor 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.870
 pay attention to him who already counts four 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:33.789
 victories in six public outings 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.250
 a priori a horse late in earnings the 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.440
 602 adios amigo little favorite for 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.479
