are fantastic little tools and it's
really<00:00:23.609> hard<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> find<00:00:24.060> something<00:00:24.240> as<00:00:24.810> strong

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really hard to find something as strong

really hard to find something as strong
as<00:00:25.500> this<00:00:26.460> for<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> solution<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.480> we'll<00:00:27.630> talk

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
as this for a solution that we'll talk

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.099 
as this for a solution that we'll talk
about<00:00:27.990> today<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.300> cages<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.779> love

camera<00:00:36.570> which<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.960> very<00:00:37.020> affordable<00:00:37.640> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
camera which is very affordable the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
camera which is very affordable the
problem<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.120> though<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.629> want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.140> get

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
problem is though we want to get

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.170 
problem is though we want to get
accessories<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.340> this<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:41.910> we<00:00:42.030> can

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
accessories on this thing which we can

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.030 
accessories on this thing which we can
do<00:00:42.300> with<00:00:42.450> monitor<00:00:42.840> arms<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.260> whatnot<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.829> as

some<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.700> I'm<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.149> into<00:00:45.690> using

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
some of you know I'm really into using

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.430 
some of you know I'm really into using
15<00:00:46.710> millimeter<00:00:47.100> rods<00:00:47.899> horizontally<00:00:48.899> or

mounting monitors EVS and things like
that<00:00:55.160> this<00:00:56.160> can<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.460> tricky<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.969> I've<00:00:57.239> done

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that this can be tricky to do I've done

together with various parts but camera
has<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> great<00:01:02.219> solution<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.570> really

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
has a great solution and it's really

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.020 
has a great solution and it's really
simple<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> essentially<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.700> tiny

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
simple it's essentially a little tiny

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.380 
simple it's essentially a little tiny
cheese<00:01:06.360> plate<00:01:06.630> with<00:01:07.500> quarter<00:01:08.430> 20s<00:01:08.850> tapped<00:01:09.180> in

cheese plate with quarter 20s tapped in

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.359 
cheese plate with quarter 20s tapped in
as<00:01:09.659> well<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.290> standard<00:01:11.159> quarter<00:01:11.549> 20<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.060> 3/8

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
as well as standard quarter 20 and 3/8

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
as well as standard quarter 20 and 3/8
screws<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> use<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.450> attach<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
screws that you can use to attach to

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
screws that you can use to attach to
anything<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.820> you're<00:01:17.970> given<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.450> 15

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
anything and then you're given a 15

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.219 
anything and then you're given a 15
millimeter<00:01:19.140> rod<00:01:19.500> female<00:01:20.689> section<00:01:21.689> here<00:01:21.930> with

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
millimeter rod female section here with

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.850 
millimeter rod female section here with
a<00:01:22.530> tightening<00:01:23.369> thumb<00:01:23.700> screw<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> see

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a tightening thumb screw so you can see

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.560 
a tightening thumb screw so you can see
I<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.159> right<00:01:26.490> here<00:01:26.549> on<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.270> particular

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
I have one right here on this particular

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990 
I have one right here on this particular
setup<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.799> from<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> can<00:01:29.549> mount<00:01:29.850> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
setup and from here I can mount a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.690 
setup and from here I can mount a
monitor<00:01:30.450> right<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.549> just

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
monitor right up there and so it's just

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
monitor right up there and so it's just
coming<00:01:32.880> right<00:01:33.000> off<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.390> page<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.320> can

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
coming right off the page and I can

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.039 
coming right off the page and I can
throw<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.799> 15<00:01:35.189> millimeter<00:01:35.490> rod<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.540> it

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
throw out a 15 millimeter rod so it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.960 
throw out a 15 millimeter rod so it
comes<00:01:37.229> with<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> kit<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:37.979> two<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.280> these<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
comes with a kit you get two of these so

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
comes with a kit you get two of these so
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> different<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.650> setup<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:41.040> have

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
this is a different kind of setup I have

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
this is a different kind of setup I have
here<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.479> could<00:01:42.659> do<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.200> also

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
here but what you could do and it also

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
here but what you could do and it also
comes<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.860> 15<00:01:44.070> millimeter<00:01:44.399> rod<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:44.880> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
comes with a 15 millimeter rod which is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.810 
comes with a 15 millimeter rod which is
awesome<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.110> could<00:01:46.320> use<00:01:46.470> one<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.369> attach<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
awesome you could use one to attach the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
awesome you could use one to attach the
15<00:01:48.149> millimeter<00:01:48.329> rod<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.960> cage<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.619> maybe

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
15 millimeter rod to a cage so maybe

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.330 
15 millimeter rod to a cage so maybe
something<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.189> could

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
something like that and then you could

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.999 
something like that and then you could
use<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> second<00:01:54.210> one<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:55.259> comes<00:01:55.500> with<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> kit

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
use a second one that comes with the kit

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.569 
use a second one that comes with the kit
to<00:01:56.250> attach<00:01:56.790> your<00:01:57.090> monitor<00:01:57.649> an<00:01:58.649> h4<00:01:59.040> ran<00:01:59.280> or

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
to attach your monitor an h4 ran or

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.219 
to attach your monitor an h4 ran or
anything<00:01:59.790> like<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.090> so<00:02:00.450> they've<00:02:00.930> made<00:02:01.140> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
anything like that so they've made it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.859 
anything like that so they've made it
really<00:02:01.500> flexible<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> can<00:02:03.390> really<00:02:03.600> add

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
really flexible so you can really add

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.660

a shoulder rig what I've done is I have
one<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.540> plates<00:02:14.930> right<00:02:15.620> onto<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.190> cage<00:02:16.400> I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
one of the plates right onto the cage I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.060 
one of the plates right onto the cage I
have<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.480> included<00:02:18.200> 15<00:02:18.500> millimeter<00:02:18.860> rod

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
have the included 15 millimeter rod

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.490 
have the included 15 millimeter rod
attached<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:20.780> another<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.380> of

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
attached to that and then another one of

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.990 
attached to that and then another one of
the<00:02:21.590> plates<00:02:21.860> off<00:02:22.070> to<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.460> side<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the plates off to the side with a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.690 
the plates off to the side with a
monitor<00:02:23.480> arm<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.950> gives<00:02:25.310> me<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.460> lot<00:02:25.640> of

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
monitor arm and this gives me a lot of

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.520 
monitor arm and this gives me a lot of
flexibility<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:26.600> here<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.170> have<00:02:27.410> a

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
flexibility so here I just have a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.500 
flexibility so here I just have a
standard<00:02:27.950> shoulder<00:02:28.280> mount<00:02:28.490> Bob<00:02:29.120> Loblaw<00:02:29.300> I'm

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
standard shoulder mount Bob Loblaw I'm

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.940 
standard shoulder mount Bob Loblaw I'm
shooting<00:02:29.870> I'm<00:02:29.960> shooting<00:02:30.350> if<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.590> need<00:02:30.740> to<00:02:30.860> go

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
shooting I'm shooting if I need to go

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.720 
shooting I'm shooting if I need to go
into<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.250> low<00:02:31.490> mode<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.000> have<00:02:32.960> the<00:02:33.350> second<00:02:34.070> Pico

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
into a low mode I have the second Pico

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.080 
into a low mode I have the second Pico
plate<00:02:35.300> set<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.380> it's<00:02:36.560> still<00:02:37.040> flexible<00:02:37.700> enough

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
plate set so it's still flexible enough

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.390 
plate set so it's still flexible enough
where<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.390> can<00:02:38.540> move<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.810> around<00:02:39.070> but<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.250> not

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
where I can move it around but it's not

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.920 
where I can move it around but it's not
going<00:02:40.550> to<00:02:40.640> flop<00:02:41.210> around<00:02:41.240> it<00:02:41.660> will<00:02:41.750> stay

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
going to flop around it will stay

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.390 
going to flop around it will stay
wherever<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.350> lives<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.740> could<00:02:42.890> drop<00:02:43.040> it<00:02:43.220> down

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
wherever it lives I could drop it down

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.760 
wherever it lives I could drop it down
do<00:02:44.360> something<00:02:44.660> like<00:02:44.780> this<00:02:44.990> get<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.260> nice<00:02:45.440> you

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
do something like this get a nice you

do something like this get a nice you
know<00:02:45.800> low<00:02:46.160> shot<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.760> then<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.360> second<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.660> need

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
know low shot and then the second I need

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960 
know low shot and then the second I need
to<00:02:47.900> go<00:02:48.050> back<00:02:48.230> to<00:02:48.290> shoulder<00:02:49.130> mounted<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.700> just

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
to go back to shoulder mounted I just

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.780 
to go back to shoulder mounted I just
flip<00:02:50.180> it<00:02:50.270> up<00:02:50.500> and<00:02:51.500> we're<00:02:51.740> back<00:02:51.920> into<00:02:52.250> a
