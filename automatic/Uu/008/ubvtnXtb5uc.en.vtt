00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
see we found one two three four five six

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.429

buildings<00:01:15.710> for<00:01:16.710> our<00:01:17.070> yet<00:01:17.400> unknown<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.320> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
buildings for our yet unknown and as you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.580 
buildings for our yet unknown and as you
can<00:01:19.590> see<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:20.070> got<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.670> pretty<00:01:20.970> good<00:01:21.560> over<00:01:22.560> here

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
can see we got up pretty good over here

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.649 
can see we got up pretty good over here
but<00:01:23.070> these<00:01:23.640> zones<00:01:23.909> are<00:01:24.150> going<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.330> be<00:01:24.420> really

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
but these zones are going to be really

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
but these zones are going to be really
tough<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:26.189> visit<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.670> they're<00:01:26.880> more

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
tough to to visit because they're more

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.039 
tough to to visit because they're more
than<00:01:27.240> 9ap<00:01:27.630> away<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.500> hopefully<00:01:29.869> there's<00:01:30.869> not

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
than 9ap away so hopefully there's not

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.100 
than 9ap away so hopefully there's not
too<00:01:31.200> many<00:01:31.290> buildings<00:01:31.680> out<00:01:31.890> there<00:01:32.100> although

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
too many buildings out there although

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.660 
too many buildings out there although
really<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.890> could<00:01:35.310> only<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.579> one

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
really I think there could only be one

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
really I think there could only be one
down<00:01:36.000> here<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.420> maybe<00:01:36.570> possibly<00:01:37.079> up<00:01:37.259> here<00:01:39.530> for

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530
