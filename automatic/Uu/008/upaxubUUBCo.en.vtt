00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.110
 Well, everyone called me Rami and welcome 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.480
 to another video this time I bring you a video 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.059
 where will I talk to you about the dlc that have 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.679
 taken out very little exactly the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:16.590
 last Friday 29th and basically it's 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 a dlc where it brings us a new way of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.210
 game here his guardian called execution 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.010
 although I tell you that this mode was already 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.900
 ongoing war 3 and it seems that they have 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.720
 decided to put it also in gears 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 equality men and on the other hand brings us a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 new map that is exactly the one that 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 you are watching on your screen 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.690
 llama hey come or shelter in Spanish and 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.969
 I sincerely like it a lot, I do not say 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.309
 that is the one that I like the most 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.129
 the 5 maps there are but I like it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.800
 quite basically by the fact that 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.829
 there are not as many decimals of height as 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.989
 You see is also quite big but 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.159
 I tell you that I like it basically 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 because there are not so many differences of 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.859
 height and in the other maps yes that the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 there's like gondola library platform and 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.999
 streets yes there are enough 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.190
 height differences and me 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.230
 personally I do not like it 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.400
 I do not like height differences 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.540
 Well, because it's so crazy, I think 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.640
 because enemies can come to you from 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.520
 many sites or if you're chasing 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.160
 an enemy because you can run away very 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.870
 easily here, what I did was 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.640
 flee because I had no bullets left 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.950
 I had 5 but with 5 I was not going to kill the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.680
 two so I picked up ammo and went to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 it and honestly what he said is of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.360
 that this map seems pretty good to me 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 also for artistic I really like the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.920
 snow and the effect there and I do not know for 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.280
 me this map is one of the best that 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 there is at the moment and nothing we will see now 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 a little about the gameplay 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 execution as I said at the beginning 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.060
 of the video this game play mode 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.890
 was already in gears of war 3 and now they have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.729
 decided to put it in gears of war diament 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.520
 and in my opinion I expected something more 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.160
 This game mode to see is not the 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.430
 game mode is badly done or not mole 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.620
 but I think that the five maps that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.090
 there is increase in a god or guard men 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.790
 Well, no 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.430
 they are well made to play for real 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.170
 to mount execution or good maybe in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 this map yes because there are not so many 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 height differences but others 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.660
 library maps gondola platform and 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.299
 streets I think it's not right 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.780
 made to play with execution since 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.209
 the maps are very large and also 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.160
 you have a lot of altitude difference and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.040
 then on top of that I have gotten myself into 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.260
 some games where only one 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.329
 my ally was alive against two or 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.670
 three enemies and what my ally was doing 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.640
 it was to stay still in a corner 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.530
 in a corner of the map and both my team 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.290
 like me, we have had to 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.060
 wait until the time is over or 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.400
 that they found my ally and what 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
 killed and the truth is that that is 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.890
 a great waste of time and I think 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.170
 really that's the main reason 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.299
 why many players do not 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.150
 you end up liking this way or that you 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.069
 it seems boring to say that in this 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.780
 Game mode can not be equipped 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.910
 initially the grenades of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.420
 fragmentation ink grenades and 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.340
 grenades 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260
 stimulating the smoke grenades and 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.000
 grenade locator so you can 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.190
 to say that this does seem to me 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.080
 correct since if everyone has 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.090
 we make a fragmentation grenade or 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.849
 ink grenade or stimulant pomegranate 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.220
 Well, it would be too slow because they are 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.720
 too good in my opinion I think 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.630
 that should not exist in any 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.790
 game mode as an initial grenade and 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.510
 here good you are going to see that yes there is 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.730
 dejection executions or human shield 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.220
 Well, yes, there is basically 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.680
 same gameplay execution that gears 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.720
 of war 3 another thing that has made me realize 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.970
 in this one of game with respect to the 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.670
 other duel by teams all when 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.120
 all and domain and that is in this mode of 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.780
 game well there is quite the lancer hammer 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.330
 max retro retro in short is rifles for 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.060
 attack in long distance and that's 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.920
 basically because I guess the 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.830
 people will not want to die when they do not see respawn 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.530
 Well, you do not want to die so fast and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.989
 that will not catch us to be in this 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.270
 gameplay you see that almost everyone go 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.639
 to be good like arms d 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.430
 but that does not use hauls or marsans and 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.039
 this kind of weapons well that's the truth 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.330
 I was lucky because I told you 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:33.400
 previously and yes I played several 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.909
 running games and yes that people 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.949
 used rifles but of course this is 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.080
 same as what I said before about 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:42.639
 that some people stayed when 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.280
 were the last ones were staying in a 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.949
 corner of the map and there they stayed until 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.590
 who spent time or who found him 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.870
 in the enemies but I already tell you that is 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.090
 that depends a lot on people in some 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.220
 parties you will meet with people 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.470
 that only uses the nasser in other 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.620
 games you will find people who use 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.180
 only the lancers rifles and that's that already 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.220
 I have told you that it depends a lot on the 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.560
 people and there we can not do anything 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.770
 we can not force people to play 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.659
 as we obviously want 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.090
 fix here for example the good people 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.590
 that it was my turn that even no less robbery 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.080
 he stood there waiting for him to get up 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:24.069
 but not rob me hope there until 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.050
 I killed him and good to tell you that in the mode 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.639
 execution on some maps like 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.590
 library 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.020
 boomers have been removed sincerely 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.210
 I do not know why it must have been for 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.460
 the same reason why they have removed 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.110
 of pomegranate 'initial the pomegranate 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.300
 fragmentation the ink and the 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.810
 stimulating because they are weapons 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.419
 too good 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:49.230
 and honestly I do not know how to take this 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.510
 well because the grenades look because they are 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.440
 pretty good and on top of initial weapon 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.900
 Fuck but the boom is that it's a 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.960
 weapon collected on the map I do not know I do not know 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.200
 how to take that on the gondola maps 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:08.040
 platform and streets I do not know if there will be 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.080
 removed some more weapon I do not know and by 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.940
 last to tell you that when you do 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.580
 a clutch is to say when you are 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.650
 you alone in the team because all 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.830
 your allies have died and you get 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.930
 kill three or more than three enemies because 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.210
 in giza wat 3 they gave you a badge 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.450
 when you did it was lucky it was called 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.729
 in Spanish and English class and here in 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:31.650
 yemen I have done several classes but not 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:32.969
 they have given me no insignia and they have not 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.639
 given nothing 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:38.069
 and finally, in my opinion, the execution is 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.439
 a great game mode the only thing that I think 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.389
 that the guardian course maps do not 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:44.699
 they are well made to play 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.049
 really how do you have to play like that 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:48.059
 good, nothing, I hope that I have 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:52.339
 liked commenting what do you think this way 

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:52.339
 of game and see you in another video
