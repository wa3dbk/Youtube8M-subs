went over a few things again we'll go

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.179 
went over a few things again we'll go
over<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> unibody<00:00:27.930> design<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:29.039> made

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
over it's got a unibody design it's made

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.550 
over it's got a unibody design it's made
of<00:00:29.340> aluminum<00:00:29.849> it's<00:00:30.060> very<00:00:30.300> light<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.410> an

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
of aluminum it's very light it has an

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.130 
of aluminum it's very light it has an
SSD<00:00:32.099> drive<00:00:32.369> built<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.630> unit<00:00:33.930> instead

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
SSD drive built in to the unit instead

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
SSD drive built in to the unit instead
of<00:00:34.260> having<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.559> standard<00:00:34.890> hard<00:00:35.040> drive<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.940> this

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
of having a standard hard drive so this

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.549 
of having a standard hard drive so this
may<00:00:36.360> make<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.570> seem<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.110> fast<00:00:37.410> because

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
may make it seem very fast because

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.290 
may make it seem very fast because
you'll<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.890> able<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.040> access<00:00:38.399> programs<00:00:38.879> faster

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
you'll be able to access programs faster

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.780 
you'll be able to access programs faster
using<00:00:39.420> an<00:00:39.660> SSD<00:00:40.170> Drive<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:41.070> for<00:00:41.340> gaming<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.670> is

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
Jack ok so here we're going to take a

look at the benchmarks from just the

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.720 
look at the benchmarks from just the
performance<00:02:22.320> scores<00:02:22.710> as<00:02:22.890> numbers<00:02:23.220> go<00:02:23.460> it's

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
performance scores as numbers go it's

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.080 
performance scores as numbers go it's
not<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.120> fast<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.230> macbook<00:02:25.740> pro<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
not as fast as the macbook pro but it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.180 
not as fast as the macbook pro but it
will<00:02:27.390> seem<00:02:27.720> faster<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> lot<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.620> people<00:02:28.770> do<00:02:29.100> to

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
will seem faster a lot of people do to

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.580 
will seem faster a lot of people do to
the<00:02:29.310> SSD<00:02:29.850> RAM<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.900> fact<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.380> has<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
the SSD RAM and the fact that it has the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.340 
the SSD RAM and the fact that it has the
SSD<00:02:32.340> when<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:32.940> play<00:02:33.150> games<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> stuff<00:02:33.870> this

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
SSD when you play games and stuff this

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.140 
SSD when you play games and stuff this
is<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.770> pretty<00:02:35.040> fast<00:02:35.370> machine<00:02:35.640> so

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
is going to be a pretty fast machine so

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.150 
is going to be a pretty fast machine so
don't<00:02:36.750> really<00:02:36.960> take<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.410> these<00:02:37.590> scores<00:02:37.890> as

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
don't really take all these scores as

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.620 
don't really take all these scores as
your<00:02:38.370> final<00:02:38.670> decision<00:02:38.790> point<00:02:39.300> because

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
your final decision point because

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.450 
your final decision point because
actually<00:02:40.020> are<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.380> on<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.220> would<00:02:41.340> call

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
actually are just on what I would call

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220 
actually are just on what I would call
the<00:02:41.610> usage<00:02:41.940> test<00:02:42.240> playing<00:02:42.660> games<00:02:42.930> actually

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
the usage test playing games actually

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.770 
the usage test playing games actually
works<00:02:43.710> really<00:02:43.830> good<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.150> numbers<00:02:45.540> don't

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
works really good so the numbers don't

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.300 
works really good so the numbers don't
count<00:02:46.080> them<00:02:46.260> all<00:02:46.380> into<00:02:46.680> your<00:02:46.980> equation

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
count them all into your equation

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.190 
count them all into your equation
because<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.240> thing<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.630> does<00:02:48.750> run<00:02:49.170> pretty

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
because the thing really does run pretty

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.370 
because the thing really does run pretty
well<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.460> we've<00:02:50.730> seen<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.000> specifications

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
well so we've seen the specifications

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.050 
well so we've seen the specifications
we've<00:02:52.380> seen<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> scores<00:02:53.040> we've<00:02:53.700> talked<00:02:53.940> about

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
we've seen the scores we've talked about

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.690 
we've seen the scores we've talked about
the<00:02:54.390> features<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.620> what<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:56.130> really<00:02:56.370> thing

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
the features so what this really thing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.470 
the features so what this really thing
is<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:58.140> an<00:02:58.320> over-the-top

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
is is it's really an over-the-top

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.030 
is is it's really an over-the-top
netbook<00:03:00.480> because<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.470> thing<00:03:01.710> is<00:03:01.920> just

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
netbook because this thing is just

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.790 
netbook because this thing is just
really<00:03:02.910> lightweight<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.200> thousand

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
really like introductory kind of gaming

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.750 
really like introductory kind of gaming
