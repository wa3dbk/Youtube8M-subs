now<00:00:47.820> when<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.540> compressor<00:00:49.020> gets<00:00:49.470> up<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.190> speed

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
now when the compressor gets up to speed

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.960 
now when the compressor gets up to speed
then<00:00:50.880> I'll<00:00:51.750> mix<00:00:51.900> it<00:00:52.140> clear<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.550> then<00:00:53.760> we'll

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
then I'll mix it clear and then we'll

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.380 
then I'll mix it clear and then we'll
start<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> three-part<00:00:55.880> 15<00:00:56.880> minutes<00:00:57.270> between

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
will use mine Stringer's and I will

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.810 
will use mine Stringer's and I will
strain<00:02:16.670> 130<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.880> clear<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> clear<00:02:20.280> coat<00:02:20.550> right

here<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:22.640> then<00:02:23.640> 33<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.690> this<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:26.450> 33<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
here and then 33 of this and 33 of this

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.550 
here and then 33 of this and 33 of this
hardener<00:02:29.390> then<00:02:30.390> I'll<00:02:30.540> put<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.810> in<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.930> gun<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
hardener then I'll put it in the gun and

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.640 
hardener then I'll put it in the gun and
I'll<00:02:31.860> mix<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.370> really<00:02:33.209> well<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:34.140> we'll

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I'll mix it up really well then we'll

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.040 
I'll mix it up really well then we'll
shoot<00:02:34.830> our<00:02:34.980> pattern<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.780> we'll<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.900> our

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
shoot our pattern and we'll get our

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.620 
shoot our pattern and we'll get our
pattern<00:02:37.440> right<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.060> I'll<00:02:39.060> show<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.300> how<00:02:39.510> to

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
pattern right and I'll show you how to

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.410 
pattern right and I'll show you how to
make<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> pattern<00:02:40.250> using<00:02:41.250> them<00:02:41.489> well<00:02:42.120> I'm<00:02:42.300> just

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
make a pattern using them well I'm just

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.120 
make a pattern using them well I'm just
gonna<00:02:42.630> show<00:02:42.810> you'd<00:02:42.959> like<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.770> just<00:02:44.010> an

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
gonna show you'd like it like just an

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.370 
gonna show you'd like it like just an
autobody<00:02:44.640> guy<00:02:44.820> would<00:02:45.030> do<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> just

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
autobody guy would do it just

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.729 
autobody guy would do it just
that's<00:02:46.680> where<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:46.860> am<00:02:47.070> all<00:02:47.760> right

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
that's where I am all right

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.930 
that's where I am all right
okay<00:02:49.739> I'll<00:02:49.920> set<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:52.250> pattern<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.820 

and<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.540> as<00:02:56.720> we're<00:02:56.900> taking<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.380> step<00:02:57.620> by

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
and now as we're taking this step by

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.820 
and now as we're taking this step by
step<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:59.090> is<00:02:59.300> what<00:02:59.480> your<00:02:59.660> real<00:02:59.810> clear<00:03:00.170> looks

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
step this is what your real clear looks

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.180 
step this is what your real clear looks
like<00:03:01.420> this<00:03:02.420> is<00:03:02.540> what<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.870> costs<00:03:03.530> 40<00:03:03.860> bucks<00:03:04.070> a

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
like this is what it costs 40 bucks a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.210 
like this is what it costs 40 bucks a
quart<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.820> there's<00:03:05.270> some<00:03:05.570> that<00:03:05.780> are<00:03:06.190> 70<00:03:07.190> or

clean this out here is our here's the

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.030 
clean this out here is our here's the
holes<00:07:03.730> I<00:07:04.030> talked<00:07:04.270> about<00:07:04.360> right<00:07:04.690> here<00:07:04.950> when<00:07:05.950> you

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
holes I talked about right here when you

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
holes I talked about right here when you
put<00:07:06.310> this<00:07:07.180> back<00:07:07.870> on<00:07:08.140> right<00:07:08.830> here<00:07:09.160> and<00:07:09.370> you<00:07:09.940> go

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.060 
put this back on right here and you go

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.730 
put this back on right here and you go
to<00:07:10.090> tap<00:07:10.390> it<00:07:10.540> down<00:07:10.720> there<00:07:11.200> won't<00:07:11.350> be<00:07:11.440> a<00:07:11.500> lot<00:07:11.710> of

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
to tap it down there won't be a lot of

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.310 
to tap it down there won't be a lot of
spurge<00:07:12.730> underneath<00:07:13.420> this<00:07:13.570> cap<00:07:13.870> that's<00:07:14.140> going

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320 
spurge underneath this cap that's going

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.590 
spurge underneath this cap that's going
to<00:07:14.410> blow<00:07:14.590> everywhere<00:07:15.130> onto<00:07:16.090> everything<00:07:16.480> you

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
to blow everywhere onto everything you

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.470 
to blow everywhere onto everything you
don't<00:07:16.750> want<00:07:16.990> it<00:07:17.050> to<00:07:17.140> blow<00:07:17.350> it<00:07:18.180> all<00:07:19.180> right<00:07:19.330> the

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:19.480 
don't want it to blow it all right the

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
don't want it to blow it all right the
next<00:07:19.630> step<00:07:19.780> is<00:07:22.620> setting<00:07:23.620> the<00:07:23.800> gun<00:07:23.980> up<00:07:24.100> for

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 
next step is setting the gun up for

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.830 
next step is setting the gun up for
spray<00:07:26.500> pattern
