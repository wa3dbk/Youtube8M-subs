quick<00:01:06.820> stops<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.780> there<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.740> when<00:01:09.040> you

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
quick stops on there so that when you

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.580 
quick stops on there so that when you
come<00:01:09.370> down<00:01:09.610> you<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.450> will<00:01:10.600> hit<00:01:10.840> right<00:01:11.229> here

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
come down you you will hit right here

because these chips can really fly let's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.630 
because these chips can really fly let's
take<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.480> trial<00:01:22.840> cut<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.410> see<00:01:23.650> what<00:01:23.920> your<00:01:24.160> speed

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
take a trial cut and see what your speed

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.430 
take a trial cut and see what your speed
is<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.090> if<00:01:25.180> there's<00:01:25.360> any<00:01:25.480> vibration<00:01:26.170> if<00:01:26.290> it

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
is and if there's any vibration if it

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.440 
is and if there's any vibration if it
vibrates<00:01:26.650> again<00:01:27.250> slow<00:01:27.610> it<00:01:27.790> down<00:01:27.820> I'm<00:01:28.360> on<00:01:29.010> this

turn<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.079> machine<00:03:08.409> on<00:03:08.439> and<00:03:08.920> here<00:03:09.819> we<00:03:09.939> go<00:03:10.090> for

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
turn the machine on and here we go for

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:18.120 
turn the machine on and here we go for
our<00:03:10.389> first<00:03:10.840> pass

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.850 

you<00:03:18.610> can<00:03:18.790> see<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.120> chips<00:03:19.390> flying<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.170> is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
you can see the chips flying and just is

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.620 
you can see the chips flying and just is
a<00:03:20.920> roughing<00:03:21.490> cuts<00:03:21.730> here<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.180> we're<00:03:22.330> not<00:03:22.420> too

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
a roughing cuts here so we're not too

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.900 
a roughing cuts here so we're not too
concerned<00:03:23.050> about<00:03:23.170> the<00:03:23.500> finish<00:03:24.370> yet<00:03:24.610> but<00:03:24.820> you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
concerned about the finish yet but you

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.640 
concerned about the finish yet but you
can<00:03:25.030> see<00:03:25.240> most<00:03:25.480> of<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:25.750> chips<00:03:26.020> are<00:03:26.230> coming<00:03:26.350> out

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
can see most of the chips are coming out

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.190 
can see most of the chips are coming out
at<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.830> bottom

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.280 

I<00:03:31.260> know<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> can't<00:03:32.220> see<00:03:32.459> into<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.790> board

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
I know you can't see into the board

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:45.650 
I know you can't see into the board
I'll<00:03:34.530> back<00:03:34.800> this<00:03:35.040> out<00:03:36.950> turn<00:03:37.950> off<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.370> spindle

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:51.320 

and<00:03:45.960> feed<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.380> in<00:03:46.530> about<00:03:46.980> 10,000<00:03:50.090> take<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
and feed it in about 10,000 take that

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.010 
and feed it in about 10,000 take that
chip<00:03:51.990> off<00:03:52.200> in<00:03:52.440> there<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:53.120> will<00:03:54.120> take<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.600> reading

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
chip off in there I will take a reading

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:10.140 
chip off in there I will take a reading
here<00:03:55.790> telescope<00:03:56.790> engage

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.789 

and<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.780> still<00:04:10.989> have<00:04:11.200> over<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> hundred

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
and we still have over a hundred

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.039 
and we still have over a hundred
thousands<00:04:12.519> to<00:04:12.640> go<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:13.000> we<00:04:13.120> got<00:04:13.269> I'm<00:04:13.599> not<00:04:13.840> going

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
thousands to go so we got I'm not going

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.330 
thousands to go so we got I'm not going
to<00:04:14.140> take<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.470> all<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.590> way<00:04:14.739> because<00:04:15.220> this

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
to take it all the way because this

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.509 
to take it all the way because this
video<00:04:15.700> is<00:04:15.819> all<00:04:15.970> ready<00:04:16.650> running<00:04:17.650> much<00:04:18.100> longer

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
video is all ready running much longer

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.039 
video is all ready running much longer
than<00:04:18.639> what<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.850> wanted<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.389> to<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:19.750> I'll<00:04:19.870> take

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
than what I wanted it to but I'll take

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.110 
than what I wanted it to but I'll take
just<00:04:20.470> one<00:04:20.680> or<00:04:20.799> two<00:04:20.919> more<00:04:21.070> passes<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:21.880> get

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
just one or two more passes so you get

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.960 
just one or two more passes so you get
the<00:04:22.270> gist<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.930> thing<00:04:23.169> and<00:04:23.820> matter<00:04:24.820> of<00:04:24.880> fact

the gist of the thing and matter of fact

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.700 
the gist of the thing and matter of fact
this<00:04:25.240> next<00:04:25.570> pass<00:04:25.780> here<00:04:26.050> we'll<00:04:26.229> pretend<00:04:26.620> that

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
this next pass here we'll pretend that

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.170 
this next pass here we'll pretend that
it's<00:04:26.889> our<00:04:27.040> last<00:04:27.280> pass<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:27.880> we're<00:04:28.000> going<00:04:28.090> to

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
it's our last pass or we're going to

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:34.990 
it's our last pass or we're going to
feed<00:04:28.360> real<00:04:28.600> slow

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000 

we're<00:04:35.420> getting<00:04:35.690> a<00:04:35.750> pretty<00:04:35.870> decent<00:04:36.050> cut<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.650> can

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
we're getting a pretty decent cut I can

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.400 
we're getting a pretty decent cut I can
tell<00:04:37.220> from<00:04:37.340> where<00:04:37.550> I'm<00:04:37.880> at

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.710 

when<00:04:41.950> you<00:04:42.070> get<00:04:42.190> down<00:04:42.370> to<00:04:42.430> your<00:04:42.670> last<00:04:43.000> passes

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
when you get down to your last passes

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.660 
when you get down to your last passes
your<00:04:43.930> final<00:04:44.320> passage<00:04:44.770> just<00:04:44.920> take<00:04:45.130> off<00:04:45.340> two<00:04:45.580> or

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
your final passage just take off two or

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.910 
your final passage just take off two or
three<00:04:45.880> thousands<00:04:46.420> and<00:04:46.570> keep<00:04:46.750> stopping<00:04:47.530> and

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
three thousands and keep stopping and

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.940 
three thousands and keep stopping and
checking<00:04:48.250> your<00:04:49.260> dimension<00:04:50.260> so<00:04:50.470> you<00:04:50.530> don't<00:04:50.800> go

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
checking your dimension so you don't go

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.850 
checking your dimension so you don't go
over<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:52.630> easy<00:04:52.810> to<00:04:52.990> take<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.350> chips<00:04:53.590> off

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
over it's easy to take the chips off

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.750 
over it's easy to take the chips off
that's<00:04:54.190> mighty<00:04:54.580> hard<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.060> put<00:04:55.240> them<00:04:55.360> back<00:04:55.510> on

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
that's mighty hard to put them back on

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.510 
that's mighty hard to put them back on
you<00:04:57.760> don't<00:04:57.940> want<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.150> spoil<00:04:58.420> your<00:04:58.690> work<00:04:59.520> and

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
you don't want to spoil your work and

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.830 
you don't want to spoil your work and
then<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.850> course<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.270> would<00:05:01.420> take<00:05:01.600> another

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
then of course I would take another

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.400 
then of course I would take another
reading<00:05:03.180> with<00:05:04.180> micrometer<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.200> gauge

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
reading with micrometer and the gauge

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.920 
reading with micrometer and the gauge
and<00:05:05.880> determine<00:05:06.880> how<00:05:07.000> much<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.330> had<00:05:07.510> to<00:05:07.630> turn<00:05:07.780> it

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
and determine how much I had to turn it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.500 
and determine how much I had to turn it
in<00:05:08.080> when<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.680> finally<00:05:08.950> got<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.430> the<00:05:09.910> final<00:05:10.240> cuts

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
in when I finally got to the final cuts

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:15.240 
in when I finally got to the final cuts
and<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.940> is<00:05:13.180> how<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.420> bore<00:05:13.900> on<00:05:14.560> the<00:05:14.950> milling

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
and that is how you bore on the milling

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.110 
and that is how you bore on the milling
machine<00:05:16.530> this<00:05:17.530> may<00:05:17.830> have<00:05:18.100> to<00:05:18.310> be<00:05:18.400> divided<00:05:18.970> into

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
machine this may have to be divided into

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.430 
machine this may have to be divided into
a<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:20.490> couple<00:05:21.490> different<00:05:21.880> videos<00:05:22.840> here<00:05:23.140> I'm<00:05:23.290> not

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
a a couple different videos here I'm not

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.230 
a a couple different videos here I'm not
sure<00:05:23.700> before<00:05:24.700> I<00:05:24.940> get<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.660> the<00:05:26.140> one<00:05:26.320> on

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
sure before I get to the the one on

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.430 
sure before I get to the the one on
drilling<00:05:28.240> the<00:05:28.450> holes<00:05:28.660> be<00:05:28.960> sure<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.260> watch

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
drilling the holes be sure and watch

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.380 
drilling the holes be sure and watch
that<00:05:29.710> one<00:05:29.920> too<00:05:29.950> and<00:05:30.520> go<00:05:30.700> back<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.090> watch<00:05:31.210> the

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
that one too and go back and watch the

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.360 
that one too and go back and watch the
other<00:05:31.420> video<00:05:31.900> if<00:05:32.320> you<00:05:32.440> haven't<00:05:32.680> watched<00:05:33.100> it

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
other video if you haven't watched it

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.180 
other video if you haven't watched it
already<00:05:33.550> hope<00:05:34.270> this<00:05:34.510> helps<00:05:34.870> you<00:05:35.040> when<00:05:36.040> you
