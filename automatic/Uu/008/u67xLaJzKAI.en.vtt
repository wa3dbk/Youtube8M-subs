00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
better in my opinion

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.040 
better in my opinion
without<00:05:25.310> the<00:05:25.700> tongue<00:05:26.920> showing<00:05:27.920> of<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.340> jeans

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
like this but I just think that's a

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:44.230 
like this but I just think that's a
little<00:05:40.370> too<00:05:40.490> flashy<00:05:40.820> for<00:05:41.210> me<00:05:41.360> so<00:05:42.110> I<00:05:42.140> just<00:05:43.240> cover

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
little too flashy for me so I just cover

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.540 
little too flashy for me so I just cover
it<00:05:44.330> up

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
