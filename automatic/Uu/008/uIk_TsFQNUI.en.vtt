00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
in this case I cut out two star shapes

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.509 
in this case I cut out two star shapes
one<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.349> a<00:03:42.379> little<00:03:42.650> bit<00:03:42.769> bigger<00:03:42.980> than<00:03:43.370> the

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
one is a little bit bigger than the

one is a little bit bigger than the
other<00:03:43.549> one

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
other one

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.979 
other one
and<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.109> you<00:03:45.200> take<00:03:45.379> your<00:03:45.409> quilt<00:03:45.799> and

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
and then you take your quilt and

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.690 
and then you take your quilt and
randomly<00:03:48.069> this<00:03:49.069> trace<00:03:50.620> these<00:03:51.620> shapes<00:03:52.010> on<00:03:52.370> your

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
randomly this trace these shapes on your

randomly this trace these shapes on your
quilt<00:03:52.969> and<00:03:53.389> to<00:03:54.079> connect<00:03:54.469> these<00:03:54.590> shapes<00:03:55.030> you

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
quilt and to connect these shapes you

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.050 
quilt and to connect these shapes you
draw<00:03:56.389> loops<00:03:57.109> and<00:03:57.469> that<00:03:58.310> connects<00:03:58.639> them<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:58.969> it

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
draw loops and that connects them and it

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.970 
draw loops and that connects them and it
makes<00:03:59.239> a<00:03:59.329> really<00:03:59.599> cute<00:04:00.019> pattern<00:04:00.290> going<00:04:00.769> across

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
makes a really cute pattern going across

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.399 
makes a really cute pattern going across
your<00:04:01.340> quilt<00:04:01.989> and<00:04:02.989> then<00:04:04.419> you<00:04:05.419> just<00:04:05.659> saw<00:04:05.959> on<00:04:06.230> the

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
your quilt and then you just saw on the

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.599 
your quilt and then you just saw on the
line<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.139> here<00:04:09.530> again<00:04:09.799> you<00:04:10.220> don't<00:04:10.430> need

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
line and you here again you don't need

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.360 
line and you here again you don't need
to<00:04:10.730> worry<00:04:10.939> about<00:04:11.470> being<00:04:12.470> perfect<00:04:12.829> right<00:04:13.220> on

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
to worry about being perfect right on

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.439 
to worry about being perfect right on
the<00:04:13.519> line<00:04:14.590> because<00:04:15.590> that<00:04:16.130> will<00:04:16.609> just<00:04:16.639> wash<00:04:17.090> out

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
the line because that will just wash out

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.560 
the line because that will just wash out
