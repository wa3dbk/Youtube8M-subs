00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello dear friends the other day in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.830
 Our stores entered the collection 2014 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.200
 years and I purchased several sets 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.220
 Today we will consider the first 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.490
 review aboard number one is the designer 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.890
 from the lego city series 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.550
 motorcyclist and burglar 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.939
 box 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.859
 times the cost of 299 rubles 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 article 641 from 5 to 12 years 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:44.879
 well let's see what's inside 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:47.660
 open our box here with us 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.660
 such a package 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:01:00.270
 instruction standard stickers and here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.589
 such a detail 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.530
 Well, let's try to collect 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.530
 our set to begin to cut 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.510
 well let's consider our set in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:24.090
 the first is a cop notice 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.580
 his forum is a little different from 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.820
 sets of 2013 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.090
 but also the most standard helmet 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:36.020
 one-sided face arms and legs all seam 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.520
 faces and moves without much difficulty 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.840
 next is a police motorcycle in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.430
 In principle, it is similar to the previous sets. 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.780
 year 2013 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.490
 the only negative in my opinion is 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.940
 stickers have these pictures 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.650
 glue by hand although in principle 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.650
 a company could do screen printing 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.770
 paint here it would be more 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:12.170
 realistic it would serve longer but 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.840
 ordinary motorcycle handcuffs flasher 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.510
 moves here we have coasters 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 so that he does not fall this top 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:28.049
 part can be uncoupled at very large 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.570
 effort and then you will only 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:36.030
 the body further we have a robber here 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.850
 such a little man logically nothing 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 different from previous sets here 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.549
 only a little modernized itself 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.049
 clothes 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:51.299
 she's a bath and a standard two-bag 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.400
 coins well 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.049
 tool to open 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:01.709
 locks the rest everything is exactly the same as 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.250
 earlier in principle, unlike new 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.680
 There are not so many sets 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.900
 we go further but this stand is something 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.200
 like a wall through which a burglar 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.560
 jumps over and here, too, nothing 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.790
 unusual no few details all 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.400
 easy enough 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.790
 also a few more left in the set 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.930
 additional parts in reserve this here 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.430
 is rubberized 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:34.040
 wheel is another pair of headphones two 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:39.090
 Circular lights 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.099
 part of the stand and glass for the helmet in 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.180
 principle simple set 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.430
 there is nothing beyond single 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.480
 like can purchase 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.950
 Well, now I understand that it was possible and 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.959
 refrain from this purchase 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.510
 the only plus and in my opinion is 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:01.500
 I donâ€™t have such a motorcycle here and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.689
 he is useful in new filming cartoons 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.489
 so buy 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:11.579
 happened motorcycle come in handy well with you 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:14.010
 there was a channel homemade review on a new set 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.500
 from 2014 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.169
 they already have sales with you were 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.199
 Constantin homemade see you soon 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.199
 until
