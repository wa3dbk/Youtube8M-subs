 In addition, the topic would be for artists 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 You can tell us how 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.280

 What else would I have to say 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.970
 around band we are so 60fps so 60 pictures per 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 Took a second 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.570
 then TuS could 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.380
 Vander Naldo 37 pictures and a man with 16vor 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.369

 So only if it pays Bolz 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.090
 The band at Kirkland Mine would be better made up of five numbers 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.500
 Slow motion sees 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.740
 and when we 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.220
 the video material has only 30 pictures 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.280
 it does not work so well in slow motion 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.090
 as if it was just fine if we could do that 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.229
 whichever at heart 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:15.289

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.989
 then the Anklamer turn on itself comes to install Quake 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.579

 then we will continue »tender indicator TTI Soden 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.289
 here it is not similar 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:03.759

 just send us a message 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.189
 with the subject labeled Soden starting profits Kelkheims 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.029
 and then we look at that too 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:23.069
 and if it falsifies us with it too popular is crowded on it 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.569
 what I know 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.569

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:34.789
 I was force still formal McClane colleagues Zac Efron wrote the topic 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.309

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:41.309
 Per cent believe CIO's point to the community 

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.819

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.169
 free for all on HIV Aids 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:49.549

 TMP Rollig Albersloher of the price not anymore 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.179
 not seen at all 

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:56.179
 i 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:58.319
 do not look at a destroyer 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.199
 and 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.369
 there a few comments 

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:02.419
 let there 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:04.019
 and already rate 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.730
 Thanks to you for mixing topic and although Tel 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.959
 it hits the clear word 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.199
 who had that they were only just a right now clear that while in 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.759
 Black box there 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:19.339
 and then we had well you want with German manager Armin Wolf only 

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.109
 a Kramer make norm 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.419
 then they have 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.469
 canceled at short notice 

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.280
 then there are clans within men 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.620
 We also wanted to put a brace on her new novel that you could as if 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.620
 So look for his whole game in half and destroy it 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:37.349
 and otherwise from the buck I still no clothes and we wanted you there 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:38.230
 asked 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.610
 if we feel like it 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.499
 Clearly play the game and set 

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:45.869
 we play and six against six best or flowing lines 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.449
 depending on how much you should and the duration of the procedure 5 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.690
 and then we would 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.279
 we have the test of domination or 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.129
 demolition squad 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.129
 HQ clock play as a spare team games 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:04.830
 he has nothing to eat and taxes because well that is not so no for us 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.830
 we have how he plays together Mr. Schopf Dudar headquarters 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.969
 The motto is so much fun and therefore disturbing only if we are absolutely gold 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.710
 so if he wants to play with us as clearly 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.110
 then just write us a message and there and look and what I am 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.400
 then let's do it 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.710
 what is being played on the computer car picture 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.139
 namely on the old Ebinger question 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.289
 white is normal pumps 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.289
 so it's hard for us or getting six people together 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.499
 the couple were locked 

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:40.399
 and so not so close to Wolbeck as Estermann Waldsee 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.870
 we have hosted special lobbies 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:46.849
 and 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:49.659
 otherwise it was the right thing to do 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:51.809
 So rather than remember 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:56.080
 then there are quite estimates last topic and that is Facebook 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.520
 Limpächer Station Description Post with Facebook Group of the Five Bar 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.849

 Friends employees wrong word 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.960
 Naor test phases big whole 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.880
