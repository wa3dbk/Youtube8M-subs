00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello welcome to garage baker 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 my name is richard brink and this is one 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.670
 renault megane cc 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 coupÃ©-cabriolet with a dci 130 130 hp 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.210
 strong 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 gasoline turbo engine in the implementation 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.960
 dynamics 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.770
 the color of this car is now true etoile 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.770
 black metallic 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.910
 this car has fog lights for in the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.910
 bumper 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.810
 17 inch alloy wheels 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.800
 with the hood it has a glass roof 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 panel 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.239
 parking sensors at the rear 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.379
 you in the car just before the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.140
 gear shift is a button around the roof 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.450
 to make up 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 so you can from within 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.229
 electric dumbbell shape 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.630
 in this way can in a number 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.819
 seconds off the roof and with 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.359
 copies the same button of course 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:33.359
 the cars have 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.829
 here the luggage space of the car 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.830
 here is a kind of roller blind here 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.890
 must close to open the roof 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.400
 it therefore indicates how vm can load 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 if you leave the roof off and hold on 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.180
 just a roof on the car like now 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.489
 can you take it away later then you have the 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
 full luggage space at your disposal 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.750
 the one under the mat 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.750
 still quite a bit of extra storage space 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.720
 animals and step the whole backwards 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.230
 seat slides forward that comes too 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.459
 back in the old place back in 2 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.230
 seats 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.920
 two headrests and two three 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.920
 advance payment tree 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.080
 here the front seats 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.310
 both front seats 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.959
 height adjustment and they also have 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.959
 both electric seat heating 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.849
 those in the driver's door than the 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.489
 operation of all four electrical 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.110
 windows and the button our all 4 at the same time 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.390
 operate 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.880
 So another when the roof down 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:29.690
 you only have one button 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.980
 the windows down too then here the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.090
 mirror adjustment 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.700
 which can be the left or the right 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.410
 and adjust the mirror with these feet 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.640
 here the ability to adjust the mirrors 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.260
 fold in electrically when you are with 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.370
 center then it automatically goes with 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.840
 the change 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.260
 you can also do them manually electrically 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.260
 foldable 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.989
 you handle the left side of the handlebar 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.180
 the lighting that also has one 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.230
 automatic mode and that mode goes the 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.110
 lighting automatically through the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.269
 light sensor headlight height control 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.560
 controllable panel lighting running 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.750
 under traction control 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.900
 and the button under parking sensors 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.900
 switch 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.680
 here on the steering wheel the buttons of the 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:15.510
 cruise control and the speed limiter 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 this switch belongs to you 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.760
 this is true between the seats 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.900
 switch 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.940
 allows you to select whether you want the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.530
 cruise control are so with the system 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.150
 whether the speed limiter wants 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.800
 switch 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.430
 control the speed with plus y min 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.620
 off and above the speed 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.200
 You see the speed I set in this 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.610
 case as a limiter 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:41.550
 with zero switch it off and with there 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.150
 picks it up your speed that's the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.150
 memory position 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.870
 here the best is with a car with links 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.850
 at height tachometer large digital 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.580
 in the middle and on the right 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.320
 so let that now include limiter 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.580
 will also see the total mileage 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.630
 from car and there are all 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.630
 on-board computer functions too 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.530
 with these two buttons I browse 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.180
 back and forth through the on-board computer 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.660
 functions so you can use it up and down 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.660
 leaves 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.510
 this is also the operation of the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.310
 Windshield wiper from with also has one 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.690
 auto mode is erased 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.320
 automatically through the 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.470
 rain sensor starts here 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.930
 the radio controls the car kit the crow 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.710
 so operate when you use the phone 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.110
