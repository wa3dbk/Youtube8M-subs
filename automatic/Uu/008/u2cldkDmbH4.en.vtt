investigating whether there's also a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.779 
investigating whether there's also a
difference<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> sperm<00:00:23.070> swimming<00:00:23.400> speeds

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
difference in the sperm swimming speeds

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.920 
difference in the sperm swimming speeds
of<00:00:24.029> these<00:00:24.210> species

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
of these species

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.920 
of these species
she<00:00:25.769> used<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.130> laser<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.640> microscope<00:00:27.150> setup<00:00:27.390> to

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
she used a laser and microscope setup to

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.320 
she used a laser and microscope setup to
determine<00:00:28.380> how<00:00:28.590> fast<00:00:28.890> sperm<00:00:29.400> move<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.240> we

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
determine how fast sperm move so we

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
determine how fast sperm move so we
start<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.929> laser<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.650> an<00:00:31.740> infrared

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
start with this laser it's an infrared

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.490 
start with this laser it's an infrared
laser<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.700> we<00:00:32.759> can't<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> laser<00:00:33.540> beam<00:00:33.870> but

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
laser so we can't see the laser beam but

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.410 
laser so we can't see the laser beam but
it's<00:00:34.649> being<00:00:34.890> bounced<00:00:35.370> off<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.760> mirrors<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's being bounced off these mirrors and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
it's being bounced off these mirrors and
through<00:00:36.690> these<00:00:36.870> lenses<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
through these lenses and actually is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
through these lenses and actually is
coupled<00:00:38.940> into<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.300> microscope<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.200> can<00:00:40.260> see

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
coupled into this microscope you can see

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.250 
coupled into this microscope you can see
it<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.129> as<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.399> enters<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.210> side<00:00:42.450> port<00:00:42.780> of

comes up and goes through that objective

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.850 
comes up and goes through that objective
and<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.090> generates<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> obstacle<00:00:52.320> tweezers

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
and it generates the obstacle tweezers

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.830 
and it generates the obstacle tweezers
it<00:00:53.430> generates<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.879> force<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.539> traps

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
it generates a force and traps

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.810 
it generates a force and traps

at some point that sperm swimming force

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.240 
at some point that sperm swimming force
will<00:01:27.060> overcome<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.259> laser<00:01:28.470> trapping<00:01:29.040> force

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
will overcome the laser trapping force

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
will overcome the laser trapping force
and<00:01:29.430> sperm<00:01:29.670> will<00:01:29.759> be<00:01:29.850> able<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.240> escape<00:01:30.509> the

Jacqueline<00:01:33.000> used<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.270> computer<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.930> monitor

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
Jacqueline used a computer to monitor

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
Jacqueline used a computer to monitor
the<00:01:34.350> sperms<00:01:34.650> activity<00:01:35.250> under<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.700> microscope

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the sperms activity under the microscope

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.990 
the sperms activity under the microscope
when<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.170> select<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> sperm<00:01:38.280> we're<00:01:38.700> tracking

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
when we select a sperm we're tracking

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
when we select a sperm we're tracking
and<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> whole<00:01:39.750> time<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.170> tracking<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
and the whole time we're tracking it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
and the whole time we're tracking it
we're<00:01:40.890> calculating<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.670> swimming<00:01:42.090> speed<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
we're calculating the swimming speed of

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.340 
we're calculating the swimming speed of
this<00:01:42.869> sperm<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:44.009> we're<00:01:44.159> tracking<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.700> sperm

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
this sperm so we're tracking the sperm

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.200 
this sperm so we're tracking the sperm
the<00:01:46.350> computer<00:01:46.860> keeps<00:01:47.130> moving<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the computer keeps moving it to the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.819 
the computer keeps moving it to the
right<00:01:48.390> location<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.200> can<00:01:49.229> keep<00:01:49.500> tracking

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
right location so we can keep tracking

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
right location so we can keep tracking
it<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:50.280> it's<00:01:50.369> going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> try<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.820> trap<00:01:51.090> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it and now it's going to try and trap it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.210 
it and now it's going to try and trap it
and<00:01:51.420> that's<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.689> trap<00:01:51.930> location<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:53.009> now

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and that's the trap location there now

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.370 
and that's the trap location there now
it's<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> trap<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.119> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> powers

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
it's in the trap you can see the powers

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.959 
it's in the trap you can see the powers
decreasing<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> sperm<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.729> strong
