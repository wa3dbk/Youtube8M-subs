00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
doing here is forming a chord on the top

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.190 
doing here is forming a chord on the top
three<00:00:50.860> strings<00:00:51.160> that<00:00:51.730> being<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.210> g6<00:00:52.840> chord

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
three strings that being a g6 chord

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.100 
three strings that being a g6 chord
which<00:00:53.829> is<00:00:53.920> going<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.280> be<00:00:54.400> B<00:00:54.700> and<00:00:55.290> then<00:00:56.290> E<00:00:56.790> and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
which is going to be B and then E and

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:06.270 
which is going to be B and then E and
then<00:00:59.110> G<00:00:59.379> on<00:00:59.530> top<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.629> I<00:01:04.660> strum<00:01:05.019> that<00:01:05.050> chord<00:01:05.500> and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
then G on top so I strum that chord and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.400 
then G on top so I strum that chord and
that's<00:01:07.000> my<00:01:07.270> chord<00:01:07.600> shape<00:01:07.810> that<00:01:07.960> I'm<00:01:08.080> going<00:01:08.320> to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
that's my chord shape that I'm going to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's my chord shape that I'm going to
move<00:01:08.590> up<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.160> parallel<00:01:10.119> off<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.600> fretboard

from G same shape moves up the B flat on

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.139 
from G same shape moves up the B flat on
top<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.470> same<00:01:23.800> shape<00:01:24.430> with<00:01:24.700> C<00:01:25.000> on

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
top then I move up a half step back to C

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.540 
top then I move up a half step back to C
on<00:01:33.850> top<00:01:34.180> B<00:01:34.690> flat<00:01:34.990> on<00:01:35.140> top<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.550> then<00:01:36.550> G<00:01:36.850> on<00:01:37.030> top

on top B flat on top and then G on top

00:01:38.550 --> 00:02:01.050 
on top B flat on top and then G on top
one<00:01:39.550> two<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.810> I<00:01:59.380> used<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.770> same<00:02:00.070> lick<00:02:00.850> over

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
one two and I used the same lick over

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.539 
one two and I used the same lick over
each<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.720> chords<00:02:02.049> and<00:02:02.259> it<00:02:02.619> works<00:02:03.280> as

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
each one of the chords and it works as

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.420 
each one of the chords and it works as
if<00:02:03.880> by<00:02:04.030> wizardry<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:05.290> now<00:02:05.439> what<00:02:05.979> I<00:02:06.009> learned<00:02:06.280> a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
if by wizardry so now what I learned a

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.199 
if by wizardry so now what I learned a
long<00:02:06.549> time<00:02:06.610> ago<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.150> that<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:08.470> can<00:02:08.649> take<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:09.220> G

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
long time ago is that you can take a G

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.930 
long time ago is that you can take a G
or<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.570> blue<00:02:11.380> scale<00:02:11.709> rather<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.160> you<00:02:12.190> can<00:02:12.730> play

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
or a blue scale rather and you can play

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:21.100 
or a blue scale rather and you can play
it<00:02:13.060> up<00:02:13.239> the<00:02:13.420> length<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.780> one<00:02:13.989> string

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.510 

and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.230> if<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.440> play<00:02:22.680> this<00:02:22.890> court<00:02:23.250> shape

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
and then if you play this court shape

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.310 
and then if you play this court shape
underneath<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.150> melody<00:02:24.480> note<00:02:24.630> on<00:02:24.750> top<00:02:25.020> it

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
underneath the melody note on top it

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:38.780 
underneath the melody note on top it
fits<00:02:36.230> over<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.530> chords<00:02:37.800> in<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.010> blues<00:02:38.220> so

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
fits over all the chords in the blues so

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.170 
fits over all the chords in the blues so
therefore<00:02:39.120> you<00:02:39.240> can<00:02:39.270> play<00:02:39.570> a<00:02:39.600> blues<00:02:39.840> like

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.430 

using<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.390> chord<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.870> long<00:02:45.990> as<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> keep<00:02:46.410> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
using a chord as long as you keep that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.180 
using a chord as long as you keep that
that<00:02:47.040> shape<00:02:47.400> moving<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:47.970> parallel<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:50.040> there

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that shape moving in parallel so there

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.600 
that shape moving in parallel so there
you<00:02:50.250> go<00:02:50.370> hope<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> enjoy<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.420> one
