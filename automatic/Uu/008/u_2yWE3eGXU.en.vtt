00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.990
 Gymnasium and the middle school 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.300
 pestalozzi the challenge came 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 in australia its origin was to be found 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 the feeling to the children and adolescents 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.940
 of creativity, love of life and joy 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.789
 deliberately abstaining from cigarettes 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.279
 alcohol and other drugs mediate 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.869
 two years ago herpes had the name of 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 dance group of both schools from pirna die 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.830
 won rock challenge and also in 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.820
 At least this year they want to be around 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.430
 mix in the title 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 I hope the best, but of course 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.290
 for all other teams and I would 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.809
 I'll be happy if we are all alright 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.600
 works and I had no 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.370
 Feeling where you land you are in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.230
 front field is one in the middle 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.239
 Area 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.270
 I personally do not want to give the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.059
 assume and evaluate the task of the jury 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.370
 because you always have to be sad 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.739
 if you can not get a seat from the first one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.840
 however, the participation gets the ranks 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.270
 is just as crucial and so 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 the group has grown so that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.210
 actually already a success is if one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.360
 stood here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 his performance shows in front of 1000 people 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.790
 and that is actually done beautiful 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.979
 similar 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.290
 none of them forget that here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.510
 stood above in front of about 1000 fans 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.860

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 Mittelschule KÃ¶nigstein with her 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.050
 Polish partner school made butter around 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.850
 the crown at the challenge it became 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.430

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.390
 English Southampton impressed with 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.280
 elaborately made stage scenery 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.200
 colorful and equally elaborate 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.479
 Costumes great hairstyles and make-up 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.420
 gaudy music and diverse 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.490
 dance performance is the rock challenge 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.770
 not just the finished show already 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.210
 first ideas are part of the project 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.250
 to do so, the students 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.229
 eight-minute dance piece to a free 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.270
 selected theme to everything you 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.970
 needs are designed in front of the students 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.920
 and designed in turner one has 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.700
 so his very own thoughts 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.720
 made 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.750
 the two schools are composed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.400
 made the little stories 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.380
 and then we have obstacle 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.240
 subscribed 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.520
 So it was the collaboration that that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.230
 then really on the end 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.330
 stage has brought it were we have 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.190
 First of all, all sorts of ideas 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.290
 written down and became the samples 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.240
 always smaller and more and more 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.680
 details came out then became natural 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.880
 then how to think about it on stage 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.190
 can implement included 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.660
 the nervousness was really felt 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.970
 behind the scenes were the young ones 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 Dancers are trembling and 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.690
 could at the moment of her appearance of the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.260
 year, so to speak, not at all 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.180
 expect 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.800
 One last make-up here 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.300
 improve and pluck it 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.300
 but then it finally started 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:54.079
 the 66 students from pirna 64 girls and 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.329
 only 2 boys had for this evening 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:57.890
 in the old slaughterhouse dresden the topic 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.430
 in the future older on the flag 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.709
 written 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.390
 it's about how old and young 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.069
 live together and around the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.230
 hardships like older ones 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.909
 People are in our society 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.670
 find our way around and of course we have it 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:13.549
 Also included because of the thought of us 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.859
 the age and this pyramid like 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.959
 already obsolete the society on the 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.250
 agenda and someday 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.239
 We also saw such a picture with 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.879
 two santa clauses 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.470
 they used to have every kid on the street 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.180
 shot and now I think I have to go 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.440
 one had child protection and it 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.480
 we were totally bad 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.670
 herpes pulled the start number 6 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.829
 had a performance on the 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.870
 stage that had almost washed 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.810
 perfect dance theater offered the students 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.819
 the audience the eight minutes were like that 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.819
 felt already half past 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.129
 then two more groups from dresden and 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.110
 boxdorf 's in the previous ones 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.970
 years already the challenge 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.980
 could win 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.629
 the task of finding the winner for the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.650
 jury this year a real one 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.140
 Challenge 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.690
 then the wait for the result began 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.430
 since september the group had once 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.660
 two hours a week on this 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.019
 moment worked 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.840
 Place 3 and 2 were already taken and 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:17.590
 then the cheering knew from then ever 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.590
 no more limits 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.449
 We have as I said it already called 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.030
 but really expected it 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:37.370
 but not two huge ones 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.570
 relief than to jump on and 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.440
 I also have no more than one vote 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.660
 really what we expected 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.580
 I did not win at all 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.479
 so count them as the second 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.740
 place was awarded 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.389
 This can be all animal looking forward 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.190
 I just went down said here 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:58.320
 people we are eight teams 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.570
 I was still very skeptical then 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.240
 was cheer greater surprise 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.250
 then pulled herpes to change now 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.930
 Have a little time all this yourself 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.160
 let go and then but will 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.530
 everything boiled up and enjoyed 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.780
 there will be the dvd or video movie 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.699
 just inserted by the in the act and 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.590
 then there is a large eat a 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:22.289
 toast with alcohol-free sparkling wine 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.599
 Of course, and then we leave it all 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.000
 pass by again and those still 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.039
 times about it and are happy about it again 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.960
 then the project is finished but the 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.280
 the two gymnasts will teach the title 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.960
 can not defend because in 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.370
 next year will be another project 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.370
 in the field of musicals
