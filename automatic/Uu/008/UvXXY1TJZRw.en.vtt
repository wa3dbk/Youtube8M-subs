between elephants and bollard areas

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.389 
between elephants and bollard areas
where<00:00:34.380> they<00:00:34.500> don't<00:00:34.559> really<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> be

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
where they don't really have to be

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.069 
where they don't really have to be
separated<00:00:35.969> even<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.450> are<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.750> separate

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
separated even if they are in separate

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.229 
separated even if they are in separate
stalls<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:38.190> all<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.579> those<00:00:38.670> things<00:00:38.730> make<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
stalls so all of those things make it a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.229 
stalls so all of those things make it a
much<00:00:39.390> easier<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.840> manage<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.410> animals<00:00:41.239> what

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
much easier to manage the animals what

good<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.700> their<00:00:50.789> skin<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.329> lanolin<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
good for their skin it has lanolin in it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
good for their skin it has lanolin in it
so<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.469> keeps<00:00:52.620> their<00:00:52.860> skin<00:00:52.949> soft<00:00:53.430> keeps<00:00:54.270> it

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.140 
we do a lot of that to help give her
exercise<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> same<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.850> that's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
exercise at the same time so that's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.850

much<00:01:33.119> weight<00:01:33.299> too<00:01:33.720> easily<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.380> we<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.799> to

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
much weight too easily so we have to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
Connell is an 8 year old male and then

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.750 
Connell is an 8 year old male and then
we<00:02:39.810> have<00:02:39.930> Shanti<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:41.070> we<00:02:41.160> will<00:02:41.310> probably<00:02:41.460> need

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
we have Shanti so we will probably need

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.370 
we have Shanti so we will probably need
to<00:02:41.850> bring<00:02:42.000> in<00:02:42.150> some<00:02:42.450> more<00:02:42.600> elephants<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
to bring in some more elephants and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.500 
to bring in some more elephants and
we're<00:02:43.500> exploring<00:02:43.770> our<00:02:43.980> options<00:02:44.040> there<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
we're exploring our options there to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
we're exploring our options there to
start<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:45.960> group<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.860> then<00:02:46.980> over<00:02:47.250> time<00:02:47.460> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
start that group and then over time that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.880 
start that group and then over time that
that<00:02:48.270> herd<00:02:48.510> will<00:02:48.660> grow<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:49.440> about<00:02:49.620> reaching

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
that herd will grow we're about reaching

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.010 
that herd will grow we're about reaching
people<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.640> connecting<00:02:51.540> them<00:02:51.690> with<00:02:51.750> our

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
people and connecting them with our

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.470 
people and connecting them with our
elephants<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.770> through<00:02:52.980> that<00:02:53.130> connection

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
elephants and through that connection

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.730 
elephants and through that connection
building<00:02:54.480> some<00:02:54.600> partners<00:02:54.990> for<00:02:55.260> elephant

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
building some partners for elephant

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.940 
building some partners for elephant
conservation<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.060> that's<00:02:57.240> just<00:02:57.330> another

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
conservation and so that's just another

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.350 
conservation and so that's just another
experience<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.250> our<00:02:59.550> public<00:02:59.940> it<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.150> have

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
experience that our public it to have

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.270 
experience that our public it to have
and<00:03:00.840> hopefully<00:03:01.020> then<00:03:01.410> will<00:03:01.650> join<00:03:02.040> us<00:03:02.190> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
and hopefully then will join us in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:11.790 
and hopefully then will join us in
trying<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.730> protect<00:03:03.480> Asian<00:03:03.780> elephants

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.860
