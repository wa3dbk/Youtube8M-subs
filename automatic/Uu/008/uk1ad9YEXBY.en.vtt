on doing with them is I'm going to hang

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.509 
on doing with them is I'm going to hang
them<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:24.410> ceiling<00:00:25.410> strain<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:26.189> fishing

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
them from ceiling strain your fishing

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.700 
them from ceiling strain your fishing
wire<00:00:26.670> hang<00:00:27.510> them<00:00:27.689> so<00:00:27.930> they'll<00:00:28.109> kind<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> float

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
