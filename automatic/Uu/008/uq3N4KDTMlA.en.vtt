131 132 133 and all these are

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.000 
131 132 133 and all these are
radioactive<00:02:47.609> materials<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.659> the<00:02:51.659> thing<00:02:51.959> that

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
radioactive materials and the thing that

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
radioactive materials and the thing that
got<00:02:53.010> me<00:02:53.040> was<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:55.190> why<00:02:56.190> did<00:02:56.489> they<00:02:57.049> show<00:02:58.049> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
got me was is why did they show the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.110 
got me was is why did they show the
levels<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.970> precipitation<00:02:59.970> for<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.900> rain<00:03:02.120> but

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
levels of precipitation for the rain but

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.240 
levels of precipitation for the rain but
they<00:03:03.239> didn't<00:03:03.510> show<00:03:03.720> them<00:03:03.900> for<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.620> milk<00:03:04.920> I

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
they didn't show them for the milk I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.490 
they didn't show them for the milk I
mean<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.639> think<00:03:05.909> that<00:03:06.239> if<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.810> fell<00:03:07.079> down<00:03:07.109> in

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
mean you think that if it fell down in

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.369 
mean you think that if it fell down in
that<00:03:07.620> area<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.370> it's<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.849> high<00:03:09.379> you're

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
that area and it's that high you're

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:11.990 
that area and it's that high you're
going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.590> go<00:03:10.709> test<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.189> milk<00:03:11.430> because<00:03:11.790> that's

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
going to go test the milk because that's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.199 
going to go test the milk because that's
like<00:03:14.480> what<00:03:15.480> would<00:03:15.599> that<00:03:15.750> be<00:03:16.159> 130<00:03:17.159> times<00:03:17.579> the

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
like what would that be 130 times the

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.490 
like what would that be 130 times the
safe<00:03:18.480> level<00:03:19.379> of<00:03:19.760> drinking<00:03:20.760> water<00:03:21.290> so<00:03:22.290> if<00:03:22.379> it's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
safe level of drinking water so if it's

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.650 
safe level of drinking water so if it's
a<00:03:22.680> soft<00:03:23.370> you<00:03:23.819> know<00:03:23.910> drinking<00:03:24.120> water<00:03:24.510> is

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
a soft you know drinking water is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.150 
a soft you know drinking water is
supposed<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:25.019> only<00:03:25.169> be<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> three<00:03:25.889> at<00:03:26.040> the

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
supposed to only be a three at the

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:34.180 
supposed to only be a three at the
maximum<00:03:26.910> that's<00:03:27.449> a<00:03:28.159> 130<00:03:29.159> times<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:31.379> maximum

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.199 

that<00:03:36.260> water<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.739> supposed<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.129> be<00:03:38.310> at<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.909> to

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
that water is supposed to be at it to

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.449 
that water is supposed to be at it to
drink<00:03:39.510> from<00:03:41.030> so<00:03:42.680> if<00:03:43.680> that's<00:03:43.889> fallen<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.340> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
drink from so if that's fallen on the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.879 
drink from so if that's fallen on the
ground<00:03:44.489> Cal<00:03:45.120> street<00:03:45.419> in<00:03:45.510> this<00:03:45.690> grass<00:03:46.139> that

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
ground Cal street in this grass that

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.770 
ground Cal street in this grass that
means<00:03:47.129> this<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.879> is<00:03:51.030> like<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.209> key<00:03:51.599> me

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
means this is a this is like a key me

means this is a this is like a key me
lighting<00:03:52.169> and<00:03:52.470> inside<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.400> cows<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.060> when

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
lighting and inside the cows and when

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.719 
lighting and inside the cows and when
they<00:03:55.879> and<00:03:56.879> when<00:03:57.299> they<00:03:57.329> note<00:03:57.629> these<00:03:57.840> cows<00:03:58.169> it's

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
they and when they note these cows it's

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:05.089 
they and when they note these cows it's
going<00:03:59.729> to<00:03:59.760> be<00:03:59.909> concentrated<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:03.829> it's<00:04:04.829> gonna

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
going to be concentrated and it's gonna

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.869 
going to be concentrated and it's gonna
have<00:04:05.909> a<00:04:05.940> fairly<00:04:06.329> high<00:04:07.519> you<00:04:08.519> would<00:04:08.639> think<00:04:08.669> I

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
have a fairly high you would think I

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:10.520 
have a fairly high you would think I
haven't<00:04:09.479> even<00:04:09.569> think<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:09.959> would<00:04:10.079> have<00:04:10.169> a<00:04:10.229> very

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
haven't even think I would have a very

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.759 
haven't even think I would have a very
fairly<00:04:11.400> high<00:04:11.729> radiation<00:04:12.209> level<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.650> would

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
fairly high radiation level so you would

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.170 
fairly high radiation level so you would
think<00:04:13.979> that<00:04:14.129> they<00:04:14.340> would<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.609> tested<00:04:15.120> this

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
think that they would have tested this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.149 
think that they would have tested this
but<00:04:15.389> I've<00:04:15.720> been<00:04:15.930> looking<00:04:16.470> down<00:04:16.680> up<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.070> down

00:04:17.149 --> 00:04:17.159 
but I've been looking down up and down

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.909 
but I've been looking down up and down
that<00:04:18.739> milk<00:04:19.739> readings<00:04:20.579> on<00:04:20.820> this<00:04:21.030> side<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.919> I

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
that milk readings on this side and I

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.029 
that milk readings on this side and I
don't

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
don't

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.559 
don't
see<00:04:26.039> anything<00:04:26.520> for<00:04:26.699> Idaho<00:04:28.580> see<00:04:29.580> Iowa<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.389> don't

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
see anything for Idaho see Iowa I don't

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:39.260 
see anything for Idaho see Iowa I don't
see<00:04:33.919> yeah<00:04:34.919> I<00:04:34.949> don't<00:04:35.220> see<00:04:35.750> Idaho<00:04:37.610> they<00:04:38.610> CIA<00:04:39.000> I

don't see ID so um I don't know I

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.270 
don't see ID so um I don't know I
thought<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:44.009> was<00:04:44.129> kind<00:04:44.340> of<00:04:44.400> weird<00:04:44.699> that

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
thought that was kind of weird that

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.300 
thought that was kind of weird that
you're<00:04:47.280> not<00:04:47.400> gonna<00:04:47.580> get<00:04:48.270> radnet<00:04:48.930> rider<00:04:49.500> red

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
you're not gonna get radnet rider red

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.610 
you're not gonna get radnet rider red
net<00:04:50.639> radnet<00:04:51.449> right<00:04:52.080> on<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.150> have<00:04:54.150> them

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
net radnet right on that and have them

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.790 
net radnet right on that and have them
sample<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.650> milk<00:04:55.949> um<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:57.629> just<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:58.080> don't

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
sample the milk um and I just I don't

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.200 
sample the milk um and I just I don't
know<00:04:58.919> I<00:04:58.979> guess<00:04:59.280> I'm<00:04:59.490> just<00:04:59.580> making<00:04:59.969> this<00:05:00.060> video

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
know I guess I'm just making this video

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.459 
know I guess I'm just making this video
because<00:05:00.360> I'm<00:05:00.599> kind<00:05:00.780> of<00:05:00.870> curious<00:05:01.110> what

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
because I'm kind of curious what

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.619 
because I'm kind of curious what
people's<00:05:02.280> thoughts<00:05:02.550> aren't<00:05:02.849> if<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.240> haven't

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:03.629

noticed<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.800> just<00:05:05.370> thought<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.550> point<00:05:06.030> that

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
noticed that I just thought I point that

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.499 
noticed that I just thought I point that
out<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:07.759> because<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:08.819> just<00:05:08.909> thought<00:05:09.210> that

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
out to you because I just thought that

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.480 
out to you because I just thought that
was<00:05:10.110> amazingly<00:05:11.030> curious<00:05:12.680> because<00:05:13.680> I'm<00:05:13.919> I<00:05:14.219> know

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
was amazingly curious because I'm I know

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.409 
was amazingly curious because I'm I know
they<00:05:14.759> got<00:05:14.940> farms<00:05:15.509> in<00:05:15.750> Boise<00:05:16.319> Idaho<00:05:16.349> I<00:05:17.419> think

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
they got farms in Boise Idaho I think

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.909 
they got farms in Boise Idaho I think
they<00:05:18.599> got<00:05:18.719> farms<00:05:19.229> are<00:05:19.289> gonna<00:05:19.379> have<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.620> couple

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
they got farms are gonna have a couple

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.070 
they got farms are gonna have a couple
of<00:05:20.129> farms<00:05:20.550> with<00:05:20.729> Calzona<00:05:21.479> maybe<00:05:21.870> i'm<00:05:22.020> wrong

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
of farms with Calzona maybe i'm wrong

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.040 
of farms with Calzona maybe i'm wrong
though<00:05:22.680> if<00:05:22.979> someone<00:05:23.340> knows<00:05:23.550> about<00:05:23.849> that<00:05:24.150> let

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
though if someone knows about that let
