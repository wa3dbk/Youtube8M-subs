in<00:00:01.709> this<00:00:02.010> so<00:00:02.190> easy<00:00:02.370> video<00:00:02.730> I'm<00:00:02.820> going<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.000> show

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
in this so easy video I'm going to show

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.749 
in this so easy video I'm going to show
you<00:00:03.270> how<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.659> cut<00:00:03.929> strip<00:00:04.259> sets<00:00:04.529> strip<00:00:05.339> sets<00:00:05.609> are

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
you how to cut strip sets strip sets are

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.970 
you how to cut strip sets strip sets are
simple<00:00:06.180> they<00:00:06.750> are<00:00:06.779> just<00:00:07.230> strips<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.770> fabric

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
simple they are just strips of fabric

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.430 
simple they are just strips of fabric
and<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.580> predetermined<00:00:09.300> with<00:00:09.450> sewn<00:00:10.170> together

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
and a predetermined with sewn together

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.890 
and a predetermined with sewn together
into<00:00:10.950> strips<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.370> then<00:00:11.490> after<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.660> cut

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
into strips and then after that you cut

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.140 
into strips and then after that you cut
them<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.200> into<00:00:13.380> sections<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:14.009> really<00:00:14.910> good

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
them up into sections a really good

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.180 
them up into sections a really good
example<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.080> nine<00:00:16.260> patch<00:00:16.529> where<00:00:16.859> you<00:00:16.949> sew

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
example is the nine patch where you sew

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.550 
example is the nine patch where you sew
three<00:00:17.910> strips<00:00:18.270> together<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.990> cut<00:00:19.230> them<00:00:19.410> up

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
three strips together and cut them up

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.880 
three strips together and cut them up
and<00:00:19.800> you'll<00:00:20.340> do<00:00:20.520> say<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> dark<00:00:21.529> light<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
and you'll do say a dark light and a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:23.990 
and you'll do say a dark light and a
dark<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> other<00:00:23.640> one<00:00:23.880> will

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
dark and then the other one will

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.550 
dark and then the other one will
alternate<00:00:24.420> with<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.660> light<00:00:24.840> darker<00:00:25.260> light<00:00:25.439> and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
alternate with a light darker light and

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.929 
alternate with a light darker light and
then<00:00:25.650> when<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.830> put<00:00:25.980> them<00:00:26.099> together<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.820> get

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
then when you put them together you get

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.580 
then when you put them together you get
your<00:00:27.119> nine<00:00:27.240> patch<00:00:27.510> well<00:00:28.170> I'm<00:00:28.230> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> show

your nine patch well I'm going to show

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.259 
your nine patch well I'm going to show
you<00:00:28.650> how<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.429> strip<00:00:29.699> sets<00:00:29.939> because<00:00:30.150> they're

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
you how to do strip sets because they're

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.749 
you how to do strip sets because they're
extremely<00:00:30.890> helpful<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.160> your<00:00:32.340> quilting<00:00:32.640> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
extremely helpful in your quilting you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:40.280 
extremely helpful in your quilting you
use<00:00:32.910> them<00:00:33.090> all<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.630> time<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:39.140> what<00:00:40.140> are

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
use them all the time so what are

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.990 
use them all the time so what are
setting<00:00:40.620> triangles<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.879> floor

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
setting triangles well I'm on the floor

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.119 
setting triangles well I'm on the floor
to<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.510> what<00:00:42.809> they<00:00:42.989> are<00:00:43.140> setting

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to show you what they are setting

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.220 
to show you what they are setting
triangles<00:00:44.640> are<00:00:44.879> comprised<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.629> two<00:00:45.840> different

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
triangles are comprised of two different

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.139 
triangles are comprised of two different
ones<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.039> corner<00:00:47.670> setting

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
ones these are the corner setting

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
ones these are the corner setting
triangles<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.840> these<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> sides

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
triangles and these are the sides

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
triangles and these are the sides
setting<00:00:50.670> triangles<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.239> what<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.629> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
setting triangles and what they do is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.170 
setting triangles and what they do is
they<00:00:52.079> set<00:00:52.440> your<00:00:52.620> blocks<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.129> point<00:00:53.460> there<00:00:54.059> will

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
they set your blocks on point there will

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.029 
they set your blocks on point there will
be<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.329> six-inch<00:00:54.899> block<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:55.829> you've

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
be a six-inch block here when you've

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.189 
be a six-inch block here when you've
pieced<00:00:56.309> or<00:00:56.550> applicate<00:00:56.969> same<00:00:57.570> here<00:00:57.899> same<00:00:58.140> here

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
pieced or applicate same here same here

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
pieced or applicate same here same here
and<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.190> instead<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> having<00:00:59.789> them<00:01:00.059> straight

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
and so instead of having them straight

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.930 
and so instead of having them straight
this<00:01:00.660> sets<00:01:00.960> them<00:01:01.230> on<00:01:01.350> point<00:01:01.920> or<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> diagonal

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
this sets them on point or on a diagonal

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
this sets them on point or on a diagonal
I'm<00:01:03.149> diagonal<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:03.899> that's<00:01:04.049> why<00:01:04.229> these<00:01:04.290> guys

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
I'm diagonal so that's why these guys

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.609 
I'm diagonal so that's why these guys
are<00:01:04.650> called<00:01:05.100> setting<00:01:05.640> triangles<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:07.320> what

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
are called setting triangles now what

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
are called setting triangles now what
you<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.369> would<00:01:08.520> have<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:09.030> say

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
you would have is you would have you say

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
you would have is you would have you say
your<00:01:09.299> 6-inch<00:01:09.720> piece<00:01:10.049> block<00:01:10.350> here<00:01:10.770> then<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
your 6-inch piece block here then the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.679 
your 6-inch piece block here then the
next<00:01:11.729> would<00:01:11.880> probably<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> same

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
next would probably be the same

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.740 
next would probably be the same
background<00:01:12.990> fabric<00:01:13.470> most<00:01:14.280> commonly<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> then

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
background fabric most commonly and then

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.450 
background fabric most commonly and then
you'd<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:15.990> another<00:01:16.290> piece<00:01:16.560> block<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.250> then

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
you'd have another piece block and then

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.380 
you'd have another piece block and then
your<00:01:17.700> solid

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
your solid

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
your solid
well<00:01:18.600> you'd<00:01:18.720> work<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.020> out<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
well you'd work it out so it is the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.609 
well you'd work it out so it is the
right<00:01:20.280> amount<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.820> work<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.570> way<00:01:21.750> what's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
right amount to work out this way what's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
right amount to work out this way what's
really<00:01:23.070> great<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.670> fonz<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.119> Porter

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
really great about the fonz and Porter

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.080 
really great about the fonz and Porter
ruler<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.409> that<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.520> tells<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.970> everything

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
ruler is that it tells you everything

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460 
ruler is that it tells you everything
that<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.780> do<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.229> you're<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.350> to

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
that you need to do and you're going to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410 
that you need to do and you're going to
cut<00:01:28.740> your<00:01:28.770> corner<00:01:29.340> strips<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.180> piece

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
cut your corner strips out of a piece

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.929 
cut your corner strips out of a piece
and<00:01:30.720> you're<00:01:31.079> going<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.229> cut<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.530> side<00:01:32.460> strips

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and you're going to cut your side strips

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
and you're going to cut your side strips
out<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> piece<00:01:33.750> or<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.200> side<00:01:34.380> triangles

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
out of a piece or your side triangles

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.499 
out of a piece or your side triangles
out<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> piece<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.759> cool<00:01:35.970> thing<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.240> if

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
out of a piece the cool thing is if

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.510 
out of a piece the cool thing is if
they're<00:01:36.689> both<00:01:36.930> start<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.409> same<00:01:37.770> size<00:01:38.040> strips

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
they're both start with same size strips

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.179 
they're both start with same size strips
and<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> ruler<00:01:39.210> tells<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:39.659> everything

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
and the ruler tells you everything

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:48.499 
and the ruler tells you everything
pretty<00:01:41.189> smart<00:01:41.460> huh<00:01:46.700> the<00:01:47.700> first<00:01:47.909> step<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.360> of

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
pretty smart huh the first step is of

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.600 
pretty smart huh the first step is of
course<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.899> cut<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.229> strips<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:50.070> important

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
course to cut your strips it's important

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190 
course to cut your strips it's important
not<00:01:50.850> only<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.270> cut<00:01:51.450> them<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> correct<00:01:51.990> width

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
not only to cut them the correct width

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.260 
not only to cut them the correct width
in<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.530> case<00:01:52.799> two<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.250> half<00:01:53.399> inches<00:01:53.729> but

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
in this case two and a half inches but

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
in this case two and a half inches but
also<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:55.079> line<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.890> ruler<00:01:56.070> line<00:01:56.520> up

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
also to have a line on the ruler line up

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.639 
also to have a line on the ruler line up
with<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> fold<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.390> fabric<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
with the fold of the fabric as at the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.980 
with the fold of the fabric as at the
bottom<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.040> screen<00:01:59.310> here<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.969> cut<00:02:00.810> one

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
bottom of your screen here I cut one

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.940 
bottom of your screen here I cut one
just<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.409> illustrate<00:02:01.530> this<00:02:02.430> problem<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.509> I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
just to illustrate this problem and I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
just to illustrate this problem and I
exaggerate<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.040> just<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.060> see<00:02:06.270> here's

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
exaggerate it just so you can see here's

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.260 
exaggerate it just so you can see here's
my<00:02:06.930> fold<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.770> if<00:02:08.009> I'm<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.250> cutting<00:02:08.879> straight

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
my fold and if I'm not cutting straight

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.090 
my fold and if I'm not cutting straight
if<00:02:09.479> I'm<00:02:09.660> cutting<00:02:09.989> off<00:02:10.860> at<00:02:11.370> an<00:02:11.520> angle

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
if I'm cutting off at an angle

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.460 
if I'm cutting off at an angle
but<00:02:12.340> what<00:02:12.760> happens<00:02:13.150> is<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:13.450> end<00:02:13.600> up<00:02:13.840> with<00:02:13.900> a<00:02:14.080> V

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
but what happens is you end up with a V

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.130 
but what happens is you end up with a V
see<00:02:15.160> how<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.490> isn't<00:02:15.820> straight<00:02:16.180> at<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.750> it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
see how that isn't straight at all it's

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.040 
see how that isn't straight at all it's
in<00:02:17.290> a<00:02:17.380> V<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.030> see<00:02:19.270> this<00:02:19.450> one<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.870> did

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
in a V as you can see this one and I did

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.260 
in a V as you can see this one and I did
exaggerate<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.250> isn't<00:02:21.670> straight<00:02:21.940> at

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
exaggerate it but that isn't straight at

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.090 
exaggerate it but that isn't straight at
all<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.900> you're<00:02:23.050> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.380> problems

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
all so you're going to have problems

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.130 
all so you're going to have problems
so<00:02:24.490> do<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.700> trick<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.210> lining<00:02:25.660> up<00:02:25.720> your<00:02:25.780> ruler

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
so do that trick of lining up your ruler

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.080 
so do that trick of lining up your ruler
and<00:02:26.380> then<00:02:26.770> your<00:02:26.950> strips<00:02:27.220> will<00:02:27.430> always<00:02:27.850> be

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
and then your strips will always be

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.080 
and then your strips will always be
straight<00:02:29.130> this<00:02:30.130> one<00:02:30.430> belongs<00:02:30.880> here<00:02:31.800> I've

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
straight this one belongs here I've

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.850 
straight this one belongs here I've
paired<00:02:34.090> two<00:02:34.360> strips<00:02:34.780> together<00:02:35.080> right<00:02:35.560> sides

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
paired two strips together right sides

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.640 
paired two strips together right sides
facing<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.700> I'm<00:02:37.570> matching<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.080> raw<00:02:38.380> edges

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
facing and I'm matching the raw edges

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.380 
facing and I'm matching the raw edges
and<00:02:39.010> of<00:02:39.070> course<00:02:39.280> they're<00:02:39.460> perfectly<00:02:39.820> cut<00:02:40.150> so

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and of course they're perfectly cut so

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
and of course they're perfectly cut so
they<00:02:40.540> match<00:02:41.050> perfectly<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:41.770> now<00:02:42.100> I'm<00:02:42.220> just

contained four or any even multiple I

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.850 
contained four or any even multiple I
suggest<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.360> sew<00:03:35.080> them<00:03:35.230> together<00:03:35.410> first

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
suggest that you sew them together first

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.590 
suggest that you sew them together first
in<00:03:36.130> pairs<00:03:36.400> of<00:03:36.490> two<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.030> then<00:03:37.150> sew<00:03:37.450> them

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
in pairs of two and then sew them

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120 
in pairs of two and then sew them
together<00:03:37.780> from<00:03:38.110> there<00:03:38.290> it's<00:03:38.440> just<00:03:38.650> simpler

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
together from there it's just simpler

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.420 
together from there it's just simpler
that<00:03:39.280> way<00:03:39.340> now<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.990> next<00:03:41.500> step<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.830> to<00:03:42.070> press

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
that way now the next step is to press

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.280 
that way now the next step is to press
these<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:43.570> want<00:03:43.750> to<00:03:43.810> press<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.080> seam

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
these you want to press the seam

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.750 
these you want to press the seam
allowances<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.100> first<00:03:45.310> thing<00:03:45.490> you<00:03:45.550> want

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
allowances and the first thing you want

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.350 
allowances and the first thing you want
to<00:03:45.790> do<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.210> press<00:03:46.990> just<00:03:47.500> along<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.360> stitching

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
to do is press just along the stitching

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.660 
to do is press just along the stitching
where<00:03:49.960> you've<00:03:50.140> stitched<00:03:50.560> because<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.280> sets

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
where you've stitched because that sets

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.060 
where you've stitched because that sets
the<00:03:51.910> seam<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:53.470> sets<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.800> threads

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
the seam and it just sets the threads

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.560 
the seam and it just sets the threads
into<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.490> seam<00:03:54.670> you<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.120> a<00:03:55.150> better

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:55.570 
into the seam you just get a better

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.920 
into the seam you just get a better
press<00:03:56.260> job<00:03:56.530> once<00:03:56.770> you<00:03:56.890> do<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.270> then<00:03:58.270> you<00:03:58.420> open

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
press job once you do that then you open

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.860 
press job once you do that then you open
it<00:03:59.080> up<00:03:59.200> and<00:04:00.010> I'm<00:04:01.000> not<00:04:01.180> worrying<00:04:01.480> about<00:04:01.540> which

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
it up and I'm not worrying about which

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.840 
it up and I'm not worrying about which
way<00:04:02.110> I'm<00:04:02.380> pressing<00:04:02.890> my<00:04:03.190> seam<00:04:03.430> allowances

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
way I'm pressing my seam allowances

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.220 
way I'm pressing my seam allowances
towards<00:04:04.180> dark<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.600> light<00:04:04.720> because<00:04:05.080> these

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
towards dark and light because these

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.620 
towards dark and light because these
fabrics<00:04:05.680> are<00:04:05.830> fine<00:04:06.070> just<00:04:06.310> take<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.300> side<00:04:07.600> of

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
fabrics are fine just take the side of

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.760 
fabrics are fine just take the side of
your<00:04:08.020> iron<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:08.640> press<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:11.320> don't<00:04:11.350> want<00:04:11.590> to<00:04:11.680> do

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
your iron and press you don't want to do

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.680 
your iron and press you don't want to do
anything<00:04:12.070> like<00:04:12.490> this<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:12.880> distort<00:04:13.300> it<00:04:13.450> now<00:04:13.600> if

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
anything like this and distort it now if

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.360 
anything like this and distort it now if
you're<00:04:13.810> using<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:14.170> big<00:04:14.410> mat<00:04:14.710> it's<00:04:14.950> just<00:04:15.100> easier

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
you're using a big mat it's just easier

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.370 
you're using a big mat it's just easier
for<00:04:15.400> me<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.640> film<00:04:15.970> on<00:04:16.120> the<00:04:16.239> small<00:04:16.600> one<00:04:16.780> what<00:04:17.350> I

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
for me to film on the small one what I

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.830 
for me to film on the small one what I
would<00:04:17.650> do<00:04:17.770> is<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.190> would<00:04:18.250> line<00:04:18.700> up<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.630> whole

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
would do is I would line up the whole

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.230 
would do is I would line up the whole
length<00:04:20.080> of<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.350> strip<00:04:20.680> against<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.729> line<00:04:21.910> on

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
length of the strip against the line on

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.870 
length of the strip against the line on
the<00:04:22.360> mat<00:04:22.570> and<00:04:22.840> then<00:04:23.650> I<00:04:23.950> would<00:04:24.100> open<00:04:24.430> it<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.610> and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
the mat and then I would open it up and

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.580 
the mat and then I would open it up and
that<00:04:25.180> way<00:04:25.450> when<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.840> press<00:04:26.110> you<00:04:26.290> know<00:04:26.440> you're

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
that way when you press you know you're

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.650 
that way when you press you know you're
getting<00:04:26.830> an<00:04:26.920> exact<00:04:27.400> straight<00:04:27.730> line<00:04:27.940> and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
getting an exact straight line and

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.720 
getting an exact straight line and
you'll<00:04:28.780> also<00:04:28.990> be<00:04:29.200> able<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.560> tell<00:04:29.860> right<00:04:30.490> down

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
you'll also be able to tell right down

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.570 
you'll also be able to tell right down
here<00:04:31.270> if<00:04:31.450> it's<00:04:32.170> straight<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.800> that<00:04:32.860> helps<00:04:33.430> of

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
here if it's straight and that helps of

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.010 
here if it's straight and that helps of
course<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:34.150> then<00:04:34.330> once<00:04:34.510> you<00:04:34.630> do<00:04:34.750> all<00:04:34.780> your

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
course that then once you do all your

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.590 
course that then once you do all your
chopping<00:04:35.290> up<00:04:35.560> that<00:04:36.250> your<00:04:36.490> every<00:04:37.030> step<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.480> the

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
chopping up that your every step of the

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.060 
chopping up that your every step of the
way<00:04:37.630> you're<00:04:37.930> keeping<00:04:38.110> everything<00:04:38.500> nice<00:04:38.830> and

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
way you're keeping everything nice and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.460 
way you're keeping everything nice and
straight<00:04:39.340> with<00:04:39.790> my<00:04:40.030> strips<00:04:40.540> all<00:04:40.840> sewn

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
straight with my strips all sewn

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.040 
straight with my strips all sewn
together<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:42.130> pressed<00:04:43.090> I'm<00:04:43.330> ready<00:04:43.630> to<00:04:43.810> cut

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
together and pressed I'm ready to cut

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.830 
together and pressed I'm ready to cut
into<00:04:44.380> my<00:04:44.410> sections<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.280> in<00:04:46.060> this<00:04:46.180> case<00:04:46.510> I've

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
into my sections and in this case I've

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.110 
into my sections and in this case I've
cut<00:04:47.590> my<00:04:47.770> strips<00:04:48.100> two<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.400> a<00:04:48.430> half<00:04:48.580> inches<00:04:48.940> so

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
cut my strips two and a half inches so

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.360 
cut my strips two and a half inches so
this<00:04:49.270> should<00:04:49.480> be<00:04:49.600> two<00:04:49.810> inches<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.920> is

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
this should be two inches and it is

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.860 
this should be two inches and it is
which<00:04:51.640> means<00:04:51.670> that<00:04:52.060> I've<00:04:52.180> sewn<00:04:52.420> impressed

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
which means that I've sewn impressed

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.590 
which means that I've sewn impressed
well<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:54.070> I<00:04:54.100> also<00:04:54.580> want<00:04:54.940> to<00:04:55.000> cut<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:55.390> way

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
well and so I also want to cut this way

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.060 
well and so I also want to cut this way
into<00:04:55.840> sections<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.470> are<00:04:56.620> two<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.920> half

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
into sections that are two and a half

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.670 
into sections that are two and a half
inches<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.660> so<00:04:58.660> what<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:58.840> first<00:04:59.110> need<00:04:59.320> to<00:04:59.350> do<00:04:59.530> is

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
inches and so what I first need to do is

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.150 
inches and so what I first need to do is
clean<00:05:00.040> up<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.610> bad<00:05:00.880> edge<00:05:01.240> and<00:05:01.800> so<00:05:02.800> I'm<00:05:03.010> going

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
clean up this bad edge and so I'm going

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.250 
clean up this bad edge and so I'm going
to<00:05:03.190> line<00:05:03.520> up<00:05:03.580> on<00:05:03.970> my<00:05:04.120> ruler<00:05:04.450> it's<00:05:04.600> good<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:05.050> use

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
to line up on my ruler it's good to use

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.560 
to line up on my ruler it's good to use
one<00:05:05.530> of<00:05:05.560> these<00:05:05.740> inside<00:05:06.370> lines<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:07.150> line<00:05:07.330> up

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
one of these inside lines to line up

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:08.790 
one of these inside lines to line up
because<00:05:07.750> then<00:05:08.110> you're<00:05:08.230> using<00:05:08.410> something

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
because then you're using something

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.830 
because then you're using something

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.110 
inside rather than what might be a wavy
edge<00:05:10.960> of<00:05:11.170> course<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.590> wouldn't<00:05:12.400> say<00:05:12.580> that<00:05:12.730> yours

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
edge of course I wouldn't say that yours

edge of course I wouldn't say that yours
are<00:05:13.480> wavy<00:05:13.750> but<00:05:14.020> mine<00:05:14.470> might<00:05:14.890> be<00:05:14.920> so<00:05:15.850> I

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
are wavy but mine might be so I

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.180 
are wavy but mine might be so I
straighten<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.450> up<00:05:16.510> and<00:05:16.840> since<00:05:17.740> I'm<00:05:17.890> not<00:05:18.010> on

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190

my big table I'm just going to turn this

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.020 
my big table I'm just going to turn this
usually<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.110> would<00:05:20.260> go<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.560> other<00:05:20.710> side<00:05:21.030> and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
usually I would go to the other side and

usually I would go to the other side and
I'm<00:05:22.840> going<00:05:23.200> to<00:05:23.260> line<00:05:23.680> this<00:05:23.860> up<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.220> my<00:05:24.340> two<00:05:24.400> and

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
I'm going to line this up to my two and

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.770 
I'm going to line this up to my two and
a<00:05:24.940> half<00:05:25.350> inches<00:05:26.350> on<00:05:26.620> this<00:05:26.800> ruler<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.780> again

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
a half inches on this ruler and again

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.290 
a half inches on this ruler and again
I'm<00:05:28.960> always<00:05:29.170> making<00:05:29.440> sure<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:30.460> this<00:05:30.700> line<00:05:31.000> is

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
I'm always making sure that this line is

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.930 
I'm always making sure that this line is
correct<00:05:32.080> and<00:05:32.290> then<00:05:32.410> that<00:05:32.560> way<00:05:32.740> as<00:05:33.010> you<00:05:33.700> cut

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
correct and then that way as you cut

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.430 
correct and then that way as you cut
along<00:05:34.240> you'll<00:05:34.630> know<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:35.020> you're<00:05:35.170> getting

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
along you'll know that you're getting

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.040 
along you'll know that you're getting
them<00:05:35.560> all<00:05:35.740> right<00:05:36.100> and<00:05:36.340> if<00:05:36.970> this<00:05:37.240> line<00:05:37.570> starts

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
them all right and if this line starts

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.960 
them all right and if this line starts
getting<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.380> little<00:05:38.410> wavy<00:05:38.830> just<00:05:39.520> do<00:05:39.700> another

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
getting a little wavy just do another

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.960 
getting a little wavy just do another
strip<00:05:40.720> across<00:05:40.870> here<00:05:41.410> using<00:05:42.220> this<00:05:42.460> line<00:05:42.760> to

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
strip across here using this line to

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.120 
strip across here using this line to
straighten<00:05:43.390> it<00:05:43.450> up<00:05:43.770> straighten<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:44.860> up<00:05:44.890> again

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.130 
straighten it up straighten it up again

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.890 
straighten it up straighten it up again
then<00:05:45.340> you<00:05:45.430> can<00:05:45.580> keep<00:05:45.760> cutting<00:05:46.300> because<00:05:46.450> you<00:05:46.720> do

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
then you can keep cutting because you do

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.420 
then you can keep cutting because you do
get<00:05:47.080> a<00:05:47.140> little<00:05:47.290> bit<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.620> out<00:05:47.800> of<00:05:47.830> whack<00:05:47.980> as<00:05:48.340> you

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430

get a little bit of out of whack as you
go<00:05:48.580> even<00:05:48.610> if<00:05:48.940> you're<00:05:49.120> really<00:05:49.270> careful<00:05:49.570> it's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
go even if you're really careful it's

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.920 
go even if you're really careful it's
just<00:05:50.740> the<00:05:50.860> nature<00:05:51.040> of<00:05:51.190> things<00:05:51.480> so<00:05:52.480> just<00:05:52.510> keep

instructions and also do note this you
can<00:05:59.200> speed<00:05:59.500> this<00:05:59.650> up<00:05:59.860> by<00:06:00.100> if<00:06:00.370> you<00:06:00.910> have<00:06:01.180> say

can speed this up by if you have say
three<00:06:01.930> strips<00:06:02.230> like<00:06:02.590> this<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:03.070> can<00:06:03.280> stack

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
three strips like this you can stack

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.560 
three strips like this you can stack
them<00:06:03.850> up<00:06:04.030> and<00:06:04.150> be<00:06:04.570> cutting<00:06:04.930> three<00:06:05.470> at<00:06:05.740> one<00:06:05.980> time

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
them up and be cutting three at one time

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.720

makes<00:06:07.570> it<00:06:07.810> go<00:06:08.020> much<00:06:08.440> faster<00:06:08.830> so<00:06:09.220> you<00:06:09.250> can<00:06:09.370> get

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
makes it go much faster so you can get

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.690 
makes it go much faster so you can get
