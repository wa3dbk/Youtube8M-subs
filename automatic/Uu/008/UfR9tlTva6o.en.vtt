00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.890

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.389
 hello to all this morning i'm going to you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.610
 talk about a game that can change your 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.110
 overnight life poker then 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.580
 I must admit that it is not too much 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.599
 my thing to bet money and I know 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.369
 that I can never do the weight 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
 face guys like patrick bruel by 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.180
 example so he wins all the time 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.769
 for example I bet once on a 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.650
 ticket to 23 euros to go see his 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.699
 concert eh ben I got fucked 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.119
 yet promo did not stop saying that 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.199
 it will be a great concert a yb do it 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.070
 I just did not play poker 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.969
 is the problem is that I play 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.890
 than with guys 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.570
 gold at home you play well down is to 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.160
 you are together I know how to play 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.079
 already well I played with guys 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520
 they are much more lousy than me 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.930
 did again 1 last weekend and 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.340
 the guy who organized did not even want 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.140
 that we play money before 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.690
 start telling us and the winner of the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.239
 part goes away with the card game 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 exactly but that they were organizing 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 an evening but do not even know the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.899
 rules and I swear to you that it's true at 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.460
 early on we thought who knew it 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.469
 but it's burnt to the end because in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:04.470
 made when winning and posed his 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:06.150
 cards like that he shouted very poker 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.320
 proud of him and more but this game of 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.700
 cards finally this is the school of the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 life what's true there are plenty of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 commonalities between poker and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 situations of everyday life 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.310
 at the Bois de Boulogne for example it's 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 exactly the same 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.189
 often you think that a lady in front 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.189
 you but in fact it's a king with a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.659
 big pair always find you me I 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.070
 know people who have divorced because 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 of their poker addiction 1 it can go 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.710
 very far away and in court for 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.720
 support one of them and it was 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.890
 super humiliating his wife to recover 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.540
 money and kids at the time of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.329
 verdict she watched him mate in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.470
 the eyes like that help the carpet 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:35.640
 it is not possible to control their desire 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.829
 to play can also write a letter 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 to refrain themselves from casino I 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.290
 passed aware of this stuff 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.520
 yeah but generally what Huawei 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.869
 really happens not write themselves 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.040
 a letter to be left behind 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 never come back but it does not work 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.079
 general 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.520
 I know it because for example the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.820
 here I am I am not very fan of céline 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 dion 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.759
 So I wrote a letter at stake 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.470
 was going to be to do it 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.850
 forbid in the casino but she 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.619
 always sings at Caesar palace and the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.630
 horse who will you believe me but a 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.850
 I've been to las vegas 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.649
 René and céline dion in a casino 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.149
 so it was still troubling because 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.799
 when you think about it, it's 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.240
 as the only one but who want the seméac 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.700
 to the world who goes to the casino with his own 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.210
 slot machine 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.210
 the punchline
