00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi hello youtube friends in this 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.130
 I bring you the analysis of the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.840
 ipad 4 as you can see on the screen 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.980
 the differences with regard to the 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 outside are not many but and the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:23.009
 Resolution of this new iPad is a lot 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 better because it brings 2048 x 1536 pixels what 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.899
 that make it one of the most 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.160
 sharp in the market that has 3.1 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:32.200
 millions of pixels 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.510
 and it is much more than what the 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.710
 high definition televisions 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.829
 at present 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 that's equivalent to 264 pixels per 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.790
 inch according to the supporting data 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.200
 as you can see is impressive is the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.170
 screen details 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.800
 another thing you can observe is 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.760
 that the collector has changed and now 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.250
 uses a connector that is 80% more 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.100
 small than the previous connector which 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.960
 it was 30 pins as you can see it's a 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.970
 smaller 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.810
 that is one of the things that have changed 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:14.690
 with regards to the outside 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.590
 it also brings two cameras one front and 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.619
 a back of the front camera brings to 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.190
 that you record in high definition up to 720 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:28.580
 pixels the main camera that you can 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.490
 record up to 1080 pixels is better 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.619
 brings stabilizer and new technology 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.350
 so that you look better in the photos with 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.780
 the videos also brings a stabilizer 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.420
 so you can take the videos and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.180
 even if you move, do not stay with much 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.340
 movement 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.520
 all this is possible thanks to the new 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.990
 a6 processor x that according to 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:56.200
 supports provides twice as fast in what 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.229
 regarding the performance of the equipment and 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.060
 better speed for games and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.460
 Applications 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.710
 or good you will be asking and after 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.160
 of all this then the battery me 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.810
 last less is not the case because 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:16.959
 according to the battery should last you 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.170
 around 10 hours and that's something 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.480
 similar to what your iPad 3 lasted 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.550
 then you will not have problems with what 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.370
 respect to that 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.920
 very well now let's talk about 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.950
 what is the connection to the internet this 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.470
 ipads has been improved now gives you the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.540
 double speed the things you did 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.510
 before today you will feel that more are being done 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.410
 fast with respect to the connections of 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.720
 cell phones also allows you if your 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.140
 team has that option you can 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.820
 connect to the latest and best networks 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:56.680
 phone numbers such as the lte or 4g as 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.260
 you can see the graphics look a lot 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.780
 better on our screen that looks very 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.300
 I should also mention that the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.050
 ipad 4 is using the new system 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:11.170
 operative and west 6 that if you observe the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.930
 difference between ipad 3 and ipad 4 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.660
 There is not much you can do in 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.330
 the 3 you can do in the 4 the biggest 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.950
 difference is in the performance due 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.040
 to the new processor 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.590
 next I'll show you the twenty 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.319
 marc which is the standard that measures the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.540
 equipment performance as you can 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:37.400
 see previous iphone equipment 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:41.120
 apple ipad have a very low score 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.810
 but if you look at the ipad 4 set with 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.720
 the iphone 5 give us a score much more 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:51.680
 high almost double those of the 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:54.110
 previous versions therefore you're going 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.380
 to give superior performance in what 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.049
 regards speed and graphics in the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.440
 system of in the time that I was 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.329
 trying this ipad 4 I had take some 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.579
 photos and videos of the ones I'll present to 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.670
 then to note is the quality 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:14.239
 and the difference these are some of the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.549
 photos that you take as you can see use 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.609
 very well the technology in this camera to 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.530
 Although it only has 5 megapixels 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.520
 for photos 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.460
 but the quality is very good 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.400
 as you can see with regards 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.550
 to the videos and take them on 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.550
 definition 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.200
 as you can notice these are the effects 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.030
 in the graphics that has this is due 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:13.200
 to the new processor 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:15.510
 which is incredibly fast and processes 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.000
 very good graphics well if you have the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.760
 ipad 3 I suggest you wait 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.350
 because to always launch new ipad 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.830
 in a very short time 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:28.770
 do not forget so your comment below and 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.400
 you tell me what do you think about this new 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.770
 tablet this is jose I repeat you thank you 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.210
 next see you later
