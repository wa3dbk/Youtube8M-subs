00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 Hello friends, I am alone here 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.790
 the subscriber from one resource has adjusted 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.700
 screenshots of the dough in new video cards from 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.280
 nvidia which I personally will idolize 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.299
 these months is called this video card 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.820
 gtx 950 I will idolize because 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.400
 I had high hopes for her and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.369
 and nvidia tried and to say the least 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.519
 fame this card as i think in terms of 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.630
 crisis will be something like 9800 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.250
 Jay ti, that is, she will be in every house 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 Cheap price strong graphics card 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.270
 main support 12 direct x if not 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:43.020
 I am mistaken at the level of and 960 970 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.719
 and 980 if I'm wrong write in comments 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.190
 although damn how can I be wrong well 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.590
 okay guys let's see what is there 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.570
 us for the test stand and then you will 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.079
 watch and I will comment on the tests 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.149
 of games 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.629
 test bench we have such a processor 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.969
 intel core i5 4670 key overclocked 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.710
 purity 4 5 gigahertz 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.199
 I will not ship you the rest 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 They are now on the screen if 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 you are interested in click on 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.850
 pause and consider carefully well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.799
 Now we look at the screenshots of the first 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 the game that tested this resource 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 there was a game witcher 3 as you see here 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.979
 everything in the ultra literally hairworks 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.430
 off and let's look at fps 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.049
 means at 1080p with us as you can see 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:35.040
 somewhere between 25 and 30 but as seen 2 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.229
 fps listen and well for full hd and for here 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.659
 of this video card and the price will be at the end 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.790
 this video is very good 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.280
 the result goes further in the list 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.740
 battlefield 4 and so we have here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.110
 ultra fourfold smoothing and 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.930
 It turns out well, as you can see from 58 there / 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.689
 was up to 35 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 at night I will tell you up to 60 fps and approximately 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.790
 somewhere 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:05.549
 well about 45 somewhere here 45 I think it is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.970
 This is the average fps for battlefield on 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.739
 this video card but fuck up 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.780
 fourfold smoothing ultra and full 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.850
 hd 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.580
 Further there was a third cruise as you can see 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.819
 outrageous settings again and here 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.510
 here as you can see there will be a jump up to 57 fps 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.530
 were about 27 years old and on average somewhere 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.560
 probably kept around 30 as I think 3 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.300
 and here at level 40 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.220
 next is the game metro last light know 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.350
 in fact, I did not see people who 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.440
 played this game but only if there 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.480
 reviewers and tested if you played 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.489
 metro last light write in the comments 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.670
 I want to know how many such people you have 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.790
 There is relatively fps as you can see 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.940
 the schedule is very uneven here 38 then there was 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.500
 drop to 20 well and jump somewhere to 30 i 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.690
 I can only tell you one thing here 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.940
 a little lower graphics will be 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.160
 calmly survive all 40 fps 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.440
 ahead we have two games that are generally 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.780
 You can not use it as a benchmark 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.269
 assassin's creed unity and far cry 4 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.420
 let's start with assassin's creed unity 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.739
 the lowest fps here is 25 and the most 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.630
 high 50 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.410
 Well, as you can see on this schedule, you can 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.079
 see that somewhere fps at level 40 what 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.670
 very playable considering the settings 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.380
 which you see on the screen this 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.680
 high fx and 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.870
 crazy settings at far cry 4 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.329
 things are much better as you can see fps 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.820
 stays at 50 practically not 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.850
 Lastly, we have a top game 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.510
 gta5 as a video setting is very high 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.329
 fx 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.799
 hey hey that is all twisted up and that we 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.700
 see 49 fps is the lowest fps and 71 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.180
 highest 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.299
 guys if you look at the graph at the level 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.910
 60 almost almost flat well, so 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.040
 honestly say almost exactly that is 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.220
 bought this video card you can play 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.359
 in gta5 at very high settings with 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.269
 full hd 60 fps on this for today all 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.500
 I would like to say thank you Sasha 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.560
