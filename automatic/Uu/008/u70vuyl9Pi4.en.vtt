00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.760
 partners risk monetization 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.710
 to avoid at scenes the video platform 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.700
 youtube gold just like the risks 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.380

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.930
 you were talking about this poster for you 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.120
 then as my sons had introduced 38 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.190
 and and carmine ex in previous 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.260
 videos space up for you is a team 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.430
 who was born a few months ago as much 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.799
 to say that is very young she benefits 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.619
 of great dynamism one vis-à-vis his 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.390
 number of subscribers as can see them 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 and their goal is very simple it's 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.560
 ask for business support for 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.670
 encourage youtuber as well as 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.190
 types and sports 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.230
 I specify I specify at a switchover 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.590
 that always still specify that the 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.990
 term and sport is designated means 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 pc players or console that plays the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 competition in tournaments as per 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.830
 example of the dan so this term coming from 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.159
 word and sport which means everything 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.790
 simply in French sport and tronic 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.470
 in short to pass all this the work of 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.170
 this fario poster is to make you 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 access benefits that can 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.950
 help develop your business via 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.750
 youtube and others 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.500
 platforms and two known as by 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.210
 example dailymotion elsewhere it's 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.180
 this team exposing to flaws or 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.860
 one that is composed of warren and zac 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.380
 so it's both officially 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.840
 we were recommended by several 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.750
 chains of youtube bird site or even 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.320
 recognized associations in their field 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:18.860
 like warteck mythix esport crucifix 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.660
 squeeze parano play comedy club total 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.460
 gamers.com es etv etc etc 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.440
 so after you tell me of course that 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.959
 it's a beautiful world 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.670
 but what about the sponsors then 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.800
 know that they have also found 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.810
 several sponsors for you as kemo 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.910
 gnac xbox live subscription 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.000
 stikeman ya and two that are going soon 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.580
 be formalized after why you 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.590
 be schooled to you will tell me any case 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.050
 just like the athletes 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.150
 sponsors help you in your projects in 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.700
 providing you with material in you 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.739
 offering their services and even a 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.110
 tip give money she goes who 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.580
 will allow you in any case who you 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:04.190
 will at least develop you 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.430
 after course it's not in exchange not 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.080
 of chocolate a obviously the 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.690
 companies what he wants in the chances 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.000
 is that you are advertising 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.709
 for them so on here they are this in 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.989
 advertising exchange on your media 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.060
 community sharing as your 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.110
 videos on youtube 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.600
 So here after and there 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.090
 it's the big fat big by cons there is 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.010
 conditions for that spotify or them 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.959
 can help you and sell you better 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.570
 to companies 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.940
 must be equal to or greater than 5000 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.410
 subscribers and have at least 1000 seen by 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.500
 video 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.760
 So that's certainly 7000 subscribers 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.640
 really huge 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.250
 but here we are talking about companies in a 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.170
 liberal economic system where the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.780
 advertising is a reasoned action 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.380
 who want to reach a maximum of 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 people 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.040
 you are several to precisely 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.810
 request the services of sponsors for 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.710
 you but that's because this team does 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.140
 are not magicians 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.520
 so if you only have one number 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.660
 very limited subscribers 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.940
 so you're obviously less visible 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.990
 on Youtube 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.340
 companies do not have its terrace and 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.660
 to you and the other countries want 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.970
 reach a maximum of people 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.310
 so much affected with people 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.680
 who have at least a pretty number 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:24.860
 so that they can broadcast 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.470
 in their image 1 it is necessary to prefer 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.870
 their ad 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:34.180
 and that's exactly what this poster 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.180
 for you can better sell here 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.160
 bravo you take you did not 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.630
 appear 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.190
 morgane fox in png great in the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.840
 world wants its part that in your world 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.330
 virtual you can because everything you 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.140
 want but in my world you are nice no 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.180
 you can do anything when it's 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.160
 rolls 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.970
 ok i'm gone will hold deadlines 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.970
 outsourced 6 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:11.259
 1 2 1 2 tests or medium very well that 

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.949
 finally works thank you live for this 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:15.879
 waste of time 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.930
 so vis-à-vis precisely why have 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:19.360
 as many subscribers 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.879
 we must know that here we are not 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.649
 of companies in terms of sponsorship 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.689
 so companies of course want 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:27.879
 give a good brand image but 

00:05:25.689 --> 00:05:28.419
 also reach a maximum of 

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.699
 people 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.960
 after all they are paying money 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.169
 to help you grow 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.779
 to represent their company well 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.099
 so your video channel is the showcase to 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.779
 which will be likely 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:42.580
 to appear 

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:44.229
 then have better visibility 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.229
 to reach a large number 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.729
 Internet users is essential, hence the 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.279
 need to have enough numbers 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.990
 number of subscribers to interest 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:54.819
 business 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.499
 you should also know that spotify or 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:59.050
 offers a graphical control service 

00:05:56.499 --> 00:06:02.050
 but know that for the realization of a 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.789
 logo of a background of a site etc 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:08.860
