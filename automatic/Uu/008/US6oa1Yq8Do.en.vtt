small branches and everything like that

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.560

I<00:00:59.800> started<00:01:00.220> pulling<00:01:00.430> on<00:01:00.640> the<00:01:00.760> moss<00:01:00.970> right

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
I started pulling on the moss right

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.270 
I started pulling on the moss right
you<00:01:01.989> know<00:01:02.110> usually<00:01:02.320> we<00:01:02.680> climb<00:01:02.950> trees<00:01:03.250> like

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
you know usually we climb trees like

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.580 
you know usually we climb trees like
this<00:01:03.640> but<00:01:03.880> since<00:01:04.030> these<00:01:04.239> are<00:01:04.449> so<00:01:04.660> so<00:01:05.290> large

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
this but since these are so so large

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.560 
this but since these are so so large
I've<00:01:06.160> been<00:01:06.370> pulling<00:01:06.700> all<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:06.910> moss<00:01:07.120> out<00:01:07.390> of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
I've been pulling all the moss out of

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.330 
I've been pulling all the moss out of
the<00:01:07.660> trees<00:01:07.900> from<00:01:08.050> a<00:01:08.200> lift<00:01:08.470> with<00:01:08.710> a<00:01:08.740> heart<00:01:09.070> rate

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
the trees from a lift with a heart rate

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.790 
the trees from a lift with a heart rate
and<00:01:10.000> what's<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.570> point<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.990> other<00:01:11.410> than<00:01:11.619> for

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
and what's the point of other than for

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.490 
and what's the point of other than for
that<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:12.250> message<00:01:13.000> makes<00:01:13.270> does<00:01:13.869> it<00:01:14.050> make<00:01:14.350> the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
that the message makes does it make the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.690 
that the message makes does it make the
tree<00:01:14.710> healthier<00:01:15.040> when<00:01:15.190> you<00:01:15.280> pull<00:01:15.430> down<00:01:15.460> the

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
tree healthier when you pull down the

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.980 
tree healthier when you pull down the
monster<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:16.300> like<00:01:16.450> a<00:01:16.479> misconception

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
monster is that like a misconception

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.320 
monster is that like a misconception
yeah<00:01:17.440> absolutely<00:01:17.770> well<00:01:18.460> generally<00:01:19.090> people

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
yeah absolutely well generally people

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.020 
yeah absolutely well generally people
think<00:01:19.660> that<00:01:19.780> all<00:01:19.990> Moss<00:01:20.400> causes<00:01:21.400> the<00:01:21.550> tree<00:01:21.760> harm

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
think that all Moss causes the tree harm

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.910 
think that all Moss causes the tree harm
and<00:01:22.360> usually<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.960> Spanish<00:01:23.320> moss<00:01:23.500> the<00:01:23.770> real

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
and usually the Spanish moss the real

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.590 
and usually the Spanish moss the real
long<00:01:24.160> stringy<00:01:24.580> stuff<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.000> doesn't<00:01:25.180> really<00:01:25.360> do

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
long stringy stuff it doesn't really do

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.290 
long stringy stuff it doesn't really do
too<00:01:25.780> much<00:01:25.930> the<00:01:26.350> ball<00:01:26.560> Moss<00:01:27.090> stuff<00:01:28.090> that's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
too much the ball Moss stuff that's

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.920 
too much the ball Moss stuff that's
actually<00:01:28.690> attached

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
actually attached

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.880 
actually attached
because<00:01:30.290> that<00:01:30.500> starts<00:01:30.800> growing<00:01:31.070> in<00:01:31.280> there<00:01:31.430> and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
because that starts growing in there and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.280 
because that starts growing in there and
Red's<00:01:32.130> across<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> tree<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.300> starts<00:01:33.659> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Red's across the tree and it starts it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.550 
Red's across the tree and it starts it
just<00:01:34.350> starts<00:01:34.800> taking<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:36.320> really<00:01:37.320> think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just starts taking we really think

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.290 
just starts taking we really think
starts<00:01:38.159> pulling<00:01:38.430> all<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.790> out<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.120> tree

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
starts pulling all that out of the tree

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.510 
starts pulling all that out of the tree
and<00:01:39.360> eventually<00:01:39.930> it'll<00:01:40.110> end<00:01:40.260> up<00:01:40.409> killing<00:01:40.650> me

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
and eventually it'll end up killing me

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.280 
and eventually it'll end up killing me
well<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.180> lot<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> people<00:01:42.479> don't<00:01:42.780> realize<00:01:43.110> it

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
well a lot of people don't realize it

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.080 
well a lot of people don't realize it
but<00:01:43.320> year<00:01:43.650> after<00:01:43.950> year<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.369> don't<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.880> your

landscaping below it in this case we've

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.080 
landscaping below it in this case we've
got<00:02:18.560> two<00:02:18.710> featured<00:02:19.310> oak<00:02:19.460> trees<00:02:19.670> in<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.910> middle

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090

at<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.260> one<00:02:24.440> here<00:02:24.680> Nate<00:02:25.160> if<00:02:25.280> you<00:02:25.370> can<00:02:25.520> pan

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
at this one here Nate if you can pan

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.400 
at this one here Nate if you can pan
right<00:02:25.940> up<00:02:26.120> we'll<00:02:26.300> show<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:27.140> Moss

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
right up we'll show you what this Moss

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.260 
right up we'll show you what this Moss
looks<00:02:27.740> like<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.490> can<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.820> how<00:02:28.940> it's<00:02:29.120> all

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
looks like and you can see how it's all

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.090 
looks like and you can see how it's all
intertwined<00:02:29.810> at<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> branches<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.920> also

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
intertwined at the branches it also

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.730 
intertwined at the branches it also
limits<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.670> sunlight<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> branches<00:02:33.320> so

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
limits the sunlight to the branches so

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.110 
limits the sunlight to the branches so
you<00:02:33.800> don't<00:02:34.040> get<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.250> photosynthesis<00:02:34.970> you

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
you don't get the photosynthesis you

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.600 
you don't get the photosynthesis you
would<00:02:35.270> get<00:02:35.480> otherwise<00:02:36.140> so<00:02:36.890> Ronnie's<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:37.550> to

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
would get otherwise so Ronnie's going to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.460 
would get otherwise so Ronnie's going to
go<00:02:37.700> ahead<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.180> take<00:02:38.690> care<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:38.990> tree<00:02:39.230> next

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
go ahead and take care of this tree next

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
actually roots into the side of the tree

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.350 
actually roots into the side of the tree
and<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.100> takes<00:03:16.310> nutrients<00:03:16.820> away<00:03:17.060> from<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
and and it takes nutrients away from the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.090 
and and it takes nutrients away from the
plant<00:03:17.660> you<00:03:17.870> know<00:03:17.959> all<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.530> water<00:03:18.739> and<00:03:18.980> all<00:03:19.070> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
plant you know all the water and all the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.650 
plant you know all the water and all the
nutrients<00:03:19.550> inside<00:03:19.910> of<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.150> that's<00:03:20.330> what<00:03:20.480> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
nutrients inside of it that's what the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.410 
nutrients inside of it that's what the
ball<00:03:20.810> moss<00:03:21.050> actually<00:03:21.530> lives<00:03:21.800> on<00:03:22.239> that's<00:03:23.239> why

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
ball moss actually lives on that's why

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.640 
ball moss actually lives on that's why
it's<00:03:23.600> detrimental<00:03:23.780> to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
it's detrimental to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.289 
it's detrimental to
you<00:03:24.739> know<00:03:24.829> trees<00:03:25.250> basically<00:03:25.730> anything<00:03:25.970> else

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
you know trees basically anything else

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.539 
you know trees basically anything else
that<00:03:26.510> includes<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.959> little<00:03:27.409> girl<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.129> wide

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
that includes a little girl on a wide

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.880 
that includes a little girl on a wide
variety<00:03:29.290> basically<00:03:30.290> anything<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:32.890> sucks

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
variety basically anything that sucks

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.259 
variety basically anything that sucks
and<00:03:33.980> nutrients<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.610> sucks<00:03:34.790> the<00:03:34.909> life<00:03:35.060> right

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
and nutrients it sucks the life right

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.970 
and nutrients it sucks the life right
out<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.420> your<00:03:35.569> trees<00:03:35.810> this<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.349> Spanish<00:03:36.739> moss

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
out of your trees this is Spanish moss

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.039 
out of your trees this is Spanish moss
not<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:37.700> bad<00:03:37.879> because<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.360> doesn't<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:38.959> not

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
not so bad because it doesn't it's not

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.009 
not so bad because it doesn't it's not
parasitic<00:03:39.769> in<00:03:39.890> nature<00:03:40.189> but<00:03:40.370> it<00:03:40.519> does<00:03:41.019> it

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
parasitic in nature but it does it

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.780 
parasitic in nature but it does it
suffocates<00:03:42.500> something<00:03:43.069> that<00:03:43.189> it's<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.400> Polish

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
suffocates something that it's a Polish

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.759 
suffocates something that it's a Polish
yeah<00:03:44.000> for<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.359> most<00:03:44.540> part<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:44.989> it'll<00:03:45.319> build<00:03:45.470> up

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
yeah for the most part is it'll build up

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.830 
yeah for the most part is it'll build up
enough<00:03:46.069> over<00:03:46.430> time<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.909> mean<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.359> right<00:03:47.569> here

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
enough over time I mean this right here

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.869 
enough over time I mean this right here
is<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:47.989> pretty<00:03:48.290> good<00:03:48.379> clump<00:03:48.890> of<00:03:49.069> it<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.730> can

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:49.879 
is a pretty good clump of it and you can

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.420 
is a pretty good clump of it and you can
see<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.209> got<00:03:50.359> a<00:03:50.390> stick<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.900> there<00:03:51.109> that<00:03:51.920> stick

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
see you got a stick in there that stick

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.190 
see you got a stick in there that stick
is<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.209> covered<00:03:53.599> you're<00:03:53.810> not<00:03:53.989> going<00:03:54.140> to

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
is you know covered you're not going to

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.990 
is you know covered you're not going to
get<00:03:54.319> too<00:03:54.560> much<00:03:54.769> weed<00:03:55.099> grow<00:03:55.400> much<00:03:55.670> sunlight

exactly very minimal amount of leaves

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.699 
exactly very minimal amount of leaves
very<00:03:59.450> weak<00:03:59.780> growth<00:04:00.170> okay

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
very weak growth okay

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.530 
very weak growth okay
tell<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.069> folks<00:04:01.220> again<00:04:01.579> how<00:04:01.849> fast<00:04:02.180> is<00:04:02.420> this

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
tell the folks again how fast is this

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.920 
tell the folks again how fast is this
grow<00:04:02.780> versus<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:04.060> well<00:04:05.060> generally<00:04:05.599> the<00:04:05.720> ball

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
grow versus this well generally the ball

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.259 
grow versus this well generally the ball
moss<00:04:06.200> grows<00:04:07.069> a<00:04:07.099> little<00:04:07.340> bit<00:04:07.579> quicker<00:04:07.849> than<00:04:08.150> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
moss grows a little bit quicker than the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.470 
moss grows a little bit quicker than the
Spanish<00:04:08.629> moss<00:04:08.780> does<00:04:09.109> it<00:04:09.310> it'll<00:04:10.310> end<00:04:10.519> up<00:04:10.700> you

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
Spanish moss does it it'll end up you

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.970 
Spanish moss does it it'll end up you
know<00:04:11.629> it<00:04:11.989> can<00:04:12.139> take<00:04:12.290> anywhere<00:04:12.620> from<00:04:12.680> like<00:04:12.950> a

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
know it can take anywhere from like a

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.009 
know it can take anywhere from like a
year<00:04:13.099> to<00:04:13.340> do<00:04:14.150> or<00:04:14.269> five<00:04:14.480> years<00:04:14.689> for<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.959> to

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
year to do or five years for it to

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.650 
year to do or five years for it to
become<00:04:15.170> an<00:04:15.439> issue<00:04:15.560> right<00:04:16.010> but<00:04:16.940> that<00:04:17.299> has<00:04:17.630> a

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
become an issue right but that has a

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.719 
become an issue right but that has a
more<00:04:18.049> rapid<00:04:18.410> growth<00:04:18.440> rate<00:04:18.979> than<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.400> Spanish

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
more rapid growth rate than the Spanish

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:20.949 
more rapid growth rate than the Spanish
moss<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.060> Spanish<00:04:20.359> moss<00:04:20.479> just<00:04:20.720> kind<00:04:20.900> of

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
moss the Spanish moss just kind of

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.050 
moss the Spanish moss just kind of
collects<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.440> starts<00:04:21.680> building<00:04:21.829> on<00:04:22.610> itself

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
collects and starts building on itself

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.180 
collects and starts building on itself
and<00:04:23.419> you<00:04:24.080> know<00:04:24.199> growing<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.830> ends<00:04:25.039> of<00:04:25.130> the

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
and you know growing in the ends of the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.480 
and you know growing in the ends of the
tree<00:04:26.169> that<00:04:27.169> you<00:04:27.229> know<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.710> can<00:04:27.979> have<00:04:28.099> Spanish

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
tree that you know you can have Spanish

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.580 
tree that you know you can have Spanish
moss<00:04:28.639> on<00:04:28.849> your<00:04:28.970> trees<00:04:29.180> for<00:04:29.479> forty<00:04:30.080> years<00:04:30.110> yeah

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
moss on your trees for forty years yeah

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.920 
moss on your trees for forty years yeah
and<00:04:30.770> it<00:04:31.190> could<00:04:31.370> not<00:04:31.550> be<00:04:31.760> a<00:04:31.789> problem<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.419> but

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and it could not be a problem but but

it's not a ton of money but replacing

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.339 
it's not a ton of money but replacing
one<00:04:49.220> of<00:04:49.250> those<00:04:49.400> oaks<00:04:49.669> is<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.060> ton<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.599> absolutely

one of those oaks is a ton of absolutely

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:52.960 
one of those oaks is a ton of absolutely
all<00:04:51.560> right<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:51.860> let's<00:04:52.130> keep<00:04:52.250> our<00:04:52.430> Oaks<00:04:52.610> healthy

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
all right so let's keep our Oaks healthy
