polymer<00:00:44.789> clay<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.239> japan<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.600> two

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
polymer clay here in japan for two

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.410 
polymer clay here in japan for two
reasons<00:00:46.230> one<00:00:47.100> because<00:00:47.340> polymer<00:00:47.850> clay<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.239> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
reasons one because polymer clay here is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
reasons one because polymer clay here is
really<00:00:48.840> really<00:00:49.079> expensive<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.829> too<00:00:50.430> there

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
really really expensive and too there

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.000 
really really expensive and too there
are<00:00:51.030> no<00:00:51.239> ovens<00:00:51.719> equipped<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.260> Japanese<00:00:52.710> homes

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
are no ovens equipped in Japanese homes

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
are no ovens equipped in Japanese homes
I'm<00:00:53.399> not<00:00:53.850> sure<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.750> homes<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.289> i

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
I'm not sure if it's all homes but i

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
I'm not sure if it's all homes but i
know<00:00:55.469> most<00:00:55.770> homes<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.460> an<00:00:56.760> oven<00:00:56.910> you

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
know most homes don't have an oven you

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.330 
know most homes don't have an oven you
would<00:00:57.600> have<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.870> buy<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.020> portable<00:00:58.949> one<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340

paper sticks are I guess by bourbon and
it's<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.740> lease<00:01:14.100> double<00:01:14.670> cast<00:01:14.909> basically<00:01:15.810> there

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
it's a lease double cast basically there

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.810

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.450 
opened one and as you can see this was
only<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.909> hundred<00:01:27.270> yen<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.200> um<00:01:28.439> I<00:01:28.890> don't<00:01:29.100> know

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
only a hundred yen but um I don't know

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.890 
only a hundred yen but um I don't know
if<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.820> would<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.060> considered<00:01:30.390> cheap

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
if that would be considered cheap

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.870 
if that would be considered cheap
because<00:01:31.259> there's<00:01:31.710> only<00:01:31.890> eight<00:01:32.220> pieces<00:01:32.549> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
because there's only eight pieces in

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.390 
because there's only eight pieces in
here<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.140> kind<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.560> understandable

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
here but that's kind of understandable

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.480 
here but that's kind of understandable
since<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> Disney<00:01:37.110> food<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
since it is like a Disney food the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.130 
since it is like a Disney food the
packaging<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:38.939> really<00:01:39.060> really<00:01:39.390> cute<00:01:39.720> there<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
packaging is really really cute there is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.749 
packaging is really really cute there is
this<00:01:40.320> red<00:01:40.619> side<00:01:40.920> for<00:01:41.189> Minnie<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.579> in<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
this red side for Minnie and in a

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.819 
this red side for Minnie and in a
chocolate<00:01:41.970> side<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.659> Mickey<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.259> because

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
chocolate side from Mickey or because

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.160 
chocolate side from Mickey or because
it's<00:01:44.040> strawberry<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.729> chocolate<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
it's strawberry and chocolate so this is

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.440 
it's strawberry and chocolate so this is
what<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> wafer<00:01:46.680> stick<00:01:46.890> looks<00:01:47.159> like<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
what the wafer stick looks like and it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
what the wafer stick looks like and it's
really<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.899> teeny<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.409> guess<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:49.920> about

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
really really teeny I guess it's about

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.679 
really really teeny I guess it's about
the<00:01:50.280> size<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.610> pocket<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.329> would<00:01:51.600> believe

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
the size of a pocket it I would believe

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.090 
the size of a pocket it I would believe
so<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.990> took<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.200> bite<00:01:55.380> from<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:55.619> end<00:01:55.950> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so I just took a bite from one end and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550 
so I just took a bite from one end and
this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> chocolate<00:01:56.790> end<00:01:57.380> then<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:58.530> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this is a chocolate end then on the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.740 
this is a chocolate end then on the
other<00:01:58.649> side<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.490> strawberry<00:01:59.909> end<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
other side is the strawberry end and I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.999 
other side is the strawberry end and I
think<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.049> really<00:02:01.079> cute<00:02:01.409> because<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:01.770> like

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
think it's really cute because it's like

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.350 
think it's really cute because it's like
Mickey<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.490> one<00:02:02.640> side<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.969> mini<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
Mickey on one side of the mini on the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030 
Mickey on one side of the mini on the
other<00:02:03.479> side<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:04.320> you've<00:02:04.530> ever<00:02:04.649> tried<00:02:04.979> this

other side if you've ever tried this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.340 
other side if you've ever tried this
kind<00:02:05.430> of<00:02:05.549> trying<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.329> strawberry<00:02:07.170> chocolate
