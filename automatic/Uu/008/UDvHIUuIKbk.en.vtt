00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.080
 a passionate action of videogames 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 I have not had one for a long time 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 eager to do but had forgotten 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.469
 he has forgotten me for a long time and so 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.469
 well this is a button 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:22.070
 how to make a button and then this 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070
 consists 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.070
 good 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.220
 I think it's good, this is 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.349
 in a good I'm going to talk a little weird 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:38.350
 because if he 's named my voice but 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:41.080
 good good consists of a piece of 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.510
 earth or I do not know what it is that breaks and 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.699
 a door falls or a 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.040
 trap or I do not know well then good in 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.220
 this case I put a piece of sand that 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.840
 camouflage with the sandstone not by itself 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.480
 so then we break him 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.260
 what is called block of sand falls on the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.910
 flour I fall that I break this falls and as 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.460
 if nothing had happened but here it's going to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.800
 see so he could be docked the same way 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 I will teach you how to do this not 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.460
 first they need a structure by 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.490
 say it like that and once is small for 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.990
 what then because it could not be the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.990
 great but like right now no no 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.340
 well here we are going to put the poster here 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.070
 another poster and the sand up here on 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.940
 the second 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.940
 because here the cactus will go 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.230
 then here the poster is going to go 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.230
 say it like that but here go the cactus 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.300
 cactus I have to remove this because the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.940
 cactus can not be next to nothing 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.110
 practically then I'm going to remove this 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.910
 I put the cactus poster up the poster 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.870
 always have to be up remember 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.870
 up up 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.260
 ah 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.759
 and well then we are going to take 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:20.870
 here is going to be the door over here is going to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.620
 report then here we will go 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.430
 putting here what 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.790
 and now we put on again 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.180
 a technical problem that my problem is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.799
 creative this seems to me if it's that we're going 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.269
 to put anti I think he put many 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:43.159
 posters and good here we put posters 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.159
 posters posters 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.200
 chairs ok here we put the sand that goes to 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 so be the door to two because I did 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.760
 two spaces remember if they are going to put 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.150
 two of doors or balances of height of the 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.390
 door have to do two two bears two 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.980
 hollow spaces works and it goes to 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.599
 be medium 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.340
 I did not put more after also good 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.590
 friendship airport 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.450
 then one 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.050
 and now nothing happens 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.050
 pouf 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:28.090
