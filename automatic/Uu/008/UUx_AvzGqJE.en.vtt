00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 After 62 mm of straight rail Japan and of one hundred election line with r's 81 Millie of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.410
 Severe type 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:36.450
 It also comes with two and the outer line there are two do not use anymore this is 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.900
 It is a later joiner 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.610
 In even though I have a of Te near Zu' on the back of the box 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:50.490
 I'd like to put together like this figure Yes Let's set the curve freshness 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:56.440
 This it is the first, I fit off and try to issue a straight rail between 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:00.100
 Four kinds and then this way by cold in the middle of the straight rail like this 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.199
 Length of the entire interval is that become 33 people 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.220
 Keep the same distance as such clothes teacher in that fit the foreshadowing of the Uni-track, so 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.530
 Can and 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.230
 And here 's a straight track lined up with two little fingers and here it comes 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.520
 By using this rail 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.539
 [musics] 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.869
 Here 's the distance here by attaching the rail attached to the sound of linearity 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:26.399
 The distance between the difficult sections is 49.5 third. 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.750
 Now the space is adapted to the structure of support by expanding the two crowns 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.039
 It can be done 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.510
 Yes and I think it would be like using a straight rail in this way 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.850
 Because it seems to be able to reproduce the war coming into the turntable 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.500
 It is a good feeling Yes curve of the Kato turntable extended line set this time 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.940

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:51.710
 Yes, this time this Kanto the curve of a set of turntable extensibility 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.400
 I think that it will be helpful if I try to install this.
