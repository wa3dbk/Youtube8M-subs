thought<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:28.860> had<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> good<00:01:29.189> football

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
thought they really had a good football

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.880 
thought they really had a good football
team<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.060> thought<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.630> loved<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.990> lost<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.530> lot

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
team I thought they loved it lost a lot

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.109 
team I thought they loved it lost a lot
of<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.130> close<00:01:32.340> games<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> thought

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
of good close games but I thought

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.969 
of good close games but I thought
Freeman<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.840> quarterback<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.530> thought

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
Freeman was a good quarterback I thought

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
Freeman was a good quarterback I thought
they<00:01:35.159> landed<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> good<00:01:35.759> coach<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:37.229> were

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
they landed a good coach and they were

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.590 
they landed a good coach and they were
going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> big<00:01:38.640> playoff<00:01:38.880> push<00:01:39.240> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
going to do the big playoff push and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.889 
going to do the big playoff push and
really<00:01:39.930> they<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.409> let<00:01:41.250> me<00:01:41.430> down<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.780> was

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
really they just let me down this was

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.810 
really they just let me down this was
more<00:01:43.079> likely<00:01:43.320> two<00:01:43.619> years<00:01:44.009> ago<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.460> last<00:01:44.610> time

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
more likely two years ago the last time

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.620 
more likely two years ago the last time
the<00:01:45.119> Niners<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> Bucs<00:01:45.990> played<00:01:46.259> at

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
the Niners and the Bucs played at

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.490 
the Niners and the Bucs played at

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
Kevin went to the game and I honestly

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.770 
Kevin went to the game and I honestly
had<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.700> niners<00:01:57.000> weren't<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.420> trying

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
had I the niners weren't really trying

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
had I the niners weren't really trying
to<00:01:58.020> run<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.380> score<00:01:58.469> but<00:01:58.860> honestly<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
to run up the score but honestly it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.190 
to run up the score but honestly it
really<00:01:59.640> felt<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:01.490> this<00:02:02.490> score<00:02:02.759> was<00:02:02.909> like<00:02:03.200> 72

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
really felt like this score was like 72

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.649 
really felt like this score was like 72
the<00:02:04.409> three<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.310> was<00:02:05.670> an<00:02:05.820> ass-kicking<00:02:06.360> whatever

it<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.140> don't<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.439> think<00:02:07.649> we<00:02:07.799> put<00:02:07.979> 10

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it was I don't really think we put 10

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.369 
it was I don't really think we put 10
touchdowns<00:02:08.640> up<00:02:08.789> on<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> board<00:02:09.270> that's<00:02:10.170> hard

touchdowns up on the board that's hard

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.050

to do for any NFL team out there even

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.640 
to do for any NFL team out there even
against<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> worst<00:02:12.720> teams<00:02:13.050> but

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
against the worst teams but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.649 
against the worst teams but
just<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.980> mab<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.250> rouille<00:02:15.060> didn't<00:02:15.329> show<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.480> to

to see them get destroyed on it's just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
to see them get destroyed on it's just
horrible<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.519> mean<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.909> had<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> get<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.239> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
horrible I mean you had to get on the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.520 
horrible I mean you had to get on the
flight<00:02:36.599> fly<00:02:36.900> home<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.500> only

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
flight fly home and that's the only

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.869 
flight fly home and that's the only
thing<00:02:37.739> you're<00:02:37.890> thinking<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.519> just

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
thing you're thinking about is just

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.670 
thing you're thinking about is just
honestly<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.569> how<00:02:40.079> much<00:02:40.260> money<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.530> I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
honestly like how much money that I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.250 
honestly like how much money that I
would<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.280> waste<00:02:41.459> in<00:02:42.090> order<00:02:42.359> to<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.599> my<00:02:43.049> team

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
would just waste in order to see my team

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.520 
would just waste in order to see my team
not<00:02:43.500> even<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:43.799> show<00:02:44.099> up<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> play<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
not even really show up the play and and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.430 
not even really show up the play and and
that<00:02:47.040> was<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.340> start<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.200> Niners<00:02:49.200> rise

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
that was the start of the Niners rise

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.309 
that was the start of the Niners rise
and<00:02:49.889> that<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.250> guess<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.519> can<00:02:50.639> say<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and that I guess you can say that the

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.680 
and that I guess you can say that the
start<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.470> Bucks<00:02:52.769> fall<00:02:53.209> to<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.299> bottom<00:02:54.450> of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
start of the Bucks fall to the bottom of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.809 
start of the Bucks fall to the bottom of
it<00:02:54.810> but<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.079> mean<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:56.190> really<00:02:56.340> have<00:02:56.549> to<00:02:56.609> put<00:02:56.790> a

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it but I mean we really have to put a

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.059 
it but I mean we really have to put a
team<00:02:57.030> together<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:58.049> know<00:02:58.139> Kaepernick<00:02:58.500> SF<00:02:58.920> the
