00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
exercises for back and three sets of

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.729 
exercises for back and three sets of
each<00:00:39.000> that's<00:00:39.899> okay<00:00:40.260> if<00:00:40.379> you're<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.590> beginner

doing that style of training don't be

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.389 
doing that style of training don't be
expecting<00:00:45.570> any<00:00:46.200> great<00:00:46.559> gains<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.160> back

anytime soon it takes it definitely
takes<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.850> lot<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.030> volume<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.170> definitely

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
takes a lot of volume and it definitely

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.560 
takes a lot of volume and it definitely
takes<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.129> variety<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> exercises

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
takes a lot of variety and the exercises

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.810 
takes a lot of variety and the exercises
that<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:54.719> do<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> develop<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.770> great<00:00:55.980> back<00:00:56.280> now

that you do to develop a great back now
I'm<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:57.149> saying<00:00:57.360> do<00:00:57.629> extremely<00:00:58.170> high<00:00:58.440> volume

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
I'm not saying do extremely high volume

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.500 
I'm not saying do extremely high volume
and<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.579> saying<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.059> shouldn't<00:01:00.359> do

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510

need<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.059> those<00:01:03.270> basic<00:01:03.719> principles<00:01:04.260> in

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
need to get those basic principles in

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
need to get those basic principles in
there<00:01:04.650> even<00:01:04.920> if<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.670> high

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
there even if you're doing high

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.940 
there even if you're doing high
intensity<00:01:05.880> trim<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.810> still<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> good

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
intensity trim and still get in a good

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
intensity trim and still get in a good
quality<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.580> want<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> volume<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.390> also<00:01:09.780> get

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
quality and want the volume and also get

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.230 
quality and want the volume and also get
that<00:01:10.110> variety<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.860> well<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:11.970> can

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that variety and as well so as you can

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
that variety and as well so as you can
see<00:01:12.450> from<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.780> workout<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.260> did<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> lot<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
see from this workout I did a lot of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.730 
see from this workout I did a lot of
pooling<00:01:14.070> motions<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.200> change<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
pooling motions I like to just change it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
pooling motions I like to just change it
up<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.189> day<00:01:17.369> I'll<00:01:17.490> focus<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> lot<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.299> pill

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
up one day I'll focus on a lot of pill

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.450 
up one day I'll focus on a lot of pill
emotions<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> then<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> next<00:01:19.860> time<00:01:20.220> we'll

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
emotions and then the next time we'll

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850 
emotions and then the next time we'll
focus<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> Ruin<00:01:21.659> motions<00:01:22.080> just<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:22.799> I

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
focus on a lot of Ruin motions just so I

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.560 
focus on a lot of Ruin motions just so I
can<00:01:22.979> put<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> most<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.000> Baffert<00:01:24.450> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
can put the most of my Baffert in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.749 
can put the most of my Baffert in
Toulouse<00:01:24.840> exercises<00:01:25.680> rather<00:01:26.250> than<00:01:26.520> doing

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
Toulouse exercises rather than doing

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.460 
Toulouse exercises rather than doing
maybe<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.150> rowing<00:01:27.509> motion<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> pool<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
maybe a rowing motion than a pool in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.830 
maybe a rowing motion than a pool in
motion<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> another<00:01:29.340> ruin<00:01:29.729> motion<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.390> tends

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
motion and another ruin motion it tends

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.390 
motion and another ruin motion it tends
to<00:01:30.990> take<00:01:31.320> away<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.829> what<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.070> trying<00:01:32.310> to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to take away from what I'm trying to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.399 
to take away from what I'm trying to
