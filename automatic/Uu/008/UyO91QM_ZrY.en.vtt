same 10 10 1024 x 768 display on the
current<00:01:30.689> model<00:01:31.549> except<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.759> since<00:01:33.000> it'll<00:01:33.210> have

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
current model except is since it'll have

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
current model except is since it'll have
a<00:01:33.390> smaller<00:01:33.689> screen<00:01:34.110> it'll<00:01:34.439> look<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.040> much

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
a smaller screen it'll look so much

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.719 
a smaller screen it'll look so much
better<00:01:35.579> like<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.780> pixel<00:01:37.770> density<00:01:38.159> will<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.430> so

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
better like the pixel density will be so

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.560 
better like the pixel density will be so
much<00:01:39.049> with<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> 8-inch<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.009> rather<00:01:41.220> than

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
much with this 8-inch one rather than

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.810 
much with this 8-inch one rather than
29.7<00:01:42.590> because<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> pics<00:01:43.860> pics<00:01:44.130> are<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.399> more

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
29.7 because the pics pics are just more

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.520 
29.7 because the pics pics are just more
dense<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.360> closer<00:01:45.600> together<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.290> it'll

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
dense more closer together so it'll

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.730 
dense more closer together so it'll
obviously<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> clear<00:01:47.700> clearer<00:01:48.240> picture

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
obviously make a clear clearer picture

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.969 
obviously make a clear clearer picture
and<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:51.210> brought<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.020> guys<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.560> rumor

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and we also brought you guys the rumor

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.179 
and we also brought you guys the rumor
about<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.340> ipad<00:01:53.700> 3<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.799> using<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.890> Retina

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
display and yeah so that's pretty much

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.149 
display and yeah so that's pretty much
old<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.960> retina<00:02:01.259> display<00:02:01.740> stuff<00:02:01.950> we

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
