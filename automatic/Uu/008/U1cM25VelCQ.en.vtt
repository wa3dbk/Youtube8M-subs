 fairs build the indicators who will use in the evaluation 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.330
 in this sixth stage we must take a small step forward 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 stipulate values 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.440
 the problem of values

 so do what 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 Now 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.700
 the values ​​evaluated 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 should be understood in two ways 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.450
 a first way that beautiful physique value in the sense of how important they are 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.100

 our torrent rimini what is 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.320
 the agenda with respect to which to establish values 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.260
 because it must be clear 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.690
 that nothing to you together 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.690
 important an important day 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.040
 well an agenda 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.380
 of tetanian cultural horizon 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.950
 of the preferences of political cultural choices 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.270
 which state that doing certain things is more important than doing things 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.239
 other 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239
 these values ​​cannot adjust the pc 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:16.189
 because you would be the evaluation 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.139
 they must become explicit 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.319
 then
