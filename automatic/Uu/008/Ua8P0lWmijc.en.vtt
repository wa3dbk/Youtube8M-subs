 creativity when ordinary fittings already 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.420
 not enough and you want something 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.640

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.509
 I will answer 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.800
 probably you know my cross passion in 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.650
 mostly i wear earrings in the shape of crosses and 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.390
 here I ordered a form suspension 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.560
 christoph chose the largest 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.140
 which were in stock 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.060
 these pendants under the old bronze with 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.770
 Rhinestones on the site they have a lot 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.500
 flowers but for some reason I wanted 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.830
 it is blue under jeans, I think that such 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.980
 bright summer notes I will have to my 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.980
 wardrobe 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.600
 I do a lot of wedding decorations 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.640
 and wreaths in the necklace and without aluminum 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.350
 wire just can not do as a rule 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.540
 I take aluminum silver wire 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.420
 colors and diameters and ranges from 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.130
 one and a half to two and a half minutes and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.610
 I ordered such a stainless necklace 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.300
 become 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.860
 under the gold but I will not use it 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.590
 how will i use it 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.660
 as a basis for it already 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.690
 make decorations and bake in the oven 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.980
 boldly on this form then I ordered 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.810
 glass beads 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.300
 I don't like plastics I do n't like 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.100
 plastic beads i will order mainly 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.100
 glass ceramics and natural stones 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.590
 you all probably saw and know mine 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.690
 bracelets with leaves they go on 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.580
 metal base on the spring too 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.739
 very hard, we find the basis of 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.959
 all nearby stores I already have it 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.180
 just bought it a long time ago therefore 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.050
 have to order and and 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.360
 directly from China 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.200
 but this time I decided to take a very 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.270
 wide base she is also on a spring then 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.209
 I chose bead caps from 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.060
 zinc alloy they are under old silver 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.860
 made does not contain some lead took 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.560
 copper wire which does not contain 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.840
 nickel and lead wire 0 5 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.420
 millimeters it is extremely rare very rare 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.850
 you will find mostly for some reason they deliver 03 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.280
 very often ask the question where do I get here 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.830
 here are these unusual mysterious fasteners I 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.830
 I order on this site they are dated 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.989
 silver does not contain nickel and lead in 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.750
 same time they are very very very light 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.790
 o conclusion is my fixture for 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.459
 plastic jewelry display which 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:36.280
 spinning there is an opportunity to put 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.829
 batteries but in principle if you know it 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.170
 as a clock mechanism such a twist tone 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.120
 there is still a minute and a half spinning 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.470
 In principle, I do not bother to 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 batteries but maybe over time 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.720
 I insert 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:51.519
 as you already understood waiting for you 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.400
 a lot of cool 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.519
 master classes on this where to get 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.810
 accessories for them you will also know 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.590
 I hope that this review was for you 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.390
 interesting as well as shopping for me 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.859
