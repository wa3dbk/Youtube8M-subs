00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.710 

this<00:00:30.140> one<00:00:30.350> he<00:00:30.470> was<00:00:30.560> like<00:00:30.770> 2<00:00:31.430> 30<00:00:31.670> teams<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.270> the

this one he was like 2 30 teams and the
rest<00:00:32.930> were<00:00:33.079> not<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.070> good<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:34.280> what's<00:00:34.579> easy

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
rest were not that good so what's easy

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.380 
rest were not that good so what's easy
to<00:00:34.820> make<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:36.170> talk<00:00:36.380> to<00:00:36.730> but<00:00:37.730> this<00:00:38.059> season

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
to make it to to talk to but this season

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.670

it was really hard at some point I
thought<00:00:39.890> we<00:00:40.010> wouldn't<00:00:40.280> even<00:00:41.000> make<00:00:41.150> it<00:00:41.360> to<00:00:41.510> top

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
thought we wouldn't even make it to top

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
think that we now have more chance I

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.430 
think that we now have more chance I
think<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:56.610> we<00:03:56.760> are<00:03:56.880> more<00:03:57.750> chances<00:03:58.140> right<00:03:58.290> now

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
think that we are more chances right now

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.670 
think that we are more chances right now
we<00:03:59.340> feel<00:03:59.370> more<00:03:59.910> confident<00:04:00.330> because<00:04:00.600> last<00:04:01.440> year

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
we feel more confident because last year

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.820 
we feel more confident because last year
I<00:04:01.740> believe<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.220> we<00:04:02.940> really<00:04:03.480> went<00:04:03.660> for<00:04:03.750> all<00:04:04.500> in

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
I believe that we really went for all in

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.790 
I believe that we really went for all in
strategy<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.580> it<00:04:06.120> didn't<00:04:06.420> it<00:04:06.750> work<00:04:07.020> but<00:04:07.500> it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
strategy and it didn't it work but it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.120 
strategy and it didn't it work but it
doesn't<00:04:08.130> work<00:04:08.160> all<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.670> time<00:04:08.700> so<00:04:09.540> I<00:04:10.260> think

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
doesn't work all the time so I think

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.090 
doesn't work all the time so I think
right<00:04:11.700> now<00:04:11.910> we're<00:04:12.210> pretty<00:04:12.450> solid<00:04:12.990> and<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.920> have

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
right now we're pretty solid and we have

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.930 
right now we're pretty solid and we have
babies<00:04:14.610> chances<00:04:15.510> to<00:04:15.630> go<00:04:15.780> through<00:04:16.109> Brooks<00:04:16.500> age

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
babies chances to go through Brooks age

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.570 
babies chances to go through Brooks age
