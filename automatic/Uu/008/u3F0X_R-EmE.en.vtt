00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:11.379
 put by all to uncle I am worth and I don't know 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.959
 if you recognize me already published a 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 video here is me I always enjoy weapons of 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:24.550
 mv 2 but it is the first time I published 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.780
 the first video on hiv Due was 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.340
 a video a little because where I can 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.200
 say I was complaining about this game 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 because north 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:41.310
 I didn't like it, it almost made me 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.250
 disgust however after a while published 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.720
 own 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.989
 here is the video started to play 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.250
 started to sauce to know how to play 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.809
 this game 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.780
 I began to experience the thrill of doing 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.270
 the news 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 what they say to that emotion that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:08.490
 there is no black ops two 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.150
 so I started to love this game 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.590
 in fact today I'm just here again with 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.009
 m2 coconut with a nuclear mv 2 with 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.549
 the m tar and if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.500
 the first video I then put on 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.479
 weapons method was always only in this 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.819
 map and you are complaining that they create 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:37.810
 I remembered the name of the map e 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:41.020
 guys can i tell you that even today i don't 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.530
 I remember the name of the perfect map 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.979
 now write me the thousand comments where 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.219
 want 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.970
 where you sign up you want to know the 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:57.520
 so the name of the map goes well apart 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:00.520
 this little little thing I have to say 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.759
 that this is a nice pretty quick look 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.030
 oh well it was to make a nukes with 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.440
 two if that is to have a news done that is not 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.590
 can do anywhere else 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.349
 so make a new that is also 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.640
 easy enough but much easier than 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.609
 make a mob on 2 3 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 that's why here, if anything, the future once 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:26.799
 that you've come to expect a 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.690
 moment that the air and does his duty 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:33.970
 called the support and the nuclear made 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.250
 but anyway I wanted to talk about another 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.590
 topic since now 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:46.370
 since it came out black ops 2 no one 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.330
 that is, I don't see very few if almost 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.670
 no one video on lv two no 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.120
 however they are seen but still many 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.190
 many less but the same also on lv 3 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.460
 now everyone is focusing on 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.350
 wii black ops 2 that 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.940
 in my opinion black ops two is not a 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.100
 very big game in fact I have voice 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.740
 played I got to the maximum of 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.050
 first level first level ie 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.190
 55 I stopped myself I'm not playing 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.300
 more than that, I also appreciated an enemy 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.210
 so I also wanted to push myself a little 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.700
 return from time to time to the old cod 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:27.790
 why 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:32.380
 especially mv 2 life also anxious one 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.140
 certain from that emotion when 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.100
 you are going to move on uk that black 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:41.580
 ops two names as to why also black 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.320
 ops does not have a real goal you say 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.500
 arrival the shaman is not the same thing 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:50.020
 because that is to arrive at the swarm and do 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.620
 a form the soul 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:58.270
 you want to put so it's not the same 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.180
 what and this was a bit my opinion 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.700
 on games then the old ones when it comes out 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.400
 a new call of duty everyone 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.950
 must have to buy on immediately 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.630
 new call of duty and old cowboys 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.180
 I say this because I did too 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.330
 so immediately black ops 2 just came out 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.700
 immediately I have to go to 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:21.040
 buy black ops 2 immediately 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.720
 they went to buy and I am 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:28.830
 regretted guys I regret it 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:33.370
 really so much because on the others cod 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:35.980
 the connection counts a lot 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.760
 like all fall of duty but on black 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.240
 ops two boys 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.070
 and an exaggerated thing I don't know if you have 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:49.310
 having seen the director video , I 'll do it 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.440
 see what it meant and what it means 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.960
 have four notches and what it means 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:00.340
 having 32 as well as three there is a 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.160
 an abysmal difference between the two 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.160
 anyway guys and since the video is 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:11.479
 to finish is a video because it is issued six 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:14.380
 minutes talking about nuclear power either 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.240
 too fast, however, the nuclear one 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.920
 for those who have n't seen the first video 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.780
 here on the huge lake 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.620

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:33.280

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.850
 where I base myself the tract only 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.040
