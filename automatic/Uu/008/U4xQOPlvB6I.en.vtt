went i believe around 15 you know and
the<00:01:16.409> UMP<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.570> very<00:01:19.110> overpowered

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the UMP is very very very overpowered

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
the UMP is very very very overpowered
but<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.590> used<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.009> fashion<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:24.200> was<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
but I used it in a fashion that I was it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
but I used it in a fashion that I was it
was<00:01:25.950> somewhat<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:26.939> although<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> UMP<00:01:27.810> is

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
was somewhat even although the UMP is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.880 
was somewhat even although the UMP is
obviously<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.210> gun<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.930> overpowered<00:01:31.530> even

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
obviously a gun that is overpowered even

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.210 
obviously a gun that is overpowered even
amusing<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:33.290> I've<00:01:34.290> been<00:01:34.500> trying<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
amusing so I've been trying to use the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.270 
amusing so I've been trying to use the
mp5k<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.810> sometimes<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.100> doesn't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
mp5k but sometimes it just doesn't

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
mp5k but sometimes it just doesn't
really<00:01:38.490> work<00:01:38.820> out<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
really work out with me because of the

meters so trying to get anybody anybody

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.420 
meters so trying to get anybody anybody
long<00:01:51.840> range

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
long range

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.510 
long range
you're<00:01:52.580> done<00:01:52.760> and<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.720> like<00:01:54.320> playing<00:01:54.560> medium<00:01:55.370> to

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.180 
you're done and I like playing medium to
short<00:01:55.550> range<00:01:55.940> whatever<00:01:56.270> clothes<00:01:56.570> at<00:01:56.780> SMG<00:01:57.190> but

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
short range whatever clothes at SMG but

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.780 
short range whatever clothes at SMG but
sometimes<00:01:58.730> you'll<00:01:58.970> need<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.270> pull<00:02:00.170> off<00:02:00.350> the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
sometimes you'll need to pull off the

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.010 
sometimes you'll need to pull off the
longer<00:02:01.790> range<00:02:01.940> right<00:02:02.860> so<00:02:03.860> I<00:02:04.690> decided<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.810> rush

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
longer range right so I decided to rush

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.660 
longer range right so I decided to rush
around<00:02:06.050> this<00:02:06.440> way<00:02:06.620> because<00:02:06.860> last<00:02:07.160> time<00:02:07.340> was<00:02:07.640> a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
around this way because last time was a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.840 
around this way because last time was a
person<00:02:08.149> camping<00:02:08.619> you're<00:02:09.619> waiting<00:02:10.039> watching

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
person camping you're waiting watching

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.699 
person camping you're waiting watching
the<00:02:11.150> flank<00:02:11.450> which<00:02:11.720> I<00:02:11.840> was<00:02:11.959> doing<00:02:12.260> on<00:02:12.410> that

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
the flank which I was doing on that

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.640 
the flank which I was doing on that
little<00:02:12.830> bin<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:13.570> he<00:02:14.570> wasn't<00:02:14.780> there<00:02:15.020> so<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.620> just

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
little bin and he wasn't there so I just

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.760 
little bin and he wasn't there so I just
start<00:02:16.040> running<00:02:16.820> around<00:02:17.240> looking<00:02:18.080> for<00:02:18.380> some

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:25.000 
computer's crap and I'm previewing a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.379 
computer's crap and I'm previewing a
quarter<00:06:25.419> all<00:06:26.080> through<00:06:26.440> my<00:06:27.190> sony<00:06:27.520> vegas<00:06:27.849> crash

yet<00:06:28.780> again<00:06:29.280> so<00:06:30.280> um<00:06:31.210> i<00:06:32.139> had<00:06:32.590> to<00:06:32.800> reset<00:06:33.310> the

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
yet again so um i had to reset the

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.879 
yet again so um i had to reset the
microphone<00:06:34.419> volume<00:06:34.449> and<00:06:35.050> everything<00:06:35.409> and<00:06:35.710> I

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
microphone volume and everything and I

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.439 
microphone volume and everything and I
can't<00:06:36.159> remember<00:06:36.280> what<00:06:36.460> I<00:06:36.550> exactly<00:06:37.060> had<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.330> at

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
can't remember what I exactly had it at

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.309 
can't remember what I exactly had it at
so<00:06:37.690> this<00:06:38.650> is<00:06:38.860> kind<00:06:39.130> of<00:06:39.310> another<00:06:39.759> test<00:06:40.719> video<00:06:41.020> on

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:41.319 
so this is kind of another test video on

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:44.219 
so this is kind of another test video on
the<00:06:41.500> microphone<00:06:41.800> volume<00:06:42.130> for<00:06:42.880> me<00:06:43.229> hopefully

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:44.229 
the microphone volume for me hopefully

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:46.620 
the microphone volume for me hopefully
it'll<00:06:44.710> be<00:06:44.740> a<00:06:44.830> little<00:06:44.919> bit<00:06:45.069> better<00:06:45.219> but<00:06:46.210> I<00:06:46.479> guess

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
it'll be a little bit better but I guess

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.070 
it'll be a little bit better but I guess
we'll<00:06:46.810> find<00:06:47.319> out

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 
we'll find out

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.730 
we'll find out
so<00:06:48.889> my<00:06:49.789> headset<00:06:50.210> is<00:06:50.509> turtle<00:06:51.139> beach<00:06:51.289> you<00:06:51.560> guys
