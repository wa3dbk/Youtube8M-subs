00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.630 
been noticing that every time I sit down
in<00:01:52.200> front<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> TV<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> game<00:01:53.369> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
in front of the TV to see a game and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
in front of the TV to see a game and
India<00:01:54.180> losses<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:54.689> i<00:01:54.720> stopped<00:01:55.110> watching<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
India losses so i stopped watching the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.950 
India losses so i stopped watching the
game<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.509> when<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> don't<00:01:57.780> watch<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.290> wind<00:01:58.469> so

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
game and when I don't watch the wind so

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.510 
game and when I don't watch the wind so
probably<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.079> should<00:02:01.320> not<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.500> commentating<00:02:02.430> on
