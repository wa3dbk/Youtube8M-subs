where<00:03:12.900> you've<00:03:13.020> actually<00:03:13.140> got<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.560> play<00:03:13.740> a

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
where you've actually got to play a

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.070 
where you've actually got to play a
microbe<00:03:14.280> coins<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:14.970> that's<00:03:15.420> frustrating

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
microbe coins for it that's frustrating

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.680 
microbe coins for it that's frustrating
me<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:17.070> else<00:03:17.250> is<00:03:17.490> there<00:03:17.730> basically

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
me and what else is there basically

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:19.940 
me and what else is there basically
limit<00:03:18.990> on<00:03:19.110> how<00:03:19.140> many<00:03:19.290> players<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.710> can<00:03:19.770> have

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
limit on how many players you can have

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.310 
limit on how many players you can have
in<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.100> club<00:03:20.310> because<00:03:20.640> if<00:03:20.910> I<00:03:21.180> could<00:03:21.420> open<00:03:21.930> up

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
in the club because if I could open up

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.830 
in the club because if I could open up
some<00:03:22.830> five<00:03:23.220> more<00:03:23.580> player<00:03:24.060> slots<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.720> going

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
some five more player slots it's going

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.380 
some five more player slots it's going
to<00:03:24.930> cost<00:03:25.050> me<00:03:25.170> thirty-five<00:03:25.920> thousand<00:03:26.580> GP

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
to cost me thirty-five thousand GP

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.600 
to cost me thirty-five thousand GP
because<00:03:27.630> currently<00:03:27.960> we<00:03:28.080> only<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.590> 95<00:03:29.220> spot

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
because currently we only have 95 spot

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.430 
because currently we only have 95 spot
which<00:03:30.120> is<00:03:30.300> annoying<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:31.020> because<00:03:31.320> of<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
which is annoying just because of the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.120 
which is annoying just because of the
price<00:03:31.710> ranges<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.900> price<00:03:34.140> ranges<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
price ranges and the price ranges of the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.970 
price ranges and the price ranges of the
GP<00:03:35.550> has<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.970> does<00:03:36.150> as<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.080> do<00:03:37.260> increase<00:03:37.740> the

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
GP has it does as you do increase the

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.950 
GP has it does as you do increase the
player<00:03:38.190> slots<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.060> give<00:03:39.240> away<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.480> dubious

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:39.960 
player slots so we give away a dubious

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.450 
player slots so we give away a dubious
penalty<00:03:40.170> they're<00:03:40.500> taking<00:03:40.890> it's<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.040> free<00:03:41.250> one

Buffon to make it 5-1 and walk with a
5-1<00:04:08.459> victory<00:04:08.670> which<00:04:09.450> was<00:04:09.660> annoying<00:04:09.900> but

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
5-1 victory which was annoying but

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.620 
5-1 victory which was annoying but
there's<00:04:10.530> still<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:11.010> few<00:04:11.820> games<00:04:12.000> left<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.510> try

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
there's still a few games left to try

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.510 
there's still a few games left to try
and<00:04:12.840> push<00:04:12.990> into<00:04:13.200> Division<00:04:13.740> five<00:04:13.920> and<00:04:14.250> I<00:04:14.459> think

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
and push into Division five and I think

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.250 
and push into Division five and I think
this<00:04:14.790> will<00:04:14.940> actually<00:04:15.120> be<00:04:15.390> happening<00:04:15.840> for<00:04:16.200> the

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260
