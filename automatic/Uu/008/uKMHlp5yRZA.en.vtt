00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 and if you leave a how do you know that 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.759
 me it's really very very very good 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.350
 I hope you and the form that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.490
 tourism needs your side in everything 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.900
 case now aside from the guys this is going 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 very well so today league 1 is 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.130
 find for a new video a 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.750
 little tutoring hospitals a new episode of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.670
 my tips series tips with all 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 the weapons of call of duty ghost so 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.680
 I really hope you like it 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.150
 so today the erasers is found 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 for a weapon that is well worth the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.580
 detour 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 I think you all know her 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.539
 I just talked about the remington r5 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.699
 which for me is one of the best 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.349
 assault girls from this game with two 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.090
 other other assault rifles that 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.430
 are sick or badges hours and the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.600
 this is three bonfations I am 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 repeat remington r5 aka 12 and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.269
 there at the nevada so here are rifles 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.920
 of assault that I advise you they 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:45.149
 are doing very very badly and so that's so 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.620
 without them waiting will go to the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.500
 class who use it with this weapon 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.909
 so that's how I usually go 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.070
 reread a little bit the comment that 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.000
 call of duty therefore offers us they 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.280
 say it's an automatic weapon 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.469
 with damage and paellas range 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 increased with a higher rate of study 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.870
 made for mr stability so me my opinion 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.699
 on it 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.739
 what I think about it is that it's a 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.009
 weapon that has a very good pace 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.810
 one of the largely enough damage he 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.830
 was wearing very high and it's really this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.649
 which makes the charm of tears it's up to 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.130
 to say that in carrying away tears su very 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.030
 quickly 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.979
 this is at the level of my stats so I 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.569
 a ratio of 1 86 with art so it goes 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.250
 it's a good ratio I have a precision of 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:28.270
 20 % I'm not moving too much we're going to say 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.710
 so here you go 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.909
 yeah that's all for the update 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 accessories that I advise you 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.119
 on this weapon so it's very simple it 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.280
 there are two that really wake me up 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.830
 head so the silencer as usual 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.180
 guys it improves the accuracy of 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.680
 rejections will clarify my tears was only 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 really thought when you play with 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.180
 maybe not in the art design on 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.979
 can see there but when you play with 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.170
 tears she really makes me think of 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.880
 one cm 900 men it was called like 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.619
 alarmed that we had in the rifle 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.640
 assault that we had this morning around 3 and 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.290
 so here at the level of 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.850
 accessories so the muffler like 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.670
 usually one to reduce a little bit 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.690
 hindsight it reduces the scope but 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.560
 like to say that she has a range 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.030
 quite important 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.890
 that's impact and not too much on the soul 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.509
 and here we are I advise you then 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.920
 any accessories on it I put the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.880
 laser sight because tonight 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.080
 I did not know I felt 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.850
 really comfortable with mazers visas 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.830
 but there are two that I put very 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.040
 often it's either the laser sight or 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.269
 the charger great cape our crises 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.410
 to laser because I have a better shoot 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.500
 with I am more comfortable 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.120
 the only drawback is that it has 24 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.989
 bullets in the magazine 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.459
 as you can see she has a 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.329
 good pace in his stats the balls 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.620
 very quickly 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.090
 and there it is a little pity 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.310
 if you put the charger big 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.840
 capacity it seems like she's 36 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.400
 much more interesting especially that the 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.040
 tank has great abilities also gives 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.420
 50% additional ammunition per donation 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.209
 extra in all chargers 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.510
 and so here is at the level of stocks 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.530
 quickly so my overall opinion is 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.530
 a weapon that I can really you 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.209
 advise a weapon that kills very 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.620
 quickly by the way to the second 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.600
 part of the video so a part will have 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.650
 little gameplay sequences that I 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.880
 want to do with this art would give you 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.260
 actually my advice and so here is 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.850
 so I immediately had no more 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.209
 wait to get to the part of the 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.120
 video 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.560
 and then that's it and so here we are 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.730
 find for the part of the video so 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.769
 the part where I cut some 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.209
 gameplay sequences with tablets 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.430
 remington we can see that it falls 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:18.290
 really very very quickly a minimal decline 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.010
 frankly not go a scope 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.120
 optimal 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.070
 and that's really what was maybe 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.989
 it is a mechaet remits of tears finally 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.579
 in short, I hope you enjoyed the video 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.170
 if this is the case please drop a 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.910

 really great fun do not hesitate to 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.329
 share the video it's meant to help 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.370
