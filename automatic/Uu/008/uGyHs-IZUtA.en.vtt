mounts to have this thing sitting at a
good<00:02:28.209> right<00:02:28.480> height<00:02:29.010> hopefully<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.129> can<00:02:30.310> see

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
good right height hopefully we can see

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.809 
good right height hopefully we can see
that<00:02:30.670> there<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.780> looks<00:02:31.930> like<00:02:32.079> it's<00:02:32.260> about

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
that there and it looks like it's about

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.850 
that there and it looks like it's about
probably<00:02:33.819> about<00:02:33.970> five<00:02:34.420> millimeters<00:02:35.019> all<00:02:35.709> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
probably about five millimeters all the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.610 
probably about five millimeters all the
way<00:02:35.950> around<00:02:36.280> I<00:02:36.780> ended<00:02:37.780> up<00:02:37.870> having<00:02:38.049> the<00:02:38.319> clip

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620

way around I ended up having the clip
the<00:02:38.799> front<00:02:39.040> body<00:02:39.250> mounts<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.760> get<00:02:39.909> them<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.180> sit

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
the front body mounts to get them to sit

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.360 
the front body mounts to get them to sit

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370
