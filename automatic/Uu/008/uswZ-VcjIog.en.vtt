had<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> hole<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.490> through<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.850> I've<00:01:11.939> had<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
had a hole going through it I've had to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
had a hole going through it I've had to
put<00:01:12.360> wood<00:01:13.170> Patchen<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.920> number<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.310> times

put wood Patchen in a number of times

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.380 
put wood Patchen in a number of times
because<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.450> pic<00:01:15.720> hit<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.650> lightly

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
because the pic hit it just lightly

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.149

three<00:01:18.390> million<00:01:18.720> times<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.290> eventually<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
three million times and eventually that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.770 
three million times and eventually that
started<00:01:20.460> wearing<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.210> eventually

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
started wearing through and eventually

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.450 
started wearing through and eventually
you<00:01:21.900> know<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.500> didn't<00:01:22.740> put<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.130> stuff<00:01:23.340> in

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.749 
you know if I didn't put some stuff in
it<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.880> would<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.060> big<00:01:24.420> holes<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
it it would have big holes in it and

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:28.039

deciding to get good for me it was like

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.700 
deciding to get good for me it was like
for<00:02:14.430> years<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.880> played<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.480> I<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.530> started

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
for years I played and I kind of started

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.710 
for years I played and I kind of started
late<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.040> started<00:02:17.460> wood<00:02:17.730> started<00:02:18.240> playing<00:02:18.510> when

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
late I started wood started playing when

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.800 
late I started wood started playing when
I<00:02:18.780> was<00:02:18.959> like<00:02:19.080> in<00:02:19.110> my<00:02:19.290> 20s<00:02:19.319> so<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:21.360> really

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
I was like in my 20s so I I really

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
I was like in my 20s so I I really
thought<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.440> I<00:02:22.590> wasn't<00:02:22.920> ever<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> be

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
thought that I wasn't ever going to be

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.410 
thought that I wasn't ever going to be
very<00:02:23.610> good<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.420> even<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.520> played<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.550> lot<00:02:26.819> but<00:02:27.390> I

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
very good so I even I played a lot but I

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.699 
very good so I even I played a lot but I
didn't<00:02:27.690> necessarily<00:02:27.810> try<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.290> get<00:02:28.500> good<00:02:28.620> if

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
didn't necessarily try to get good if

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860 
didn't necessarily try to get good if
something<00:02:29.400> was<00:02:29.490> kind<00:02:29.700> of<00:02:29.730> hard<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.209> just<00:02:30.690> kind

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
something was kind of hard I just kind

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.400 
something was kind of hard I just kind
of<00:02:30.930> thought<00:02:31.459> that's<00:02:32.459> pretty<00:02:32.880> hard<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.450> can't<00:02:34.230> do

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
of thought that's pretty hard I can't do

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.500 
of thought that's pretty hard I can't do
that<00:02:34.560> probably<00:02:35.100> there's<00:02:35.610> people<00:02:35.910> who<00:02:36.000> started

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
that probably there's people who started

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.480 
that probably there's people who started
when<00:02:36.630> they<00:02:36.720> were<00:02:36.780> four<00:02:37.170> years<00:02:37.410> old<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.980> so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
when they were four years old and so

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.640 
when they were four years old and so
I'll<00:02:38.850> never<00:02:39.030> be<00:02:39.209> very<00:02:39.420> good<00:02:39.690> now<00:02:40.320> what<00:02:40.530> I've

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
I'll never be very good now what I've

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.410 
I'll never be very good now what I've
kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> changed<00:02:41.520> my<00:02:41.700> mind<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
kind of changed my mind on that and I

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.250 
kind of changed my mind on that and I
thought<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:43.020> know<00:02:43.140> what<00:02:43.319> out<00:02:43.830> I'll<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.670> good

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
thought you know what out I'll be good

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.540 
thought you know what out I'll be good
so<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.290> started<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:46.800> going<00:02:47.160> after<00:02:47.430> things

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
so I started like going after things

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.180 
so I started like going after things
that<00:02:47.700> were<00:02:47.850> harder<00:02:48.239> and<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.860> know<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.160> a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
that were harder and you know for a

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.130 
that were harder and you know for a
while<00:02:50.310> it's<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.610> like<00:02:50.730> beginning<00:02:51.330> was<00:02:51.600> it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
while it's just like beginning was it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
while it's just like beginning was it
not<00:02:52.380> standard<00:02:52.860> tuning<00:02:53.190> I<00:02:53.370> wouldn't<00:02:53.760> even<00:02:53.820> try

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
not standard tuning I wouldn't even try

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.030 
not standard tuning I wouldn't even try
it<00:02:54.180> because<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.900> thought<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.320> don't<00:02:55.739> feel<00:02:55.860> like

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
it because I thought I don't feel like

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.660 
it because I thought I don't feel like
retuning<00:02:56.519> my<00:02:56.670> guitar<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.800> just<00:02:59.400> started

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
retuning my guitar so I just started

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.490 
retuning my guitar so I just started
when<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.360> changed<00:03:00.660> my<00:03:00.750> mind<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.080> thought<00:03:01.230> you

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
when I changed my mind I thought you

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.199 
when I changed my mind I thought you
know<00:03:01.590> what<00:03:01.680> I'll<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.070> I'm<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.820> going<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.060> get

all<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.900> eventually<00:03:40.440> because<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:40.620> kept<00:03:40.829> on

play a mandolin you know I networked for

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.589 
play a mandolin you know I networked for
a<00:05:07.159> while<00:05:07.310> like<00:05:07.490> you<00:05:07.669> know<00:05:07.819> that<00:05:08.000> I<00:05:08.240> started

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
a while like you know that I started

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.600 
a while like you know that I started
with<00:05:08.960> piano<00:05:09.409> and<00:05:09.530> then<00:05:09.620> went<00:05:09.800> to<00:05:09.830> guitar<00:05:10.190> and

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
with piano and then went to guitar and

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.580 
with piano and then went to guitar and
then<00:05:10.759> I<00:05:11.479> think<00:05:11.810> maybe<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.169> third<00:05:12.319> instrument

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.270 
then I think maybe the third instrument
I<00:05:12.770> tried<00:05:13.009> was<00:05:13.220> the<00:05:13.250> mandolin<00:05:13.819> and<00:05:15.039> it<00:05:16.039> just

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
right now it's kind of like when I'm

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.670 
right now it's kind of like when I'm
soloing<00:05:58.699> there's<00:05:59.449> about<00:05:59.719> two<00:05:59.990> or<00:06:00.110> three<00:06:00.139> spots

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
soloing there's about two or three spots

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.149 
soloing there's about two or three spots
on<00:06:00.979> a<00:06:01.039> guitar<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.580> I'll<00:06:01.849> I'll<00:06:02.120> solo<00:06:02.659> in

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
on a guitar that I'll I'll solo in

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.040 
on a guitar that I'll I'll solo in
depending<00:06:04.159> on<00:06:04.250> what<00:06:04.460> key<00:06:04.639> I'm<00:06:04.759> in<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.120> I

depending on what key I'm in and I

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.559 
depending on what key I'm in and I
thought<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.740> would<00:06:06.800> be<00:06:06.919> cool<00:06:07.159> to<00:06:07.400> really<00:06:08.300> know

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
thought it would be cool to really know

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.240 
thought it would be cool to really know
the<00:06:08.990> whole<00:06:09.169> neck<00:06:09.409> of<00:06:09.529> the<00:06:09.590> guitar<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:09.889> be<00:06:10.069> able

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.250 
the whole neck of the guitar and be able

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.820 
the whole neck of the guitar and be able
to<00:06:10.340> solo<00:06:10.580> all<00:06:10.819> the<00:06:10.940> way<00:06:11.090> up<00:06:11.240> so<00:06:11.509> it<00:06:12.289> takes<00:06:12.529> time

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
to solo all the way up so it takes time

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.010 
to solo all the way up so it takes time
you<00:06:12.860> know<00:06:13.190> we<00:06:13.310> have<00:06:13.430> to<00:06:13.580> find<00:06:14.150> stuff<00:06:14.569> and<00:06:14.840> you

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:15.020 
you know we have to find stuff and you

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.540 
you know we have to find stuff and you
have<00:06:15.110> to<00:06:15.169> really<00:06:15.560> spend<00:06:15.680> a<00:06:15.889> lot<00:06:16.039> of<00:06:16.069> time<00:06:16.340> with

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
have to really spend a lot of time with

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.439 
have to really spend a lot of time with
it<00:06:16.729> and<00:06:16.909> get<00:06:17.419> comfortable<00:06:17.750> with<00:06:17.990> it<00:06:18.050> and<00:06:19.449> but

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.029 
it and get comfortable with it and but
it's<00:06:20.690> something<00:06:20.900> that<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.199> enjoy<00:06:21.229> so<00:06:21.770> it's<00:06:21.919> not

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039 
it's something that I enjoy so it's not

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.700 
it's something that I enjoy so it's not
like<00:06:22.389> laboring<00:06:23.389> and<00:06:23.690> I<00:06:23.750> think<00:06:24.169> I<00:06:24.259> kind<00:06:24.469> of<00:06:24.529> want

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:26.680 
like laboring and I think I kind of want
to<00:06:24.770> do<00:06:24.860> it<00:06:24.979> it's<00:06:25.370> something<00:06:25.580> I'm<00:06:25.759> into<00:06:26.150> and<00:06:26.360> so

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
to do it it's something I'm into and so

to do it it's something I'm into and so
it<00:06:26.840> makes<00:06:27.050> it<00:06:27.139> so<00:06:27.319> much<00:06:27.380> easier<00:06:27.500> to<00:06:27.860> do<00:06:28.039> it<00:06:28.190> um

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:28.840 
it makes it so much easier to do it um

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.320 
it makes it so much easier to do it um
