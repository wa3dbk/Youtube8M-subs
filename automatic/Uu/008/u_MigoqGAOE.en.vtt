00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.930
 yo everybody knows how to help and we get 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.779
 find today for a tutorial so 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.359
 there you see my the actor so actually 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.340
 I kill everything will serve to arrange to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.140
 better or two months trying to fix 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 your lenses if she does not read the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 games so here's one time you go 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.660
 it was that stage that is necessary 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.120
 completely disassemble the drive just 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.190
 if there is still this drawer grated by 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.870
 know it's not a problem 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.730
 I took them for more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.260
 easy but know that it is not 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 annoying at all so here i'm just going 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.030
 show you that the tech console 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.789
 why an ope that the console does not read 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.850
 not the games so the up 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.120
 the game turns a half second and the game 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.189
 stop 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.140
 so here I am just going to show you 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:12.990
 way on the interface that he marked there 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.159
 open the reader we will open the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 reader in that she really does not read 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.310
 of view and I 'm going to show you how 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.299
 arrange 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 this is so we remove everything we see 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.040
 to turn off the console knock down 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.450
 for security reasons 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.460
 we never know with the readers of this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 who can happen so here you are 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.840
 take your reader upside down and there 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.159
 you may not be able to see well 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 wait for it to be on the short day there 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.310
 you have two screws here and here next to 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.369
 each marked a little letter here at 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.740
 to mark d here is so the death 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.450
 for games dvd and cc for 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
 cd engraved divx etc 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.960
 so in fact what will happen is 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.409
 when you are going to turn for the towards the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.060
 right 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.560
 you will increase when you go 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.590
 turn to the left you go 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.820
 reduce 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:07.240
 I will explain to you so you take 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.129
 a donation measuring device that makes 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.140
 mill man kg men and so I'm going 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.920
 try with the camera to place but that 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.940
 is going to be very hard hard 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.140
 so you have to put the most so 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.349
 usually it's red 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.390
 here so in fact there are two solders to 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.540
 on the left you pass on that of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.980
 up we'll try to handle that they 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.250
 know to new york hutin it's going to be very 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.989
 hard in hand and black and on the weld 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.880
 right there is only one so this is 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:47.220
 not very complicated I do not know how 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.220
 I will do good here but we will try 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.260
 in the worst case what I will do is 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.530
 that I will ask the camera just the time 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 to do 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.819
 here I come to do it and there we could 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.580
 see actually I was at 7.10 so me this 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:12.230
 than what I advise as a setting 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.239
 it is to be around 5 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.209
 it's really muc so here we go 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.940
 reduce a little hop you have to turn 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.260
 really light such as I'm going 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.920
 look at how many years I'm laying 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.980
 just the camera the time to watch on 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.459
 maybe can hold and yeah that's it 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.459
 nickel 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.650
 so here I am I am at 5 36 so 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.450
 honestly 5.36 I think that's 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.370
 rather not bad 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.220
 we'll see that right now I think 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.390
 it should work at 5.36 it is safe 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.160
 you must not find yourself 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.080
 above 7 and especially not below 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.330
 of 3 so that's why I'm telling you 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.220
 about 5 what is the average it's 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.080
 rather not bad so we will test everything from 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.550
 after 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:10.420
 let's see now that I settle them on 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.880
 out of 5 36 if it works it can be that 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.620
 it does not work by the first shot 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.019
 and if it does not work I would go down 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:21.210
 maybe a little bit we'll see so I turn on 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.800
 the console here we already see that the game 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.990
 do not stop what is extremely 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.230
 good sign yeah so the game does not stop 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.730
 not what is really good sign 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.070
 I use an old game in case of a test and 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.770
 so that's normal I say if phaneuf is 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.530
 so here we can see that this is the 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.150
 console bed perfectly 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.930
 so here I hope you soon will be 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.730
 very useful 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.320
 and so that was rosette 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.510
 do not forget the little green thumb if that 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.100
 you have been useful and if it does not work 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.790
 you have to change the 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.370
 optical block 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.660
 so we need to change this maybe 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.130
 that I will do a tutorial to explain 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.740
 how to change it I do not know yet 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.970
 it's not very complicated 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.620
 especially that it depends the readers in 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.729
 do so so here I hope you get away 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.890
 you will have enjoyed just one last 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.710
 levis parenthesis are not obliged to 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.350
 to be there look like here they are 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.900
 find on the tablecloth on this one there is 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.860
 find below the tablecloth and so you 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.340
 have several models but there will be 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.590
 So there always screw with two screws 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.060
 score tests all the time so 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.520
 you remember that's the letter 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.440
 as soon as you have to change and that was 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.310
 Droz help this tutorial how to arrange 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.310
 his lens
