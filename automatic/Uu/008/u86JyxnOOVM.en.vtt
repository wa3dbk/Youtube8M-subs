00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and then you're just going to use s to

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.040 
and then you're just going to use s to
scale<00:04:09.069> it<00:04:09.280> up<00:04:09.489> to<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.879> right<00:04:10.120> size

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.070 

and<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:15.130> some<00:04:15.280> cases<00:04:15.580> you<00:04:15.880> may<00:04:15.910> have<00:04:16.120> to<00:04:16.300> press

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
and in some cases you may have to press

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.860 
and in some cases you may have to press
like<00:04:17.110> SX<00:04:17.860> to<00:04:18.340> scale<00:04:18.700> this<00:04:18.880> but<00:04:19.300> we<00:04:19.570> don't<00:04:19.720> move

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
like SX to scale this but we don't move

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.440 
like SX to scale this but we don't move
to<00:04:20.970> Alex<00:04:21.970> all<00:04:22.540> right<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:24.850> there<00:04:25.060> now<00:04:25.210> we<00:04:25.270> have

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
to Alex all right so there now we have

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.970 
to Alex all right so there now we have
our<00:04:25.590> basic<00:04:26.590> gun<00:04:27.040> pretty<00:04:27.430> much<00:04:27.640> and<00:04:28.030> then

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
our basic gun pretty much and then

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.500 
our basic gun pretty much and then
what's<00:04:29.980> new<00:04:30.190> about<00:04:30.220> this<00:04:30.520> tutorial<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.210> the

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
what's new about this tutorial is the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.270 
what's new about this tutorial is the
top<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:32.410> can<00:04:32.560> actually<00:04:32.740> change<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.670> look

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
top we can actually change to look

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.950 
top we can actually change to look
better<00:04:36.280> than<00:04:36.520> just<00:04:36.910> like<00:04:37.060> a<00:04:38.160> repeated<00:04:39.160> pattern

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
better than just like a repeated pattern

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.230 
better than just like a repeated pattern
so<00:04:40.960> just<00:04:41.920> select<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.520> top<00:04:42.930> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:45.240> press

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
so just select the top and then press

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.900 
so just select the top and then press
one<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:48.600> then<00:04:49.600> project<00:04:50.290> from<00:04:50.440> view<00:04:50.790> so<00:04:51.790> you

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
one and then project from view so you

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.670 
one and then project from view so you
just<00:04:52.120> take<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.450> good<00:04:52.600> part<00:04:52.810> of<00:04:52.870> this<00:04:52.960> gun<00:04:53.200> and

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
just take the good part of this gun and

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.150 
just take the good part of this gun and
it'll<00:04:53.950> look<00:04:54.550> pretty<00:04:54.670> good<00:04:54.820> like<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:59.160> so

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
it'll look pretty good like that so

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.790 
it'll look pretty good like that so
there<00:05:00.310> now<00:05:00.460> we<00:05:00.520> have<00:05:00.670> our<00:05:00.760> gun<00:05:01.500> I'm<00:05:02.500> gonna<00:05:02.620> get

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
there now we have our gun I'm gonna get

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.470 
there now we have our gun I'm gonna get
a<00:05:02.860> background<00:05:03.160> image<00:05:03.460> I'm<00:05:03.880> gonna<00:05:04.030> take<00:05:04.210> awakes

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
a background image I'm gonna take awakes

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.100 
a background image I'm gonna take awakes
don't<00:05:04.840> really<00:05:05.020> need<00:05:05.170> it<00:05:05.290> anymore<00:05:06.540> then<00:05:07.540> I'm

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
don't really need it anymore then I'm

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.340 
don't really need it anymore then I'm
rotating<00:05:08.590> it<00:05:08.920> up<00:05:09.840> so<00:05:10.840> then<00:05:10.990> now<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:11.140> we<00:05:11.320> have

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
rotating it up so then now that we have

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.030 
rotating it up so then now that we have
our<00:05:11.500> gun<00:05:11.730> um<00:05:12.730> if<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.510> press<00:05:13.780> render<00:05:14.050> the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
our gun um if you press render the

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.340 
our gun um if you press render the
texture<00:05:15.550> doesn't<00:05:15.880> render<00:05:16.030> but<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.110> does<00:05:17.320> work

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
texture doesn't render but it does work

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.460 
texture doesn't render but it does work
in<00:05:17.980> the<00:05:18.400> game<00:05:18.610> engine<00:05:20.010> if<00:05:21.010> my<00:05:21.550> game<00:05:21.820> engine

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
in the game engine if my game engine

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.170 
in the game engine if my game engine
yeah<00:05:23.470> it'll<00:05:23.800> it'll<00:05:24.130> work<00:05:24.370> in<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.640> game<00:05:24.820> engine

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
yeah it'll it'll work in the game engine

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.570 
yeah it'll it'll work in the game engine
but<00:05:25.420> it<00:05:25.510> won't<00:05:25.690> work<00:05:25.960> in<00:05:26.230> there<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.430> can

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
but it won't work in there so you can

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.810 
but it won't work in there so you can
fix<00:05:27.850> that<00:05:28.090> oh<00:05:29.370> also<00:05:30.370> if<00:05:30.550> you're<00:05:30.730> using<00:05:30.880> Jill<00:05:31.450> SL

fix that oh also if you're using Jill SL

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.370 
fix that oh also if you're using Jill SL

going<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.560> go<00:05:38.620> over<00:05:38.710> here<00:05:39.130> in<00:05:39.400> the<00:05:39.850> textures

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:40.420 
going to go over here in the textures

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.330 
going to go over here in the textures
and<00:05:40.830> then<00:05:41.830> press<00:05:42.070> add<00:05:42.280> new<00:05:42.580> and<00:05:43.770> then<00:05:44.770> up<00:05:45.100> in

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
walkie is just putting that picture on

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.250 
walkie is just putting that picture on
there<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.160> do<00:05:57.160> map<00:05:57.550> input<00:05:58.320> UV<00:05:59.320> and<00:06:00.330> now<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.540> put

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
there so do map input UV and now it put

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.280 
there so do map input UV and now it put
it<00:06:02.380> like<00:06:02.740> we<00:06:02.980> want<00:06:03.010> it<00:06:03.570> let<00:06:04.570> me<00:06:04.660> go<00:06:04.900> over<00:06:05.020> here

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
it like we want it let me go over here

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:11.280 
it like we want it let me go over here
to<00:06:05.500> nor<00:06:06.900> and<00:06:07.900> up<00:06:08.680> that<00:06:08.950> and<00:06:09.720> now<00:06:10.720> I<00:06:11.140> don't

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:11.290 
to nor and up that and now I don't

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.659 
to nor and up that and now I don't
really<00:06:11.530> know<00:06:11.740> what<00:06:11.860> the<00:06:11.950> reflection<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:12.550> this

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
really know what the reflection of this

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.290 
really know what the reflection of this
of<00:06:13.390> a<00:06:13.540> gun<00:06:13.780> I'm<00:06:14.500> just<00:06:14.620> going<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:14.890> do<00:06:15.040> this<00:06:18.300> then

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
of a gun I'm just going to do this then

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.210 
of a gun I'm just going to do this then
with<00:06:19.600> our<00:06:19.750> wine<00:06:20.020> up<00:06:20.229> here<00:06:20.850> now<00:06:22.680> when<00:06:23.680> we<00:06:23.830> own<00:06:24.040> to

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:24.220 
with our wine up here now when we own to

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.570 
with our wine up here now when we own to
the<00:06:24.340> render

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
the render

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.200 
the render
it<00:06:26.580> should<00:06:26.910> look<00:06:27.150> pretty<00:06:31.580> so<00:06:32.580> then<00:06:32.760> that's<00:06:33.030> a

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
it should look pretty so then that's a

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:40.070 
it should look pretty so then that's a
gun<00:06:37.160> and<00:06:38.160> you<00:06:38.220> can<00:06:38.880> pretty<00:06:39.060> much<00:06:39.150> use<00:06:39.570> this

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
gun and you can pretty much use this

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.800 
gun and you can pretty much use this
technique<00:06:40.530> with<00:06:40.800> like<00:06:41.220> anything<00:06:42.060> a<00:06:42.330> car

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
technique with like anything a car

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.070 
technique with like anything a car
something<00:06:43.850> but<00:06:44.850> yeah<00:06:45.270> let's<00:06:45.450> pretty<00:06:45.780> much<00:06:45.930> it

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
something but yeah let's pretty much it

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
something but yeah let's pretty much it
