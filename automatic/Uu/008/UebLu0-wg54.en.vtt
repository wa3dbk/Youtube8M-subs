to make it exciting but I think just the
basic<00:01:13.140> brief<00:01:13.380> was<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.860> exciting<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.090> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
would have to make it really bad to go

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
functional beauty and that shed that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
functional beauty and that shed that
says<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.770> need<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.159> respect<00:01:35.490> the

the<00:01:44.340> production<00:01:44.970> should<00:01:45.119> start<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> 2012<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
the production should start to 2012 so

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.609 
the production should start to 2012 so
maybe<00:01:47.340> even<00:01:47.460> before<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:49.020> says<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.439> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
maybe even before this as it says is a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.510 
maybe even before this as it says is a
concept<00:01:50.070> what

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
concept what

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.670 
concept what
can<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.240> see<00:01:52.479> changing<00:01:53.140> what<00:01:53.290> can<00:01:53.440> you<00:01:53.500> see

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
can you see changing what can you see

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.890 
can you see changing what can you see
being<00:01:53.950> lost<00:01:54.250> on<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.030> reduction<00:01:55.479> car<00:01:55.690> that's

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
being lost on the reduction car that's

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.230 
being lost on the reduction car that's
on<00:01:55.990> this<00:01:56.200> I<00:01:56.470> think<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.310> bonnet<00:01:57.700> will<00:01:57.880> have<00:01:58.090> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
on this I think the bonnet will have to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.960 
on this I think the bonnet will have to
go<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.420> not<00:01:58.810> because<00:01:59.110> of<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.970> unfeasible

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
go up not because of the unfeasible

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.330 
go up not because of the unfeasible
engineering<00:02:01.840> things<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.260> think<00:02:02.320> that's<00:02:02.530> you

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
engineering things I think that's you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.920 
engineering things I think that's you
can<00:02:03.550> put<00:02:03.790> it<00:02:03.909> in<00:02:04.000> production<00:02:04.150> like<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.750> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
can put it in production like that the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.749 
can put it in production like that the
exterior<00:02:05.200> pretty<00:02:05.650> much<00:02:05.800> is<00:02:05.950> for<00:02:06.159> pedestrian

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
exterior pretty much is for pedestrian

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.550 
exterior pretty much is for pedestrian
but<00:02:06.909> it<00:02:07.030> still<00:02:07.180> impacts<00:02:07.570> here<00:02:07.869> I<00:02:08.050> mean

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
but it still impacts here I mean

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.449 
but it still impacts here I mean
basically<00:02:09.280> I<00:02:09.640> heard<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> mr.<00:02:11.319> Toyota<00:02:11.620> really

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
basically I heard that mr. Toyota really

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.360 
basically I heard that mr. Toyota really
liked<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.030> he<00:02:13.209> wants<00:02:13.480> to<00:02:13.600> push<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:13.959> very

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
liked it and he wants to push it very

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.610 
liked it and he wants to push it very
very<00:02:15.370> closely<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:16.150> production<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:17.200> exterior

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
very closely to production the exterior

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.120 
very closely to production the exterior
the<00:02:17.890> interior<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:18.340> think<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:20.200> would<00:02:21.010> be

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the interior I think it's a I would be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.309 
the interior I think it's a I would be
very<00:02:21.250> surprised<00:02:21.790> if<00:02:22.090> if<00:02:22.900> there<00:02:23.140> will<00:02:23.260> be

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
very surprised if if there will be

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.470 
very surprised if if there will be
something<00:02:23.890> left<00:02:24.100> basic<00:02:24.700> idea<00:02:25.000> was<00:02:25.180> actually

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
something left basic idea was actually

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.170 
something left basic idea was actually
the<00:02:25.870> same<00:02:26.050> light<00:02:26.260> exterior<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.160> emphasize<00:02:28.030> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
the same light exterior to emphasize the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.360 
the same light exterior to emphasize the
low<00:02:28.360> center<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.720> gravity<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.470> emphasize<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
low center of gravity and emphasize the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.479 
low center of gravity and emphasize the
light<00:02:30.580> lightweight<00:02:31.380> feeling<00:02:32.380> so<00:02:32.590> right<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.430> he

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
light lightweight feeling so right so he

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.590 
light lightweight feeling so right so he
deliberately<00:02:33.850> gonna<00:02:34.920> yes<00:02:36.360> create<00:02:37.360> like

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
deliberately gonna yes create like

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.780 
deliberately gonna yes create like
dominant<00:02:38.110> center<00:02:38.500> tunnel<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.160> really<00:02:39.580> light

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
dominant center tunnel and really light

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.960 
dominant center tunnel and really light
IP<00:02:40.750> nor<00:02:41.350> -<00:02:41.500> what<00:02:41.739> basically<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.550> dashboard

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
IP nor - what basically the dashboard

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.229 
IP nor - what basically the dashboard
idea<00:02:43.300> was<00:02:43.570> to<00:02:43.720> create<00:02:44.280> trimming<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.640> urban

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
idea was to create trimming the urban

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.470 
idea was to create trimming the urban
ducting<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.250> idea<00:02:48.519> of<00:02:48.820> the<00:02:48.970> zippers<00:02:49.300> was

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
ducting and the idea of the zippers was

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.199 
ducting and the idea of the zippers was
to<00:02:49.860> not<00:02:50.860> just<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> decoration<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.000> for

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
to not just the decoration but for

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.390 
to not just the decoration but for
example<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.720> instead<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.530> creating<00:02:53.860> plastic

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
example I instead of creating plastic

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.490 
example I instead of creating plastic
pockets<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.209> as<00:02:55.390> a<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:56.079> have<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.290> like<00:02:56.470> a

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
pockets it's just as a you have a like a

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.680 
pockets it's just as a you have a like a
jacket<00:02:56.860> pocket<00:02:57.190> so<00:02:57.489> you're<00:02:58.120> taking<00:02:58.329> away

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
jacket pocket so you're taking away

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.690 
jacket pocket so you're taking away
unnecessary<00:02:59.620> plastic<00:02:59.829> and<00:03:00.280> you<00:03:00.370> think<00:03:00.610> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
unnecessary plastic and you think you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.780 
unnecessary plastic and you think you
did<00:03:01.209> out<00:03:01.329> of<00:03:01.420> production<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:02.110> don't<00:03:03.100> see<00:03:03.280> why

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
did out of production I don't see why

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.330 
did out of production I don't see why
not<00:03:03.820> but<00:03:04.120> I<00:03:04.660> think<00:03:04.989> it's<00:03:05.200> a<00:03:05.470> may<00:03:06.280> be

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
not but I think it's a may be

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.509 
not but I think it's a may be
unconventional<00:03:06.850> photos<00:03:08.130> for<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> fact<00:03:09.370> what

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
unconventional photos for a fact what

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.150 
unconventional photos for a fact what
about<00:03:09.730> back<00:03:10.480> seats<00:03:10.780> will<00:03:11.380> there<00:03:11.500> be<00:03:11.680> will<00:03:12.010> then

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
about back seats will there be will then

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.400 
about back seats will there be will then
basically<00:03:12.549> just<00:03:12.640> be<00:03:13.000> no<00:03:13.209> back<00:03:13.420> seats<00:03:13.720> doesn't

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
basically just be no back seats doesn't

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.440 
basically just be no back seats doesn't
be<00:03:14.530> well<00:03:15.130> you<00:03:15.250> should<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:15.579> two<00:03:15.730> plus<00:03:15.940> two<00:03:16.150> but

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
be well you should be two plus two but

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.560 
be well you should be two plus two but
literally<00:03:17.440> for<00:03:18.299> communications<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.390> be<00:03:19.480> able

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
literally for communications to be able

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.539 
literally for communications to be able
to<00:03:19.690> see<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.079> Oh<00:03:20.340> small<00:03:21.340> no<00:03:21.730> longer<00:03:23.010> like<00:03:24.010> 911

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
to see it Oh small no longer like 911

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.240 
to see it Oh small no longer like 911
yeah<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.180> guess<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:25.780> work<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.680> little<00:03:26.769> bit<00:03:27.040> on<00:03:27.100> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
yeah I guess we work a little bit on a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.880 
yeah I guess we work a little bit on a
concept<00:03:27.670> with<00:03:27.910> Playstation<00:03:28.870> it's<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.650> little

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
concept with Playstation it's a little

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.180 
concept with Playstation it's a little
bit<00:03:30.120> yeah<00:03:31.120> again<00:03:31.390> engaging<00:03:32.019> and<00:03:32.560> have<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.860> fun

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
bit yeah again engaging and have a fun

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.370 
bit yeah again engaging and have a fun
car<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.760> of<00:03:34.690> course<00:03:34.959> when<00:03:35.109> you<00:03:35.200> go<00:03:35.320> to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
car and of course when you go to

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.650 
car and of course when you go to
production<00:03:35.709> maybe<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.850> will<00:03:37.000> be<00:03:37.150> GPS

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
production maybe this will be GPS

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.509 
production maybe this will be GPS
navigation<00:03:38.230> things<00:03:38.500> that<00:03:39.070> was<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> whole

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
navigation things that was the whole

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.670 
navigation things that was the whole
idea<00:03:39.549> as<00:03:39.910> well<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.329> try<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.870> concentrate<00:03:41.320> on

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
idea as well to try to concentrate on

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.349 
idea as well to try to concentrate on
the<00:03:41.829> information<00:03:42.100> in<00:03:42.459> front<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.850> you<00:03:42.940> even<00:03:43.239> is

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
the information in front of you even is

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:47.580 
the information in front of you even is
a<00:03:43.390> production<00:03:44.350> car<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:45.600> too<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.500> don't

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
a production car that too so you don't

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.770 
a production car that too so you don't
we<00:03:48.160> don't<00:03:48.280> have<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.640> look<00:03:48.760> up<00:03:48.910> down<00:03:49.299> yeah
