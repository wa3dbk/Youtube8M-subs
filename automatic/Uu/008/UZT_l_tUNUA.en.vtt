00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Look at a sugar cane plant. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 located in the city of sÃ£o manuel is 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.610
 developing a technology for 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.780
 to produce ethanol from the straw and the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.610
 cane bagasse 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.769
 the goal is to increase the supply of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.500
 fuel and consequently decrease 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.289
 the price at the pumps 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.390
 a plantation to lose sight of the sugarcane 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.180
 of sugar is spread by many 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.789
 hectares of our region are diverse 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.680
 mills that work 24 hours a day 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.900
 for the production of ethanol 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.949
 industry installed in the city of 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.050
 Saint Manuel 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.360
 technology that began on a scale of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.610
 laboratory today works in plant 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 pilot to increase the amount of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.989
 ethanol extracted from sugarcane ctc began to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 develop this ethanol technology 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.280
 known as the ethanol of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.469
 second generation from 2007 onwards. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.820
 A team was hired and the people 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.140
 the research began a technology for 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 to develop ethanol from bagasse 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.019
 and from sugarcane straw from 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
 2008 the process has progressed and the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.670
 development was at the same time 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.880
 increasing the scale we move to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.170
 a pilot plant scale that are already 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.610
 thousands of liters produced 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.890
 daily 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.500
 We are arriving here today at the plant are 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.049
 manoel with a project that will be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.479
 deployed from next year 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.990
 there is a demonstration plant of this 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.509
 technology it should be running in 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.799
 2014 together with the beginning of the harvest in May 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.140
 2014 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.200
 this plant is the last stage that 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.200
 people come to be able to market this 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.450
 new technology 30 mills associated with 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 sugar cane technology center were 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.579
 analyzed to receive the development 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.009
 more than twenty technical parameters 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.500
 involve a model management structure and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.810
 human resources will serve as a basis for 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.790
 choice of the appropriate place for the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 demonstration plant for us is 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.180
 importance because first of all 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 because we muted ours our staff 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.689
 qualified and trained to operate 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 this plant that more experimental plant 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.369
 that is, we are in the vanguard and we will be 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.770
 the first to install this plant in the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.710
 Brazil that will have visibility until 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.780
 to the world, right? 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.310
 and our people will be trained and 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.650
 ready to design a plant 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.480
 future to meet this 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.470
 need for a market and even a price 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.270
 more competitive 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.700
 this demonstration plant was 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.510
 designed to be integrated with the industry 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 Brazilian 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.190
 the investment to run the new 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.560
 enterprise will be 80 million 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.440
 real with this technology will be 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.020
 possible to increase production by up to 50% 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.420
 without having to expand the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.330
 planting if proven viability 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.490
 ethanol with straw and sugarcane bagasse 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.190
 the supply of the fuel goes 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.810
 grow and can prevent the price increase 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.810
 for the consumer 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.580
 Another positive aspect is the environmental one 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.100
 reduction of deforestation 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.840
 of areas for new plantations 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.030
 the point of development of this 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.420
 technology is to generate fuel with 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.150
 below the figure generated today in the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.060
 first generation ctc technology 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.790
 she is going to use this 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.280
 raw material and use a process that 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.200
 final sum the total cost of ethanol 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.350
 below the cost of the first 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.030
 even because it is our industry today. 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.530
 a very competitive and tailor-made sector 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.630
 what's going on all the time 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.030
 technology are coming and through 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.070
 requirements of the environment 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.510
 the course is getting a little high 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.340
 to 1 for the sector then we are 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.900
 really looking for alternatives and 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.130
 means for us to try 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.820
 reduce this cost and be more 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.820
 competitive market
