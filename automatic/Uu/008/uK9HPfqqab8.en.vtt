00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
seconds or some reasonable but anyway I

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.770 
seconds or some reasonable but anyway I
wouldn't<00:00:49.620> recommend<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.399> Barrett<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.390> fall

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
wouldn't recommend a Barrett with fall

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
wouldn't recommend a Barrett with fall
on<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:52.890> sexy<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:54.800> thermal

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
on it because it's sexy and thermal

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069

scope<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.219> don't<00:00:56.370> really<00:00:56.489> need<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.870> use

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
scope you don't really need you can use

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.520 
scope you don't really need you can use
it<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.410> prefer<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.160> maps<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.760> rundown<00:01:00.530> but

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
