marked<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.949> 406<00:00:53.430> East<00:00:55.219> then<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.489> full<00:00:56.789> flame

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
marked a 406 East then the full flame

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.630 
marked a 406 East then the full flame
becomes<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.930> middle<00:00:58.230> lane<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.039> close<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
becomes the middle lane so close the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
becomes the middle lane so close the

traffic lights delays increase from

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.469 
traffic lights delays increase from
three<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.310> five<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.729> we<00:01:11.880> need<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.180> drive

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
three to five so we need to drive
