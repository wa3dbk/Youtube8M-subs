00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
other side too you can add these little

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.020 
other side too you can add these little
lines<00:00:42.739> in<00:00:42.949> there<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.250> make<00:00:43.370> the<00:00:43.519> flower<00:00:43.789> look

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030

lines in there to make the flower look
more<00:00:44.210> natural<00:00:46.300> and<00:00:47.350> now<00:00:48.350> you<00:00:48.410> can<00:00:48.649> layer<00:00:48.890> some

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
more natural and now you can layer some

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.040 
more natural and now you can layer some
of<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:49.429> other<00:00:49.609> petals<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.420> this<00:00:50.629> one's<00:00:50.870> going

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
of the other petals so this one's going

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.139 
of the other petals so this one's going
to<00:00:51.079> be<00:00:51.230> wrapped<00:00:51.500> around<00:00:51.710> like<00:00:52.429> that<00:00:53.949> and<00:00:55.149> let's

to be wrapped around like that and let's

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.419 
to be wrapped around like that and let's
curve<00:00:56.719> out<00:00:57.050> this<00:00:57.589> side<00:01:00.039> and<00:01:01.039> there's<00:01:01.219> going<00:01:01.370> to

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
curve out this side and there's going to

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.580 
curve out this side and there's going to
be<00:01:01.489> another<00:01:02.329> bigger<00:01:02.839> petal<00:01:04.000> just<00:01:05.000> like<00:01:05.239> that
