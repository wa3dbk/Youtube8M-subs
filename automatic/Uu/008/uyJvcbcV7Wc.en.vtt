00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 Hello today I show you my beauty 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 favorites for august and like you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.880
 I guess I was in Brome 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.300
 on vacation and there I was biting forwards 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 and I've been up for a long time 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.779
 my wish list is a wish in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.779
 fulfillment and indeed it is of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 make-up driver of the make up in the 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:28.920
 color in 1 27 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.510
 the age foundation and that's a form 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 nation you probably already 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.700
 You have seen more at youtube and blogs 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.860
 and which is also recommended if you the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 videos made or photos taken by you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.579
 because no sun protection factor 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.200
 is included i have the wrong ones 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.360
 taken together because it was in color 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 that fit me because that's mine 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.140
 all biggest problem is and the nnn 27 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.190
 just fits perfectly 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'm just about the mac nc 30 but 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.379
 just yourself as that and that corresponds 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 just this color and I have it too 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.589
 now applied and wear them 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 Just since I bought it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.580
 actually every day because I just 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 find that she holds her for a very long time 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.630
 but medium medium strong covering power 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.729
 and it's just that way, of course 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.740
 So she does not find it very smart 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 but not very dewey either 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.909
 very natural and you do not need it 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.290
 necessarily after brother the price has 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 of course it costs it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 Optimizing the 40 euro 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.560
 but what advantage did play is too 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.689
 new here has such a pump dispenser 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.619
 and there really only so much 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.259
 rausgeholt 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.119
 in itself, 30 milliliters are included and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.860
 Definitely you can go to Berlin 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.619
 also order at mask berlin or 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.060
 buy in the shop or online 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.520
 I can order a few for you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.049
 applied in the pack left infobox 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.579
 I have the whole thing with the beauty 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.320
 Blender at me a little now 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.200
 I already look dirty 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.190
 very long but somehow uses it 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.620
 only very irregular because it is me 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.570
 as always too much is early starters 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.940
 and somehow wet it so 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.370
 is he so relative to himself 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.920
 small and very hard and then you 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:14.000
 keeps under water and then he goes 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.320
 and gets a bit softer and softer 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.360
 But that's the foundation 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.520
 I can apply very very well 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.960
 you recommend if you strong 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.210
 covering foundations hooked or for 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.250
 right he is so max or if you are 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.690
 rather dry skin have the youtube 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.550
 countries to use because then all 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.200
 somehow it gets a little bit better 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.970
 and not so much that dries out 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.220
 At least I have made and experienced 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.380
 so that the face does not look that way 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.300
 I still have this 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.030
 Married applied and that is the of 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.160
 mac a cream carter bays in the paint 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.470
 shell with a crosstrainer 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.030
 I do not know if they still exist and 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.860
 if there is still the color I always have 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.830
 Again, that somehow belongs 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.110
 but taken from the assortment is the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.600
 I bought in bicester village in 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.060
 this outfit village in the uk 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.290
 and he only had ten pounds or so 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.190
 tasted and I always wanted 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.840
 Try these cream carla bases 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 last because janina is about in every one 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.410
 video about her finca la bessÃ©e color 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.410
 makes speak and that is just such a 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.239
 rather pink tone in looks too 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.830
 a bit cool from what actually 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.230
 not as my prey scheme corresponds 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.080
 but applied that is just very 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.520
 very very natural and subtle and that 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.160
 as well a sparkle and not so 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.350
 shimmering no blitzer or so and looks 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.230
 of course, if somehow 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.660
 I just want it a bit 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.100
 glory looks on the cheeks and on 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.630
 in any case, I would like my color 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.850
 has set 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.120
 I'm on the day with sophia 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.670
 hit by 480 and she meant it too 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.950
 Must try the color because of that 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.930
 I think that's just the kind of gold tone 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.130
 he's a bit warmer than us 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.209
 probably could drive out already 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.400
 that my skin is a bit again 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.720
 become drier I thought so I 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.890
 now have a modest but forever 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.110
 she will be so kind again 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.020
 drier though 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.510
 I was still around the whole summer 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.790
 I counteract this cream 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.580
 here very much likes to use the base set 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.340
 there was such an oil in there and there 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.990
 and also a cleaner of those 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.209
 I was not that excited 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.019
 but I really like this cream and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.520
 it is increased from behren minden july 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:28.030
 newhouses the racer with ryan and 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 any complex and that is for 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.770
 normal to dry skin suitable 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.150
 and it is a cream that feels in itself 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.740
 they are a bit of a video ads 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.660
 arenen cream I'll give you that too 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:43.060
 this active aqacur would have shown him 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.520
 I think that means dry skin 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.540
 From rich the cream that feels 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.490
 something like that is like that 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.590
 rich consistency without any 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.810
 oily or acting like that also pulls 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.380
 really a super very fast 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.690
 underlay also for make-up but just 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.160
 also very caring and teaching and 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.160
 my skin has been fine since then 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.570
 use a lot better and I know 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.220
 not if you do not have any in front of me 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.680
 Definitely have the feeling that there 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.390
 no perfume is in it and I tolerate it 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.680
 she also very well what I from 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.340
 Unfortunately, other creams do not claim 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.010
 can 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.950
 so if you as a solid cream well 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.320
 those without essential oils and so on 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.150
 gets along without dad and the just fine 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.740
 then i can care for you the heart now 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.410
 I also have the last product 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.750
 applied and I have sent that 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.590
 Maybelline got that in 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.200
 my mailbox 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.060
 and I was very excited because se 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.460
 she does not know her 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.900
 then you should know the video now 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.990
 have looked at the end in the infobox 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.340
 Click and you look at the channel it 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.849
 one of my favorite youtubers 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.619
 and 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:47.979
 she has this product somehow in the 

00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:51.969
 Heaven praised that's from Maybelline 's 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:56.080
 color galaxy delicious in the color nude 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:06:00.610
 illusion 720 basically just ein 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:02.229
 lip gloss of the yes why a paint works 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.419
 So as it actually says like the name 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.479
 but says something, it is as beautiful 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.469
 first, the packaging 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.999
 second, it is so nice and small 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.059
 handy but that is actually 

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:14.770
 incidentally the main thing is that it 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:17.259
 I do not stick that I think very well 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:20.879
 also think this applicator reminds you 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:23.499
 bit of this special lip gloss 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.779
 applicators he is so small and one 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:29.529
 a little wider you can handle it very well 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:31.959
 Apply lip gloss and he also smells 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:33.969
 totally good dish not so dissimilar 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:36.759
 as artificial as most lipglosses though 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.159
 already a bit sweet has that way too 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:40.659
 this nurturing character he characterizes me 

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:43.679
 so a bit of consistency to 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:47.019
 this clear perfect or something like this 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.339
 debate going on in the direction sticks 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:50.889
 just not synonymous and I think the synonymous 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.839
 color very nice I thought only 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.939
 I'm too brave or too 

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:57.909
 dark but just if you like that 

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:59.439
 then lets a good dribble 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.479
 that combine very well with them 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.979
 and that 's it said uci favorites me 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:05.579
 Hope you liked her and you liked me 

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:05.579
 Until next time
