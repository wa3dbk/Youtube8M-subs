00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.260
 Hello everyone today, June 15 today 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.139
 decided to get out for a couple of hours 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.030
 I will dig in such a place 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.930
 walk today and 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.529
 in the right side and give a small such 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.020
 little forest 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:27.990
 I also want to invent a walk today 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.340
 on it md has already collected a shovel cooked 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.489
 find bag 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:38.160
 also that will find something let's get started 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 today's first color son 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:54.600
 have not watched anything there 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:01:08.000
 let's see a month something in it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 the pebbles aren't this lumps 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.630
 cork unfortunately this cork will continue 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.350
 so there was another color good such 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.850
 signal 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 and here is this hole I got this 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:37.330
 here is a spoonful visible on it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:41.670
 green oxidation most likely 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:49.110
 silver spoon and very much he returned 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:53.799
 favors to whiteness on a spoon clean 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.970
 ok to claim one hundred percent 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:01.080
 sure that the spoon is silver plated everything 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.520
 I take the find by myself and continue 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:10.899
 quite a while no longer came across colored 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 the signals were the next of them and now this 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:19.290
 the hole here got her such a capsule 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 or caps or sleeve incomprehensible 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.780
 aluminum find erysipelas 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 there was another color signal and dripping and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:40.959
 I did not get such a cartridge 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:46.380
 German bullets took his sleeve 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:50.760
 did not shoot such a huge find 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:56.400
 here's another hole and with this hole 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.630
 I got such a sleeve 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:04.510
 or cap 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.500
 I think the shell of the rocket launcher about her 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.590
 stigma is worth 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:18.010
 triangle and latin three letters 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.480
 SCN here is such a find 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.220
 another echo of the war did not get who 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.670
 such 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:33.280
 Chip Soviet Elsa find 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:35.650
 so we continue today in such a hurry 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.010
 on the cube, I really did not have time to charge 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.020
 batteries and as a result they are very 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.600
 quickly selo 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.560
 I could not be like really like 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.990
 today a little popular for such 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:55.480
 I did not find any explanations now 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:04:01.350
 what's your steamed capsule 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:07.120
 some such debris 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.750
 debris and such a spoon is all my 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.000
 taxes 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:15.760
 What people normally slaughtered at will 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.270
 battery and be sure to come here again 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.270
