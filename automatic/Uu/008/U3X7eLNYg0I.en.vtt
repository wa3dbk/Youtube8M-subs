00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.670 
made a positive impact or a positive
play<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.310> then<00:01:45.940> obviously<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:47.020> those<00:01:47.290> big

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
play and then obviously in those big

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.149 
play and then obviously in those big
moments<00:01:48.340> when<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.670> clocks<00:01:48.970> tickin<00:01:49.860> guy<00:01:50.860> has

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
moments when the clocks tickin guy has

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.830 
moments when the clocks tickin guy has
to<00:01:51.310> make<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> big<00:01:51.729> shot<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.210> we<00:01:52.330> have<00:01:52.510> gone<00:01:52.750> on

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to make a big shot and we have gone on

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.600 
to make a big shot and we have gone on
our<00:01:52.960> team<00:01:53.200> who<00:01:53.470> believes<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:54.250> has<00:01:54.370> great

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
our team who believes and has great

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.850 
our team who believes and has great
confidence<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.390> thought<00:01:55.600> mark<00:01:56.229> lyons<00:01:56.530> shot

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
confidence and I thought mark lyons shot

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.500 
confidence and I thought mark lyons shot
was<00:01:57.070> one<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.430> biggest<00:01:57.760> shots<00:01:58.180> that<00:01:58.420> I've

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
was one of the biggest shots that I've

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.570 
was one of the biggest shots that I've
seen<00:01:58.780> go<00:01:59.050> in<00:01:59.260> but<00:01:59.800> there<00:01:59.920> wasn't<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.280> doubt<00:02:00.460> in

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
seen go in but there wasn't a doubt in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.039 
seen go in but there wasn't a doubt in
my<00:02:00.640> mind<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.030> it<00:02:01.120> was<00:02:01.299> going<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.510> go<00:02:01.690> in<00:02:01.870> when

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:02.049 
my mind that it was going to go in when

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.350 
my mind that it was going to go in when
I<00:02:02.080> saw<00:02:02.380> him<00:02:02.500> go<00:02:02.680> it's<00:02:02.950> just<00:02:03.130> who<00:02:03.520> he<00:02:03.549> is<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.150> and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
I saw him go it's just who he is and and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.050 
I saw him go it's just who he is and and
I<00:02:04.960> think<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.320> all<00:02:05.350> benefit<00:02:06.010> by<00:02:06.190> having<00:02:06.400> him<00:02:06.909> on

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
I think we all benefit by having him on

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.359 
I think we all benefit by having him on
the<00:02:07.420> court<00:02:07.690> in<00:02:07.840> that<00:02:07.990> situation<00:02:08.349> we<00:02:09.250> were

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
the court in that situation we were

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.559 
the court in that situation we were
talking<00:02:09.729> there<00:02:09.849> right<00:02:10.090> after<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.390> ballgame

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
talking there right after the ballgame

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.270 
talking there right after the ballgame
about<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.959> fact<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.349> this<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.799> the<00:02:12.040> type<00:02:12.250> of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
about the fact that this is the type of

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.699 
about the fact that this is the type of
situation<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:13.150> work<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.690> in<00:02:13.930> practice<00:02:13.959> all

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
situation you work on in practice all

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.410

the time putting at

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.300 
the time putting at
number<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.810> seconds<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.410> clock<00:02:17.560> knowing

number of seconds on the clock knowing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.850 
number of seconds on the clock knowing
what<00:02:18.819> you<00:02:19.000> need<00:02:19.300> how<00:02:19.630> many<00:02:19.690> times<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.349> practice

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
what you need how many times in practice

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.430 
what you need how many times in practice
have<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.880> run<00:02:22.150> anything<00:02:22.569> similar<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.230> what

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
have you run anything similar to what

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.130 
have you run anything similar to what
Mark<00:02:24.069> did<00:02:24.340> there<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.270> basket<00:02:25.510> well

Mark did there to get that basket well

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.870 
Mark did there to get that basket well
we<00:02:26.260> practice<00:02:26.680> special<00:02:27.040> situations<00:02:27.610> all<00:02:27.849> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
we practice special situations all the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.390 
we practice special situations all the
time<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.510> we<00:02:28.989> run<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.319> but<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.860> player<00:02:30.099> has<00:02:30.370> to

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
time and we run it but the player has to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.610 
time and we run it but the player has to
make<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.819> play<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.270> know<00:02:31.360> a<00:02:31.390> year<00:02:31.450> ago<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:32.380> was

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
make the play you know a year ago I was

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.070 
make the play you know a year ago I was
in<00:02:33.100> many<00:02:33.370> regards<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:34.090> bad<00:02:34.270> coach<00:02:34.630> because<00:02:35.020> I

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
in many regards a bad coach because I

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900 
in many regards a bad coach because I
didn't<00:02:35.410> call<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> timeout<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.580> situation

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
didn't call a timeout in that situation

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.750 
didn't call a timeout in that situation
remember<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:38.050> think<00:02:38.770> five<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.280> know<00:02:39.370> he

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
remember that I think five you know he

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.130 
remember that I think five you know he
doesn't<00:02:39.910> call<00:02:40.150> timeout<00:02:40.569> why<00:02:40.690> didn't<00:02:40.989> call

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
doesn't call timeout why didn't call

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.380 
doesn't call timeout why didn't call
time<00:02:41.410> out<00:02:41.530> today<00:02:41.739> right<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:43.209> of<00:02:43.239> the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
time out today right and one of the

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.000 
time out today right and one of the
reasons<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.870> we<00:02:44.110> didn't<00:02:44.470> call<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.680> timeout

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
reasons that we didn't call a timeout

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.370 
reasons that we didn't call a timeout
whether<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.700> shot<00:02:46.000> went<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:46.390> or<00:02:46.510> not<00:02:46.660> was<00:02:47.080> if

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
whether that shot went in or not was if

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.530 
whether that shot went in or not was if
you<00:02:47.860> call<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.130> timeout<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:49.060> don't<00:02:49.239> know<00:02:49.420> if

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
you call a timeout you don't know if

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.840 
you call a timeout you don't know if
they're<00:02:49.690> going<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.870> be<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.140> zone<00:02:50.170> or<00:02:50.560> man

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
they're going to be in zone or man

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.090 
they're going to be in zone or man
because<00:02:51.850> in<00:02:52.060> Florida's<00:02:52.720> case<00:02:52.930> they<00:02:53.170> play<00:02:53.440> 50

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
because in Florida's case they play 50

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.520 
because in Florida's case they play 50
50<00:02:54.280> zone<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.000> fifty<00:02:55.269> fifty<00:02:55.600> men<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.080> once<00:02:56.380> in

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
50 zone and fifty fifty men and once in

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.690 
50 zone and fifty fifty men and once in
a<00:02:56.590> while<00:02:56.739> what<00:02:56.920> they'll<00:02:57.100> do<00:02:57.250> is<00:02:57.400> they'll<00:02:57.519> make

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
a while what they'll do is they'll make

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.030 
a while what they'll do is they'll make
the<00:02:57.819> ball<00:02:58.030> very<00:02:58.690> difficult<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.440> even<00:02:59.620> get<00:02:59.920> it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
the ball very difficult to even get it

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.400 
the ball very difficult to even get it
inbounds<00:03:00.190> so<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.390> was<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.660> reason<00:03:01.690> for<00:03:02.260> not

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
inbounds so that was the reason for not

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.800 
inbounds so that was the reason for not
calling<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.040> in<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.400> trust<00:03:03.700> level<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:04.330> Solomon

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
calling it in a trust level with Solomon

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.380 
calling it in a trust level with Solomon
out<00:03:04.930> there<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.350> Nick<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:06.160> Mark<00:03:06.459> that<00:03:06.730> what<00:03:07.269> we

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
out there and Nick and Mark that what we

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
out there and Nick and Mark that what we
called<00:03:07.720> would<00:03:08.019> be<00:03:08.140> executed<00:03:08.799> and<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.040> live

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
called would be executed and you live

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.360 
called would be executed and you live
with<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.519> result<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:11.530> other<00:03:11.650> thing<00:03:11.920> is<00:03:11.950> just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
with the result the other thing is just

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.520 
with the result the other thing is just
from<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.060> defensive<00:03:13.239> perspective<00:03:14.049> you<00:03:14.140> know<00:03:14.170> we

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
from a defensive perspective you know we

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.309 
from a defensive perspective you know we
gave<00:03:14.739> up<00:03:14.890> 10<00:03:15.130> threes<00:03:15.549> but<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.750> tonight's<00:03:17.080> game

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
gave up 10 threes but in tonight's game

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.720 
gave up 10 threes but in tonight's game
I<00:03:17.350> didn't<00:03:17.709> really<00:03:17.830> look<00:03:18.010> at<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.310> as<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.489> lack

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
I didn't really look at that as a lack

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.070 
I didn't really look at that as a lack
of<00:03:18.760> effort<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.420> had<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> couple<00:03:19.780> breakdowns

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
of effort we had a couple breakdowns

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.470 
of effort we had a couple breakdowns
they're<00:03:21.070> a<00:03:21.130> great<00:03:21.430> shooting<00:03:21.760> team<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:22.269> think

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
they're a great shooting team I think

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.180 
they're a great shooting team I think
everybody<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.109> arena<00:03:23.410> felt<00:03:23.799> it<00:03:23.950> when<00:03:24.040> they

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
everybody in the arena felt it when they

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.520 
everybody in the arena felt it when they
get<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> good<00:03:24.579> look<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:25.989> horse<00:03:26.290> game

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
get a good look it's like a horse game

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.470 
get a good look it's like a horse game
and<00:03:26.829> Murphy<00:03:27.280> is<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> great<00:03:27.760> shooter<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.329> their

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
and Murphy is a great shooter and their

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.479 
and Murphy is a great shooter and their
surrounding<00:03:28.739> patrick<00:03:29.739> Young<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> number

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
surrounding patrick Young with a number

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.550 
surrounding patrick Young with a number
of<00:03:30.700> great<00:03:30.820> shooters<00:03:31.329> and<00:03:31.510> that's<00:03:32.380> what

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
of great shooters and that's what

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.110 
of great shooters and that's what
they're<00:03:32.799> so<00:03:32.980> difficult<00:03:33.459> to<00:03:33.640> guard<00:03:33.670> because

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
they're so difficult to guard because

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.930 
they're so difficult to guard because
they<00:03:34.630> play<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.200> well<00:03:35.410> off<00:03:35.650> of<00:03:35.680> each<00:03:35.950> other<00:03:36.220> but

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
they play so well off of each other but

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.819 
they play so well off of each other but
for<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> most<00:03:37.390> part<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.810> think<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.590> did

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
for the most part I think what we did

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.920 
for the most part I think what we did
defensively<00:03:39.190> against<00:03:39.820> them<00:03:39.940> was<00:03:40.150> our<00:03:40.630> best

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
defensively against them was our best

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.720 
defensively against them was our best
effort<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.530> that's<00:03:41.769> what<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.100> can<00:03:42.250> ask<00:03:42.400> for

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
effort and that's what you can ask for

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.420 
effort and that's what you can ask for
our<00:03:42.970> effort<00:03:43.780> level<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.320> what<00:03:44.500> we<00:03:44.620> did<00:03:44.829> was<00:03:44.890> was

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
our effort level and what we did was was

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.340 
our effort level and what we did was was
as<00:03:45.579> good<00:03:45.760> as<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:45.970> think<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.450> could<00:03:46.690> do<00:03:46.989> at<00:03:47.230> this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
as good as I think we could do at this

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680 
as good as I think we could do at this
time<00:03:47.680> of<00:03:47.709> year<00:03:47.910> against<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.030> team<00:03:49.239> as<00:03:49.420> skilled

I<00:04:54.229> thought<00:04:54.440> we<00:04:54.590> were<00:04:54.740> much<00:04:54.949> more<00:04:55.190> sure<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.580> think

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
I thought we were much more sure I think

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.550 
I thought we were much more sure I think
they<00:04:56.120> probably<00:04:56.270> looked<00:04:56.840> at<00:04:56.960> that<00:04:57.110> and<00:04:57.290> saw

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
they probably looked at that and saw

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.260 
they probably looked at that and saw
that<00:04:57.590> because<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:58.370> couple<00:04:58.610> times<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:59.150> they

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
that because a couple times that they

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.810 
that because a couple times that they
did<00:04:59.510> press<00:04:59.810> we<00:05:00.680> went<00:05:00.830> through<00:05:00.949> it<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.610> think

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
did press we went through it and I think

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.520 
did press we went through it and I think
had<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:01.970> lot<00:05:02.180> more<00:05:02.210> poise<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:02.960> again<00:05:03.289> I<00:05:03.320> give

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
had a lot more poise but again I give

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:05.110 
had a lot more poise but again I give
our<00:05:03.680> team<00:05:03.889> credit<00:05:04.220> it's<00:05:04.370> tough<00:05:04.639> when<00:05:04.820> you<00:05:04.940> turn

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
our team credit it's tough when you turn

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.360 
our team credit it's tough when you turn
the<00:05:05.150> ball<00:05:05.389> over<00:05:05.449> a<00:05:05.930> couple<00:05:06.590> times<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:07.070> we<00:05:07.220> did

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
the ball over a couple times like we did

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.189 
the ball over a couple times like we did
in<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.520> first<00:05:07.760> half<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.300> put<00:05:08.479> that<00:05:08.630> behind<00:05:08.780> you

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
in the first half to put that behind you

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.439 
in the first half to put that behind you
and<00:05:09.440> play<00:05:09.979> that<00:05:10.190> entire<00:05:10.550> second<00:05:11.030> half<00:05:11.060> with

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
and play that entire second half with

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.060 
and play that entire second half with
only<00:05:11.630> 2<00:05:11.900> turnovers<00:05:12.110> it's<00:05:12.590> one<00:05:12.770> of<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:12.949> reasons

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
only 2 turnovers it's one of the reasons

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.250 
only 2 turnovers it's one of the reasons
we<00:05:13.460> won<00:05:13.669> and<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.479> other<00:05:14.600> thing<00:05:14.840> I<00:05:14.930> think<00:05:15.139> we

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
we won and the other thing I think we

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.050 
we won and the other thing I think we
learned<00:05:15.410> tonight<00:05:15.680> especially<00:05:16.039> our<00:05:16.460> young<00:05:16.490> big

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
learned tonight especially our young big

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.570 
learned tonight especially our young big
guys<00:05:17.270> is<00:05:17.660> it's<00:05:18.260> not<00:05:18.470> easy<00:05:18.710> to<00:05:19.100> offensive

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
guys is it's not easy to offensive

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.400 
guys is it's not easy to offensive
rebound<00:05:19.910> against<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.270> team<00:05:20.479> like<00:05:20.510> Florida<00:05:21.080> we

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
rebound against a team like Florida we

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.920 
rebound against a team like Florida we
had<00:05:21.560> four<00:05:22.010> and<00:05:22.340> they<00:05:23.000> did<00:05:23.180> an<00:05:23.300> incredible<00:05:23.449> job

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
had four and they did an incredible job

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.810 
had four and they did an incredible job
of<00:05:24.139> taking<00:05:24.560> our<00:05:24.800> strength<00:05:25.130> away<00:05:25.370> and<00:05:25.639> by<00:05:25.789> the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
of taking our strength away and by the

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.640 
of taking our strength away and by the
way<00:05:26.060> they<00:05:26.270> had<00:05:26.449> 12<00:05:26.870> and<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.229> look<00:05:27.410> at<00:05:27.500> that

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
way they had 12 and you look at that

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.570 
way they had 12 and you look at that
rebounding<00:05:28.280> 33<00:05:29.270> 222<00:05:29.960> they<00:05:30.770> took<00:05:31.070> one<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.460> our

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
rebounding 33 222 they took one of our

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.370 
rebounding 33 222 they took one of our
strengths<00:05:32.000> away<00:05:32.210> from<00:05:32.449> us<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:33.050> think<00:05:33.260> we

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
strengths away from us and I think we

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.500 
strengths away from us and I think we
have<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.680> learn<00:05:33.830> as<00:05:34.160> we<00:05:34.760> keep<00:05:34.940> moving<00:05:35.330> forward

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
have to learn as we keep moving forward

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.060 
have to learn as we keep moving forward
down<00:05:35.840> our<00:05:36.020> schedule<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.440> not<00:05:36.680> let<00:05:36.889> that<00:05:36.919> happen

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
down our schedule to not let that happen

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.029 
down our schedule to not let that happen
