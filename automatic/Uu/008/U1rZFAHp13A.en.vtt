on<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.680> now<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.820> isn't<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> sizing<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
on it now this isn't the sizing that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.240 
on it now this isn't the sizing that
you're<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.409> need<00:01:53.030> for<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:55.860> right<00:01:56.040> size
