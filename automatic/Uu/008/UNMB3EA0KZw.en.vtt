00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.101
Hyeongdon is tired from a long travel,
so will he drink the night before the shoot?

00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:05.401
You use the GPS from this?

00:00:05.401 --> 00:00:07.791
The cell phone GPS,
not the one in the car.

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:11.221
He's starting...

00:00:12.531 --> 00:00:14.901
And he's taking it without any objections

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:19.891
No way...

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:22.281
Yes...

00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:25.921
He's not listening to Hyeongdon anymore

00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:27.341
Incredible.

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:28.581
Clink

00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.501
This is 99.99% failure

00:00:32.501 --> 00:00:33.561
Just one...

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.481
To show loyalty!

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:40.151
Loyalty my butt...
You're finished...

00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:45.721
A grand project that took 3 weeks of
hard work

00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:49.021
Hyeongdon is the first victim...

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:51.251
Goodbye

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:54.281
It's over.

00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.431
It's water?
With a hint of soju.

00:00:58.431 --> 00:00:59.651
It's water.

00:01:00.171 --> 00:01:01.491
Here is Captain Yoo

00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:04.821
Poor Hyeongdon has no clue

00:01:04.821 --> 00:01:06.851
Hyeongdon?

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:07.941
Huh?

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:11.581
So innocent

00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.661
Why did you come out from there...?

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:18.721
Unfortunately, it's over.

00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:21.301
The giant's temptation!

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:23.701
How disappointing!

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:24.921
What is this?

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.781
The giant's temptation.

00:01:26.781 --> 00:01:28.961
The Temptation of the Giant.

00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.571
The night before the shoot...

00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:33.431
No clue...

00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:35.371
We worked really hard, so...

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.261
He can't hear what they're saying

00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:43.361
Mr. Jeong Hyeongdon was
really loyal.

00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:48.621
It's really late, and he came
all the way from Daegu.

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:50.991
He is really...

00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:52.851
He has no idea...

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.781
Hyeongdon! They got me last week!

00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:57.541
Completely destroyed...

00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.681
Mr. Jeong Junha got caught last week.

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:02.161
Why don't you get up?

00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:04.681
This is week 3 of this project, Hyeongdon!

00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.971
It's week 3 of this project.

00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:07.961
Dizzy

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.931
He's totally wrecked.

00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:13.231
Mr. Jeong Hyeongdon is a mess right now.

00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.481
He's trying to take his clothes off!

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:18.441
Side effect of the most powerful
giant's temptation...

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:21.361
Sit down and listen to me.

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:24.541
As you already figured out,
it was water.

00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:26.711
We...

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:27.711
Ah!

00:02:27.711 --> 00:02:30.421
You called me last week! On Wednesday!

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:32.931
- He was there.
- I was with Janghoon.

00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:34.781
Oh! Right!

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:36.481
Last week, you!

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.451
We talked yesterday.

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:39.481
Right!

00:02:39.481 --> 00:02:42.171
I talked to him on the phone yesterday.

00:02:42.171 --> 00:02:45.231
That was why you fell for this.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:46.471
Mr. Jeong Hyeongdon!

00:02:46.471 --> 00:02:47.931
Aaagh!

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:50.861
It's too late for that...

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:53.941
The first member to fall for the temptation

00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:56.241
Jeong Hyeongdon got arrested
