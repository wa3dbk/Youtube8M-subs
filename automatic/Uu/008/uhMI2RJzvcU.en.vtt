00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 i 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.840
 in another video we showed how 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 we planted the tomatoes 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.590
 of seedbed and then we passed them to 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.020
 earth and today we are going to show you how 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.619
 we can structure the fighting for 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.330
 what we do is place a stick or 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.900
 in its defect we put rods 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.760
 with plays 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.760
 next to tomatoes and alcohol 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.240
 the feeling 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:45.650
 we put ourselves at a small distance 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.470
 well we get it right we can use 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.150
 for we can use bamboo can be 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.010
 use many things but good I use 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.830
 these corrugated rods once 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.740
 posts with sticks or rods or 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.610
 stakes what we want we have to give them 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.930
 the rod with which we use grace 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 which is so more natural but you can 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.520
 use ropes you can use threads 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.800
 what we want is worth as long as 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 are well tied and subject we put and 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.280
 the tamos 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.840
 A) Yes 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.310
 you do not have to stick to the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.790
 Rod in fact is not advisable 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.620
 because we want is that neither the wind 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.120
 strength or simply pull 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.120
 we hold so that it does not fall 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.870
 we count 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.550
 A) Yes 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.610
 and as it grows the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.010
 we will take more knots 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 and putting more string or more on 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.970
 this case we would already be in tutor 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.260
 fairies 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.410
 the tomatoes are worth and we see how we have 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.140
 also next to the onion sown 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.300
 we show you in the previous video that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.750
 it was very good to associate with the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.090
 tomato 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 and if you want to see how the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.530
 onion then we have a video on the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 channel I will put the link but we already 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.020
 all the tomatoes would be in tutor 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.900
 you have seen how easy it is to structure 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.450
 the tomatoes just remember that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.610
 whenever they grow as 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.890
 we have to go putting new strings 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.040
 so that we do not get to know each other and 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.019
 falling by the weight 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.670
 so nothing if you liked the video 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.790
 you give like 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.890
 And you can comment on what you want us 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.890
 we see in other videos only
