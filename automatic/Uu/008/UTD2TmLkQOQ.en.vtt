00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
surprised but I'm starting from her

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
surprised but I'm starting from her
scalp<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:44.129> massaging<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.789> through<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
scalp and I'm massaging it through and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.020 
scalp and I'm massaging it through and
then<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.020> bringing<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.710> through<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:48.000> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
then I'm bringing it up through to the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.540 
then I'm bringing it up through to the
ends<00:00:48.480> when<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.440> hair<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.620> wet<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.160> super

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
ends when your hair is wet it's super

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.840 
ends when your hair is wet it's super
elastic<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:52.050> actually<00:00:52.710> easier<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
elastic and it's actually easier to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.090 
elastic and it's actually easier to
break<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.360> way<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.899> should<00:00:55.170> be<00:00:55.320> super

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
break that way so you should be super

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.439 
break that way so you should be super
careful<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.789> hair<00:00:57.030> when<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.360> wet
