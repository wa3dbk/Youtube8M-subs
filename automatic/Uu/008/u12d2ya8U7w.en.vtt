get a lot of myself in water a so this
is<00:04:46.520> probably<00:04:47.030> from<00:04:47.270> water<00:04:47.539> and<00:04:47.750> also<00:04:47.870> alright

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
is probably from water and also alright

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.810 
is probably from water and also alright
so<00:04:49.280> just<00:04:49.639> gonna<00:04:50.509> hold<00:04:50.810> it<00:04:50.960> forward<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:55.220> just

and<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.710> guess<00:05:01.889> cuz<00:05:02.069> my<00:05:02.190> hands<00:05:02.400> getting<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.909> long

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
and I guess cuz my hands getting so long

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.899 
and I guess cuz my hands getting so long
now<00:05:03.360> now<00:05:03.840> when<00:05:04.169> I<00:05:04.199> you<00:05:04.620> know<00:05:04.740> do<00:05:05.280> a<00:05:05.310> puff<00:05:05.639> it

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:05.909 
now now when I you know do a puff it

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:09.290 
now now when I you know do a puff it
doesn't<00:05:06.270> normally<00:05:06.389> just<00:05:06.840> stay<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.349> as<00:05:08.090> he<00:05:09.090> used
