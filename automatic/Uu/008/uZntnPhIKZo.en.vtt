00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 boxes are everywhere 

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.666
 boxes exist for longer than the wheel 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
 our lives are filled with them 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 We work in boxes 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:16.119
 We sat on them. 

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:18.042
 boxes also carry some of us 

00:00:17.485 --> 00:00:20.485
 Are you in a box now? 

00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:22.621
 for a long time, the boxes have made our life easier 

00:00:22.036 --> 00:00:25.036
 but at some point, the boxes have become a problem. 

00:00:25.612 --> 00:00:28.612
 shoe box for example, is causing tons of garbage. 

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:31.003
 We cougar, we do not like waste 

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.697
 So we started looking. 

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:35.833
 Ways to change our boxes 

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:38.434
 we started talking to Yves Behar 

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:40.709
 who spent 21 months thinking about how 

00:00:40.078 --> 00:00:43.078
 of inventing a shoebox less damaging or intelligent (without damage in nature) 

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:46.375
 after testing, research and a comprehensive life cycle assessment ... 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.090
 we found that the best solution 

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:52.203
 it was not the case the problem 

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:54.688
 Fuseproject and Puma - worked relentlessly on materials and manufacturing methods 

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:57.753
 to reduce material and transportation costs 

00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:00.818
 more than 2,000 ideas 

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.533
 More than 40 packaging prototypes 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 With many hours of work 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Coffee break 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.500
 intensive factory evaluations around the world 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 all working towards a stylish and simple solution. 

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.586
 Introducing 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 smart bag 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 the change from our red shoe box to the smart bag, allows us to reduce 65% of useless fabric 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.100
 No set 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.800
 no useless fabric 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 which transformed the retail experience 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 changing the way we present our shoes 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.100
 How can we store them? 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.100
 as we can serve them with people, without extra stuff to take home. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 This innovative system will save 8.5 thousand tons of paper ... 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
 20 million megajoules of electric power ... 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.850
 1 million liters of water 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.500
 1 million liters of fuel oil, and 500,000 liters of diesel. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 we are reducing our carbon dioxide by 10,000 tons. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 but it did not stop there 

00:01:49.161 --> 00:01:52.160
 all our shoes are PVC free 

00:01:51.174 --> 00:01:54.170
 we are increasing the quantity of our clothes produced with 

00:01:53.108 --> 00:01:56.110
 cotton produced in Africa 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.900
 our German matrix is ​​powered by green electricity. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 biodegradable clothing and shopping bags. 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.300
 labels with less paper. 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.450
 we are even making our cougar the phone packaging of the recycled pulp 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.700
 this revolutionary change in the printing of the cougar is not only a change of business 

00:02:08.242 --> 00:02:11.240
 but may one day change the industry 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.240
 and contribute to a better world 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
 it's time to put the boxes for better use. 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.440
 Why not use them. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
 COUGAR ALWAYS RENEWING AND NEXT TO NATURE
