00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.240
Let's talk about achieving the Dao. Is there a 
 catalyst and what is the process?

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:19.161
Of course! I know. It is to say, in Taiji, we say 
 it is Yin and Yang. What is Yin and Yang?

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.854
Whatever it is, humans have two perspectives to it naturally.

00:00:22.854 --> 00:00:25.450
and two types of feelings towards it.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:33.291
My feeling is that in the most important moment in time, I suddenly fell into emptiness but the opponent was out.

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:43.074
For others the same thing happens but they think that they almost fell down and they become afraid of it.

00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:48.040
When they look back, they decided not to go through the situation again.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.900
The next time, when this is about to happen, they avoid reaching this point, instead rely on power to push the opponent out.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.089
This situation is the demarcation. 
This is what we say we are both on the cliff.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:06.426
When I am on the cliff and you come to me, 
 and I dodge, you fall off the cliff.

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:11.294
I saw this as a good thing. I did not get scared.

00:01:11.294 --> 00:01:13.662
I experimented with this type of action.

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:16.242
Sometimes I would fall off the cliff with the opponent.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.138
But falling down is very interesting to me 
 and thus experiment with it again.

00:01:19.138 --> 00:01:21.623
And thus received this special ability.

00:01:21.623 --> 00:01:26.931
I have seen that many of my friends get 
 scared when they fall off the cliff.

00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.048
And they would never allow themselves to go near the cliff again.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:33.304
They put themselves in a different place.

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:35.650
Let's use an analogy, it is like a more solid place.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.900
They train and get "kungfu". They are able to  use power 
 to blow their opponent to the bottom of the cliff.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.028
But not standing on the cliff to use a 
 special method to entice the opponent down.

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:49.635
So the catalyst is very special. It is something that 
 happens at the exact instant of failure.

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:54.730
What is your response is at that time. Most people experience 
 a desire to resist on the verge of failure.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.500
In my many years of teaching, my experiences have validate this observation.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.700
My students have mastered the movements, when the opponent accidentally fall off the  cliff, but they are not on the cliff, they are OK.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.700
But when they are also on the cliff, 
even when the opponents fall down, they get  scared.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.240
They do not train the correct moves any more after the experience.

00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:17.540
Normal people, we say Yin and Yang. They wander around the Yang dimension.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.320
They cannot get near the Yin dimension. Because 
 they are afraid of the Yin dimension.
