00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:14.040
 1 9 l holds the best time on the old 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 tracktest if it is to go porsche 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.990
 that on the new route is no different 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 his 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.080
 and send for this task 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.080
 do not feed anybody 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.480
 but their double zero agents on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.480
 wheels 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.279
 with the 911 gt3 rs comes the swabian 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 runner par excellence for the inaugural visit 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.400
 the lures riding center a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.400
 welcome guest 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.989
 So a porsche is a porsche that 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.239
 you can feel it no matter if in the smallest boxer 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.239
 quote or now here 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.860
 before going for the model on the catwalk 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.860
 Let's have a look at the setcard 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.579
 a310 top goes the gt3 rs 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 sprint from zero to one hundred in 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:10.890
 4.2 seconds performance 415 ps maximum 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.410
 torque 405 newton meters of displacement 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.009
 of course a boxer six with 3600 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.600
 cubic centimeters weight 1375 kilograms 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.899
 Models have to be slim 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.929
 The ticket is proud 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.929
 135,000 euros 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.429
 It stands for racing and so on 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 he presents himself no back seat 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.750
 high speed motor racing tires and one 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.750
 large spoiler luxury fail 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.850
 driving in the access model means 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.200
 Of course, as always in rent 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.200
 back to record atmosphere 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.700
 but there is also light atmospheric 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.700
 disorders 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.579
 this frame from the cage 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.900
 At the beginning you will find it's funny 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.709
 but then at some point it's off 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.709
 really on the cookie 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.569
 okay you could from the Berghaus such a 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.280
 to deliver small channels 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.829
 The cage is already working extremely hard 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.470
 but it also helps in the car, of course, 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.730
 torsional strength is increased, the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.909
 I was not sure about safety 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.909
 speak 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 other things please 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.480
 restraint 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.790
 what almost - in the car is called sets 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.920
 you go in! 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.050
 Everything starts hectic 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.800
 Turn off all buttons all behavior 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.040
 look to switch 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.530
 here you go march and 23 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.300
 okay then it's out of the corner 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.920
 now something briefly regulated 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.420
 that is so relaxing that you really 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.400
 does not wear the try comes 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.960
 to turn everything off but it's on 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.150
 a bit more supportive a bit 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.620
 a little warning note that mine 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.990
 friend there it was a little early on 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.130
 Because of this, gas has a traction control 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.990
 bit intervened 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.430
 it is not a form and it is 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.430
 really a nice support before 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.300
 the bicycle 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.930
 but the driver gets support 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.319
 not just from the healed 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.260
 grip the ceramic brake with the whole 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:41.430
 panic that is conclusive it does not work 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.430
 in super performance tires 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.860
 I consider it as are just 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.080
 the arcs have arcs 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.620
 that harmonizes it suits each other 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.560
 it is also the dominant reason 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.060
 form on a new elfer 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.590
 identifying features of the rs broad track 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.410
 and thick baking race bowls and cage 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.790
 The interior is the driving experience 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.360
 subordinate only luxury is the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.310
 cladding with alcantara in gt3 rs applies 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.310
 less is more in this case 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.930
 I find it fascinating that a car 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:26.240
 with so much precision but also creative 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.760
 is just by doing that 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.080
 according to all treated as clear 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.280
 the bub now wears a bit of fun 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.640
 we drive across there 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.410
 Just a gt3 rs is im 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.540
 border area only for the knowledgeable 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:43.940
 Hand on the steering wheel is just such a car 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.090
 you have long been a gibson 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:50.800
 gas order approximately if you want 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.800
 in the best case it looks like that 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.680
 this nine does not only bring the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.380
 Tires to smoke but also his 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.260
 father to glow i find perfect 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.750
 Precision revving engine great 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.230
 power delivery switchable transmission 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.240
 perfect in all corners 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:20.090
 this green sneakers is serious 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.160
 the best time wavered 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.990
 off we go to start and finish at the 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.820
 Most other manufacturers in the premium 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.530
 sports car segment is looking for now 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.450
 Any buttons where goes in the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.400
 launch control or something about that 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.650
 Helps me start here says porsche 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.330
 clearly boy you are silly coupling 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.770
 get in gear 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.770
 speed up and hurt 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.230
 the hunt for the best time on the 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.890
 route of the lok driving center can 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.890
 begin 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.979
 No 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.470
 on the other side we flash the rs 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:08.960
 with 100 92 47 km h 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.250
 by sending a second round and then 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.660
 logically everything is going on here 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.010
 second year just now that 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.140
 understeering quite a maybe 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.850
 not back the 180 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:24.160
 right here they are playing their grip 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.160
 starch out of you sticking like pattex 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:32.830
 two curves still to the finish 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.830
 Which time will the stopwatch stand? 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:50.509
 the Porsche 911 gt3 rs made it 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.310
 with a lap time of 1 06 93 sets 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:55.159
 he is at the top of the tracktest 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:57.199
 best list and that too clear that he 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:58.430
 somehow the time of 3 already somewhere 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:00.889
 can beat already because of the cup 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.120
 mature in the data analysis I have 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.979
 but somehow someone has thought me 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.490
 something in the eye because one 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:10.430
 minute 693 more than five seconds 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.310
 to smear on the bread in the 3 is that 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.629
 tremendous today a king and me 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:17.020
 think that will be pretty long 

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:17.020
 stay
