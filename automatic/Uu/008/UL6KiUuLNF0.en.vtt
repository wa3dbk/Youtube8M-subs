00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
going into it that it was going to be a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.190 
going into it that it was going to be a
challenge<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> directors<00:01:06.750> knew<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.049> course

challenge the directors knew of course
but<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.500> think<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.310> important<00:01:08.729> for

but I think it was really important for

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
but I think it was really important for
the<00:01:09.000> students<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.049> look<00:01:10.680> you're

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
going to be doing what you've always

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.660 
going to be doing what you've always
done<00:01:12.869> but<00:01:13.680> you're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.250> doing<00:01:14.369> two

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
done but you're going to be doing two

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.190 
done but you're going to be doing two
different<00:01:14.820> activities<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> same<00:01:15.930> time

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
different activities at the same time

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
different activities at the same time
it's<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.830> take<00:01:17.100> more<00:01:18.090> of<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.330> mental

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it's going to take more of a mental

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.320 
it's going to take more of a mental
effort<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.350> awareness<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.490> what<00:01:20.759> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
effort and awareness to know what you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.640 
effort and awareness to know what you
know<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> take<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.170> achieve<00:01:22.290> all

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
know it's going to take to achieve all

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
know it's going to take to achieve all
of<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.950> so<00:01:23.340> you'd<00:01:23.460> say<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.850> you've<00:01:24.780> got<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
of that so you'd say it's you've got the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.200 
of that so you'd say it's you've got the
culture<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> excellence<00:01:25.920> embedded<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
culture of excellence embedded in it and

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.480 
culture of excellence embedded in it and
then<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.600> about<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:28.590> pointing<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.250> kids

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
then it's about just pointing the kids

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
then it's about just pointing the kids
in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.820> direction<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.650> what

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
in the right direction for this is what

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.170 
in the right direction for this is what
it's<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> concert<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.060> it's

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it's like in concert this is what it's

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.429 
it's like in concert this is what it's

favorite memory from Midwest I your

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.690 
favorite memory from Midwest I your

think<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.480> was<00:02:42.629> probably<00:02:42.900> when<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
think it was probably when the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.789 
think it was probably when the
composer's<00:02:45.120> came<00:02:45.480> into<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.810> rehearsal<00:02:46.379> yeah

composer's came into the rehearsal yeah

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.670 
composer's came into the rehearsal yeah
