the traditional old Soviet texts but I

the traditional old Soviet texts but I

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
would say most of my information that I

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.780 
would say most of my information that I
get<00:02:54.140> now<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.500> through<00:02:54.680> experimentation<00:02:55.400> on<00:02:55.700> my

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
get now is through experimentation on my

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.569 
get now is through experimentation on my
population<00:02:56.269> having<00:02:56.989> older<00:02:57.799> populations<00:02:58.430> and

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
population having older populations and

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.539 
population having older populations and
watching<00:02:58.970> how<00:02:59.090> fast<00:02:59.450> or<00:02:59.690> slow<00:02:59.720> they<00:03:00.049> recover

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
watching how fast or slow they recover

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.430 
watching how fast or slow they recover
having<00:03:01.549> younger<00:03:01.880> kids<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.450> seeing<00:03:03.079> how<00:03:03.230> fast

having younger kids and seeing how fast

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.020 
having younger kids and seeing how fast
they<00:03:03.680> recover<00:03:04.100> and<00:03:04.370> they<00:03:04.519> respond<00:03:04.970> to

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
they recover and they respond to

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.360 
they recover and they respond to
training<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.290> also<00:03:06.440> experimenting<00:03:07.280> on

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
training and then also experimenting on

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.490 
training and then also experimenting on
myself<00:03:07.819> still<00:03:08.090> and<00:03:08.359> trying<00:03:08.660> new<00:03:08.900> things<00:03:08.930> all

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
myself still and trying new things all

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.890 
myself still and trying new things all
the<00:03:09.530> time<00:03:09.889> with<00:03:10.160> without<00:03:11.000> leaving<00:03:11.299> my<00:03:11.660> base

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
the time with without leaving my base

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.990 
the time with without leaving my base
knowledge<00:03:12.200> okay<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.100> think<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.489> where<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.700> get

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
knowledge okay I think is where I get

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.809 
knowledge okay I think is where I get
most<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.420> my<00:03:14.480> knowledge<00:03:14.630> now<00:03:14.930> but<00:03:15.170> I<00:03:15.200> would<00:03:15.380> say

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
most of my knowledge now but I would say

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.199 
most of my knowledge now but I would say
med<00:03:16.819> D<00:03:17.000> EV<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:18.170> was<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.250> actually<00:03:19.400> spoke<00:03:19.819> a<00:03:20.000> lot

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.180 
with virtus and ski before he died in
Italy<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.410> got<00:03:24.410> got<00:03:24.620> quite<00:03:24.889> a<00:03:24.920> bit<00:03:25.099> of

out one in the field so I think for me
to<00:05:12.169> have<00:05:12.320> a<00:05:12.349> connection<00:05:12.770> to<00:05:13.010> them<00:05:13.160> more<00:05:13.460> I<00:05:13.700> need

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.460 
again I just think it gives me a better
base<00:05:19.550> of<00:05:19.760> knowledge<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.289> understand<00:05:21.289> what

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
base of knowledge and understand what

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.960 
base of knowledge and understand what
the<00:05:21.560> body<00:05:21.740> can<00:05:21.979> really<00:05:22.190> take<00:05:22.550> when<00:05:22.849> I'm

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
the body can really take when I'm

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:24.730 
the body can really take when I'm
telling<00:05:23.180> these<00:05:23.389> kids<00:05:23.450> how<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:23.960> squat<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:24.680> they

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
telling these kids how to squat and they

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.990 
telling these kids how to squat and they
don't<00:05:24.889> have<00:05:25.010> briefs<00:05:25.250> on<00:05:25.430> or<00:05:25.639> they<00:05:25.729> don't<00:05:25.820> have

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
don't have briefs on or they don't have

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.960 
don't have briefs on or they don't have
you<00:05:26.330> know<00:05:26.360> a<00:05:26.450> bell<00:05:26.720> or<00:05:26.930> they<00:05:27.050> don't<00:05:27.139> have<00:05:27.229> suits

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
you know a bell or they don't have suits

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.460 
you know a bell or they don't have suits
how<00:05:28.970> much<00:05:29.180> muscle<00:05:29.630> damage<00:05:29.900> are<00:05:30.139> they<00:05:30.260> getting

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
how much muscle damage are they getting

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.050 
how much muscle damage are they getting
from<00:05:30.770> these<00:05:30.889> training<00:05:31.280> methods<00:05:31.639> if<00:05:31.729> I<00:05:31.820> can't

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
from these training methods if I can't

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.760 
from these training methods if I can't
do<00:05:32.210> it<00:05:32.300> then<00:05:32.479> what<00:05:33.050> should<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.260> have<00:05:33.289> them<00:05:33.500> do<00:05:33.620> it

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
do it then what should I have them do it

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.100 
do it then what should I have them do it
the<00:05:34.490> last<00:05:34.669> question<00:05:35.120> in<00:05:35.419> this<00:05:35.570> segment<00:05:35.810> I'm

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
the last question in this segment I'm

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.140 
the last question in this segment I'm
going<00:05:36.229> to<00:05:36.320> hit<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.650> with<00:05:36.680> is<00:05:37.000> looking<00:05:38.000> at

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
going to hit you with is looking at

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.060 
going to hit you with is looking at
newer<00:05:38.900> lifters<00:05:39.470> what<00:05:39.620> are<00:05:39.740> some<00:05:39.889> of<00:05:39.979> the

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
newer lifters what are some of the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.620 
newer lifters what are some of the
common<00:05:40.400> mistakes<00:05:40.550> that<00:05:41.030> you<00:05:41.180> see<00:05:41.419> with<00:05:41.539> people

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
common mistakes that you see with people

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.190 
common mistakes that you see with people
you<00:05:41.930> work<00:05:42.110> with<00:05:43.210> well<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.510> think<00:05:44.690> with<00:05:44.960> if

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
you work with well I think with if

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.620 
you work with well I think with if
you're<00:05:45.349> talking<00:05:45.530> about<00:05:45.710> power<00:05:46.430> lifters<00:05:46.849> the

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:47.630 
you're talking about power lifters the

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.480 
you're talking about power lifters the
biggest<00:05:47.990> mistake<00:05:48.349> is<00:05:48.620> is<00:05:48.979> trying<00:05:49.250> to<00:05:49.370> get

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
biggest mistake is is trying to get

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.550 
biggest mistake is is trying to get
strong<00:05:49.729> too<00:05:49.820> fast<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:50.570> I'm<00:05:50.870> sure<00:05:51.080> there's

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 
strong too fast and I'm sure there's

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.100 
strong too fast and I'm sure there's
been<00:05:51.620> 50<00:05:52.220> other<00:05:52.340> guys<00:05:52.400> to<00:05:52.729> say<00:05:52.910> that<00:05:53.120> but<00:05:53.990> you

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
been 50 other guys to say that but you

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:56.650 
been 50 other guys to say that but you
really<00:05:54.349> have<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.500> have<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.770> big<00:05:55.160> balance<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:56.120> in

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:56.660 
really have to have a big balance and in

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.030 
really have to have a big balance and in
a

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
a

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.670 
a
understanding<00:05:57.490> of<00:05:57.610> your<00:05:57.760> genetic<00:05:58.450> and

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
understanding of your genetic and

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.860 
understanding of your genetic and
structural<00:05:59.680> weaknesses<00:06:00.250> get<00:06:01.180> those<00:06:01.450> super

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
structural weaknesses get those super

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.270 
structural weaknesses get those super
strong<00:06:02.140> and<00:06:02.380> then<00:06:02.470> let<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.770> strength<00:06:03.070> come

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
strong and then let the strength come

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.580 
strong and then let the strength come
slowly<00:06:03.670> I<00:06:03.820> think<00:06:04.120> strength<00:06:04.720> has<00:06:04.990> a<00:06:05.020> lot<00:06:05.290> to<00:06:05.440> do

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
slowly I think strength has a lot to do

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.460 
slowly I think strength has a lot to do
with<00:06:05.620> the<00:06:05.950> body's<00:06:06.520> ability<00:06:06.670> ability<00:06:07.420> to<00:06:07.630> be

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
with the body's ability ability to be

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.030 
with the body's ability ability to be
highly<00:06:08.770> coordinated<00:06:09.010> very<00:06:09.820> strong<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:10.630> also

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
highly coordinated very strong and also

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.090 
highly coordinated very strong and also
have<00:06:12.040> a<00:06:12.430> very<00:06:12.640> high<00:06:13.360> tolerance<00:06:13.720> for<00:06:14.140> pain<00:06:14.380> and

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
have a very high tolerance for pain and

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.710 
have a very high tolerance for pain and
discomfort<00:06:15.400> and<00:06:15.850> those<00:06:16.300> things<00:06:16.510> take<00:06:16.690> time

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
discomfort and those things take time

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720 
discomfort and those things take time
you<00:06:17.680> can't<00:06:17.890> just<00:06:17.980> you<00:06:18.280> know<00:06:18.310> you're<00:06:18.520> it's

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
you can't just you know you're it's

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:20.190 
you can't just you know you're it's
gonna<00:06:18.850> be<00:06:18.970> rare<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.240> find<00:06:19.540> a<00:06:19.630> guy<00:06:19.750> who<00:06:19.780> can<00:06:20.080> take

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
gonna be rare to find a guy who can take

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.660 
gonna be rare to find a guy who can take
it<00:06:20.350> 18<00:06:20.650> years<00:06:20.830> older<00:06:21.130> by<00:06:21.250> the<00:06:21.310> time<00:06:21.490> he's<00:06:21.640> 20

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:21.670 
it 18 years older by the time he's 20

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.000 
it 18 years older by the time he's 20
he's<00:06:22.120> gonna<00:06:22.270> be<00:06:22.390> a<00:06:22.420> world<00:06:22.630> champion<00:06:23.010> these

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
he's gonna be a world champion these

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:25.230 
he's gonna be a world champion these
types<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.460> sports<00:06:24.670> take<00:06:24.940> a<00:06:24.970> lot<00:06:25.150> of

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
types of sports take a lot of

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.200 
types of sports take a lot of
developmental<00:06:25.900> time<00:06:26.110> to<00:06:26.590> get<00:06:26.740> better<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.490> I

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
developmental time to get better and I

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.210 
developmental time to get better and I
think<00:06:28.270> people<00:06:28.720> try<00:06:29.230> to<00:06:29.290> get<00:06:29.500> good<00:06:29.710> too<00:06:29.920> fast

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
think people try to get good too fast

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.130 
think people try to get good too fast
and<00:06:30.460> end<00:06:30.610> up<00:06:30.760> having<00:06:31.300> injuries<00:06:31.750> and<00:06:31.900> I<00:06:31.930> think

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:32.140 
and end up having injuries and I think

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.460 
and end up having injuries and I think
that's<00:06:32.320> one<00:06:32.500> of<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.620> most<00:06:34.290> advantages<00:06:35.290> that<00:06:35.410> I

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
that's one of the most advantages that I

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.310 
that's one of the most advantages that I
have<00:06:35.740> is<00:06:35.950> the<00:06:36.040> lifter<00:06:36.310> as<00:06:36.520> I<00:06:36.700> broke<00:06:37.290> quite<00:06:38.290> a

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
have is the lifter as I broke quite a

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.810 
have is the lifter as I broke quite a
bit<00:06:38.530> of<00:06:38.620> world<00:06:38.800> records<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.280> done<00:06:39.400> quite<00:06:39.790> a

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
bit of world records and done quite a

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.250 
bit of world records and done quite a
bit<00:06:39.970> of<00:06:40.060> significant<00:06:40.570> things<00:06:40.810> I've<00:06:41.020> never<00:06:41.110> had

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.260 
bit of significant things I've never had

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.410 
bit of significant things I've never had
more<00:06:41.410> than<00:06:41.470> a<00:06:41.620> muscle<00:06:41.920> pull<00:06:42.040> so<00:06:43.000> I'm<00:06:43.090> not<00:06:43.270> the

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:43.420 
more than a muscle pull so I'm not the

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.730 
more than a muscle pull so I'm not the
guy<00:06:43.540> walking<00:06:43.870> around<00:06:43.930> going<00:06:44.260> oh<00:06:44.410> I<00:06:44.440> had<00:06:44.710> a

elbow surgery here in a shoulder surgery
here<00:06:46.810> something<00:06:47.500> starts<00:06:47.710> going<00:06:47.950> wrong<00:06:48.100> I

here something starts going wrong I
changed<00:06:48.550> my<00:06:48.640> training<00:06:48.970> everything<00:06:49.330> is<00:06:49.390> right

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
changed my training everything is right

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.600 
changed my training everything is right
yeah<00:06:49.900> where's<00:06:50.650> a<00:06:50.710> lot<00:06:50.920> of<00:06:51.040> other<00:06:51.160> people<00:06:51.400> don't

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610
