so happen what do you think Michael
what's<00:03:19.080> your<00:03:19.290> what's<00:03:19.830> your<00:03:19.860> verdict<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.460> the

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.730 

wasn't<00:03:24.360> expecting<00:03:24.900> bathroom<00:03:25.290> ceiling<00:03:25.500> I

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
wasn't expecting bathroom ceiling I

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.320 
wasn't expecting bathroom ceiling I
thought<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.070> might<00:03:26.220> be<00:03:26.250> proper<00:03:26.550> seating<00:03:27.060> but

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
thought it might be proper seating but

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.790 
thought it might be proper seating but
never<00:03:27.540> mind<00:03:32.120> places<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.480> although<00:03:34.350> it's<00:03:34.650> gone

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
never mind places so although it's gone

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.500 
never mind places so although it's gone
back<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.130> bright<00:03:35.340> metal<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.880> starts<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.330> darken

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
back to bright metal it starts to darken

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.050 
back to bright metal it starts to darken
very<00:03:36.990> creatures<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.650> normally<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.190> want<00:03:38.910> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
very creatures that normally you want to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.580 
very creatures that normally you want to
put<00:03:39.210> something<00:03:39.420> straight<00:03:39.810> on<00:03:39.960> to<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:42.590> but

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
put something straight on to that but

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.870 
put something straight on to that but
for<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.860> rest<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.160> it<00:03:44.280> it's<00:03:44.430> actually<00:03:44.550> quite

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
for the rest of it it's actually quite

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.880 
for the rest of it it's actually quite
important<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.690> that<00:03:46.080> all<00:03:46.260> you<00:03:46.410> do<00:03:46.560> is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
important that that all you do is

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.790 
important that that all you do is
literally<00:03:47.870> dust<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:49.050> down<00:03:49.230> with<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> paintbrush

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
literally dust it down with a paintbrush

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.560 
literally dust it down with a paintbrush
and<00:03:50.250> put<00:03:50.400> an<00:03:50.490> X<00:03:50.640> primer<00:03:50.940> straight<00:03:51.270> on<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and put an X primer straight on it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.940 
and put an X primer straight on it
you're<00:03:51.990> going<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.170> be<00:03:52.230> tempted<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.680> put<00:03:52.770> any

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
you're going to be tempted to put any

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.860 
you're going to be tempted to put any
other<00:03:53.190> chemicals<00:03:53.610> I<00:03:53.730> think<00:03:53.910> it's<00:03:54.450> time<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.780> do

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
other chemicals I think it's time to do

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.040 
other chemicals I think it's time to do
its<00:03:55.020> job<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.260> stick<00:03:55.650> to<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.890> steel<00:03:59.450> and<00:04:00.450> you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
its job and stick to the steel and you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.630 
its job and stick to the steel and you
say<00:04:01.200> you<00:04:01.260> used<00:04:01.560> about<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.800> back<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.250> half<00:04:02.460> of

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
say you used about a back and a half of

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.280 
say you used about a back and a half of
your<00:04:02.790> arch<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.360> high<00:04:03.450> material<00:04:05.810> we've<00:04:06.810> had<00:04:07.050> to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
your arch of high material we've had to

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.080 
your arch of high material we've had to
run<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.860> slightly<00:04:08.130> lower<00:04:08.520> pressure<00:04:08.940> than

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
run and slightly lower pressure than

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.990 
run and slightly lower pressure than
they<00:04:09.270> would<00:04:09.420> like<00:04:09.600> to<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:10.110> places<00:04:10.350> but<00:04:11.000> the

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
they would like to get in places but the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.510 
they would like to get in places but the
benefit<00:04:12.390> of<00:04:12.420> that<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:13.070> it<00:04:14.070> takes<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.370> bit

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
benefit of that is that it takes a bit

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.670 
benefit of that is that it takes a bit
longer<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:14.910> can<00:04:14.970> use<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.390> less<00:04:15.540> mediums<00:04:16.049> it

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
longer we can use a bit less mediums it

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.060 
longer we can use a bit less mediums it
is<00:04:16.950> fair<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> say<00:04:17.400> that<00:04:17.430> our<00:04:17.670> overworked<00:04:18.330> and

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
is fair to say that our overworked and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.520 
is fair to say that our overworked and
our<00:04:20.070> compressor<00:04:20.840> didn't<00:04:21.840> quite<00:04:22.049> operate<00:04:22.410> the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
our compressor didn't quite operate the

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.290 
our compressor didn't quite operate the
way<00:04:22.650> that<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.250> did<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> last<00:04:23.610> time<00:04:23.910> Michael

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
way that it did the last time Michael

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.510 
way that it did the last time Michael
goes<00:04:24.419> into<00:04:24.600> this<00:04:24.720> so<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.350> it<00:04:26.040> wasn't<00:04:26.310> able<00:04:26.370> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
goes into this so and it wasn't able to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.980 
goes into this so and it wasn't able to
push<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:28.590> blasting<00:04:29.010> pot<00:04:29.190> as<00:04:29.520> well<00:04:29.700> as<00:04:29.990> he

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
push the the blasting pot as well as he

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.020 
push the the blasting pot as well as he
would<00:04:31.500> have<00:04:31.620> liked<00:04:31.830> and<00:04:32.040> we<00:04:32.100> would<00:04:32.940> have

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
would have liked and we would have

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.390 
would have liked and we would have
preferred<00:04:33.360> for<00:04:33.390> him<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:34.710> majority<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.160> it<00:04:35.310> was

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
preferred for him the majority of it was

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.700 
preferred for him the majority of it was
blasted<00:04:35.820> about<00:04:36.180> 40<00:04:36.660> psi<00:04:36.870> almost<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.440> little<00:04:37.650> bit

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
blasted about 40 psi almost a little bit

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.210 
blasted about 40 psi almost a little bit
lower<00:04:38.010> than<00:04:38.220> you'd<00:04:38.370> normally<00:04:38.460> be<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.650> that's

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
lower than you'd normally be so that's

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.770 
lower than you'd normally be so that's
that's<00:04:41.430> one<00:04:41.640> you<00:04:41.760> consider<00:04:42.090> having<00:04:42.480> said<00:04:42.750> that

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that's one you consider having said that

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.740 
that's one you consider having said that
it's<00:04:43.169> still<00:04:43.350> fantastic<00:04:44.250> job<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.000> has<00:04:45.540> really

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750
