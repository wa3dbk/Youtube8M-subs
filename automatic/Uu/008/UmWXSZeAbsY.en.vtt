capable of that then any of the other

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.720 
capable of that then any of the other
rifles<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.069> we've<00:02:21.190> had<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.520> our<00:02:21.580> history

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
rifles that we've had in our history

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.960 
rifles that we've had in our history
before<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:23.560> setup<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.190> this<00:02:24.250> actually

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
before and a setup like this actually

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.400 
before and a setup like this actually
gives<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.270> lot<00:02:25.480> more<00:02:25.510> capabilities

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
gives you a lot more capabilities

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.559 
gives you a lot more capabilities
because<00:02:26.770> you're<00:02:26.950> using<00:02:27.220> advanced<00:02:28.150> optics

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
because you're using advanced optics

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.030 
because you're using advanced optics
you're<00:02:28.720> using<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.050> advanced<00:02:29.500> ammunition

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
you're using the advanced ammunition

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.920 
you're using the advanced ammunition
you're<00:02:30.160> using<00:02:30.400> all<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.180> new<00:02:31.330> technologies

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
you're using all the new technologies

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.710 
you're using all the new technologies
that<00:02:31.959> we<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.170> here<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:33.760> demonstrate<00:02:34.000> kind

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
that we have here so to demonstrate kind

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.270 
that we have here so to demonstrate kind
of<00:02:34.780> what<00:02:34.870> we're<00:02:34.989> talking<00:02:35.349> about<00:02:35.409> I<00:02:35.829> got<00:02:36.250> a

take her first shot at the 20 yard plate

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.290 
take her first shot at the 20 yard plate
and<00:02:59.440> then<00:03:00.010> she<00:03:00.220> will<00:03:00.340> go<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.520> to<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.850> hundred

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
and then she will go out to the hundred

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.990 
and then she will go out to the hundred

out to two hundred come back to the 20

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.170 
out to two hundred come back to the 20
tagged<00:03:09.970> base<00:03:10.239> go<00:03:10.900> to<00:03:10.959> 300<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.709> keep<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.610> 20

tagged base go to 300 and keep going 20

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.449 
tagged base go to 300 and keep going 20
and<00:03:13.660> then<00:03:13.810> four<00:03:14.050> hundred<00:03:14.410> twenty<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.160> then

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
and then four hundred twenty and then

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.880 
and then four hundred twenty and then
five<00:03:15.730> hundred<00:03:16.150> and<00:03:16.390> what<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:17.050> does<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.739> it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
five hundred and what this does is it

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.350 
five hundred and what this does is it
really<00:03:18.160> trains<00:03:18.640> you're<00:03:18.850> transitioning

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
really trains you're transitioning

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.750 
really trains you're transitioning
because<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.140> closer<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.800> target<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.310> 20<00:03:21.580> yard

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
because the closer in target the 20 yard

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.030 
because the closer in target the 20 yard
targets<00:03:22.090> something<00:03:22.239> you<00:03:22.420> can<00:03:22.570> pull<00:03:22.959> in<00:03:23.170> clear

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
targets something you can pull in clear

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.890 
targets something you can pull in clear

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
that two three four five hundred yard

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.430 
that two three four five hundred yard
target<00:03:30.489> you've<00:03:30.970> got<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.330> take<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.720> extra<00:03:32.110> few

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
take that good breath and squeeze

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.520 
take that good breath and squeeze
through<00:03:37.360> your<00:03:37.420> trigger<00:03:37.750> without<00:03:37.930> moving<00:03:38.410> that

crosshair so you can make contact with

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.259 
crosshair so you can make contact with
us<00:03:40.360> targets<00:03:40.750> of<00:03:40.840> distance<00:03:41.940> once<00:03:42.940> she<00:03:43.120> gets

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
us targets of distance once she gets
