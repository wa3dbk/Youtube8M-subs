00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.860
 the sensations comment on each song 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.860
 every throw me wrong 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.340
 the rebellion possessed by the rhythm of the 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.500
 night I talked to karma and it sounds like 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.989
 alarm weapon verses that disarm and those 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.000
 puts mourning and any chubby using 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.370

 laughter reproaches and ashes without having to 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.020
 say enough view and analyze that in my 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.329
 letters makes you shreds are not borders 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.519
 without having to use the andoian visa strip 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.829
 of gas leaving but they are masses for 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:54.190
 make them more fierce as cockroach is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.559
 under the table -1 quiet in a 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 cherry with his bullshit know that to me 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.829

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.110
 in throwing me a lot of tequila sometimes 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.270
 I think insecure and in excess you are not 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.479
 You're a fucking 15 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.149
 the contentions that the song every 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:22.270
 they pull me from rebellion to the possessed 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:28.000
 for the rhythm of hip hop for containment 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:30.670
 in each song every I pull the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.750
 rebellion when possessed by the pace of 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.640
 hip hop 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.619
 the street calls me clama means the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.959
 drama branch that turn on the plasma for 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.149
 let the bed come out I know how it sounded 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:42.429
 I'd better take care of everything that I'm the 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.829
 plague so that is what the load does not 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.630
 nobody is metric when I know her 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.970
 tell me about your flow that I 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.590
 I do not know, I'm the one who keeps you well and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.140
 he wants you to point it out and you do not 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.759
 It agrees serious issue is in my mind and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.009
 is to teach you what is this the 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.470
 structure you do not know anything better 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.329
 first natural all your songs for 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.149
 they are pure trash and mine is 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:06.520
 excellence without censorship I put it 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:10.090
 intention action in each song each 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:13.000
 that they throw me more medals on the plane 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.290
 I am the rebellion and it was not followed by the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.450
 hip hop rhythm 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.450
 by such intense emotion in every song 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:25.150
 to which the rebellion throws me 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.040
 I'm possessed by the rhythm of hip hop in 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.560
 everything is beyond what this ever 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.349
 stepped on and in less in minutes it falls off the 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.900
 unforeseen newbie treats me to no longer 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.260
 it turns me off I come compelling everything 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.420
 can go fast you stay is tiny 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.060

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.909
 minutes you feel great to get out in 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.030
 youtube there is nothing 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.159

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.209
