00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.290
 much more a video 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.960
 good on this video, I'll have it again 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.860
 tried to teach how to teach in the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.330
 ghost match that good boom on is 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.820
 This is where I see it. 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.099
 seeming to appear new invisible you 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.520
 goes back invisible - understood 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.829
 without appearing and cellphone and you may be 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.320
 using this for example you are here and the 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.180
 dude it's there it 's you 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.090
 the box goes back weibo nando o 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.969
 Sir, speaking in the woods, he understood. 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.679
 good you can also use the court 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.660
 for you to fall place to the belt sending 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.210
 but there is still no teacher yet in the 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.359
 second and tals 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.390
 Good, I want to know who sees you. 4 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.890
 It's like bruna. 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.289
 You may be thinking that it's just 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.809
 tightening centered and patras and effective for 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.280
 so much space or locally but not 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:08.590
 It's good to pay you first 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is a keyboard that is not space does not 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.960
 be soft for example on one side and 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.230
 below the other too 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.440
 anyway the good keyboard we can say so 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.990
 And then you think it tight there you belong 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.640
 a little bit in this time that you are 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.290
 invisible you jump and when you 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.530
 when I get on the floor I could get them new like this 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.300
 Hey, there's a video explaining how 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.250
 fits jumps that basically the same 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.620
 Only thing that you do standing up 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.190
 It's more or less that way, and so 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:41.230
 But I gave you the video as 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.300
 It fits the description purpose 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:48.430
 learn at least it's good, let's go there now 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.650
 I'll move on to gr 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.170
 I will show to another otherwise there for 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.350
 I can have a personal beauty. I'll have it. 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.860
 here on the map castle and good now back 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.750
 in Sinimbu it 's because I played here 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.540
 because the other way, it does not work for you 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:08.050
 see right to you 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.379
 f 1 assuming at last as a cap you 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.790
 tightens crouched center types and tightens 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.310
 People go a little behind the gate. 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:19.230
 space party 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:25.319
 Iraq, for example, has shot 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:27.390
 mother daughter and back beauty take 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.840
 that now in the same act that you want 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.700
 win and go you pts 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.159
 there you see there you go behind carrying 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.280
 not you lose heart behind s tam 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.890
 and jumps and when we have less here 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.450
 If you have less then you pick up again. 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.099
 this will make you jump for example 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.629
 Where are you cooking chance? 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.970
 Well, you'll do it again. 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.230
 understood this is basically is 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.450
 Basically, there you go. 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.410
 perfecting finally will have an hour that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750
 You 'll be able to do this. 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.760
 perfectly 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.019
 It's wrong and you will not know how to leave here. 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.750
 video is already super good but it goes 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.220
 come out knowing how you do or for example 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.109
 more or less 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.489
 that's what you liked 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.209
 Sorry for not having too many 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.549
 explanations to itown but it is by chance that 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.810
 I do not touch any friend online here and with 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.560
 friends would be much easier to 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:28.609
 demonstrate the business right? 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:28.609
 Good Day tried to climb here will not 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:39.359
 Do you even think that there is no problem? 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:46.250
