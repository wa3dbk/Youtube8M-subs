things that people have missed big time

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.130 
things that people have missed big time
is<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> fact<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> he's<00:01:35.550> the<00:01:36.270> only<00:01:36.480> horse<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
is the fact that he's the only horse and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.680 
is the fact that he's the only horse and
history<00:01:37.470> that's<00:01:37.680> one<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:39.030> three<00:01:39.570> year

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
history that's one that for three year

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.750 
history that's one that for three year
old<00:01:39.840> group<00:01:40.080> won<00:01:40.230> races<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.800> Sydney<00:01:41.160> and<00:01:41.370> so

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
old group won races in Sydney and so

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.760 
old group won races in Sydney and so
when<00:01:42.360> they<00:01:42.390> start<00:01:42.750> realizing<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.410> I<00:01:43.470> think

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
when they start realizing that I think

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.470 
when they start realizing that I think
they<00:01:43.890> might<00:01:44.100> lift<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.700> accolades<00:01:45.120> even

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.480

they might lift the accolades even
further<00:01:45.720> now<00:01:46.680> thinking<00:01:47.010> back<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.430> early

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
further now thinking back to the early

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.980 
Anderson the breeders always always said
right<00:03:16.650> from<00:03:16.680> day<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.430> family

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
matures of age and I think if it keeps
maturing<00:03:22.650> away<00:03:22.860> as<00:03:23.130> we've<00:03:23.730> seen<00:03:23.880> what's

happened since the spring to the autumn

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.430 
happened since the spring to the autumn
i<00:03:25.860> think<00:03:26.460> is<00:03:26.550> scary<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.450> what<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.900> horses

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
i think is scary what what the horses

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.410 
i think is scary what what the horses
potential<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.700> we're<00:03:30.330> looking

beat it but yeah there's no such thing
as<00:04:05.760> certainties<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.150> racing<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.830> know

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
as certainties and racing and you know

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.710 
as certainties and racing and you know
when<00:04:08.100> we<00:04:08.220> took<00:04:08.459> Procyon<00:04:09.000> in<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.269> spring

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
when we took Procyon in the spring

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.960 
when we took Procyon in the spring
stakes<00:04:10.170> suddenly<00:04:10.680> he<00:04:11.519> was<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.670> dollar<00:04:11.850> twenty

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
stakes suddenly he was a dollar twenty

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.420 
stakes suddenly he was a dollar twenty
favorite<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.570> it<00:04:13.470> was<00:04:13.590> only<00:04:13.739> after<00:04:14.160> we<00:04:14.250> won

favorite and it was only after we won
that<00:04:14.640> race<00:04:15.209> i<00:04:15.480> think<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> Aussies

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
that race i think that the Aussies

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.500 
that race i think that the Aussies
really<00:04:16.560> started<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:17.070> wake<00:04:17.910> up<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.239> her<00:04:18.330> but<00:04:18.450> he

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
really started to wake up to her but he

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.390 
really started to wake up to her but he
is<00:04:18.630> so<00:04:19.470> there's<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.769> few<00:04:19.799> punters<00:04:20.220> in<00:04:20.280> the
