00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.490
 the functions that exist within the field 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.430

 of us entering the stadium 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.090

 When football arrives in Brazil, then 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.040

 after a room is the a rite room of 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.240
 passage where they mark one of the moments 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.530
 most important in Brazilian football and 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.230
 at the same time one of the most 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.510
 sad first cup of Brazil hosted is 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.970

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.670
 ends up having a setback against the selection 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.860
 Uruguayan 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.980
 This is just one of the cups so we have 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.020
 eight Bahians who portray for a period 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.400

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.070
 football is the pelÃ© shirt he 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.150
 scored the first goal in the late 1970s 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.040
 against italy 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.140
 we have the world cup balls to 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.940
 from the top of 70 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.640
