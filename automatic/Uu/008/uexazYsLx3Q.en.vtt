00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.670
 project that was planned in July 95 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.350

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.480

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.590
 January of 1996 why all the together 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.780

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.590
 call to create a new adventure of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.410

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.960
 finally by dragon ball it and here 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.850
 comes what nobody knows and animation 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.860
 trusted by the resounding success that 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.260
 seven seasons gave them dragon ball z 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.360
 today I wanted to sign a contract to do 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.720
 the same number of seasons 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.570
 that is to say the 291 chapters but toriyama 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.700
 he refused as if sensing the failure and 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.740
 agreed to initially authorize three 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.900
 seasons of dragon ball of which 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.810
 would cover a period between February 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 96 to September 99 with a total 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.560
 approximately 138 chapters with him 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 of extend two more seasons if the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.200
 series was successful calculating until January 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.210
 from the 2002 dragon ball and started to 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 be broadcast in Tokyo on Wednesday 7 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.030
 February 1996 and achieved a crushing 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.069
 tune in his first 26 episodes 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.990
 according to the balance made by toe and 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.200
 animation and the embodied leaders 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.149
 hard the new plans centered since 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.520
 after the battle of baby they had 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.979
 planned an excellent second season 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.039
 with the appearance of the super android 17 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.179
 which would last 50 chapters 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.790
 approximately and not seven miserable 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.650
 chapters like everyone seen but when 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.599
 began the battle of baby began to 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.640
 turn black the prosperous future that 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.650
 had the series staying with the syntony 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.720
 through the floors at the end of the first 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.549
 season being that it had started very 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.709
 well he could not even save the 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.580
 transformation of the super sayayin 4 of 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.860
 crazy 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.660
 by flame when realizing this is 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.730
 angry with the executives of everything and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.440
 ordered to take out dragon ball vice from the air 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.140
 joel reached an agreement to advance 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.540
 the last saga which was planned 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.760
 initially for the 3rd season the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.530
 which was the saga of the dragons which 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 it was not very good since they had to 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.460
 rush everything including the channel of the 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.020
 series that's why the end of the 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.260
 dragon valli and left much to be desired 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.930
 for all or almost all with respect to 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.030
 the super saiyan 4 the fusion of goku and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.100
 vegeta in super saiyan 4 was had 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.440
 planned for the saga of the super android 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.630
 17 in the second season but the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 failure forced to run the merger of what 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.410
 that is super sayayin 4 at the end of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.870
 beat and when they were fighting with the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.690
 dragon of a star fuck super 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.910
 saiyan 4 on the internet round the photo of a 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.040
 goian poster in super saiyan kill 4 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.290
 printed by the atomic study they understand 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.940
 printed since this poster we continue to 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.770
 many misunderstandings in 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.870
 special for the rumor of dragon ball a 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.300
 it's good it's photo is real one super 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.610
 sayayin 4 would also appear in the saga 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.980
 of the super android 17 in what would be the 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.790
 second season in you but in the end the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.799
 transforms 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.659
 He included us in the mythical lack of time 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.030
 due to the order of finishing the series 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.670
 made by all super calls and fans 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.560
 saiyan and good with a truth is that 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.689
 bread if it was going to transform into super 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.629
 saiyan but in the end it was not 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.150
 included for the reasons already mentioned 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.189
 and what happened to the contract as they should 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.170
 know after that dragon ball and finished 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.420
 destroyed bird gave him a new series 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.459
 from the reis room to meet until 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.349
 the contract initially signed that 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.909
 conclude as a way to complete the 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.939
 breach that made thousands of 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.790
 studios and botica even was going to be kids 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.500
 it did not happen of a special television the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.329
 special was born from the idea of 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.799
 convince all calls to continue 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:16.620
 dragon ball with a series totally 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.570
 new as we said before which 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.459
 it would happen one hundred years after issuing 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.889
 this series would be called dragon ball the 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.470
 new adventures where the protagonist 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.479
 would be the grandson of tango woman but 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.880
 after many negotiations between 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.949
 November and December of 1996 did not 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.169
 that toriyama came out of his decision and 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.200
 they later removed as special from 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.690
 television on March 26, 97 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.060
 under construction ramÃ³n here is more than 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.190
 that we believed there were many 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.050
 things that we would have liked to see 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.540
 except I hope that this little 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.730
 article even if it does not seem like I made them 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.770
 the doubts that of haiti not to be left 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.810
 cheat with some dragon things 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.700
 world as new seasons since 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.620
 many of the ideas for doing these 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.750
 rumors were taken out of what is not 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.780
 used in dragon ball and something of invention 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.700
 that creative space 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.700
 Greetings and I hope you liked it
