to<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.960> careful<00:00:46.170> about<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
to be careful about is that there is

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.080 
to be careful about is that there is
brush<00:00:48.059> inside<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:48.960> base<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> this<00:00:50.850> is

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
brush inside your base so and this is

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.479 
brush inside your base so and this is
probably<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.510> very<00:00:51.840> very<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.379> very<00:00:52.829> dangerous

find yourself in other world of hurt so
an<00:01:11.250> inside<00:01:12.030> your<00:01:12.150> Baker<00:01:12.330> basis<00:01:12.750> fairly<00:01:13.080> large

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
an inside your Baker basis fairly large

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.830 
an inside your Baker basis fairly large
but<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.610> large<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.540> very

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but it's not so large that it is very

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
but it's not so large that it is very
difficult<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.350> defend<00:01:17.000> there's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.090> rather

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
difficult to defend there's a rather

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.149 
difficult to defend there's a rather
narrow<00:01:18.630> choke<00:01:18.990> point<00:01:19.229> here<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.830> as<00:01:19.979> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
narrow choke point here and then as it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
narrow choke point here and then as it
comes<00:01:20.430> out<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.759> long<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> build<00:01:21.450> your

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
comes out as long as you build your

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
comes out as long as you build your
buildings<00:01:21.990> correctly<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.040> make<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.460> so

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
buildings correctly you can make it so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
buildings correctly you can make it so
that<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> units<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.930> funnel<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.409> through

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
that the units have to funnel in through

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
that the units have to funnel in through
the<00:01:25.890> other<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.400> side<00:01:26.640> or<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:26.970> side<00:01:27.270> which

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
the other this side or this side which

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.390 
the other this side or this side which
really<00:01:28.049> helps<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> long<00:01:28.979> run<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
really helps out in the long run and

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.850 
really helps out in the long run and
after<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.020> very<00:01:31.170> very<00:01:31.619> easily

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
after that you have a very very easily

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
after that you have a very very easily
to<00:01:32.310> defend<00:01:32.759> natural<00:01:33.390> expansion<00:01:33.750> here<00:01:34.259> but

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
to defend natural expansion here but

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.620 
to defend natural expansion here but
your<00:01:34.890> natural<00:01:35.250> expansion<00:01:35.520> opens<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.360> into

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
your natural expansion opens up into

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560 
your natural expansion opens up into
actually<00:01:37.380> three<00:01:37.890> separate<00:01:38.460> choke<00:01:38.790> points<00:01:39.210> or

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
actually three separate choke points or

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.480 
actually three separate choke points or
is<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.900> three<00:01:40.530> separate<00:01:40.770> opens<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.369> is

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is that three separate opens there is

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
is that three separate opens there is
one<00:01:41.759> choke<00:01:42.000> point<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.320> guarded<00:01:43.649> by

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
one choke point here that is guarded by

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.789 
one choke point here that is guarded by
destructible<00:01:44.369> rocks<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.560> do

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
destructible rocks and so that you do

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499 
destructible rocks and so that you do
not<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.399> concerned<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.270> too

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
not have to be concerned about all too

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
I've been that I've been asking and I

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.339 
I've been that I've been asking and I
like<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> see<00:02:32.879> and<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:33.450> is<00:02:33.599> going<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.019> help<00:02:34.200> a

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
like to see and this is going to help a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.440 
like to see and this is going to help a
lot<00:02:34.379> of<00:02:34.739> Zerg<00:02:34.980> players<00:02:35.340> out<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.819> that<00:02:36.269> they

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
lot of Zerg players out in that they

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.479 
lot of Zerg players out in that they
don't<00:02:36.660> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.930> take<00:02:37.170> down<00:02:37.410> rocks<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.099> order

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
don't need to take down rocks in order

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.339 
don't need to take down rocks in order
to<00:02:38.640> establish<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.180> third<00:02:39.569> base<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.050> this<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
to establish a third base so this is

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.250 
to establish a third base so this is
definitely<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.250> help<00:02:42.030> Zerg<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:42.989> one<00:02:43.140> of

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
definitely going to help Zerg but one of

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.660 
definitely going to help Zerg but one of
the<00:02:43.349> things<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> Zerg<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.040> not<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.519> to

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
the things that Zerg is not going to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.809 
the things that Zerg is not going to
like<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.269> this<00:02:45.900> expansion<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.819> recessed

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
like is that this expansion is recessed

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.570 
like is that this expansion is recessed
into<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.390> ground<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.650> by<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.890> being<00:02:50.099> recessed

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
into the ground so by it being recessed

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.490 
into the ground so by it being recessed

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
going to be able to get damaged onto

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.570 
going to be able to get damaged onto

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
this low ground fairly easily there are

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.460 
this low ground fairly easily there are
two<00:02:59.940> cell<00:03:00.209> naga<00:03:00.420> watchtowers<00:03:00.959> here<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.349> these

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
two cell naga watchtowers here but these

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.800 
two cell naga watchtowers here but these
all<00:03:01.620> naga<00:03:01.830> watch<00:03:02.099> hours<00:03:02.310> are<00:03:02.519> not<00:03:02.819> nearly<00:03:03.629> as

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
all naga watch hours are not nearly as

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.930 
all naga watch hours are not nearly as

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.290 
important as the Xel'Naga watch towers

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
were in Lost Temple 1.0 the the reason

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.780 
were in Lost Temple 1.0 the the reason
behind<00:03:09.599> this<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.800> these<00:03:11.220> first<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.730> all

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
behind this is that these first of all

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.640 
behind this is that these first of all
these<00:03:11.909> along<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.330> watchtowers<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.930> not<00:03:13.140> give

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
these along the watchtowers do not give

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.009 
these along the watchtowers do not give
each<00:03:13.769> other<00:03:13.920> site<00:03:14.310> as<00:03:14.519> they<00:03:14.790> do<00:03:14.849> similarly<00:03:15.659> in

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
each other site as they do similarly in

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.080 
each other site as they do similarly in
metal<00:03:16.590> opolis<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.280> even<00:03:17.819> though<00:03:17.909> that<00:03:17.940> is

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
metal opolis and even though that is

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.330 
metal opolis and even though that is
rather<00:03:18.480> close<00:03:18.930> so<00:03:19.349> I'm<00:03:19.590> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.890> surprised

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
rather close so I'm a little surprised

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:21.979 
rather close so I'm a little surprised
that<00:03:20.370> they<00:03:20.640> actually<00:03:20.819> don't<00:03:21.300> give<00:03:21.659> sight

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
that they actually don't give sight

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.800 
that they actually don't give sight
across<00:03:22.260> each<00:03:22.500> other<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:23.209> might<00:03:24.209> notice

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
across each other and might notice

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.600 
across each other and might notice
shouldn't<00:03:25.049> be<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.230> brush<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.739> guess<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.459> is

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
shouldn't be the brush I guess this is

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.520 
shouldn't be the brush I guess this is
just<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.849> rather<00:03:27.090> large<00:03:27.510> map<00:03:27.840> celoso<00:03:28.409> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
just a rather large map celoso the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.690 
just a rather large map celoso the
walking<00:03:28.890> distance<00:03:28.980> between<00:03:29.519> these<00:03:29.640> two

walking distance between these two

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.449 
walking distance between these two
locations<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.450> is<00:03:31.290> rather<00:03:31.650> large<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.280> that's

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
locations and is rather large so that's

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.729 
locations and is rather large so that's
why<00:03:32.640> even<00:03:33.090> though<00:03:33.299> it<00:03:33.480> looks<00:03:33.510> closer<00:03:34.049> than<00:03:34.470> on

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
why even though it looks closer than on

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.289 
why even though it looks closer than on
metal<00:03:35.069> opolis<00:03:35.370> it's<00:03:35.580> actually<00:03:35.849> a<00:03:35.879> little<00:03:36.090> bit

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
metal opolis it's actually a little bit

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.240 
metal opolis it's actually a little bit
further<00:03:36.540> away<00:03:36.629> or<00:03:37.140> perhaps<00:03:37.349> they<00:03:37.709> adjusted

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
further away or perhaps they adjusted

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.180

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
app review yeah the Xel'Naga wash cars

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.000 
app review yeah the Xel'Naga wash cars
are<00:03:45.569> not<00:03:45.599> nearly<00:03:46.049> as<00:03:46.170> important<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:46.769> they<00:03:46.950> were

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
are not nearly as important as they were

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.190 
are not nearly as important as they were
on<00:03:47.280> last<00:03:47.549> temple<00:03:47.940> because<00:03:48.330> there's<00:03:48.599> there's<00:03:49.110> a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
on last temple because there's there's a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.399 
on last temple because there's there's a
lot<00:03:49.500> easier<00:03:49.860> ways<00:03:50.549> to<00:03:50.580> flank<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.540> these<00:03:52.230> are

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
lot easier ways to flank and these are

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.039 
lot easier ways to flank and these are
naga<00:03:52.590> watchtowers<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.689> they<00:03:54.689> don't<00:03:54.870> they

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
naga watchtowers and they don't they

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.289 
naga watchtowers and they don't they
don't<00:03:55.080> give<00:03:55.349> as<00:03:55.500> give<00:03:55.860> as<00:03:56.040> much<00:03:56.189> site<00:03:56.489> across

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
don't give as give as much site across

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.570 
don't give as give as much site across
the<00:03:57.450> center<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.959> map<00:03:58.200> so<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.430> actually

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
the center of the map so it is actually

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.880 
the center of the map so it is actually
easy<00:04:00.030> in<00:04:00.360> order<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.900> just<00:04:01.200> take<00:04:01.409> down<00:04:01.650> these

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
easy in order to just take down these

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.429 
easy in order to just take down these
rocks<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.549> these<00:04:03.480> rocks<00:04:03.750> are<00:04:03.870> actually<00:04:04.260> the

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
rocks and these rocks are actually the

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:06.320 
rocks and these rocks are actually the
closer<00:04:04.860> way<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.640> into<00:04:05.939> your<00:04:06.090> opponent's

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
closer way to get into your opponent's

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.580 
closer way to get into your opponent's
base<00:04:06.659> if<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:07.049> say<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.290> spawned<00:04:07.739> directly

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
base if you say you spawned directly

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.710

to trying to cut through the center and

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.210 
to trying to cut through the center and
this<00:04:13.030> map<00:04:13.300> does<00:04:13.660> however<00:04:13.930> have<00:04:14.140> those<00:04:14.950> and

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
this map does however have those and

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.680 
this map does however have those and
promised<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.819> be<00:04:15.879> one<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.120> those<00:04:16.209> maps<00:04:16.449> where

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
promised to be one of those maps where

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.409 
promised to be one of those maps where
if<00:04:17.290> it<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.590> a<00:04:17.620> terran<00:04:18.010> vs<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> Terran<00:04:18.790> or<00:04:18.940> if<00:04:19.239> it's

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
if it is a terran vs a Terran or if it's

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.960 
if it is a terran vs a Terran or if it's
a<00:04:19.479> Terran<00:04:19.780> who<00:04:19.900> likes<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.350> siege<00:04:20.769> up<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.699> map

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
a Terran who likes the siege up this map

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.150 
a Terran who likes the siege up this map
is<00:04:22.000> very<00:04:22.449> easy<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.870> split<00:04:23.260> north<00:04:23.620> south<00:04:23.919> east

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
is very easy to split north south east

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.850 
is very easy to split north south east
west<00:04:24.669> not<00:04:25.360> so<00:04:25.600> much<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.020> north-south<00:04:26.620> there

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
west not so much but north-south there

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.670 
west not so much but north-south there
are<00:04:26.949> only<00:04:27.070> four<00:04:27.580> chokepoints<00:04:28.570> siege<00:04:29.169> tanks

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
are only four chokepoints siege tanks

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.500 
are only four chokepoints siege tanks

ground there are also ramps coming into
this<00:04:42.910> location<00:04:43.360> here<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:43.690> whenever<00:04:43.840> you're

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
this location here so whenever you're

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.690 
this location here so whenever you're
charging<00:04:44.620> up<00:04:44.800> a<00:04:45.010> ramp<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.310> got<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.580> be<00:04:45.669> very

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
charging up a ramp you got to be very

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.150 
charging up a ramp you got to be very
careful<00:04:45.970> and<00:04:46.510> as<00:04:47.080> your<00:04:47.380> opponent<00:04:47.740> will<00:04:47.889> have

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
careful and as your opponent will have

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.430 
careful and as your opponent will have
sight<00:04:48.490> on<00:04:48.729> you<00:04:48.940> unless<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.780> bring<00:04:49.990> along<00:04:50.320> an

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
other flying unit or a colossus as well

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.120 
other flying unit or a colossus as well
as<00:04:54.910> colossi<00:04:55.419> are<00:04:55.630> able<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.050> see<00:04:56.229> up<00:04:56.440> onto<00:04:57.100> that

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
as colossi are able to see up onto that

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.460 
as colossi are able to see up onto that
high<00:04:57.430> ground<00:04:57.729> but<00:04:58.240> yeah<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.389> like<00:04:58.720> this<00:04:58.750> map<00:04:59.169> and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
high ground but yeah I like this map and

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.800 
high ground but yeah I like this map and
I'm<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.700> hundred<00:05:01.000> percent<00:05:01.270> sure<00:05:01.300> who<00:05:01.690> it

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
I'm not hundred percent sure who it

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.900 
I'm not hundred percent sure who it
favors<00:05:02.050> just<00:05:02.650> quite<00:05:03.010> yet<00:05:03.039> there's<00:05:03.460> a<00:05:03.520> lot<00:05:03.880> of

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
favors just quite yet there's a lot of

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:06.570 
favors just quite yet there's a lot of
walkways<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.680> it's<00:05:06.250> going<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.520> very

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
walkways and so it's going to be very

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.400 
walkways and so it's going to be very
very<00:05:07.060> interesting<00:05:07.750> to<00:05:07.840> see<00:05:07.990> what<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.260> early

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
very interesting to see what the early

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.620 
very interesting to see what the early
game<00:05:08.740> is<00:05:08.889> going<00:05:09.070> to<00:05:09.220> play<00:05:09.400> out<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.630> because

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
game is going to play out like because

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.450 
game is going to play out like because
of<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.870> sheer<00:05:11.139> number<00:05:11.199> of<00:05:11.560> walkways<00:05:12.190> your

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
of the sheer number of walkways your

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.120 
of the sheer number of walkways your
opponent<00:05:12.970> can<00:05:13.150> get<00:05:13.389> into<00:05:13.690> your<00:05:13.810> base<00:05:14.130> very

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
opponent can get into your base very

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.940 
opponent can get into your base very
easily<00:05:15.610> if<00:05:16.060> they<00:05:16.720> take<00:05:16.990> a<00:05:17.200> roundabout<00:05:17.560> way<00:05:17.740> to

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
easily if they take a roundabout way to

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.060 
easily if they take a roundabout way to
get<00:05:18.190> into<00:05:18.340> your<00:05:18.520> base<00:05:18.990> so<00:05:19.990> yeah<00:05:20.560> if<00:05:20.740> they

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
get into your base so yeah if they

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:22.529 
get into your base so yeah if they
decide<00:05:21.370> to<00:05:21.400> instead<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.030> coming<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.330> the

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:22.539 
decide to instead of coming to the

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:24.120 
decide to instead of coming to the
center<00:05:22.660> they<00:05:22.900> try<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.110> implement<00:05:23.620> do<00:05:23.979> this

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
center they try to implement do this

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:25.680 
center they try to implement do this
brush<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.520> then<00:05:24.550> come<00:05:24.789> back<00:05:24.820> down<00:05:24.970> this<00:05:25.479> side

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
brush and then come back down this side

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.200 
brush and then come back down this side
you<00:05:26.260> do<00:05:26.410> not<00:05:26.590> see<00:05:26.950> it<00:05:27.099> by<00:05:27.250> activating<00:05:27.789> or<00:05:28.000> you

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
you do not see it by activating or you

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.700 
you do not see it by activating or you
could<00:05:28.450> see<00:05:28.690> if<00:05:28.780> I<00:05:28.840> acting<00:05:29.110> this<00:05:29.229> uh<00:05:29.289> naga<00:05:29.500> wash

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
could see if I acting this uh naga wash

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.129 
could see if I acting this uh naga wash
our<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.130> only<00:05:30.849> seen<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.090> little<00:05:31.419> portion<00:05:31.990> of

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
our and only seen a little portion of

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.920 
our and only seen a little portion of
this<00:05:32.289> walking<00:05:32.650> here<00:05:32.800> so<00:05:33.010> early<00:05:33.630> rushes<00:05:34.630> may<00:05:34.870> be

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
this walking here so early rushes may be

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.440 
this walking here so early rushes may be
possible<00:05:35.590> but<00:05:36.190> there<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.639> very<00:05:36.940> very<00:05:37.150> large

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
possible but there is a very very large

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.510 
possible but there is a very very large
walking<00:05:38.050> distance<00:05:38.440> between<00:05:38.860> these<00:05:39.070> bases

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
walking distance between these bases

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.400 
walking distance between these bases
