00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
Triton headset for the computer first of

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.640 
Triton headset for the computer first of
all<00:00:26.760> you've<00:00:27.240> got<00:00:27.269> your<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.810> you<00:00:30.810> need<00:00:31.019> at

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
all you've got your right so you need at

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.950 
all you've got your right so you need at
least<00:00:32.899> two<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.290> these<00:00:35.059> at<00:00:36.059> least<00:00:36.329> two<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> these

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
least two of these at least two of these

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590 
least two of these at least two of these
it<00:00:37.800> doesn't<00:00:38.010> matter<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.700> as<00:00:39.000> long<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
it doesn't matter just as long as you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.970 
it doesn't matter just as long as you
can<00:00:39.719> connect<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:41.250> Y<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.710> you've<00:00:43.710> got

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
can connect them like Y so you've got

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.569 
can connect them like Y so you've got
both<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.610> ends<00:00:45.000> both<00:00:45.629> ends<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.190> can<00:00:47.340> see

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
both the ends both ends so you can see

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.270 
both the ends both ends so you can see
both<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.270> us<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> be<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.280> once

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
both of us have to be like that once

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.010 
both of us have to be like that once
you've<00:00:50.550> got<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.809> going<00:00:51.989> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you've got that you're going to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.139 
you've got that you're going to
basically<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.829> plug<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.969> plug<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:54.899> into

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
basically just plug it in plug one into

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
basically just plug it in plug one into
got<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:58.910> microphone<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:01.280> heads<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
got the microphone and a heads like the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.270 
got the microphone and a heads like the
headset<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.070> one's

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
headset for like here so this one's

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480 
headset for like here so this one's
going<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> go<00:01:05.580> into<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> hearing<00:01:07.490> actually

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
going to go into with a hearing actually

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
going to go into with a hearing actually
not<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> I'm<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.290> go<00:01:10.439> into<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.460> mic<00:01:12.350> then

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
not so I'm going to go into the mic then

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.910 
not so I'm going to go into the mic then
next<00:01:14.040> well<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.720> other<00:01:15.810> end<00:01:16.110> plug<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
next well you got the other end plug it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.749 
next well you got the other end plug it
into<00:01:17.180> spot<00:01:18.180> where<00:01:18.390> says<00:01:19.110> well<00:01:20.100> actually<00:01:20.250> shows

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
into spot where says well actually shows

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.230 
into spot where says well actually shows
the<00:01:20.790> controller<00:01:25.640> just<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
the controller just like that

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.310 
the controller just like that
so<00:01:28.049> here's<00:01:28.259> how<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.530> should<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.520> far

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
so here's how it should look like so far

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.140 
so here's how it should look like so far
you've<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.189> plugged<00:01:32.430> into<00:01:32.759> your

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
you've got it plugged into your

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
you've got it plugged into your
controller<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> computer<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.650> control

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
controller and the computer well control

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.890 
controller and the computer well control
you<00:01:35.369> got<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> plug<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.180> headset<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
you got it plug into your headset and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.109 
you got it plug into your headset and
the<00:01:37.500> computer<00:01:38.040> next<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:39.900> to<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
the computer next what you want to do is

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.679 
the computer next what you want to do is
get<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.450> set<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.549> which<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.850> got<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.360> audio

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
get this set up which you got the audio

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.260 
get this set up which you got the audio
you<00:01:46.110> need<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> audio<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.829> pretty<00:01:49.829> much

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
you need the audio and the pretty much

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.469 
you need the audio and the pretty much
of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> power<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.729> basically<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.270> going<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
of the power in basically just going to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.460 
of the power in basically just going to
use<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.200> computer<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.979> power<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.790 

second

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.470 

all<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.430> should<00:02:11.849> look<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.030> this

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
all right and that should look like this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.229 
all right and that should look like this
you<00:02:13.170> should<00:02:13.319> have<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.530> blue<00:02:13.980> light<00:02:14.180> should<00:02:15.180> be

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
you should have a blue light should be

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.479 
you should have a blue light should be
connected<00:02:15.750> into<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.830> where<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> op

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
connected into the back where the op

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.260 
connected into the back where the op
power<00:02:17.819> end<00:02:18.150> says<00:02:18.830> shows<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:20.190> then<00:02:20.370> have<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
power end says shows and then have it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
power end says shows and then have it
plugged<00:02:21.420> into<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:21.750> computer<00:02:21.870> also<00:02:23.150> next<00:02:24.290> if

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
