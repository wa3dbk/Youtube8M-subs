00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.390
 but it's okay today 's video is to catch 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.960
 a do-it-yourself video and 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.090
 signs of their looks and is also a 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.900
 notebook was already sick of his leaving 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.109
 It's all bullshit that I lent him andrÃ© 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.230
 who shined in which is beautiful 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.160
 It's too much, I do not talk anymore 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.830
 he is like this I wish it is different but 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.830
 then this video last year was 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:39.200
 very large and 17 inches and I had to 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:53.960
 He gave me and I want I want in there 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:56.090
 home but that did not want that size and 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.390
 it's very very very easy 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:05.239
 I want to do the time right now, but I do not 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:08.119
 had brake now will make sense of 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.100
 personalization and gradually releasing 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.000
 I hope you like, let's go to the 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.060
 allies 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.180
 So folks to start, I got the pencil. 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.340
 in case you will need only one 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.070
 scissors preferably cutting 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.049
 that is not the one here that 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.509
 do not be upset, say so 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.600
 that being a good one and I took a ruler 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.299
 also the contact paper also you 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.689
 You will choose your cue column 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.310
 the case and costs $ 6 I chose the 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.000
 leopard print because I love the 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.250
 leopard 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.770
 but if I bought half a meter of the area and 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.860
 sovereignty quietly 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.350
 I bought a subway because I'm a fominha 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.990
 I wanted to do more things more 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.470
 after the contact but my method gives 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.180
 and still remains so first you water 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:02.119
 by the whole contact and put your 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.369
 notebook on top and you putting in 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.280
 up you will have 7 in all measures 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.720
 and the contours of the screen also 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.580
 and after that you can 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.860
 You want to put more to learn the day? 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.750
 you 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.550
 You can put it there is not enough left 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.500
 contact paper 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.450
 The more freedom to spare, I 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.450
 put better because - please contact 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
 left over then you will go around the screen 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.820
 not the reason you skirt the screen that is 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.560
 a little thinner than the notebook 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.770
 skirting the screen but down the side 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.770
 Can you see with pencil? 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:03:00.030
 Ready to go around and then you get 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:08.880
 scissors and you'll cut it straight 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:11.070
 marking you did in case I took the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.240
 didi highlighted that the law that piece 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.950
 contact paper because otherwise 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.080
 hard to cut right then it's 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:23.070
 here and there and I'll do tackles 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:28.920
 Perfect, there I started gate of 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:32.280
 Just right, it takes too long. 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 I jumped and left it right then it stayed 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:45.140
 so no role the contact was given 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 How did you do it? 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.910
 Perfect size and right now 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.540
 the boring, hardest part that I 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.820
 I hated it but it was worth it, but it's too much. 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.190
 boring and overworked because you have 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.140
 have lots of patience and lots of 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.730
 perfection to do because otherwise you will 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.920
 get a job done badly but have to 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.450
 To have a lot of perfection so I highlighted 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.910
 contact paper 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.560
 to leave that cheat sheet and I put in 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.840
 top of the notebook 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.880
 What happens is this contact role is a 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.800
 bag to handle because it glues right 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.470
 so the ball 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.880
 so I did I took the ruler and went 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.780
 passing him to make him well 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.760
 lisinho 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.770
 only it happens that you even carry the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.260
 times then you do the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.380
 What am I doing here, honey? You? 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.690
 lift back in the case of the procon taxi and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.610
 pass the ruler again it will stay 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.580
 alone you learn this procedure 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.230
 always always will pass a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:52.080
 ruler will know the weight of the ruler goes 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:54.090
 following and it is very chatinho that but do 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.530
 What a choice, that's enough. 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.940
 I work more 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.919
 so when you come in the middle of 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.780
 notebook you are pretty practical 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.960
 understood then you do not get to so much 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.640
 ball and ended with a notebook stayed 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.640
 so it did a lot of work but stayed 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.360
 So this is it - if you liked it, who? 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.580
 been down here if you write the channel 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.380
 How did you find out? 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.990
 You think you stay, you're a defender. 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.540
 whenever I was a cat you would do 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.880
 and this is it I'll make several videos of 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.670
 customization and I hope you 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.750
 so this is like kissing girls and even 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.750
 next Sunday 7
