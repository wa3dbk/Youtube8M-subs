I usually like to play really aggressive

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.869 
I usually like to play really aggressive
and<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> it's<00:00:37.350> tough<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.890> know<00:00:38.070> exactly<00:00:38.399> where

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and so it's tough to know exactly where

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.170 
and so it's tough to know exactly where
you<00:00:39.000> should<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.770> to<00:00:40.770> get<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> enemies<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> come

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you should be to get the enemies to come

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.229 
you should be to get the enemies to come
to<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.129> one<00:00:44.129> one<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:44.940> thing<00:00:44.969> I've

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
to you and one one good thing I've

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
to you and one one good thing I've
figured<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.610> you<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.820> kind<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> want

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
figured out is that you you kind of want

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.100 
figured out is that you you kind of want
to<00:00:48.239> be<00:00:48.450> right<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.739> edge<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.840> where<00:00:51.840> your

nothing wrong with sitting in a spot for
just<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> little<00:01:59.399> bit<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> making<00:02:00.509> sure<00:02:00.630> that

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
just a little bit and making sure that

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
just a little bit and making sure that
you<00:02:00.899> don't<00:02:01.020> die<00:02:01.259> especially<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.920> place<00:02:02.159> like

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you don't die especially on a place like

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.029 
you don't die especially on a place like
WMD<00:02:03.210> where<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.619> open<00:02:05.009> map<00:02:05.990> the

WMD where it's a really open map the

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.350 
WMD where it's a really open map the
there's<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.099> whole<00:02:08.280> lot<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.489> places<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.849> hide<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
there's a whole lot of places to hide it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
there's a whole lot of places to hide it
you<00:02:09.390> run<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.590> middle

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
you run out here in the in the middle

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
you run out here in the in the middle
like<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.160> without<00:02:11.370> taking<00:02:12.030> any<00:02:12.180> sort<00:02:12.450> of

don't care if that's if that's how you

have fun I mean that's that's how you
have<00:02:30.319> fun<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.680> do<00:02:31.129> have<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:32.060> couple<00:02:32.989> of<00:02:33.200> matches

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
have fun I do have a couple of matches

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.039 
have fun I do have a couple of matches
that<00:02:33.620> I've<00:02:34.040> recorded<00:02:34.519> where<00:02:34.879> I<00:02:35.180> just<00:02:35.870> run

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
that I've recorded where I just run

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.349 
that I've recorded where I just run
around<00:02:36.139> with<00:02:36.439> light<00:02:36.650> weight<00:02:36.859> on<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.459> and<00:02:37.909> go

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
around with light weight on and and go

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:39.759 
around with light weight on and and go
nuts<00:02:38.599> but<00:02:38.870> usually<00:02:39.169> I<00:02:39.200> don't<00:02:39.319> get<00:02:39.530> very<00:02:39.650> good

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
nuts but usually I don't get very good

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.319 
nuts but usually I don't get very good
scored<00:02:40.099> of<00:02:40.219> that<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.639> think<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.299> reason

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
scored of that and I think the reason

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.080 
scored of that and I think the reason
for<00:02:42.200> that<00:02:42.230> at<00:02:42.590> least<00:02:42.620> for<00:02:42.919> me<00:02:43.069> is<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.819> I'm

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
for that at least for me is that I'm

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.089 
for that at least for me is that I'm
careless<00:02:44.599> when<00:02:44.749> I<00:02:44.810> do<00:02:44.930> that<00:02:45.139> I<00:02:45.349> don't<00:02:45.409> focus<00:02:45.799> on

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
careless when I do that I don't focus on

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.459 
careless when I do that I don't focus on
getting<00:02:46.909> behind<00:02:47.209> cover<00:02:47.569> I<00:02:47.840> don't<00:02:48.049> focus<00:02:48.200> on

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
getting behind cover I don't focus on

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.039 
getting behind cover I don't focus on
hey<00:02:48.799> where's<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:49.700> enemy<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.060> don't<00:02:50.689> focus<00:02:50.840> on

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
hey where's the enemy I don't focus on

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.959 
hey where's the enemy I don't focus on
na<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.500> stuff<00:02:51.769> so<00:02:52.069> I<00:02:52.280> think<00:02:52.730> it's<00:02:52.849> pretty

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
na that stuff so I think it's pretty

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.199 
na that stuff so I think it's pretty
important<00:02:53.449> to<00:02:54.340> I've<00:02:55.340> said<00:02:55.639> it<00:02:55.730> before<00:02:55.760> but

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
important to I've said it before but

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.819 
important to I've said it before but
it's<00:02:56.719> really<00:02:57.049> important<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.409> know<00:02:57.620> where<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
it's really important to know where the

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.409 
it's really important to know where the
enemy<00:02:57.919> is<00:02:58.099> now<00:02:58.909> where<00:02:59.060> they're<00:02:59.150> going<00:02:59.269> to<00:02:59.329> be

00:02:59.409 --> 00:02:59.419 
enemy is now where they're going to be

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.809 
enemy is now where they're going to be
coming<00:02:59.569> from<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.199> set<00:03:00.919> up<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.129> position<00:03:01.280> where

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
coming from and set up a position where

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.629 
coming from and set up a position where
you<00:03:02.209> can<00:03:02.419> ambush<00:03:02.870> them<00:03:03.109> you<00:03:03.409> can't<00:03:04.099> just<00:03:04.280> sit

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
you can ambush them you can't just sit

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:07.720 
you can ambush them you can't just sit
in<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.969> same<00:03:05.239> position<00:03:05.689> forever<00:03:06.159> but<00:03:07.159> if<00:03:07.430> you

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
in the same position forever but if you

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.449 
in the same position forever but if you
can<00:03:07.909> get<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.510> nice<00:03:08.870> spot<00:03:09.230> where<00:03:09.409> you<00:03:09.560> can<00:03:10.010> only

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
can get a nice spot where you can only

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.699 
can get a nice spot where you can only
be<00:03:10.669> attacked<00:03:10.969> from<00:03:11.180> maybe<00:03:11.510> one<00:03:11.810> or<00:03:12.019> two<00:03:12.049> angles

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
be attacked from maybe one or two angles

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.500 
be attacked from maybe one or two angles
at<00:03:12.889> the<00:03:12.980> most<00:03:13.189> you'll<00:03:13.909> be<00:03:14.060> in<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.239> lot<00:03:14.480> better

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
at the most you'll be in a lot better

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.929 
at the most you'll be in a lot better
position<00:03:15.230> then<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:16.069> you're<00:03:16.250> just<00:03:16.370> running

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
position then if you're just running

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.920 
position then if you're just running

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
running from cover to cover without

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.740 
running from cover to cover without
actually<00:03:22.400> thinking<00:03:22.819> about<00:03:23.090> where<00:03:23.449> can<00:03:23.659> you

not<00:04:44.180> sure<00:04:44.300> why<00:04:44.480> I<00:04:44.540> can't<00:04:44.750> shoot<00:04:44.900> through<00:04:45.440> this

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
not sure why I can't shoot through this

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.510 
not sure why I can't shoot through this
great<00:04:45.860> here<00:04:46.160> I<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:46.790> guess<00:04:47.270> I<00:04:47.390> thought<00:04:47.690> I<00:04:47.720> could

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
great here I I guess I thought I could

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.400 
great here I I guess I thought I could
if<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.670> were<00:04:49.820> more<00:04:50.360> solid<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:51.080> would<00:04:51.320> have

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
if it were more solid I would have

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.570 
if it were more solid I would have
expected<00:04:51.530> that<00:04:51.920> I<00:04:52.040> wouldn't<00:04:52.340> have<00:04:52.430> been<00:04:52.490> able

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
expected that I wouldn't have been able

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.860 
expected that I wouldn't have been able
to<00:04:52.760> shoot<00:04:52.940> through<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.360> you<00:04:53.480> know<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.600> have

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
to shoot through but you know I have

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.100 
to shoot through but you know I have
have<00:04:54.680> an<00:04:54.800> assault<00:04:55.100> rifle<00:04:55.160> and<00:04:55.810> it's<00:04:56.810> just<00:04:57.020> a

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
have an assault rifle and it's just a

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.350 
have an assault rifle and it's just a
chain-link<00:04:57.700> catwalk<00:04:58.700> I<00:04:58.910> didn't<00:04:59.240> really

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
chain-link catwalk I didn't really

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.180 
chain-link catwalk I didn't really
figure<00:04:59.990> I<00:05:00.200> wouldn't<00:05:00.830> be<00:05:00.890> able<00:05:00.950> to<00:05:01.100> shoot

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
figure I wouldn't be able to shoot

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.710 
figure I wouldn't be able to shoot
through<00:05:01.400> that<00:05:01.580> so<00:05:01.760> I<00:05:01.790> almost<00:05:02.150> lost<00:05:02.510> my

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
through that so I almost lost my

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.210 
through that so I almost lost my
killstreak<00:05:03.320> there<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.590> didn't<00:05:03.800> get<00:05:03.890> my<00:05:03.980> dogs

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
killstreak there and didn't get my dogs

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.840 
killstreak there and didn't get my dogs
but<00:05:04.490> luckily<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.750> was<00:05:06.260> not<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.530> case<00:05:06.820> so<00:05:07.820> i

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850

simply<00:06:49.480> be<00:06:49.930> behind<00:06:50.290> cover<00:06:50.590> and<00:06:50.919> watching<00:06:51.910> the

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 
simply be behind cover and watching the

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.150 
simply be behind cover and watching the
same<00:06:52.210> direction<00:06:52.419> that<00:06:53.080> your<00:06:53.620> team<00:06:54.130> is

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 
same direction that your team is

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.220 
same direction that your team is
watching<00:06:54.820> even<00:06:55.240> if<00:06:55.330> you're<00:06:55.450> sticking

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.230 
watching even if you're sticking

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:57.780 
watching even if you're sticking
somewhat<00:06:56.560> close<00:06:56.740> to<00:06:56.860> them<00:06:57.010> i<00:06:57.190> wouldn't

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:57.790 
somewhat close to them i wouldn't

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:01.230 
somewhat close to them i wouldn't
recommend<00:06:57.850> doing<00:06:58.150> that<00:06:58.360> just<00:06:58.690> because<00:06:59.110> I<00:07:00.240> I

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
recommend doing that just because I I

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.450 
recommend doing that just because I I
can't<00:07:01.690> tell<00:07:01.840> you<00:07:01.930> how<00:07:02.530> many<00:07:02.590> times<00:07:02.860> I've<00:07:03.160> lost

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460 
can't tell you how many times I've lost

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.230 
can't tell you how many times I've lost

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:27.760 
the most part though when you're using a

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.159 
the most part though when you're using a
suppressor<00:07:28.150> on<00:07:28.180> your<00:07:28.389> weapon<00:07:28.690> you'll<00:07:28.990> be

00:07:29.159 --> 00:07:29.169 
suppressor on your weapon you'll be

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.500 
suppressor on your weapon you'll be
doing<00:07:29.410> a<00:07:29.470> lot<00:07:29.530> less<00:07:29.800> damage<00:07:30.220> over<00:07:30.820> range<00:07:31.060> to

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:31.510 
doing a lot less damage over range to

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:34.500 
doing a lot less damage over range to
people<00:07:31.840> compared<00:07:32.620> to<00:07:32.800> the<00:07:33.520> good<00:07:33.700> majority<00:07:34.090> of

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:34.510 
people compared to the good majority of

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.140 
people compared to the good majority of
people<00:07:35.380> who<00:07:35.530> don't<00:07:35.950> use<00:07:36.190> suppressors<00:07:37.030> on

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
people who don't use suppressors on

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.030 
people who don't use suppressors on
their<00:07:37.300> weapons<00:07:37.690> so<00:07:38.320> it's<00:07:38.620> important<00:07:38.919> to<00:07:39.010> keep

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:39.040 
their weapons so it's important to keep

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.950 
their weapons so it's important to keep
that<00:07:39.220> in<00:07:39.340> mind<00:07:39.550> and<00:07:40.120> that's<00:07:40.270> why<00:07:40.419> it's<00:07:40.780> also

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 
that in mind and that's why it's also

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.020 
that in mind and that's why it's also
important<00:07:41.620> like<00:07:41.710> I<00:07:41.830> said<00:07:41.979> before<00:07:42.130> to<00:07:42.550> attack

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030 
important like I said before to attack

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.909 
important like I said before to attack
from<00:07:43.390> angles<00:07:43.960> where<00:07:44.140> they<00:07:44.260> can't<00:07:44.500> see<00:07:44.740> you<00:07:44.890> or

00:07:44.909 --> 00:07:44.919 
from angles where they can't see you or

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:47.310 
from angles where they can't see you or
where<00:07:45.310> they<00:07:45.400> haven't<00:07:45.700> noticed<00:07:46.300> you<00:07:46.419> yet<00:07:46.630> so

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:47.320 
where they haven't noticed you yet so

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.590 
where they haven't noticed you yet so
try<00:07:47.620> to<00:07:47.650> focus<00:07:47.860> on<00:07:48.100> that<00:07:48.250> and<00:07:48.310> you<00:07:48.789> will<00:07:49.060> notice

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:49.600 
try to focus on that and you will notice

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.690 
try to focus on that and you will notice
that<00:07:49.810> your<00:07:49.900> score<00:07:50.280> probably<00:07:51.280> increases

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:51.700 
that your score probably increases

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.380 
that your score probably increases
that's<00:07:52.360> the<00:07:52.780> final<00:07:53.020> game<00:07:53.169> 38<00:07:53.650> no<00:07:54.090> no<00:07:55.090> deaths

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:55.390 
that's the final game 38 no no deaths

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.110 
that's the final game 38 no no deaths
and<00:07:56.100> that's<00:07:57.100> that's<00:07:57.460> how<00:07:57.640> you<00:07:57.700> do<00:07:57.820> it<00:07:57.850> right

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:58.120 
and that's that's how you do it right

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.090 
and that's that's how you do it right
there<00:07:58.440> let<00:07:59.440> me<00:07:59.530> know<00:07:59.650> if<00:07:59.770> you<00:07:59.830> have<00:07:59.919> any
