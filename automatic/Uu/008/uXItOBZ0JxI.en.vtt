 This is a bit bright now, but when it is put on the curtain it looks so beautiful 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.200
 For example 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 Even if you hit the ceiling 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 in this way 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.000
 Can see 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.930
 You can do it even while watching 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 This is still 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.200
 It has not been marketed 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.509

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.530

 Seeing with eyes When seeing with the naked eye 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.409
 It looks beautiful 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:02.270
 This wall is also a bit Shirai's 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.270
 This reflected in the considerably beautiful and reflects on the screen 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.910
