00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.140
 Hello I'm from Hesse by Serge Miot SEC today I'll show you 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.719
 Drums the marketing force and saves the series 8 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.880
 here in one color Kriegenburg have reports 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.710
 so a bit more specific to tackle the tram force so as already mentioned 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.690
 that the series a 8 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.160
 that is it here in the series a 8, the guests are made of Aarau and 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 here in the cauldron sizes 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.720
 Ulf 14 now lives twenties until 22 18 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.010
 and one 14 times 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.430
 the closer 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.470
 the drums themselves 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.620
 he can also match the color of the dark rings or the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.480
 meanwhile very well-known screen of the company morbidly in 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.779
 self interest a German Engineering Stay 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.839
 and how old this one 

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:18.099
 These screens are singers and also very nice with rubber 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:22.289
 accordingly times will be set free for us 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.239
 it is in its processing 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.029
 simple and simple 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.469
 Aalen SZ that I leave a good voice 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.569
 the Kaeslin itself 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.359
 I like kites here 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.719
 The district also has a free-swinging system 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.709
 also very simple but very effective yes and it is already drowned 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.839
 is the kettle 

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:46.699
 do not rename those rosettes themselves directly 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.999
 AV is bolted and here the version has never done 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:52.569
 meaningful 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.289
 So just go cold 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:58.379
 that is now itself is equipped with Remo cases 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.920
 is despite the criticism umstimmen 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.319
 their slightly higher than a little deeper are a tiresome 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.139
 otherwise the z-wave is constructed here have sum 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.969
 with the hardware points so we have 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.689
 Fust machine with double we would have in Calden stand we have one 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.679
 Cardstand we have it like this 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:21.959
 go for it 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.149
 the TUM hang up the toms this clearly betrays you with us 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:28.519
 here ball joints 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.519
 at 4 2 1 neat and very free 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.869
 variable 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.539
 to be able to fix 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.789
 it is thus close to peer damage while the stand is the only thing missing 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:40.799
 the covers 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.799
 and the squat 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.849
 we have that in our room now 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.409
 snom com spreads 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:28.029
 plays it is the ZumbÃ¼hl play here 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.659
 And if you decide on the drums, think of it 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:36.989
 can not fault our strong package the 33 da Gama Deepak 

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:41.279
 respectively 66 days exchange right looks over I am the Klaus
