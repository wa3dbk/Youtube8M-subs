00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.710
 makeup can cause sensation in a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.230

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.950
 face 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.320
 so I think that all of you have 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.590
 found with these or with these and they 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.090
 they have looked at themselves and have seen 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.020
 what is it like these can be 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.300
 correctors 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.739
 we are talking about purple circles 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.260
 black circles dark pink granites and others 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.480

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.879
 the correctors and look like stars 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.879
 of cinema see this secret of beauty 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.240
 one of the biggest problems that 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.070
 we have is that I discovered it a lot in 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.660
 the blog is that it seems that women 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 we are good for roses 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 I have roses and many women have 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.680
 rosacea and rosacea is when we 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.170
 we started to put red with different 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.010
 patches in the face so we eat 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.890
 for the environment because of the weather and so on 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.760
 let's avoid this we're going to avoid it with 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.250
 green color green promises 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:31.190
 lower the red tone of our skin 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.730
 and achieve that uniformity that we need 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.170
 so that our caritas looks like a 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 canvas ready to mature 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.650
 with the corrector lila I can cover 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:50.880
 those dark circles that are 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.680
 practically impossible to cover 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.030
 women with very white skin tend to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.330
 take out dark circles that are means 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.220
 blue and greenish and it is very difficult to 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.290
 cover with a normal concealer again 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.290
 and for that we have the orange tree 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.620
 I apply the base 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 also in small touches and 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.280
 circular movements always from the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.260
 nose outward since one has to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.510
 Respect hair growth because no 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.620
 what it does is bring color to the 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.370
 little hairs and they start to appear more like this 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.590
 that always like 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.349
 descending and never 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.870
 the translucent powders have no color 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.280
 and they basically serve to seal the 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.210
 makeup that the makeup does not remain 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.460
 fatty sound boat 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.390
 and with this he managed that makeup too 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.640

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.390
