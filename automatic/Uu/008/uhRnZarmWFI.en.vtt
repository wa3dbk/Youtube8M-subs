years but in addition to the size in

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.359 
years but in addition to the size in
terms<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.839> sheer<00:00:16.080> numbers<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.830> positions

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
that comes from the fact that these were

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
that comes from the fact that these were
people<00:00:21.359> who<00:00:21.600> had<00:00:21.630> good<00:00:22.230> paying<00:00:22.560> jobs<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.310> so
