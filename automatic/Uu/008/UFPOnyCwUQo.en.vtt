00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.299 

a<00:00:49.410> Kydex<00:00:49.620> sheet<00:00:50.120> let<00:00:51.120> me<00:00:51.210> show<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:52.309> rock

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
a Kydex sheet let me show you rock

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.240 
a Kydex sheet let me show you rock
itself<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:54.059> one<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> spiked<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:58.250> as

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
itself this one is a spiked one so as

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.340 
itself this one is a spiked one so as
you<00:00:59.399> can<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.670> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> spike<00:01:01.020> on<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:03.229> it<00:01:04.229> has

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
you can see have a spike on it it has

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.280 
you can see have a spike on it it has
that<00:01:04.379> finish<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:06.390> not<00:01:06.510> gonna<00:01:06.659> rust<00:01:07.049> or

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that finish so it's not gonna rust or

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.200 
that finish so it's not gonna rust or
anything<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.369> has<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> glass<00:01:11.820> breaker<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
anything and it has a glass breaker or I

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.330 
anything and it has a glass breaker or I
don't<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.420> else<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> call<00:01:16.020> it

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
don't know what else you can call it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.219 
don't know what else you can call it
killer<00:01:18.200> spike<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.220> front<00:01:20.460> spike<00:01:20.790> I

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
killer spike and a front spike I

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.859 
killer spike and a front spike I
honestly<00:01:22.229> preferred<00:01:22.920> not<00:01:23.700> spike<00:01:24.090> one<00:01:24.330> because

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
honestly preferred not spike one because

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.770 
honestly preferred not spike one because
it's<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.229> useful<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.860> actually<00:01:26.040> use<00:01:26.460> it

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
it's more useful you can actually use it

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's more useful you can actually use it
you<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.960> probably<00:01:28.950> cut<00:01:29.400> wood<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.360> do<00:01:30.750> stuff

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
you can probably cut wood and do stuff

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340 
you can probably cut wood and do stuff
this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.439> pretty<00:01:31.740> much<00:01:31.829> mostly<00:01:32.579> for<00:01:32.880> battle<00:01:33.350> as

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
this is pretty much mostly for battle as

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
this is pretty much mostly for battle as
you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:37.470> I<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.920> spike<00:01:38.189> will

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
you can see and I think the spike will

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.590 
you can see and I think the spike will
break<00:01:39.079> but<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.130> very<00:01:41.310> nice<00:01:41.610> very

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
break but it's actually very nice very

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.520 
break but it's actually very nice very
nice<00:01:42.810> piece<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.979> full<00:01:44.250> tang<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.259> the<00:01:46.259> steel

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
nice piece it's full tang and the steel

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.940 
nice piece it's full tang and the steel
is<00:01:46.740> fifty<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.729> sixty<00:01:48.000> carbon<00:01:48.689> steel<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.950> it's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
is fifty one sixty carbon steel so it's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340 
is fifty one sixty carbon steel so it's
basically<00:01:53.430> strong<00:01:54.180> steel<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> little<00:01:55.020> rust

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
basically strong steel but a little rust

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
basically strong steel but a little rust
if<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.460> don't<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:57.390> care<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.579> as<00:01:59.579> it's<00:02:00.270> not
