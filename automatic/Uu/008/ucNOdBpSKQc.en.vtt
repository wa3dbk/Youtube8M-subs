probably no bad thing that you should
calibrate<00:01:54.229> those<00:01:56.000> first<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.240> get<00:01:57.329> any

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
calibrate those first time you get any

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.920 
calibrate those first time you get any
aircraft<00:01:57.689> new<00:01:58.110> out<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.409> box<00:01:58.939> but<00:01:59.939> even<00:02:00.659> so

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
aircraft new out of the box but even so

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
aircraft new out of the box but even so
it's<00:02:01.770> sort<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.100> some<00:02:02.700> people<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.090> are<00:02:03.329> wary

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it's sort of some people I know are wary

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.910 
it's sort of some people I know are wary
perhaps<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.259> running<00:02:04.500> through<00:02:04.649> some<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.829> these

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
perhaps of running through some of these

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.560 
perhaps of running through some of these
more<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.759> appear<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.030> be<00:02:06.119> advanced

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
more what appear to be advanced

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
more what appear to be advanced
functions<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.799> I'm<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.220> through<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
functions so I'm going to go through a

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.490 
functions so I'm going to go through a
few<00:02:08.700> things<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.149> can<00:02:09.270> try<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.780> order<00:02:10.020> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
few things you can try in order in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.350 
few things you can try in order in
increasing<00:02:11.069> order<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.450> complexity<00:02:12.450> and

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
increasing order of complexity and

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.980 
increasing order of complexity and
paying<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> bum<00:02:14.080> nurse<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.370> try<00:02:15.610> to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
paying the bum nurse you can try to

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.980 
paying the bum nurse you can try to
level<00:02:16.990> up<00:02:17.080> your<00:02:17.320> gimbal<00:02:18.450> so<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> first<00:02:19.810> thing

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
level up your gimbal so the first thing

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.540 
level up your gimbal so the first thing
that<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.200> try<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.740> actually<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.400> do<00:02:21.520> a

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
that you can try is actually to do a

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.300 
that you can try is actually to do a
gimbal<00:02:21.910> calibration<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.080> air<00:02:23.230> next<00:02:24.160> time

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
gimbal calibration in the air next time

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.130 
gimbal calibration in the air next time
you're<00:02:24.490> flying<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.540> relatively

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
you're flying and it's a relatively

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.500 
you're flying and it's a relatively
pretty<00:02:27.070> calm<00:02:27.370> day<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.910> you've<00:02:28.150> got<00:02:28.360> this

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
pretty calm day and you've got this

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.430 
pretty calm day and you've got this
aircraft<00:02:28.900> in<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.170> really<00:02:29.770> solid<00:02:30.250> lovely

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
aircraft in a really solid lovely

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.010 
aircraft in a really solid lovely
motionless<00:02:32.440> hover<00:02:32.850> go<00:02:33.850> into<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> app<00:02:34.330> and<00:02:34.630> hit

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
motionless hover go into the app and hit

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.490 
motionless hover go into the app and hit
the<00:02:35.140> calibrate<00:02:35.620> gimbal<00:02:36.070> button<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.760> will<00:02:36.970> say

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the calibrate gimbal button it will say

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.930 
the calibrate gimbal button it will say
calibration<00:02:38.500> failed<00:02:38.860> because<00:02:39.280> it<00:02:39.580> knows<00:02:39.910> that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
calibration failed because it knows that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.390 
calibration failed because it knows that
it's<00:02:40.240> not<00:02:40.450> on<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.870> ground<00:02:41.110> but<00:02:41.410> let<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.220> run

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
it's not on the ground but let it run

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.190 
it's not on the ground but let it run
through<00:02:42.430> anyway<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.270> then<00:02:43.450> see<00:02:43.660> what<00:02:43.780> happens

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
through anyway and then see what happens

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.040 
through anyway and then see what happens
because<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:45.580> for<00:02:46.150> me<00:02:46.300> and<00:02:46.570> for<00:02:46.810> a<00:02:46.840> lot<00:02:46.959> of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
because for for me and for a lot of

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.740 
because for for me and for a lot of
other<00:02:47.170> people<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:48.070> doing<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:48.660> sorted<00:02:49.660> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
other people just doing that sorted it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.979 
other people just doing that sorted it
out<00:02:49.950> because<00:02:50.950> now<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.209> forward<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
out because now going forward the the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.920 
out because now going forward the the
gimbal<00:02:53.680> kind<00:02:53.890> of<00:02:53.980> agrees<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.450> aircraft

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
gimbal kind of agrees with the aircraft

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.449 
gimbal kind of agrees with the aircraft
about<00:02:56.140> what<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.470> level<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:57.070> that<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
about what is level and that is the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.670 
about what is level and that is the
easiest<00:02:57.610> way<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.060> do<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.420> don't<00:02:59.230> try<00:02:59.380> and<00:02:59.500> do<00:02:59.590> it

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
easiest way to do it don't try and do it

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.960 
easiest way to do it don't try and do it
on<00:02:59.739> a<00:02:59.770> windy<00:03:00.100> day<00:03:00.130> where<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.489> aircraft<00:03:00.640> is

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
on a windy day where the aircraft is

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.000 
on a windy day where the aircraft is
heeling<00:03:01.360> over<00:03:01.450> throw<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.930> keep<00:03:02.050> steady<00:03:02.320> pick

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
heeling over throw and keep steady pick

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.540 
heeling over throw and keep steady pick
a<00:03:03.040> nice<00:03:03.250> calm<00:03:03.550> day<00:03:03.610> and<00:03:04.030> do<00:03:04.810> it<00:03:04.840> like<00:03:05.410> that<00:03:05.550> the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
a nice calm day and do it like that the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.010 
a nice calm day and do it like that the
other<00:03:06.580> thing<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:06.970> could<00:03:07.060> obviously<00:03:07.450> do<00:03:07.750> is

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
other thing you could obviously do is

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.760 
other thing you could obviously do is
try<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.410> do<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.590> same<00:03:08.860> calibration<00:03:10.560> not<00:03:11.560> in

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
try and do that same calibration not in

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.490 
try and do that same calibration not in
the<00:03:11.950> air<00:03:12.209> but<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.360> want<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.780> try<00:03:14.020> and<00:03:14.140> do<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.350> on

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
the air but you want to try and do it on

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.820 
the air but you want to try and do it on
as<00:03:14.620> level<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.130> surface<00:03:15.489> as<00:03:15.610> possible

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
as level of surface as possible

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.630 
as level of surface as possible
now<00:03:17.830> people<00:03:18.519> have<00:03:18.580> said<00:03:18.850> well<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.480> know<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
now people have said well you know the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.670 
now people have said well you know the
top<00:03:21.850> of<00:03:21.970> the<00:03:22.060> aircraft<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.510> curved<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.170> how<00:03:23.350> do

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
top of the aircraft is curved and how do

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.039 
top of the aircraft is curved and how do
we<00:03:23.799> find<00:03:24.070> a<00:03:24.190> level<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.700> what<00:03:25.299> if<00:03:25.420> my<00:03:25.570> tables<00:03:25.989> a

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
we find a level and what if my tables a

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.670 
we find a level and what if my tables a
bit<00:03:26.170> wonky<00:03:26.350> well<00:03:27.310> yeah<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.120> am<00:03:28.360> yes<00:03:28.780> one<00:03:29.440> way<00:03:29.560> of

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
bit wonky well yeah I am yes one way of

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.229 
bit wonky well yeah I am yes one way of
doing<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.100> sort<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.400> chalk<00:03:30.670> up<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.880> legs

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
doing it is to sort of chalk up the legs

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.670 
doing it is to sort of chalk up the legs
of<00:03:31.390> your<00:03:31.420> kitchen<00:03:31.810> table<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.230> try<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.560> get<00:03:32.650> a

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
of your kitchen table and try and get a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.259 
of your kitchen table and try and get a
level<00:03:33.010> but<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.280> other<00:03:33.459> way<00:03:33.730> to<00:03:33.790> do<00:03:34.000> it<00:03:34.030> is

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
level but the other way to do it is

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.460 
level but the other way to do it is
using<00:03:35.049> one<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.350> these<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:37.260> because<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.410> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
using one of these and because it's the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.210 
using one of these and because it's the
kitchen<00:03:38.799> table<00:03:39.549> look<00:03:40.299> at<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:43.170> glass

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
kitchen table look at that a glass

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.720 
kitchen table look at that a glass
chopping<00:03:45.220> board<00:03:45.430> chopping<00:03:45.880> block<00:03:46.090> thing<00:03:46.590> if

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
chopping board chopping block thing if

as<00:03:58.630> you<00:03:59.170> can<00:03:59.320> see<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.680> there's<00:03:59.830> no<00:04:00.010> these<00:04:00.790> are

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
as you can see that there's no these are

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.430 
as you can see that there's no these are
but<00:04:01.150> fitting<00:04:01.510> beautifully<00:04:01.900> there's<00:04:02.019> no<00:04:02.140> tip

and<00:04:02.799> wobble<00:04:03.160> once<00:04:03.850> you've<00:04:04.030> done<00:04:04.209> that<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:05.560> can

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
and wobble once you've done that you can

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.860 
and wobble once you've done that you can
stick<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.100> on<00:04:06.310> and<00:04:07.120> then<00:04:07.420> all<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.630> need<00:04:07.780> to

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
stick that on and then all you need to

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.280 
stick that on and then all you need to
do<00:04:08.019> is<00:04:08.760> actually<00:04:09.760> just<00:04:10.030> adjust<00:04:10.660> whatever<00:04:11.049> the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
do is actually just adjust whatever the

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.270 
do is actually just adjust whatever the
aircraft<00:04:11.590> standing<00:04:12.010> on

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
aircraft standing on

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.620 
aircraft standing on
so<00:04:12.579> rather<00:04:12.760> than<00:04:12.820> adjusting<00:04:13.209> the<00:04:13.269> whole<00:04:13.390> table

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
so rather than adjusting the whole table

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.000 
so rather than adjusting the whole table
if<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.840> put<00:04:13.959> another<00:04:14.140> board<00:04:14.440> underneath<00:04:14.799> it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
if you put another board underneath it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.830 
if you put another board underneath it
you<00:04:15.670> know<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:15.850> could<00:04:16.090> just<00:04:16.120> chalk<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.510> up<00:04:16.690> with

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
you know I could just chalk that up with

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.170 
you know I could just chalk that up with
a<00:04:16.870> bit<00:04:16.989> of<00:04:17.079> paper<00:04:17.370> as<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.519> is<00:04:18.640> that's<00:04:18.940> pretty

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
a bit of paper as it is that's pretty

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.430 
a bit of paper as it is that's pretty
good<00:04:19.390> that's<00:04:19.510> within<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> levels<00:04:20.140> isn't<00:04:20.380> it

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
good that's within the levels isn't it

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.920 
good that's within the levels isn't it
and<00:04:20.680> then<00:04:20.799> just<00:04:21.010> check<00:04:21.330> check<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.419> diagonals

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
and then just check check the diagonals

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.290 
and then just check check the diagonals
and<00:04:23.169> check<00:04:23.800> across<00:04:24.160> when<00:04:24.849> you've<00:04:24.970> got<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> nice

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
and check across when you've got a nice

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.850 
and check across when you've got a nice
level<00:04:25.539> surface

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
level surface

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.730

run<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:28.150> gimble<00:04:28.449> calibration<00:04:28.990> again<00:04:29.229> and

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
run the gimble calibration again and

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.640 
run the gimble calibration again and
maybe<00:04:29.979> do<00:04:30.159> it<00:04:30.280> one<00:04:30.430> or<00:04:30.460> two<00:04:30.550> times<00:04:31.379> see<00:04:32.379> if<00:04:32.470> that

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
maybe do it one or two times see if that

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.399 
maybe do it one or two times see if that
works<00:04:32.889> for<00:04:33.039> you<00:04:34.379> failing<00:04:35.379> that<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:36.930> that<00:04:37.930> isn't

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
works for you failing that if that isn't

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.679 
works for you failing that if that isn't
doing<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.770> either<00:04:38.889> then<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.400> next<00:04:39.939> step<00:04:40.479> and

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
doing it either then the next step and

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:42.179 
doing it either then the next step and
remember<00:04:40.990> I'm<00:04:41.080> doing<00:04:41.289> these<00:04:41.439> in<00:04:41.590> increasing

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
remember I'm doing these in increasing

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.490 
remember I'm doing these in increasing
order<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.569> what<00:04:43.569> a<00:04:43.599> pain<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.139> do<00:04:44.349> them

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
order of what a pain it is to do them

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.670 
order of what a pain it is to do them
the<00:04:45.129> next<00:04:45.340> step<00:04:45.699> is<00:04:45.879> to<00:04:46.270> run<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.479> full<00:04:46.870> IMU

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
the next step is to run a full IMU

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.399 
the next step is to run a full IMU
calibration<00:04:48.460> what<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:49.539> basically<00:04:49.750> does<00:04:50.020> is

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
calibration what this basically does is

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.760 
calibration what this basically does is
reset<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.699> inertial<00:04:52.150> measurement<00:04:52.569> unit<00:04:52.870> so

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
reset the inertial measurement unit so

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.320 
reset the inertial measurement unit so
it<00:04:53.889> knows<00:04:54.129> what<00:04:54.849> is<00:04:55.199> straight<00:04:56.199> and<00:04:56.319> level<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
it knows what is straight and level the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.730 
it knows what is straight and level the
first<00:04:58.599> thing<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.960> do<00:04:59.080> is<00:04:59.199> just<00:04:59.500> what<00:04:59.590> we've

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
first thing you do is just what we've

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.110 
first thing you do is just what we've
done<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.219> need<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.460> make<00:05:00.639> sure<00:05:00.669> that<00:05:00.969> the

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
done you need to make sure that the

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.219 
done you need to make sure that the
aircraft<00:05:01.449> is<00:05:01.539> on<00:05:01.599> a<00:05:01.659> completely<00:05:02.110> level

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229

aircraft is on a completely level
surface<00:05:02.740> you<00:05:03.370> also<00:05:03.580> need<00:05:03.909> to<00:05:03.940> do<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.240> cold<00:05:04.800> this

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
surface you also need to do it cold this

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.379 
surface you also need to do it cold this
doesn't<00:05:06.219> necessarily<00:05:06.340> mean<00:05:06.819> put<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.210> in<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
doesn't necessarily mean put it in the

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.050 
doesn't necessarily mean put it in the
fridge<00:05:07.629> although<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.289> know<00:05:08.740> some<00:05:09.099> people<00:05:09.219> do<00:05:09.490> or

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
fridge although I know some people do or

fridge although I know some people do or
what<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.330> means<00:05:10.479> is<00:05:10.719> that<00:05:10.750> make<00:05:11.020> sure<00:05:11.050> the

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
what it means is that make sure the

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.559 
what it means is that make sure the
aircraft<00:05:11.409> hasn't<00:05:11.889> been<00:05:11.979> running<00:05:12.280> for<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.180> good

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569

aircraft hasn't been running for a good
several<00:05:13.990> hours<00:05:14.110> probably<00:05:14.469> get<00:05:15.099> it<00:05:15.190> out<00:05:15.310> in<00:05:15.430> the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
several hours probably get it out in the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.649 
several hours probably get it out in the
morning<00:05:15.819> after<00:05:16.060> it's<00:05:16.180> been<00:05:16.270> away<00:05:16.479> all<00:05:16.629> night

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:19.469 
morning after it's been away all night
and<00:05:16.990> do<00:05:17.139> it<00:05:17.259> then<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:18.729> then<00:05:19.029> what<00:05:19.150> you<00:05:19.270> need<00:05:19.419> to

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
and do it then and then what you need to

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.629 
and do it then and then what you need to
do<00:05:19.599> is<00:05:19.719> fire<00:05:20.229> it<00:05:20.379> up<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.800> then<00:05:20.949> immediately<00:05:21.310> go

do is fire it up and then immediately go

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.050 
do is fire it up and then immediately go

that can tweak the things but to be

that can tweak the things but to be

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
good genuine level position and then

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.220 
good genuine level position and then
let's<00:07:05.340> get<00:07:05.520> everything<00:07:05.730> squared<00:07:06.030> away<00:07:06.300> in<00:07:06.420> by

let's get everything squared away in by

sorted out with an IMU calibration I
think<00:07:10.410> that's<00:07:10.530> definitely<00:07:10.890> better<00:07:11.040> than<00:07:11.420> kind

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
think that's definitely better than kind

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.930 
think that's definitely better than kind
of<00:07:12.480> fixing<00:07:13.050> it<00:07:13.140> by<00:07:14.070> tweaking<00:07:14.340> things<00:07:14.640> in<00:07:14.850> the
