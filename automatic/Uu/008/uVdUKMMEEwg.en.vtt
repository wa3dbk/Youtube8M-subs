having<00:02:36.750> something<00:02:37.200> break<00:02:37.410> down<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.830> have

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
having something break down and you have

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.850 
having something break down and you have
to<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.310> fixed<00:02:38.489> especially<00:02:38.970> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.150> road

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
to get it fixed especially on the road

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.650 
to get it fixed especially on the road
so<00:02:40.860> if<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.760> could<00:02:41.910> do<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.090> all<00:02:42.180> over<00:02:42.209> again<00:02:42.480> I

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
so if I could do it all over again I

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.600 
so if I could do it all over again I
would<00:02:42.900> probably<00:02:43.050> get<00:02:43.500> like<00:02:44.070> my<00:02:44.370> ideal

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610
