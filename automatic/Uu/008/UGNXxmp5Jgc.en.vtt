00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
this room and we will be in an area that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.450 
this room and we will be in an area that
is<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:54.090> very<00:00:54.120> useful<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.989> us<00:00:55.250> not<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
is actually very useful to us not just

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
is actually very useful to us not just
because<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.940> progresses<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> story<00:00:57.870> along

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
because it progresses the story along

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.450 
because it progresses the story along
but<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.590> also<00:00:59.930> has<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:00.989> box<00:01:01.410> moving<00:01:01.949> puzzle

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
but it also has a box moving puzzle

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.630 
but it also has a box moving puzzle
which<00:01:03.239> means<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.750> have<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.930> move<00:01:04.170> forward

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
which means I just have to move forward

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.679 
which means I just have to move forward
but<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.760> still<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.210> speed<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> up

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
but I'm still going to speed it up

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.740 
but I'm still going to speed it up
because<00:01:06.960> i<00:01:07.110> hate<00:01:07.409> box<00:01:07.710> moving<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.939> not<00:01:09.330> cut<00:01:09.600> up

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because i hate box moving I'm not cut up

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.530
