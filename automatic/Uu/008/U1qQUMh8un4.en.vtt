 some bucks on morgan combat 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.830
 many will think that mortal kombat and doom 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.719
 they were the beginning of violence 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.279
 extreme in video games but before 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.840
 that liters and liters of blood 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 spilled with every hit in mortal 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.400
 kombat there was a like with the cake 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.770
 created by exit and called killer that in 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.329
 1986 tormented the parents of the 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.750
 young people attending the places of 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.750
 little machines 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.420
 it was planned that jacques was a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.340
 character selectable from the first 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.970
 mortal kombat but they decided 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 replace it with sonya blade since 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:45.220
 they needed female characters 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 the name of the character in offside bot 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.809
 It is composed of surnames but at 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.989
 reverse of the creators of mortal kombat 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.399
 ed boon and jon tobias kintaro was not going to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.470
 be a shock rather it was just going to be 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.089
 a great anthropomorphic tiger but then 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.910
 who liked to put two more arms 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.910
 do not 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 will 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.920
 the name of the drunk character comes 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.680
 the word in Spanish drunk and good 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.120
 despite his obvious state of drunkenness is a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.940
 great master of martial arts 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.940
 having taught aside and liu kang 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.040
 tell the rumors that the role of 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.840
 Johnny Cage for the Deadly Movie 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.610
 kombat was confirmed for brandon 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.110
 league was even going to start the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.050
 filming after finishing filming 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.150
 the crow is a shame it ended so 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.920
 bad for an oversight of production 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.750
 jean-claude van damme rejection came out in 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.000
 the movie of mortal kombat for leaving 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.800
 in street fighter cat if only 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.450
 I would have known in this same movie the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.970
 scorpion role interprets it create 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.600
 Mass house although the voice is from the very same 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.600
 ed boon 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.960
 most famous were considered for 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 get out in the movie and represent 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.360
 Game characters like Cameron Diaz and 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.250
 tom cruise johnny depp and up steve 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.899
 James the original idea of ​​the game was 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.280
 pay the rights of blood esports and 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.549
 use the image of jean claude van 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.700
 damme 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.039
 in fact jean claude and johnny cage 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.660
 they share initials brain is a 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.270
 character tribute to the album but for 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.640
 brain the prince you know it's called rain 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.060
 the suit is purple and it turns out that his 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.060
 the prince 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.330
 the creators of mortal kombat have the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.070
 fame of listening well to their fans and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.860
 implement rumors in their games that 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.440
 they read or even that they start ermac 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.060
 abbreviation of macro error ran the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.160
 rumor that it was a glitch that appeared 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 when about you used a scorpion which 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.110
 he changed his suit from yellow to red 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.270
 the red color was with which they recorded to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.580
 the actors before changing them 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.680
 digitally the same color happens 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.510
 with scarlett only it was said that 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.730
 in the deadly kombat 2 this error instead 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.120
 of happening with scorpion happened with 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.120
 gypsy 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.990
 the rumor that led to the creation of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.930
 place was also given in mortal kombat 2 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.550
 in the pit tour in which on the bridge 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.740
 from the bottom you could see two characters 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.660
 fight and one of them was on fire 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.860
 only that back then the character 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.860
 rumor was called torch 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.560
 another rumor that became a reality 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.260
 is the scorpion becoming a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.439
 scorpion for an exclusive fatality 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.970
 given the strength of this gossip the 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:38.099
 creators decided to make this rumor 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.099
 real and they created the little animals 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.549
 only that when the game changed to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.680
 platforms with 3d characters was had 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.930
 to forget this idea because to model a 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.330
 animal for each character was very 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.790
 laborious the director of artest and bryant 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.530
 He said in an interview that he has a 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.720
 cousin named scott and that is 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.519
 practically a human skeleton alone 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.620
 that never became part of the game 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:07.900
 hunter who interpreted several 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.110
 characters like sub zero and scorpion 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.060
 noob saibot smoke samsung among others 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.280
 He has also appeared in series as prison 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.900
 break and in movies like batman the 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.850
 dark knight during the creation stage 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.090
 of the deadly kombat 3 do excel and the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.180
 madame oyster mustard and ketchup sector 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.860
 cached by their respective colors one of 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.410
 the most important characteristics of 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.600
 show kan is his imposing stature though 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 the actor who represented him the truth is 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.350
 that is not so high in fact there is a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.720
 group photo where he leaves next to ed 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.580
 boon and the boom takes a few 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.630
 centimeters seems to be that after 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.630
 have been the only two survivors 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.880
 of drone johnny cage and sonya blade 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.070
 they spent a lot of time together since for 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.000
