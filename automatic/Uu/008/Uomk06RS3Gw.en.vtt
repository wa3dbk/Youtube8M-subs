00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Hello, today we are the first 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.940
 unpacking four hands and even on 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.450
 nature we have such a box 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.679
 big very in black package it 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.150
 gift from my friend for my day 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.240
 birth many thanks to him for that 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.390
 there must be a machine for the sake of 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 radio control 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:31.460
 which you have long dreamed of yourself 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:35.550
 grandfather well let's unpack characteristic 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:40.879
 sounds of course all sorts of animals a lot 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.879
 flies some people do not go 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:53.070
 this is probably the line we must now 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:55.789
 some good normal cows 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.789
 cow 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:12.550
 This probably remove in this box yet 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 I go Chinese in the back hardly such 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.320
 healthy health so small at home 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.320
 Now the car will be schA and here 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:32.380
 guarantees for pasting to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.180
 very miracle machine well let's open 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:43.030
 farther 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:49.020
 Your present look is still a bunch 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.020
 documentation instruction schedule this 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:02.120
 little box set about bye 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:05.150
 postpone the documentation on me 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.890
 over how to read the instructions usually first 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:21.160
 tries when fails when 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:21.160
 start friday itself machine lenochke 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.780
 so but this is it so not the power cable 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:42.810
 here we have big mega attempts 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:50.099
 charging apparatus 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:52.890
 2 and 4 gigahertz here we have all sorts of miracles 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:03:01.650
 photo samples that a bit 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:09.530
 a little differently the wheel was wrinkled well 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.530
 let's see and 4 batteries battery 2a 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:20.910
 get further hope that 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:24.920
 the battery is at least a little charged and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.920
 we will be able to run it 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:50.500
 I'll install the batteries in the fly 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:58.360
 nature are not half mad 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:58.360
 moving here she is beautiful 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:16.209
 he already smacked something well so what 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.609
 still 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.850
 channel exception 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:26.479
 two twists but it is necessary to understand 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.410
 Then there will be a separate review and there already 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:46.630
 try everything 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:52.669
 when we will understand about dna wonderful 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:54.800
 battery is some kind of protection yet 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:57.280
 battery and a half thousand milliamps 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.280
 o'clock 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:08.840
 lithium polymer really have to read 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:12.050
 The instruction would not like very much 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:21.039
 everything just turned out to be something even 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:21.039
 it works yes of course there is not enough here 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.220
 like utopia our spark 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.240
 frisky machine 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:46.669
 Yes, you can immediately apologize for the fact that 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:52.430
 maybe not everything was visible but toys 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:57.020
 for the first time therefore everything is new and 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:59.590
 incomprehensible well, now we will collect everything 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.590
 there will be 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:13.330
 we fix our technique 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:15.280
 using special clamps, I understand 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:25.650
 that all this is unprofessional all this in 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:25.650
 first time here is our wonderful car 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:50.210
 what do you want to steer 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:53.120
 Well, let me play that uncles give 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:56.919
 uncles play your gift then 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.919
 play another game 

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.629
 go 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.810
 all-wheel drive unit 

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:44.040
 Yes, and we are great 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.280
 who is already flying something
