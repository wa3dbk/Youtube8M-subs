00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi to all the boys welcome back pumpkin 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.099
 of this loyal we are here with great 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.870
 tourism 6 and with a new one a new event 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.830
 seasonal let's do this here 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.509
 andretti mario andretti in 1948 hudson 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.189
 ciro launched let's see a little bit 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.310
 a bit the car is crap but this time it is 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.449
 among other things cars they have reached with 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.189
 precisely with this event also in the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.189
 wanting game you can also buy 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 giammona of favorite cars of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.700
 you will go so ugly track for 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.950
 this is one of the tracks he likes for 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.730
 anything 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:45.629
 I had already said a few races though 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.600
 too much too much desert too little 133 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.070
 go let's try let's see how it is self but 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.680
 because this is not very reliable 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.690
 as mentioned these seasonal events for 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.460
 I throw them so that I occasionally shoot them 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.030
 between a video and another video 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.030
 and I want a look 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.020
 clear then that look at the wajda 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.450
 daje 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.340
 but there is the second hand 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:32.329
 does not enter does not enter the mafia curse 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.369
 oh well so this is the first round for 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.380
 see how the car behaves 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.380
 then I do the collective one 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.890
 for a moment study it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.840
 Well 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.140
 we have under and swears before 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:10.069
 even start to see a little ha 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:17.109
 changed when it's best to do it 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:17.109
 he doesn't have his p and he does a little shit 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.090
 then we'll do it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.920
 hopefully the sporting tour 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.460
 the car is not the top but the track is not there 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.460
 like it 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.420
 at least in braking it goes 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420
 for 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.799
 agreement the curbs but it is a bobÃ² bomb that 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.799
 pin and skittles 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.769
 evitiamogli avoid there 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.310
 by almost by 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.840
 let's try a stamp bomb 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.720
 the instruments 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.720
 just aggressive 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.280
 fear 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.590
 let's go the curb or that of jesi earth 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.590
 okay 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.840
 so much enough 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.360
 I offer from this classroom so it's fine 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:01.020
 however, it's a bit of an advantage 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.020
 a dock is therefore cappellate 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.500
 a bomb on board 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.300
 if we can do it 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:35.180
 or that is perfect abd gold gold it 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.650
 very well we have how much money gives us 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.570
 maybe we should also get the car 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.000
 I would like to say nothing was not millions and 7 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.740
 great if I had it and 100 percent yes 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.060
 also quotes the auto Mario Andretti 1948 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.160
 perfect for guys at this point 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.090
 I would say sorry to see with the next 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.470
