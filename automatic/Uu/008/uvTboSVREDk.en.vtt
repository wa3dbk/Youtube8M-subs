before we put that in what we're gonna
do<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.000> Vigo<00:00:15.570> you've<00:00:15.719> got<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.049> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
do is on the Vigo you've got this this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.230 
do is on the Vigo you've got this this
panel<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> cigarette<00:00:17.760> lighter<00:00:17.789> in

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
panel here with the cigarette lighter in

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.150 
panel here with the cigarette lighter in
and<00:00:18.539> we're<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:18.930> take<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.289> illumination

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and we're gonna take the illumination

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.599 
and we're gonna take the illumination
from<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.330> cigarette<00:00:21.779> lighter<00:00:21.810> ring<00:00:22.529> okay<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
from the cigarette lighter ring okay so

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.599 
from the cigarette lighter ring okay so
if<00:00:23.670> we<00:00:23.789> grab<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.359> panel<00:00:24.920> just<00:00:25.920> pull<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> out

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
if we grab this panel just pull it out

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.999 
if we grab this panel just pull it out
like<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.560> okay<00:00:28.560> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.789> back<00:00:30.029> we've<00:00:30.510> got<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
like so okay on the back we've got a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
like so okay on the back we've got a
connection<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.820> this<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.270> main<00:00:33.480> power<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
connection so this is the main power the

we've got to do now you've got to take
the<00:00:54.629> illumination<00:00:55.500> wire

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the illumination wire

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.920 
the illumination wire
okay<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> connect<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.660> power

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
okay and connect it to the the power

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.890 
okay and connect it to the the power
module<00:01:01.609> okay<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> power<00:01:03.539> module

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:17.399 

do<00:01:07.909> okay<00:01:10.010> let's<00:01:11.010> connect<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.670> one

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
okay we want to pull the other wires

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.250 
okay we want to pull the other wires
through<00:02:09.820> so<00:02:10.119> that's<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.539> button<00:02:10.750> will<00:02:11.110> show

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.220 
you what to do with that and then the
other<00:02:13.210> cable<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.430> that<00:02:16.230> spoke

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
other cable here is the that spoke

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.570 
other cable here is the that spoke
they'll<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.650> ones<00:02:17.800> will<00:02:17.980> connect<00:02:18.280> into

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
they'll be the ones will connect into

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.790 
they'll be the ones will connect into
the<00:02:18.670> elimination<00:02:19.270> so<00:02:20.050> basically<00:02:20.440> we've<00:02:20.650> got

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
the elimination so basically we've got

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.300 
the elimination so basically we've got
all<00:02:20.980> this<00:02:21.190> connected<00:02:21.760> up<00:02:21.910> now<00:02:22.150> okay<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.720> now

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
all this connected up now okay so now

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.090 
all this connected up now okay so now
we've<00:02:30.310> just<00:02:30.340> got<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.760> reconnect<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.800> main

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
we've just got to reconnect the main

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.979 
we've just got to reconnect the main
connection<00:02:33.640> on<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> back<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
connection on to the back of the on to

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.750 
connection on to the back of the on to
the<00:02:41.080> back<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.560> here

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.100 

make<00:02:45.760> sure<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.120> clicks<00:02:46.510> in<00:02:46.750> okay<00:02:47.770> then<00:02:49.110> like

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
make sure that clicks in okay then like

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.720 
make sure that clicks in okay then like
you<00:02:50.260> should<00:02:50.410> we<00:02:50.470> don't<00:02:50.650> get<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.070> elimination

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
you should we don't get the elimination

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.230 
you should we don't get the elimination
signal<00:02:52.150> wire<00:02:52.330> trap<00:02:53.040> okay<00:02:54.040> we<00:02:54.400> push<00:02:54.670> that<00:02:54.940> back

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
signal wire trap okay we push that back

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.300 
signal wire trap okay we push that back
up<00:02:55.570> and<00:02:56.440> in<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:03.220> locates<00:03:03.940> on<00:03:04.150> these<00:03:04.360> pins<00:03:04.750> here

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
up and in so locates on these pins here

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.250 
up and in so locates on these pins here
okay<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.580> at<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.850> top<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.750> then<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:07.960> get<00:03:08.080> the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
okay and at the top and then we get the
