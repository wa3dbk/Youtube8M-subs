I have harbored an interest in nautical

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
I have harbored an interest in nautical
themes<00:00:41.820> largely<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> fish<00:00:43.860> on

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
themes largely because of the fish on

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.190

nautical glass is based on nautical
themes<00:00:47.850> where<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> find<00:00:49.559> glass<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.370> reacts

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
themes where I find glass that reacts

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
themes where I find glass that reacts
with<00:00:50.910> one<00:00:51.059> another<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.600> creates<00:00:51.960> shading

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
with one another and creates shading

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.799 
with one another and creates shading
where<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> two<00:00:53.399> black<00:00:53.730> pieces<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.270> glass<00:00:54.480> meet

make<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:57.840> glass<00:00:58.050> coasters<00:00:58.850> first<00:00:59.850> thing<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.180> do

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
make my glass coasters first thing I do

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.420 
make my glass coasters first thing I do
is<00:01:00.600> pick<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.289> color<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> glass<00:01:02.070> I

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

repeating the process with a cream
colored<00:01:16.020> glass<00:01:16.259> I<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.220> cut<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> corner<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
colored glass I then cut it corner to

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.140 
colored glass I then cut it corner to
corner<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.840> cut<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> triangles<00:01:20.119> with<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
corner to cut the triangles with a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.410 
corner to cut the triangles with a
similar<00:01:21.479> process<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.350> cut<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.830> 4x4<00:01:23.610> Clair

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
similar process I then cut a 4x4 Clair

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
similar process I then cut a 4x4 Clair
piece<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> use<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> base<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.890> coaster

piece to use as a base of the coaster

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
piece to use as a base of the coaster
depending<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.540> cutting<00:01:27.900> skills<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.470> may

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
depending on the cutting skills you may

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.920 
depending on the cutting skills you may
need<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.159> wet<00:01:29.490> sand<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> edges

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
need to wet sand down some of the edges

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.370 
need to wet sand down some of the edges
using<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.860> disk<00:01:32.549> sander<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:33.689> then<00:01:34.020> round

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
using a disk sander I also then round

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
using a disk sander I also then round
the<00:01:34.500> corners<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> glass<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:36.060> avoid<00:01:36.299> any

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the corners of the glass to avoid any

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.830 
the corners of the glass to avoid any
sharp<00:01:36.990> edges<00:01:37.610> when<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.790> piece<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> fired<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
sharp edges when the piece is fired I

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.830 
sharp edges when the piece is fired I
then<00:01:40.770> wash<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> glass<00:01:41.520> using<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.420> pair<00:01:42.659> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
then wash the glass using a pair of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.139 
then wash the glass using a pair of
latex<00:01:43.229> gloves<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.100> avoid<00:01:44.399> getting<00:01:44.939> any

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
latex gloves to avoid getting any

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.749 
latex gloves to avoid getting any
fingerprints<00:01:45.869> on<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> clean<00:01:46.619> glass<00:01:46.860> then

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
fingerprints on the clean glass then

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
fingerprints on the clean glass then
arrange<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.570> pieces<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> coaster<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.680> a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
arrange the pieces of the coaster like a

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
arrange the pieces of the coaster like a
puzzle<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.490> one<00:01:50.729> piece<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.210> top<00:01:51.390> of<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
puzzle with one piece on top of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.389 
puzzle with one piece on top of the
other<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.409> tightly<00:01:52.770> fit<00:01:53.100> together

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
other so they're tightly fit together

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
other so they're tightly fit together
for<00:01:53.820> placing<00:01:54.180> them<00:01:54.270> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.420> kiln<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
for placing them in the kiln so this is

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.120 
for placing them in the kiln so this is
my<00:01:55.619> kill<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:58.020> initially<00:01:58.500> have<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.860> start

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
my kill and you initially have to start

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.179 
my kill and you initially have to start
by<00:01:59.310> either<00:01:59.460> putting<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.270> kiln<00:02:00.570> wash<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.530> piece

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
by either putting a kiln wash or a piece
