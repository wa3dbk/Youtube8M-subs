00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.000
This scarecrow

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.740
is lacking the eyes.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.780
B cinema, 100% Iberian.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.460
Tell me what the Hell has happened!

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.220
100% independent.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.200
Give me the bag!
Drop the gun!

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.680
Motherfucking traitor!

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.120
I love the smell of
coke in the morning!

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.620
100% professional.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.640
You are a fucking amateur gang!

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
Fuck! Fucking damn shit!

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.300
0% budget.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.620
We're lucky we are in the
fucking back arse of nowhere.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.360
Do you know if there's any doctor nearby?

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.420
I can tell your village is pretty nice these days.
Are you in the middle of some celebrations?

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:59.140
Yes sir. If you may honor us with your presence,
you'll enjoy the best festivities you've ever seen.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.000
You can start to prepare yourselves
for our festival.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.420
Awesome.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.940
What's the problem, boss?

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.580
I don't know.
There's something strange going on here.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.740
Don't miss the festival!

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.260
Don't worry.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.800
Son of a bitch!

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.080
This is really not traditional at all!

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.660
Villorrio del Caudillo
Hicks and Knives.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.060
