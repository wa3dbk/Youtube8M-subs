00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hi to all the boys of cassano with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.339
 such of minecraft mod today we will talk about 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 loved day 1 point 7.10 a lot 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.519
 death is interesting and very simple 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.650
 to control a motorcycle today a lot 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 details that practically already exist 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 in many affected packages b indeed has 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.650
 given permission only to FTP for 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.990
 being able to use it without requesting it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.520
 then a very simple girl in 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.410
 a way even in the middle of Toulouse a fashion 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.699
 be fortunate that she is unlucky 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 then let's go and see them together I have you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 put some true curiosity and then it will be 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.439
 a fashion is very simple then we think 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 what goes to add we loose in the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.790
 solo boratorio ok adds these 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 blocks and see in front here that yes 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 they call random mere hours guys yes 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.980
 they can have two versions 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.379
 currently I don't know why he's giving me 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.000
 I only want the other one because there 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.850
 are two versions of random ideas now 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.420
 I am writing because because here it is 415 e 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.980
 434 then this block works in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.489
 practice that when you go to break vida 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.350
 a certain number of material minerals so I ran away 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.530
 mitch let's say they go to from the vislab 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.629
 only to the iron laurel to the diamond al 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.330
 which even so, however, then 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 dropping rob pretty bonina can't 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.439
 sic touch can be used above 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 these beautiful hours we can not say 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.950
 not even appropriate to be used 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 because they are already strong enough of them 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.820
 and therefore that the adore wanted to give a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.270
 limit the situation must look 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.040
 how many beautiful minerals pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 in that there are two boys now there 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:29.070
 ask why this other version 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.799
 which is the 434 if I remember correctly virtually 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.500
 not too much 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.180
 now we know from in the edalli of 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.710
 what is there that finds nothing 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.180
 so you can also go and discover but 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.520
 imagine in a package where there is none 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.590
 the uai the hall where there are selections 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.360
 gods of how it was an old time 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.369
 those with adventures let's say that liter 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 losi you go to undermine there was that 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.729
 lucky and unlucky or not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.909
 Watch out, go undermine and it's not there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.290
 nothing therefore actually is an hour 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.850
 quite useful from the point of view 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.380
 also a bit boring from the other than 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.780
 however it can be easily circumvented 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.670
 with the in the boys so this was the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.960
 Today's death is a very simple fashion 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.250
 also quite nice and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.280
 we have practically found so many 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.679
 ftb packages in our past kids 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.030
 look at how much stuff looks like everything 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.800
 also spy on some diamond boys 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.050
 look with diamonds at what height you are 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.340
 find these materials questions yes 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.590
 can find iron height and ea 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.110
 diamond kids are very much 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.760
 comfortable ok guys this was the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.470
 today's fashion as usual call for 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.400
 let hashtag udine useless aspects 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.900
 below in the comments 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.709
 and we are going to change fashions next 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.709
