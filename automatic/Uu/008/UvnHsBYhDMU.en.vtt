00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
we meet thinking about bridge their

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.130 
we meet thinking about bridge their
ideas<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:42.400> either<00:01:42.790> have<00:01:43.120> one<00:01:43.150> idea<00:01:43.600> about

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
ideas they either have one idea about

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.820 
ideas they either have one idea about

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
bread or they have lots of ideas about

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.210 
bread or they have lots of ideas about
bridge<00:01:48.270> fill<00:01:49.270> of<00:01:49.390> us<00:01:49.510> everybody<00:01:52.920> if<00:01:53.920> we<00:01:54.100> were

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
bridge fill of us everybody if we were

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.220 
bridge fill of us everybody if we were
doing<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.580> kind<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:54.970> thinking<00:01:55.390> we<00:01:55.960> would<00:01:56.170> be

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
doing this kind of thinking we would be

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.620 
doing this kind of thinking we would be
linking<00:01:56.950> our<00:01:57.220> ideas<00:01:57.760> about<00:01:57.910> breathe<00:01:58.390> together

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
linking our ideas about breathe together

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.980 
linking our ideas about breathe together
in<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.860> easy<00:02:00.100> way<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.550> doing<00:02:01.030> that<00:02:01.240> would

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
in a really easy way of doing that would

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.460 
in a really easy way of doing that would
be<00:02:02.350> if<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:02.770> took<00:02:02.979> all<00:02:03.280> our<00:02:03.340> ideas<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.780> we

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
be if we took all our ideas and we

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.710 
be if we took all our ideas and we
classified<00:02:06.430> them<00:02:06.700> and<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.030> means<00:02:07.060> we<00:02:07.479> put

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
classified them and that means we put

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.990 
classified them and that means we put
them<00:02:07.900> into<00:02:08.050> groups<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.399> could<00:02:09.670> put<00:02:09.880> them

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
them into groups and we could put them

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.880 
them into groups and we could put them
into<00:02:10.179> groups<00:02:10.420> of<00:02:11.220> what<00:02:12.220> breeds<00:02:12.670> looks<00:02:13.180> like

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
into groups of what breeds looks like

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.980 
into groups of what breeds looks like
tastes<00:02:14.890> like<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:16.630> two<00:02:17.160> scripts<00:02:18.160> right<00:02:18.790> one

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.280 

of<00:02:22.990> your<00:02:23.290> ideas<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:24.700> could<00:02:25.030> do<00:02:25.330> we<00:02:25.780> could<00:02:25.810> put

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
of your ideas we could do we could put

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.290 
of your ideas we could do we could put
all<00:02:26.560> ideas<00:02:27.100> into<00:02:27.370> two<00:02:27.610> groups<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> would

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
all ideas into two groups and it would

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.380 
all ideas into two groups and it would
be<00:02:28.330> linking<00:02:28.780> our<00:02:28.900> ideas
