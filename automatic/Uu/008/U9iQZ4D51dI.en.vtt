more<00:01:01.920> wanted<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.369> get<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.670> out<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.970> their

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
more wanted to get more out of their

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.210 
more wanted to get more out of their
education<00:01:03.409> to<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.619> challenge<00:01:04.830> themselves

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
education to really challenge themselves

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
education to really challenge themselves
I<00:01:06.619> started<00:01:07.619> with<00:01:07.799> arrow<00:01:10.159> growing<00:01:11.159> out<00:01:11.250> of

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I started with arrow growing out of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.020 
I started with arrow growing out of
concern<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:13.670> dealing<00:01:14.670> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
concern that I have for dealing with

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
climate change global climate change is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.810 
climate change global climate change is
a<00:01:18.270> problem<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.260> face<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.310> all<00:01:20.549> know

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
a problem we all face that we all know

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.740 
a problem we all face that we all know
or<00:01:21.240> hopefully<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.530> know<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.979> very<00:01:23.010> real<00:01:23.750> we

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
or hopefully we all know is very real we

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.280 
or hopefully we all know is very real we
see<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> images<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.799> news<00:01:26.510> but<00:01:27.510> at<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
see the images on the news but at the

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.380 
see the images on the news but at the
same<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.340> need<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> drive<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> work<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
same time we need to drive to work in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.499 
same time we need to drive to work in
the<00:01:30.450> morning<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.110> need<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:32.000> go<00:01:33.000> get<00:01:33.270> groceries

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the morning we need to go get groceries

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.770 
the morning we need to go get groceries
in<00:01:34.110> our<00:01:34.320> car<00:01:34.650> there's<00:01:35.580> a<00:01:35.940> level<00:01:36.570> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
in our car there's a level of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.450 
in our car there's a level of
convenience<00:01:37.050> that's<00:01:37.860> built<00:01:38.160> into<00:01:38.340> our

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
convenience that's built into our

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.440 
convenience that's built into our
society<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.390> relies<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:40.520> filling<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.640> at<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
society that relies on filling up at the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.399 
society that relies on filling up at the
filling<00:01:43.290> up<00:01:43.410> at<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.620> tank<00:01:43.860> every<00:01:44.130> week<00:01:45.409> what

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
filling up at the tank every week what

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.850 
filling up at the tank every week what
arrows<00:01:46.830> tried<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> do<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.510> bridge<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.650> gap

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
arrows tried to do is to bridge the gap

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.220 
arrows tried to do is to bridge the gap
between<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.550> disconnect<00:01:51.390> between<00:01:51.570> those<00:01:52.020> two

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
between the disconnect between those two

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.190 
between the disconnect between those two
things<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> what<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.180> decided<00:01:54.300> upon<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.170> that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
things so what we decided upon is that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.090 
things so what we decided upon is that
we<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:57.030> build<00:01:57.690> a<00:01:57.900> car<00:01:58.140> that<00:01:58.500> fit<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
we wanted to build a car that fit the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.969 
we wanted to build a car that fit the
definition<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.940> hybrid<00:02:00.290> to<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> tee<00:02:01.620> we

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
definition of a hybrid to a tee we

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.730 
definition of a hybrid to a tee we
wanted<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.610> basically<00:02:03.290> work<00:02:04.290> towards

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
wanted to basically work towards

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.410 
wanted to basically work towards
developing<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.400> platform<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.210> would

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
developing a platform that would

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.740 
developing a platform that would
eventually<00:02:06.630> be<00:02:07.260> the<00:02:07.770> ultimate<00:02:08.009> hybrid<00:02:08.750> racing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
eventually be the ultimate hybrid racing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080 
eventually be the ultimate hybrid racing

had<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:13.459> come<00:02:14.459> up<00:02:14.580> with<00:02:14.610> solutions<00:02:14.909> that<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
had to come up with solutions that we

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.539 
had to come up with solutions that we
may<00:02:15.840> not<00:02:16.019> have<00:02:16.230> necessarily<00:02:16.530> covered<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hybrid apart from other vehicles is that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.649 
hybrid apart from other vehicles is that
the<00:02:58.019> fact<00:02:58.260> that<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.560> can<00:02:58.739> riha<00:02:59.370> earnest<00:02:59.659> energy

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
the fact that it can riha earnest energy

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.649 
the fact that it can riha earnest energy
which<00:03:00.930> would<00:03:01.139> otherwise<00:03:01.319> be<00:03:02.099> lost<00:03:02.480> which<00:03:03.480> is

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
called regenerative braking and so if

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.170

why you can't make a car that's fast and
