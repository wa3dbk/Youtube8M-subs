probably the most confusing part about

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.390 
probably the most confusing part about
bike<00:00:08.059> technology<00:00:08.240> nowadays<00:00:09.110> is<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:09.980> carbon

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
bike technology nowadays is the carbon

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.759 
bike technology nowadays is the carbon
you<00:00:11.000> know<00:00:11.090> when<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:11.480> consumer<00:00:11.930> here<00:00:12.140> is<00:00:12.290> high

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:12.769 
you know when the consumer here is high

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.879 
you know when the consumer here is high

you<00:00:16.760> know<00:00:16.820> it<00:00:16.939> becomes<00:00:17.210> very<00:00:17.450> confusing<00:00:17.689> and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
you know it becomes very confusing and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.480 
you know it becomes very confusing and
everybody<00:00:18.529> has<00:00:18.680> different<00:00:18.860> words<00:00:19.220> for

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
everybody has different words for

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.220 
everybody has different words for
basically<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.029> same<00:00:20.239> materials<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.050> things

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
basically the same materials and things

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.859 
basically the same materials and things
like<00:00:21.349> that<00:00:21.410> so<00:00:22.279> to<00:00:22.880> start<00:00:23.119> with<00:00:23.239> aerospace

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
like that so to start with aerospace

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.859 
like that so to start with aerospace
great<00:00:24.380> material<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:26.060> thing<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:26.450> the

great material the thing is the

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.929 
great material the thing is the
aerospace<00:00:27.320> industry<00:00:27.349> uses<00:00:28.220> the<00:00:28.340> same<00:00:28.579> carbon

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
aerospace industry uses the same carbon

aerospace industry uses the same carbon
as<00:00:29.239> the<00:00:29.450> bike<00:00:29.630> industry<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:30.410> other<00:00:30.560> sporting

as the bike industry and other sporting
goods<00:00:31.160> industries<00:00:31.700> the<00:00:32.419> only<00:00:32.689> difference<00:00:33.050> is

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
goods industries the only difference is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.990 
goods industries the only difference is
that<00:00:33.230> when<00:00:33.620> you<00:00:33.770> buy<00:00:33.980> it<00:00:34.040> as<00:00:34.309> an<00:00:34.640> aerospace

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.000 
that when you buy it as an aerospace

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.870 
that when you buy it as an aerospace
company<00:00:35.740> you<00:00:36.740> get<00:00:36.950> a<00:00:37.100> lot<00:00:37.400> of<00:00:37.550> paperwork

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
company you get a lot of paperwork

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.610 
company you get a lot of paperwork
whether<00:00:38.240> that<00:00:38.480> shows<00:00:38.750> where<00:00:39.110> the<00:00:39.140> material

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
whether that shows where the material

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.770 
whether that shows where the material
has<00:00:39.710> been<00:00:39.860> at<00:00:40.040> all<00:00:40.160> times<00:00:40.520> who<00:00:41.030> was<00:00:41.210> working<00:00:41.660> on

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
has been at all times who was working on

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.360 
has been at all times who was working on
it<00:00:41.990> what<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.290> temperatures<00:00:42.770> were<00:00:42.980> used<00:00:43.190> in

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
it what the temperatures were used in

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.690 
it what the temperatures were used in
the<00:00:43.490> ovens<00:00:43.820> things<00:00:44.390> like<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.640> you<00:00:46.640> know

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
the ovens things like that and you know

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.100 
the ovens things like that and you know
that's<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.120> not<00:00:47.390> something<00:00:47.630> that's<00:00:47.900> useful

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
that's just not something that's useful

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.260 
that's just not something that's useful
for<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.560> sporting<00:00:48.890> goods<00:00:49.070> industry<00:00:49.550> and<00:00:49.760> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
for the sporting goods industry and the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.790 
for the sporting goods industry and the
flipside<00:00:50.630> is<00:00:50.780> also<00:00:51.080> that<00:00:51.200> that<00:00:51.320> material<00:00:51.440> is

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
flipside is also that that material is

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.830 
flipside is also that that material is
five<00:00:52.040> times<00:00:52.370> more<00:00:52.520> expensive<00:00:52.820> because<00:00:53.450> of<00:00:53.630> all

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
five times more expensive because of all

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.140 
five times more expensive because of all
the<00:00:53.960> paperwork<00:00:54.440> so<00:00:55.070> nobody<00:00:55.760> in<00:00:55.880> the<00:00:56.000> bike

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 
the paperwork so nobody in the bike

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.910 
the paperwork so nobody in the bike
industry<00:00:56.180> is<00:00:56.780> using<00:00:57.110> aerospace<00:00:57.590> great

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
industry is using aerospace great

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.280 
industry is using aerospace great
material<00:00:58.430> or<00:00:58.579> flipped<00:00:59.210> around<00:00:59.329> everybody<00:01:00.110> is

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
material or flipped around everybody is

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.500 
material or flipped around everybody is
really<00:01:00.620> using<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:01.130> but<00:01:01.610> nobody's<00:01:02.030> paying<00:01:02.329> the

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
really using it but nobody's paying the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.439 
really using it but nobody's paying the
extra<00:01:02.900> for<00:01:03.200> the<00:01:03.320> paperwork<00:01:03.879> when<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:05.030> comes<00:01:05.210> to

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
extra for the paperwork when it comes to

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.169 
extra for the paperwork when it comes to
high<00:01:05.840> modulus<00:01:06.110> carbon<00:01:06.829> there<00:01:07.520> are<00:01:07.729> some<00:01:08.060> other

00:01:08.169 --> 00:01:08.179 
high modulus carbon there are some other

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:10.029 
high modulus carbon there are some other
problems<00:01:08.659> like<00:01:08.719> high<00:01:09.049> modulus<00:01:09.530> means<00:01:09.740> high

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
problems like high modulus means high

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:12.399 
problems like high modulus means high
stiffness<00:01:10.399> but<00:01:11.119> it<00:01:11.240> also<00:01:11.359> means<00:01:11.630> very<00:01:11.960> brittle

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
stiffness but it also means very brittle

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.349 
stiffness but it also means very brittle
so<00:01:13.039> you<00:01:13.130> can<00:01:13.280> imagine<00:01:13.759> that<00:01:13.880> when<00:01:14.030> you<00:01:14.179> have<00:01:14.329> a

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:14.359 
so you can imagine that when you have a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:17.279 
so you can imagine that when you have a
frame<00:01:14.719> that's<00:01:15.020> 100%<00:01:15.799> high<00:01:16.340> modulus

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
frame that's 100% high modulus

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.959 
frame that's 100% high modulus
potentially<00:01:18.289> it<00:01:18.499> could<00:01:18.649> be<00:01:18.829> stiff<00:01:19.130> but<00:01:19.819> it's

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
potentially it could be stiff but it's

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.730 
potentially it could be stiff but it's
also<00:01:20.149> very<00:01:20.299> brittle<00:01:20.899> so<00:01:21.109> you<00:01:21.229> don't<00:01:21.409> want<00:01:21.590> that

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
also very brittle so you don't want that

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.529 
also very brittle so you don't want that
what<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.100> want<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.520> when<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:22.789> have<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.060> 400

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
what you want is when you have the 400

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:26.200 
what you want is when you have the 400
pieces<00:01:23.719> of<00:01:23.990> carbon<00:01:24.439> that<00:01:24.979> for<00:01:25.219> each<00:01:25.460> piece<00:01:25.850> you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
pieces of carbon that for each piece you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.480 
pieces of carbon that for each piece you
choose<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.810> right<00:01:27.020> type<00:01:27.350> of<00:01:27.380> material<00:01:28.039> so

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
choose the right type of material so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.190 
choose the right type of material so
maybe<00:01:28.700> here<00:01:28.939> on<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.119> sides<00:01:29.389> of<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.719> downtube

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
maybe here on the sides of the downtube

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.830 
maybe here on the sides of the downtube
where<00:01:30.920> we<00:01:31.069> have<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.549> lot<00:01:31.819> of<00:01:31.850> material<00:01:32.329> far<00:01:32.630> away

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
where we have a lot of material far away

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.599 
where we have a lot of material far away
from<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.200> center<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:33.920> can<00:01:34.100> really<00:01:34.369> do<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.520> lot

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:34.609 
from the center that can really do a lot

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.270 
from the center that can really do a lot
for<00:01:34.759> stiffness<00:01:35.149> that's<00:01:35.869> where<00:01:36.109> we<00:01:36.259> use<00:01:36.499> high

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
for stiffness that's where we use high

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.669 
for stiffness that's where we use high
modulus<00:01:37.789> material<00:01:38.389> because<00:01:38.869> there<00:01:39.170> there's

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
modulus material because there there's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:41.620 
modulus material because there there's
not<00:01:39.859> a<00:01:39.920> lot<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.159> impact<00:01:40.609> not<00:01:40.969> a<00:01:40.999> lot<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.270> other

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
not a lot of impact not a lot of other

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.179 
not a lot of impact not a lot of other
things<00:01:41.959> that<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.289> material<00:01:42.649> has<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.829> do<00:01:42.950> other

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
things that the material has to do other

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.789 
things that the material has to do other
than<00:01:43.280> withstand<00:01:43.880> those<00:01:44.149> bending<00:01:44.719> forces<00:01:45.109> so

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
than withstand those bending forces so

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.620 
than withstand those bending forces so
there<00:01:45.979> we<00:01:46.130> use<00:01:46.340> high<00:01:46.549> modulus<00:01:46.789> but<00:01:47.539> we

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
there we use high modulus but we

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.269 
there we use high modulus but we
wouldn't<00:01:47.929> use<00:01:47.959> high<00:01:48.259> modulus<00:01:48.499> in<00:01:48.829> the<00:01:49.009> hatu

00:01:49.269 --> 00:01:49.279 
wouldn't use high modulus in the hatu

00:01:49.279 --> 00:01:51.429 
wouldn't use high modulus in the hatu
barrier<00:01:49.639> because<00:01:49.939> there<00:01:50.270> with<00:01:50.840> this<00:01:51.020> impact

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
barrier because there with this impact

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.169 
barrier because there with this impact
you<00:01:51.889> don't<00:01:52.100> want<00:01:52.279> the<00:01:52.399> brittleness<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.999> high

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
you don't want the brittleness of high

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.749 
you don't want the brittleness of high
modulus<00:01:53.709> so<00:01:54.709> the<00:01:54.799> key<00:01:54.979> is<00:01:55.100> not<00:01:55.249> to<00:01:55.310> use<00:01:55.549> high

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
modulus so the key is not to use high

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.699 
modulus so the key is not to use high
modulus<00:01:55.939> everywhere<00:01:56.509> it's<00:01:56.959> to<00:01:57.079> use<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.439> right

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:00.429 
modulus everywhere it's to use the right
grade<00:01:58.159> of<00:01:58.429> material<00:01:58.569> now<00:01:59.569> luckily<00:01:59.840> a<00:02:00.049> lot<00:02:00.289> of

these companies that claim 100% high
modulus<00:02:02.810> carbon<00:02:03.560> obviously<00:02:04.279> they're<00:02:04.459> the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
really know what high modulus means so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.540 
really know what high modulus means so
most<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.710> those<00:02:12.800> companies<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.520> you

actually look at the spec of the

actually look at the spec of the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480

even low modulus in some cases which

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.130 
even low modulus in some cases which
actually<00:02:22.849> ironically<00:02:23.090> makes<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:23.930> frame

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
actually ironically makes the frame

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.570 
actually ironically makes the frame
better<00:02:24.409> because<00:02:24.769> at<00:02:24.890> least<00:02:25.010> it's<00:02:25.250> a<00:02:25.340> safe

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
very light and that's something to keep

very light and that's something to keep

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
modulus of the material is just a tool

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.539

what you actually want to achieve is a

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.729 
what you actually want to achieve is a
