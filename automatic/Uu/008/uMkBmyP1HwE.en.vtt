the most in playoffs is cloud nine every
game<00:00:18.359> that<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.630> would<00:00:18.750> lose<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> them<00:00:19.140> we<00:00:19.680> just

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
game that we would lose to them we just

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
game that we would lose to them we just
barely<00:00:20.369> lose<00:00:20.609> by<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.090> much<00:00:21.359> if<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.930> want<00:00:22.080> to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
barely lose by this much if we want to

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
barely lose by this much if we want to
be<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.260> top-10<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.710> want<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> make<00:00:23.130> its<00:00:23.250> world<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
be a top-10 you want to make its world I

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.450

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
have to be able to not make those

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.179 
have to be able to not make those
mistakes<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.320> we<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.680> into<00:00:28.800> playoffs

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189

mistakes I think we can go into playoffs
and<00:00:29.429> be<00:00:29.760> cloud<00:00:30.000> nine<00:00:30.240> will<00:00:30.630> prove<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.349> are

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
and be cloud nine will prove that we are

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.150 
and be cloud nine will prove that we are
a<00:00:31.500> team<00:00:31.740> that<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.099> compete<00:00:32.369> with<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:34.160> how

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
a team that can compete with this how

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
a team that can compete with this how

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
because the rivalry we kind of have when

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
because the rivalry we kind of have when
we<00:00:39.420> play<00:00:39.629> against<00:00:39.899> CLG<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:41.160> fans<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.120> hype

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
we play against CLG the fans the hype

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.709

the<00:00:42.960> game<00:00:43.170> itself<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.420> blown<00:00:45.420> out

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the game itself is just like blown out

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.500 
the game itself is just like blown out
of<00:00:45.870> control<00:00:46.520> I'd<00:00:47.520> prefer<00:00:47.879> playing<00:00:48.270> against

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of control I'd prefer playing against

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
of control I'd prefer playing against
TSM<00:00:48.690> were<00:00:49.320> 30<00:00:49.620> against<00:00:49.950> them<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.190> we<00:00:50.309> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
TSM were 30 against them and we have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.400 
TSM were 30 against them and we have
them<00:00:50.579> figured<00:00:50.879> out<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.270> CLG<00:00:52.199> or

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
them figured out pretty well CLG or

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
them figured out pretty well CLG or
dignitas<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.190> think<00:00:53.579> will<00:00:53.910> be<00:00:54.149> confident<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
