 Hello dear friends with you flint 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.799
 and today at 10 o'clock on December 30, 2013 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.559
 of the year I decided to write down my very first 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.690
 video where to record video came to me 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.080
 a long time ago but somehow the hands did not reach 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.420
 before that and today it somehow happened 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.660
 time and I decided to start my video will 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.230
 more both for fun and dedicated and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.740
 games and so on but the first video will be 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.370
 like a little video tutorial namely video 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.440
 a lesson to go to minecraft 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 hunger games on pirates 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.280
 as you already understood the first and the first game 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.329
 mine will be this maykravt to go to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.270

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.449

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.449
 dot ru 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.450
 for this you need to download the launcher 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.840
 I will not download it for download 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.780
 there is a slope that downloads you 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.910
 a little program from you 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.270
 downloads you will need to pull it on 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.220
 desktop that was more convenient then you 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.720
 will need to register 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:21.500

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.670
 you enter the login here and it will even 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.790

 it will be given to you simply 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.860
 a set of letters so I will advise you 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.080
 just save it in a document which 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.200
 text that remember it will be 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.540
 Difficult and when you register 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.600

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.930
 have to wait a little bit and you 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.420
 come into play how do we begin exactly 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:36.550

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.810
 exit or starting stuffing it means 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.000

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.310
