00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
so mistreated that's why that she has a

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.880 
so mistreated that's why that she has a
little<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.430> of<00:04:41.490> a<00:04:41.580> floppy<00:04:41.850> walk<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.390> her<00:04:42.540> but

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.650 

she<00:04:46.890> was<00:04:47.040> almost<00:04:47.370> completely<00:04:47.940> bald<00:04:48.240> we<00:04:48.510> could

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
she was almost completely bald we could

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.570 
she was almost completely bald we could
see<00:04:48.810> her<00:04:48.900> hips<00:04:49.200> we<00:04:49.590> could<00:04:49.740> see<00:04:49.860> her<00:04:49.980> every<00:04:50.310> ball

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
see her hips we could see her every ball

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.780 
see her hips we could see her every ball
long<00:04:50.820> or<00:04:51.030> she<00:04:51.210> was<00:04:51.330> just<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.660> bad<00:04:51.870> shape<00:04:51.900> so

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
long or she was just in bad shape so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
long or she was just in bad shape so
that's<00:04:53.790> why<00:04:53.940> she<00:04:54.180> has<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.420> little<00:04:54.570> thing

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
that's why she has that little thing

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.590 
that's why she has that little thing
with<00:04:54.930> her<00:04:55.020> feet

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
with her feet

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.170 
with her feet
no<00:04:57.600> no<00:04:57.900> genetic<00:04:58.410> issues<00:04:58.740> at<00:04:58.890> all<00:04:59.090> just<00:05:00.090> a

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
no no genetic issues at all just a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.970 
no no genetic issues at all just a
calcium<00:05:00.630> deficiency<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.560> she's<00:05:01.800> actually

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
calcium deficiency but she's actually

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.700 
calcium deficiency but she's actually
improved<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.550> lot<00:05:02.700> for<00:05:02.910> him<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.540> think<00:05:04.380> she'll

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
improved a lot for him so I think she'll

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.470 
improved a lot for him so I think she'll
end<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.100> in<00:05:05.280> another<00:05:05.460> year<00:05:05.790> so<00:05:05.850> it<00:05:06.210> takes<00:05:06.390> a

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
end up in another year so it takes a

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.370 
end up in another year so it takes a
while<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.720> rebound

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
while to rebound

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.290 
while to rebound
especially<00:05:08.010> Carmen<00:05:08.460> her<00:05:08.580> both<00:05:08.820> took<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.120> while

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
especially Carmen her both took a while

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.750 
especially Carmen her both took a while
I<00:05:09.570> think<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.350> guy<00:05:10.530> should<00:05:11.040> finally<00:05:11.370> get<00:05:11.520> there

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
I think the guy should finally get there

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.640 
I think the guy should finally get there
