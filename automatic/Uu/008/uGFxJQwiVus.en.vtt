00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 In fact, I was reflecting a little 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.019
 It is said that Japan has about 63 people 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.019
 I wonder if that kind of thing is not enough 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.819
 We are going to throw such things 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.819
 I think it was still inadequate 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.490
 A little more 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.020
 It is said that there is a project name 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.489
 A new way of playing without a controller begins 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.820
 This sauce is 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 I'm thinking that fixed the way of enjoying the game from the ground up 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.160
 But what if there is something to do before putting it into Japan 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.880
 When 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.200
 People of x6 fans in Japan 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.440
 You can get more other titles 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.470
 I think it is necessary to provide each push 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.610
 This anonymization project is 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.120
 The way we are for Japanese fans 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.120
 It's a promise 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.030
 That's right 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.660
 I can do it 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.220
 Including popular titles 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.160
 Including the original project 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.780
 With Mr. Motokura 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.350
 While cooperating 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.020
 It is the mission of anonymization that processes such titles 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.320
 is 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.400
 in addition 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.160
 We are an entertainment company 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.900
 In the lives of users 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 It's up to you to offer fun 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.020
 I'm sneaking into your life and advertising 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.790
 I think it's more fun body 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.230
 Please note that 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.000
 A few years from now 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.369
 The most evolved and most popular game console is the xbox 360 version 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.839
 is 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.089
 xbox 360 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:17.399
 In hardware designed for games 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.329

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.439

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.439
 It has become a standard 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.979
 Also for Japanese xbox version 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.109
 textbox1 example 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.059
 I'm sorry 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:47.479
