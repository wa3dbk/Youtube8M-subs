00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.960

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.220
 channel in youtube today I will tell you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.120
 how to pick it up 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.280
 whence drawing 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.400
 I have four notebooks to give 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.310
 notebook 18 sheets in a cage 2 notebook 48 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.770
 charter cage 3 1 a 6 sheets per cage and 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.530
 daily for a year and then what 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.600
 more suitable for l2 checked all 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.970
 we know that sometimes very good at 200 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.830
 at least a year and this is not suitable 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.440
 notebook 18 sheets in a cage she is very 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.570
 will end quickly and will have found 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.430
 killed nobody will like every 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.770
 week fill up a new snooze and so 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.860
 notebook 48 sheets seemingly 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.660
 she is more but still she is not suitable for 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.570
 it is not so big to everywhere 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.390
 For the whole year we have two applicants 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.360
 casino quotes 6 sheets per cell and 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.610
 diary for a whole year that life is two 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.320
 more suitable for l2 each of 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.600
 items have a lot of cons and pros 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.810
 for example , the diary is very thick 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.730
 cover outs Trotsky 96 sheets she can 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.700
 tear very easy care you wear 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.229
 cover and for the diary you don't 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.050
 will be able to draw pictures in squares 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.560
 as here are most often drawings by 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.450
 lines 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.510
 and our from sheets we beat absolutely 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.000
 another picture at the same time diary 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.070
 very difficult to find with beautiful good 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.750
 the cover on the other side can 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.270
 arrange by yourself but it will be much 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.370
 nicer try to take cover 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.490
 diary using my video on 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:45.100
 youtube and so which one is better 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.990
 it's up to you to decide 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.850
 if you really like to draw pictures by 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.010
 Cells then you certainly have to choose from 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.900
 Us 6 sheets notebook if you this not 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.600
 so important is the main strength and 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.400
 durability then choose a diary but 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.650
 I'm passing attack advise you to choose 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.860
 family for a date subscribe to my 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.970
