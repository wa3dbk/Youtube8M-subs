00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
countries it's very important just part

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.930 
countries it's very important just part
of<00:01:46.920> their<00:01:47.070> development<00:01:47.430> program<00:01:47.730> that<00:01:47.850> they

of their development program that they

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.340 
of their development program that they
get<00:01:48.120> on<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.360> world<00:01:48.510> series<00:01:48.780> because<00:01:49.140> once

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
get on the world series because once

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.570 
get on the world series because once
you're<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.650> world<00:01:49.830> series<00:01:50.160> then<00:01:50.370> the

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
you're on the world series then the

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.610 
you're on the world series then the
athletes<00:01:51.300> are<00:01:51.420> competing<00:01:51.510> at<00:01:52.260> a<00:01:52.290> totally

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
athletes are competing at a totally

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.560 
athletes are competing at a totally
different<00:01:52.920> level<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.640> program<00:01:53.820> centralized

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
different level the program centralized

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.420 
different level the program centralized
last<00:01:54.870> year<00:01:55.140> so<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.440> was<00:01:55.530> probably<00:01:55.740> huge<00:01:56.160> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
last year so that was probably huge for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
last year so that was probably huge for
a<00:01:56.460> progression<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.200> meant<00:01:58.410> that<00:01:58.500> all

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
a progression and so it meant that all
