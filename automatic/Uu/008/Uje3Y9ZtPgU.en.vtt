00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
on stock temps I'm just gonna go over a

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.179 
on stock temps I'm just gonna go over a
quick<00:00:14.769> overclocking<00:00:15.550> of<00:00:15.730> it<00:00:16.919> what<00:00:17.919> we<00:00:18.009> got

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
quick overclocking of it what we got

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.009 
quick overclocking of it what we got
here<00:00:18.460> is<00:00:18.730> your<00:00:20.070> 978<00:00:21.070> board<00:00:21.519> from<00:00:21.730> MSI<00:00:22.240> the<00:00:22.630> FX

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
here is your 978 board from MSI the FX

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.659 
here is your 978 board from MSI the FX
4350<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.249> our<00:00:24.699> 7200<00:00:25.659> series<00:00:25.869> FX<00:00:26.650> X<00:00:27.099> card<00:00:27.550> I

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:30.509 
4350 and our 7200 series FX X card I
believe<00:00:28.230> got<00:00:29.230> you<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.439> solid<00:00:29.649> state<00:00:30.009> hiding<00:00:30.429> in

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
believe got you a solid state hiding in

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.450 
believe got you a solid state hiding in
there<00:00:30.899> and<00:00:31.899> they're<00:00:32.260> both<00:00:32.380> one<00:00:32.619> six<00:00:32.860> games<00:00:33.100> so

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
there and they're both one six games so

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.220 
there and they're both one six games so
the<00:00:33.580> SATA<00:00:33.850> with<00:00:34.240> an<00:00:34.420> old<00:00:34.570> traditional<00:00:35.050> hard

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
the SATA with an old traditional hard

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.800 
the SATA with an old traditional hard

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.770 
drive and eight gigs of mismatched
generic<00:00:38.410> memory<00:00:38.740> so<00:00:39.730> let's<00:00:39.940> get<00:00:40.060> those<00:00:40.270> in

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
generic memory so let's get those in

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.010 
generic memory so let's get those in
here<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:42.460> i've<00:00:42.610> ever<00:00:42.790> clocked<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.360> OC<00:00:43.750> Genie

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
here now i've ever clocked the OC Genie

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.560 
here now i've ever clocked the OC Genie
and<00:00:44.830> it<00:00:45.130> wasn't<00:00:45.340> too<00:00:45.640> bad<00:00:45.790> at<00:00:46.000> all<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.300> it<00:00:46.450> I

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
and it wasn't too bad at all of it I

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.420 
and it wasn't too bad at all of it I
think<00:00:46.660> we<00:00:46.990> can<00:00:47.140> do<00:00:47.260> better<00:00:47.440> so<00:00:47.890> let's<00:00:48.130> see<00:00:48.340> if

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
think we can do better so let's see if

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.270 
think we can do better so let's see if
we<00:00:48.610> can't<00:00:48.910> liver<00:00:49.210> pops<00:00:49.570> off<00:00:50.940> gonna<00:00:51.940> go<00:00:52.090> in<00:00:52.270> here

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we can't liver pops off gonna go in here

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.750 
we can't liver pops off gonna go in here
change<00:00:54.280> a<00:00:54.370> few<00:00:54.550> settings<00:00:57.280> that<00:00:57.550> 2:16

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
change a few settings that 2:16

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
change a few settings that 2:16
we're<00:01:00.760> gonna<00:01:00.910> just<00:01:01.120> our<00:01:01.300> frontside<00:01:01.750> bus<00:01:02.079> -<00:01:03.150> no

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
we're gonna just our frontside bus - no

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.030 
we're gonna just our frontside bus - no
let's<00:01:05.320> take<00:01:06.130> a<00:01:06.159> guess<00:01:06.400> since<00:01:06.670> 822<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.860> not<00:01:09.010> a

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
let's take a guess since 822 it's not a

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.530 
let's take a guess since 822 it's not a
guess<00:01:09.280> I've<00:01:09.520> actually<00:01:09.700> already<00:01:10.000> tested<00:01:10.450> all

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
guess I've actually already tested all

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.140 
guess I've actually already tested all
these<00:01:10.690> numbers<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:12.460> all<00:01:12.580> within<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.000> well

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
these numbers we're all within the well

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.420 
these numbers we're all within the well
ranges<00:01:13.630> of<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.870> temperatures<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
ranges of the temperatures and

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.460 
ranges of the temperatures and
everything<00:01:15.970> else<00:01:16.120> good<00:01:16.300> about<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.720> so<00:01:17.140> we're

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
everything else good about it so we're

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.350 
everything else good about it so we're
gonna<00:01:17.530> see<00:01:17.830> what<00:01:17.860> we<00:01:17.979> can't<00:01:18.280> do<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.820> push<00:01:19.150> this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
gonna see what we can't do to push this

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.760 
gonna see what we can't do to push this
thing<00:01:19.570> out<00:01:19.720> we're<00:01:20.020> gonna<00:01:20.170> turn<00:01:20.380> off<00:01:20.530> to

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
thing out we're gonna turn off to

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.980 
thing out we're gonna turn off to
protection<00:01:21.220> because<00:01:21.700> I<00:01:21.970> want<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:22.690> try<00:01:22.870> and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
protection because I want to try and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.380 
protection because I want to try and
blow<00:01:23.140> stuff<00:01:23.200> off<00:01:23.620> blow<00:01:24.550> stuff<00:01:24.760> up<00:01:24.909> I<00:01:25.120> can't

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
blow stuff off blow stuff up I can't

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.020 
blow stuff off blow stuff up I can't
talk<00:01:25.570> -<00:01:26.070> we're<00:01:27.070> gonna<00:01:27.190> turn<00:01:27.400> off<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.580> turbo

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
talk - we're gonna turn off the turbo

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.850 
talk - we're gonna turn off the turbo
technology<00:01:28.720> because<00:01:29.020> it's<00:01:29.290> not<00:01:29.470> gonna<00:01:29.620> do<00:01:29.830> us

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
technology because it's not gonna do us

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.940 
technology because it's not gonna do us
any<00:01:30.070> good<00:01:30.220> in<00:01:30.520> this<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:32.680> we're<00:01:32.890> gonna

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
any good in this time and we're gonna

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
any good in this time and we're gonna
set<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:33.430> memory<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.880> 1333<00:01:35.880> let's<00:01:36.880> give<00:01:37.060> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
set the memory to 1333 let's give the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.570 
set the memory to 1333 let's give the
video<00:01:38.530> card<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:38.979> little<00:01:39.070> bit<00:01:39.250> of<00:01:39.340> room<00:01:39.430> to

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
video card a little bit of room to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.620 
video card a little bit of room to
breathe<00:01:39.640> at<00:01:40.360> 15<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.299> think<00:01:43.450> that's

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
breathe at 15 to that so I think that's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.420 
breathe at 15 to that so I think that's
gonna<00:01:43.869> be<00:01:43.960> all<00:01:44.229> of<00:01:44.320> our<00:01:44.409> settings<00:01:44.830> for<00:01:45.159> the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
gonna be all of our settings for the

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.390 
gonna be all of our settings for the
simple<00:01:45.790> stuff<00:01:46.000> quick<00:01:46.869> overclocking<00:01:47.650> simple

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
simple stuff quick overclocking simple

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.310 
simple stuff quick overclocking simple
or<00:01:48.490> clocking<00:01:48.970> let's<00:01:49.180> see<00:01:49.360> how<00:01:49.450> she<00:01:49.510> does<00:01:49.690> give

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
or clocking let's see how she does give

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.690 
or clocking let's see how she does give
everybody<00:01:50.530> start

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.520 

now<00:01:56.299> they<00:01:56.420> use<00:01:56.570> all<00:01:56.750> these<00:01:56.900> temperatures<00:01:57.409> are

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
now they use all these temperatures are

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.560 
now they use all these temperatures are
always<00:01:57.799> within<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.159> range<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.580> 50<00:01:58.729> degrees<00:01:59.240> to

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
always within a range of 50 degrees to

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.899 
always within a range of 50 degrees to
about<00:01:59.659> 62<00:02:00.229> degrees<00:02:00.500> Celsius<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:01.460> well<00:02:01.670> within

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
about 62 degrees Celsius so well within

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.120 
about 62 degrees Celsius so well within
the<00:02:02.150> thermal<00:02:02.570> ranges<00:02:03.080> of<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:03.409> computer<00:02:03.920> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
the thermal ranges of this computer and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.670 
the thermal ranges of this computer and
under<00:02:04.700> load<00:02:04.850> it's<00:02:05.689> holding<00:02:05.990> up<00:02:06.140> fine

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
under load it's holding up fine

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.620 
under load it's holding up fine
now<00:02:06.860> obviously<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.700> fans<00:02:07.909> are<00:02:08.209> telling<00:02:08.539> you

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
now obviously the fans are telling you

it's<00:02:08.840> hurt<00:02:09.050> upset<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.310> mad<00:02:10.489> but<00:02:10.789> that's<00:02:11.120> the

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
it's hurt upset and mad but that's the

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.790 
it's hurt upset and mad but that's the
point<00:02:11.360> overclocking<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.170> want<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.410> see<00:02:12.530> how<00:02:12.590> far

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
point overclocking I want to see how far

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.040 
point overclocking I want to see how far
I<00:02:12.860> could<00:02:12.980> push<00:02:13.100> this<00:02:13.489> one<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.450> stop<00:02:14.690> stuff

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
I could push this one the stop stuff

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
I could push this one the stop stuff
before<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:17.950> really<00:02:18.950> wanted<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> see<00:02:19.970> what<00:02:20.090> it

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
before I really wanted to see what it

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.300 
before I really wanted to see what it
could<00:02:20.270> do<00:02:20.390> before<00:02:20.690> our<00:02:20.720> water<00:02:20.959> cooled<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> we

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
could do before our water cooled it we

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.009 
could do before our water cooled it we
like<00:02:22.760> it<00:02:22.790> on<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> stock<00:02:23.360> settings<00:02:23.810> but<00:02:23.989> I

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
like it on the stock settings but I

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.180 
like it on the stock settings but I
wanted<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.350> see<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.650> could<00:02:24.800> push<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> little

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
wanted to see if we could push a little

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.309 
wanted to see if we could push a little
bit<00:02:25.370> faster<00:02:25.880> oh<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.630> just<00:02:26.720> got<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.959> past<00:02:27.140> this

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
bit faster oh you just got you past this

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.140 
bit faster oh you just got you past this

bring<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.390> back<00:02:32.420> up<00:02:32.569> it's<00:02:33.050> common<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> have

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
bring it back up it's common to have

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.800 
bring it back up it's common to have
this<00:02:33.860> deal<00:02:34.069> there<00:02:34.970> with<00:02:35.150> me<00:02:35.299> guys<00:02:35.480> we'll<00:02:35.720> get

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
this deal there with me guys we'll get

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.199 
this deal there with me guys we'll get
this<00:02:35.989> up<00:02:36.170> and<00:02:36.319> go<00:02:39.430> ain't<00:02:40.430> nothing<00:02:40.700> wrong<00:02:40.819> so

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
this up and go ain't nothing wrong so

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.820 
this up and go ain't nothing wrong so
we're<00:02:41.360> just<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.840> push<00:02:42.380> right<00:02:42.500> through

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
we're just going to push right through

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.789 
we're just going to push right through
to<00:02:43.239> Windows<00:02:44.239> 10<00:02:44.269> that's<00:02:44.989> my<00:02:45.170> base<00:02:45.410> that<00:02:45.620> I'm

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
to Windows 10 that's my base that I'm

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.759 
to Windows 10 that's my base that I'm
running<00:02:46.239> I<00:02:47.239> would<00:02:47.540> probably<00:02:47.870> use<00:02:48.019> Windows<00:02:48.440> 7

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
running I would probably use Windows 7

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.259 
running I would probably use Windows 7
if<00:02:48.860> I<00:02:48.980> was<00:02:49.100> really<00:02:49.340> overclocking<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.060> than

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
if I was really overclocking this than

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.970 
if I was really overclocking this than
to<00:02:50.299> try<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.750> see<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.900> can<00:02:51.200> go<00:02:51.350> it<00:02:51.590> would<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.769> more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
to try and see I can go it would be more

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.190 
to try and see I can go it would be more
stable<00:02:52.069> drivers<00:02:52.819> more<00:02:53.030> stable<00:02:53.450> environment<00:02:53.690> I

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
stable drivers more stable environment I

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.410 
stable drivers more stable environment I
like<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:55.010> push<00:02:55.190> things<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.760> see<00:02:55.940> how<00:02:56.150> far<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
like to push things and see how far I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.449 
like to push things and see how far I
can<00:02:56.600> get<00:02:56.870> with<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.110> new<00:02:57.140> technologies<00:02:57.920> these

software it's free and I've used it

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.130 
software it's free and I've used it
before<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:16.609> can<00:04:16.970> go<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.359> get<00:04:17.419> other<00:04:17.600> baselines

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
before I can go and get other baselines

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.099 
before I can go and get other baselines
for<00:04:18.260> say<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> core<00:04:18.829> i5<00:04:19.359> just<00:04:20.359> to<00:04:20.480> see<00:04:20.690> how<00:04:20.900> they

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
for say a core i5 just to see how they

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.320 
for say a core i5 just to see how they
they<00:04:21.470> hold<00:04:21.680> up<00:04:21.829> against<00:04:22.190> each<00:04:22.310> other<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:22.910> now

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
they hold up against each other so now

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.460 
they hold up against each other so now
that<00:04:23.419> we're<00:04:23.630> up<00:04:23.660> I'm<00:04:23.930> going<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.110> run<00:04:24.200> the<00:04:24.320> base

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
that we're up I'm going to run the base

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.770 
that we're up I'm going to run the base
marks<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.010> stop<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.400> video<00:04:25.640> alright<00:04:26.390> guys<00:04:26.600> we

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
marks and stop the video alright guys we

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.510 
marks and stop the video alright guys we
finished<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.230> baseline<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.830> got<00:04:27.980> a<00:04:28.010> result

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
finished the baseline and got a result

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.350 
finished the baseline and got a result
of<00:04:29.560> 2309<00:04:30.560> on<00:04:30.770> this<00:04:30.950> computer<00:04:31.310> now<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:31.910> have<00:04:32.210> it

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
of 2309 on this computer now I have it

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.070 
of 2309 on this computer now I have it
set<00:04:32.390> up<00:04:32.600> against<00:04:33.910> here<00:04:34.910> we<00:04:35.030> got<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.419> 4<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:35.990> an

one<00:05:06.919> time<00:05:07.190> I<00:05:07.310> jumped<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.270> there<00:05:08.860> memory<00:05:09.860> looks

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
one time I jumped out there memory looks

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.560 
one time I jumped out there memory looks
like<00:05:10.220> we're<00:05:10.370> right<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.550> par<00:05:10.880> with<00:05:10.940> everything

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
like we're right on par with everything

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.390 
like we're right on par with everything
and<00:05:11.840> we<00:05:12.110> have<00:05:12.229> a<00:05:12.260> solid<00:05:12.500> state<00:05:12.860> in<00:05:12.979> here<00:05:13.190> sort

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
and we have a solid state in here sort

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.550 
and we have a solid state in here sort
of<00:05:13.430> long<00:05:13.700> and<00:05:13.880> way<00:05:14.030> on<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.419> so<00:05:15.169> as<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.440> can

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
of long and way on that so as you can

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.960 
of long and way on that so as you can
see<00:05:15.680> that's<00:05:15.800> how<00:05:15.979> quickly<00:05:16.250> we<00:05:16.550> can<00:05:16.669> look<00:05:16.850> at

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
see that's how quickly we can look at

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.909 
see that's how quickly we can look at
stuff<00:05:17.240> we're<00:05:17.810> gonna<00:05:17.960> change<00:05:18.290> the<00:05:18.470> baseline
