2 inch piece and a 3/4 inch by one and a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.500 
2 inch piece and a 3/4 inch by one and a
half<00:00:15.540> inches<00:00:16.550> these<00:00:17.550> are<00:00:17.699> both<00:00:17.910> made<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.390> of

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
half inches these are both made out of

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.400 
half inches these are both made out of
tissue<00:00:18.630> foil<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:20.609> take<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.820> paper<00:00:21.080> fold<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.230> in

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
tissue foil so take the paper fold it in

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.210 
tissue foil so take the paper fold it in
half<00:00:23.960> to<00:00:24.960> create<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.230> center<00:00:25.560> line<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.980> acts

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
half to create a center line this acts

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.419 
half to create a center line this acts
as<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:27.170> point<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.260> reference<00:00:28.349> for<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.160> rest<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
as a point of reference for the rest of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.569 
as a point of reference for the rest of
your<00:00:29.550> folds<00:00:30.769> take<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.189> corner<00:00:33.649> fold<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:34.829> from

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
your folds take the corner fold it from

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.060 
your folds take the corner fold it from
the<00:00:35.670> center<00:00:35.969> line<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.110> tip<00:00:37.350> reaches

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
the center line so that the tip reaches

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.209 
the center line so that the tip reaches
over<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.850> far<00:00:39.030> side<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.890> then<00:00:40.890> crease

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
over to the far side and then crease

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.660 
over to the far side and then crease
along<00:00:42.290> until<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.469> come<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.129> about<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.430> same

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
along until you come to about the same

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.910 
along until you come to about the same
distance<00:00:45.450> from<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> top<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.450> paper<00:00:48.450> as

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
distance from the top of the paper as

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.189 
distance from the top of the paper as
from<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> top<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.210> center<00:00:51.480> line<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:52.079> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
from the top to the center line so it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
from the top to the center line so it
forms<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.590> square<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> top<00:00:53.420> corner<00:00:55.610> then<00:00:56.610> do

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
forms a square in the top corner then do

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.660 
forms a square in the top corner then do
the<00:00:56.850> same<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> other<00:00:57.570> side<00:01:01.670> folding

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the same for the other side folding

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.950 
the same for the other side folding
across<00:01:02.969> from<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.390> center<00:01:03.660> line<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:05.960> then

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
across from the center line and then

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.160 
across from the center line and then
fold<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.939> overlap<00:01:08.939> over<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> other<00:01:10.110> side

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
fold the overlap over to the other side

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.960 
fold the overlap over to the other side
so<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.320> creates<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> stem<00:01:14.070> part<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> your

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
so this creates the stem part of your

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.890 
so this creates the stem part of your
leaf<00:01:15.530> now<00:01:16.530> create<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.040> crease<00:01:17.900> just

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
leaf now create a little crease just

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.429 
leaf now create a little crease just
below<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> first<00:01:20.700> folds<00:01:21.259> meet<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
below where the first folds meet the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.770 
below where the first folds meet the
side<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> paper<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:26.310> fold<00:01:26.570> from<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
side of the paper and then fold from the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.830 
side of the paper and then fold from the
center<00:01:28.110> fold<00:01:29.720> over<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> tip<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
center fold over so that the tip is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.539 
center fold over so that the tip is
about<00:01:34.079> halfway<00:01:34.590> across<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.880> opposite<00:01:36.299> side

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
about halfway across the opposite side

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.870 
about halfway across the opposite side
and<00:01:38.549> fold<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.030> other<00:01:39.119> tip<00:01:39.420> down<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.729> it

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and fold the other tip down so that it

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.300 
and fold the other tip down so that it
meets<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.210> fold<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> previous<00:01:43.890> tip<00:01:44.450> right

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.670 

and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.240> new<00:01:49.360> tip<00:01:49.600> that's<00:01:49.810> farm<00:01:50.170> fold<00:01:50.500> it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
and then the new tip that's farm fold it

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.350 
and then the new tip that's farm fold it
over<00:01:51.040> into<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.760> center<00:01:52.799> before<00:01:53.799> to<00:01:54.790> form<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
over into the center before to form the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:02.999 
over into the center before to form the
top<00:01:55.810> part<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.170> your<00:01:56.229> leaf<00:02:01.140> now<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.200> make<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
top part of your leaf now to make the

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.850 
top part of your leaf now to make the
stem<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.810> want<00:02:04.990> to<00:02:05.050> fold<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.350> bottom<00:02:06.000> third

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
stem you want to fold the bottom third

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.460 
stem you want to fold the bottom third
up<00:02:08.860> towards<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:09.429> top<00:02:09.459> so<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.539> tip<00:02:10.780> ends<00:02:11.350> up

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
up towards the top so the tip ends up

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.040 
up towards the top so the tip ends up
about<00:02:11.620> halfway<00:02:12.040> between<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:13.209> fold<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.840> the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
about halfway between the fold and the

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.210 
about halfway between the fold and the
top<00:02:14.260> of<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.530> leaf<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.870> fold<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.260> back<00:02:17.290> and

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
top of the leaf and fold it back and

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.979 
top of the leaf and fold it back and
then<00:02:18.850> create<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.209> little<00:02:19.590> indent<00:02:21.989> underneath

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
then create a little indent underneath

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.990 
then create a little indent underneath
the<00:02:23.170> fold<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:25.030> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.500 

and<00:02:29.510> then<00:02:29.870> scrimp<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:30.920> together

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.470 

and<00:02:34.989> take<00:02:35.200> your<00:02:35.319> fingernail<00:02:35.739> and<00:02:36.300> crease<00:02:37.300> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and take your fingernail and crease the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.710 
and take your fingernail and crease the
center<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.340> stem<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:41.260> pinch<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
center of the stem and then pinch it

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.449 
center of the stem and then pinch it
well<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.989> same<00:02:44.200> time<00:02:44.470> pressing<00:02:44.950> down<00:02:45.159> on

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
well it's the same time pressing down on

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.309 
well it's the same time pressing down on
the<00:02:45.549> top<00:02:45.879> part<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.330> leaf<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:49.110> then<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.290> a

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
the top part of the leaf and then do a

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.440 
the top part of the leaf and then do a
little<00:02:50.470> shaping<00:02:51.030> around<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.150> leaf<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.420> little

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
little shaping around the leaf a little

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.030 
little shaping around the leaf a little
bit<00:02:53.580> yeah<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:54.879> go
