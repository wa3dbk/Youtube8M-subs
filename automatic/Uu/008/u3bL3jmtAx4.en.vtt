 in which in addition to accepting orders 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.250
 we produce our own work and we do 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.050
 collaborations with illustrating artists 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.930
 to make limited editions in the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.340
 jobs we have that technique makes 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.350
 three years and after a time of 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.000
 learning we have gone from working in 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.620
 a totally hotmail studio to a 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.210
 workshop to be teacher biography we have 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.489
 made pieces from posters 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.540
 towns bucks cards and stationery o 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.980
 corporate notebooks in beard 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.690
 we mainly work on paper 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.030
 although we are open to work on 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.339
 Other supports such as packaging bags 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 wood our customers have been since

 if some are passionate to continue doing 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.090
 The process of silkscreening is a technique 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.920
 that allows us to move our design 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.630
 to any support when dealing with a 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.460
 manual process each the pieces is left 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.460
 different and that will give you a unique value 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.550
 in our domestic course you will learn 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.200
 screen print from scratch and also you

 the different results offer 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.090
 technique 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 our domestic course we propose 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.040
 to make a poster to four with a phrase 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.330
 inspiring and two colors in which 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.520
 we will see the whole process of screen printing 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.470
 first we will create our image we will 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.000
 the photolith will prepare the screen and 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.740
 we will register the two colors for 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 finish we will clean and recover 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.450
 our screen to use it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.399
 on another occasion 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.560
 for this course we will need a small

 screen a squeegee tapes and some 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.670
 hinges 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 we will also need other materials 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.569
 that we can all find at home 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.400
 pencils thread rules scissors 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.110
 we will also need a computer with 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.790
 a design program but do not 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.080
 worry about the knowledge that you should 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.590
 have about these programs are the
