really too much even though this is a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
really nice Sony keyboard it's the flat

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.010 
really nice Sony keyboard it's the flat
island-style<00:01:44.700> keys<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.390> key<00:01:45.540> faces<00:01:45.899> are

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
island-style keys and the key faces are

island-style keys and the key faces are
actually<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.439> big<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.189> touchpad<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
actually pretty big the touchpad kind of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.370 
actually pretty big the touchpad kind of
gets<00:01:48.299> squeezed<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.170> call

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
gets squeezed down a little bit I call

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170 
gets squeezed down a little bit I call
it<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> letterbox<00:01:49.799> style<00:01:50.399> where<00:01:50.939> it's<00:01:51.030> much

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it a letterbox style where it's much

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
it a letterbox style where it's much

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
longer than it is wide and that makes a

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
longer than it is wide and that makes a
little<00:01:53.790> hard<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> finger<00:01:54.659> gestures

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
little hard to do to finger gestures

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
little hard to do to finger gestures

get that's even more important that
there's<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:11.910> nice<00:02:12.090> new<00:02:12.330> design<00:02:12.690> the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
they have kind of this wraparound look I

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.520 
they have kind of this wraparound look I
think<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:18.390> very<00:02:18.480> modern<00:02:18.750> actually<00:02:19.200> looks<00:02:19.410> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
think it's very modern actually looks a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.630 
think it's very modern actually looks a
little<00:02:19.590> bit<00:02:19.800> nicer<00:02:19.830> than<00:02:20.310> some<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.520> some<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
little bit nicer than some of some of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.060 
little bit nicer than some of some of
these<00:02:20.760> more<00:02:21.000> expensive<00:02:21.270> laptops<00:02:22.080> which<00:02:22.950> can

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
these more expensive laptops which can

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.350 
these more expensive laptops which can
actually<00:02:23.280> look<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.490> little<00:02:23.670> generic<00:02:23.850> so<00:02:24.300> if

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
actually look a little generic so if

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.030 
actually look a little generic so if
you're<00:02:24.480> willing<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.690> overlook<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.560> lower

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040
