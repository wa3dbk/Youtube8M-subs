00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.150
 that's it you hibernated them on face 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.610
 book inn so today a video 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
 special recipe from taco bell 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.580
 so that's it if you have not seen the little 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.889
 test video 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.160
 she's here and we end up for a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.369
 pastry love them dada caramel and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.820
 apple c of killing so it's gone 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.849
 you'll need sugar butter from 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.000
 sugar or cinnamon a broken dough 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 and of course apples then first 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.140
 step we will just peel the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.280
 apples 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.719
 once this is done it is the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 cut in half and remove the core 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.070
 so we take the apple to the group in two 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
 and then what I advise you to 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.140
 to do it's simple we take it off small 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.510
 to small pieces as in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.430
 bypassing the throne 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 we then see roughly cut the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.020
 ravoux apples does not really 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.120
 watch out for apple pieces 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.370
 about 2 this size there and then 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 we will put them in a saucepan and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.390
 it's very simple we played all the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 remains of the ingredients that it means 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.990
 cinnamon brown sugar sugar 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.540
 classic and to finish the butter 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.640
 here and have to cook well once 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.680
 that it is well caramelized we will 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.150
 remove the preparation from the fire and we will 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.180
 let it cool 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.189
 you are going to smear your broken dough and to 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.799
 the help of a cookie cutter comes to make 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.040
 ch directly into the dough rolls 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.290
 then you will fill the rounds with 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.509
 our preparation so look at little 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.890
 near the quantity must not be omitted from 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.890
 too much behind yellow we are a little bit 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.490
 that's it and then it's very simple for 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.850
 come close lemba nada that's it 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.979
 support well and for the finish we come 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.750
 well stung here with a fork 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.850
 in a saucepan we just put 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.800

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.600
 minutes on each side at medium heat and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.880
 once they are golden although they 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.320
