00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
there a couple of great lectures that I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.729 
there a couple of great lectures that I
really<00:00:50.160> like<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> atomic<00:00:52.230> bombing

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
really like one is on the atomic bombing

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.200 
really like one is on the atomic bombing
of<00:00:53.460> Japan<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.649> we<00:00:55.649> talk<00:00:55.920> about<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.940> way<00:00:57.059> in

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
of Japan and we talk about the way in

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.630 
of Japan and we talk about the way in
which<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.050> war<00:00:58.260> ended<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.520> which

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
which the war ended and the way in which

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.420 
which the war ended and the way in which
the<00:00:59.789> Japanese<00:01:00.149> Emperor<00:01:00.510> renounced<00:01:01.430> his

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
the Japanese Emperor renounced his

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.210 
the Japanese Emperor renounced his
sacred<00:01:02.730> status<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.619> then<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.070> there<00:01:05.189> are

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
sacred status and then I think there are

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.560 
sacred status and then I think there are
many<00:01:05.400> different<00:01:05.790> ways<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.060> could<00:01:06.180> talk<00:01:06.390> about

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
many different ways you could talk about

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.219 
many different ways you could talk about
the<00:01:06.840> effects<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.380> being<00:01:07.920> bombed<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.670> Japan<00:01:09.229> and

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the effects of being bombed on Japan and

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.410 
the effects of being bombed on Japan and
certainly<00:01:10.830> there<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.400> pictures<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.180> stories

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
certainly there are pictures and stories

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
certainly there are pictures and stories
and<00:01:12.840> poems<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> really<00:01:13.680> tell<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.070> story

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and poems that really tell that story

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.399 
and poems that really tell that story
very<00:01:14.580> pointedly<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.270> choose<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> go<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
very pointedly I choose to go a

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.630 
very pointedly I choose to go a
different<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.130> tell<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.400> story

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
different way and I tell that story

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.649 
different way and I tell that story
through<00:01:18.030> Godzilla<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.400> we<00:01:21.330> do<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> little

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
through Godzilla and so we do a little

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
through Godzilla and so we do a little
history<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> Godzilla<00:01:22.590> films<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.250> we

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
history of the Godzilla films but we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.560 
history of the Godzilla films but we
also<00:01:23.490> talk<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.180> fact<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.630> Godzilla

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
also talk about the fact that Godzilla

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.020 
also talk about the fact that Godzilla
is<00:01:27.570> himself<00:01:28.189> although<00:01:29.189> he's<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> monster<00:01:29.880> he

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
is himself although he's a monster he

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.999 
is himself although he's a monster he
represents<00:01:30.509> both<00:01:30.659> both<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.380> destruction<00:01:31.950> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
represents both both the destruction of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.080 
represents both both the destruction of
Japan<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.490> Japan

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
Japan but also Japan
