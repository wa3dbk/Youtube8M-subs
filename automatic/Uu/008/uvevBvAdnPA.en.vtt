00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.979
 I'm pete seeger project and welcome 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.450
 back to the channel this time 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.790
 we will try some points there 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.350
 compiled and compacted and it might seem 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.580
 that are common sense but many times 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.410
 we ignore them 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 likewise following these steps at the foot 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 of the letter will guarantee you to be better 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.050
 inside banfield or practically 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.910
 any shooter in the first person 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.920
 let's start with step number 1 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.810
 knowledge of the map may be the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.190
 point of greater weight to know that all 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.320
 they want to reach the roof for example in 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.820
 some maps can be useful so that 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.350
 you take a quick route and attacks by 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.600
 behind the opponent while they are not 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.429
 prevented for example in domination and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.780
 conquest there are certain routes that are taken 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.670
 commonly after capturing the 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.829
 flag or places where is where 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 catch the hidden flag and places 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.699
 where there may be someone hiking around 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.589
 example the best way besides the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.479
 practice to understand all these routes 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.489
 and how the enemy behaves is to enter 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.499
 to a server as a viewer and see a 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.350
 full game of your mode or map that 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.539
 you want to study step number 2 uses 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.789
 a proper configuration of both 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.190
 weapons as of the attachments and 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.840
 accessories of your kind do not use 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.030
 shotguns or sub-machine guns for example in 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 open fields change smoke grenades 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.540
 if you need to cover your equipment use 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.790
 anti- aircraft missiles if the situation is 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.800
 difficult by air or unguided missiles and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.210
 the enemy is powerful by land all 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.770
 it is according to the situation and what 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 be better to her as regards the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.460
 weapons attachments that are decided 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.810
 more than anything by trial and error although 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.479
 if you want to save yourself a little time 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 you can visit the channel reviews a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.800
 bad example is a look 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.619
 of 40 x in a map of domination nothing 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.210
 more number 3 and this is going to earn a lot 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.580
 with experience do the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.440
 more unfair confrontations towards you 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.300
 please here they do not give you points for being 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.190
 rambo or do not plan a strategy not 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.600
 matter what skill you have while 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.880
 that the disadvantage is the opponent 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.930
 that always keep in mind the ideal is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520
 that every time I shot him is a 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.590
 enemy you are in the position where 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.920
 practically do what I always do 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.000
 you will gain how you do that mainly 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.580
 coverage whenever you advance and that 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.140
 walk looking how to cover your back by 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.210
 if an enemy thinks to flank 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.220
 before shooting an enemy that does not 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.170
 know of your presence make sure you know 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.610
 if you can kill it in a single burst 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.019
 before it is behind a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.780
 coverage of the against the factor 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.820
 surprise will have gone completely forever 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.130
 try to cover your whole body so that 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.850
 at least the only thing that is exposed is 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.800
 the head 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.420
 in case you use the system of 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.280
 baba coverage is to say when you 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.830
 You approach a corner remember that you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 soldier is right or right-handed so 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.890
 if you look at your right side you'll be 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.660
 more covered than if you are or more on the side 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.100
 left where a greater part of your 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.710
 body is going to add up for the enemy 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.120
 also look for the enemy's back 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.490
 if you see in the minimap you are looking at 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 to one side tries to surround it is going to be 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.450
 much harder for him to turn around 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.310
 and that he kills you so that you arrive and give him 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.660
 four shots in the back too 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.400
 try to get to the routes that are not 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.710
 are so covered by the enemy 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.600
 - pointing guns means you're going 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.670
 to get further and possibly you can 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.310
 flank them or attack them from behind 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.770
 but most of all he recognizes when to flee and 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.780
 when to stay to fight number 4 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.990
 get used to your proper sensitivity 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.180
 and practice a lot although this is not a 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.610
 sports are not mathematics or something 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.560
 similarly everything that was 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.930
 you need to learn thoroughly you need 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.940
 practice in terms of sensitivity what 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 ideal is not having acceleration in your 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.710
 mouse in case you play on pc 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.180
 obviously to know how to eliminate it 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.070
 I'll leave you a link in the description 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.730
 that will teach them how to do it and 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.860
 will remove everything 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.989
 to your doubts now yes for console and pc 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.940
 to know what is your best sensitivity 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.340
 I suggest that the adjustments to the level 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.989
 maximum but that at the same time leaves you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.209
 do the following correctly 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.069
 tasks a number one take a turn 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.980
 complete in the space you have for 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.690
 your mouse comfort first of all number two 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.750
 be able to point a sniper rifle 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.040
 to enemies in the distance and power 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.200
 accommodate the look in the head of 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.480
 opponent without much hesitation without losing 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.980
 long time number three being able to control 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.099
 the shooting pattern without problem of 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.110
 weapons like famas the cct to 3 to 1 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.150
 scorpion or for example on the n-240 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.549
 bravos that are characterized by a 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.170
 shooting pattern something crazy so 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.609
 if you can control this kind of 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.379
 shooting pattern can control 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.819
 anyone and finally have the 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.290
 enough agility to be able 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.760
 Shoot enemies that are very 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.739
 glued to you or that gives them the 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.420
 back for a moment the ideal is that 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.070
 can be perfectly and you feel 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.380
 totally comfortable in those four 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.060
 situations of not being completely 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.220
 in some of them look for the balance 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.260
 that fits you best between those four and 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:28.410
 the rest will do the practice incised 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.080
 number 5 knowledge of the objectives and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.610
 game modes 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.400
 play catch the flag you play 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.930
 elimination by equipment or denomination 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.270
 definitely knowing what is done 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.860
 when it is done and how it is done inside 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.659
 a game mode will help you to know 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.789
 where will there be enemies and where will you 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:46.129
 allies covering the back what routes 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.289
 take and what bait to put the enemy 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.750
 if you want to put a trap step number 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.610
 6 know the pros and cons of the weapon 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.500
 what do you use if you have a defense weapon 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.120
 staff do not shoot him a sniper 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.830
 in the distance it is better to try 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590
 shorten that gap so that again 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.819
 do the situation in your favor if you have 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.190
 a shotgun and you see a player 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.750
 assault about 30 meters do not shoot what 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.430
 it's safer to finish first if you 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.080
 turn around and realize you for more 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.879
 details about the weapons and their 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.280
 indicated moments I suggest you check 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:15.289
 the reviews within the channel last step 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.139
 the number seven unless you're a 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:21.379
 super competitor pro uber wow 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.969
 the value field player and fantasy not 

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:25.159
 you have to use that weapon on 

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:27.770
 powerful all the time give a little time to 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:30.050
 every weapon and every class of time in 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.090
 when will one keep you out of what 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.740
 monotonous and changing patterns of 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.840
 shot will make you control better in 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.889
 general all the weapons of the game if 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.110
 you use the same 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.560
 easy weapons are very common as 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.169
 they are 23 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.050
 971 as wr all the time you will have greater 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.939
 problem when using other weapons a 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.740
 Perfect strategy is to reserve your weapon 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:54.680
 that powerful one with which you feel most 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.120
 pro for situations really eye 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.529
 difficult against teams where 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.360
 practically everything is using this 

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.949
 type of weapons and where do you know that you 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.319
 team will lose if you do not kill some 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.969
 how many in a very short time you will see as your 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.469
 game magically jump on those 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:08.960
 situations and you will be the hero of the 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.000
 heading the motto is there are too many weapons 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.590
 in banfield do not stay stuck in 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.629
 one and one extra step that could 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.550
 use and could serve them and that is 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.319
 one thing that is easily forgotten is that 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.599
 the other players on the screen also 

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.879
 they are real people that means that if 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.500
 you kill a player many times from the 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.669
 same place , most likely, 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.979
 look for revenge 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.839
 also take into account that you can 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.669
 deconcentrate can get out of kish and 

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:34.279
 basically psychoanalyze what if 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:36.349
 you wish you always have the advantage that 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.939
 yes do not forget to keep the respect because 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:39.949
 the internet and its anonymity is not 

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:41.389
 pretext that you are a cretin so 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:43.370
 shows a good spirit of the player 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:45.560
 in the same way remember 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.660
 Enjoy any game you are 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.490
 playing or otherwise better to leave it 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.440
 for a while that video games are for 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.860
 fun and not out of frustration
