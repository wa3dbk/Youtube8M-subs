responsive<00:01:12.580> motion<00:01:13.000> game<00:01:13.149> that's<00:01:13.390> ever<00:01:13.569> been

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
responsive motion game that's ever been

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.900 
responsive motion game that's ever been
I<00:01:14.080> think<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.530> does<00:01:14.709> set<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:14.979> new<00:01:15.190> bar<00:01:15.399> for<00:01:15.459> what

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
I think it does set a new bar for what

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.980 
I think it does set a new bar for what
motion<00:01:16.600> games<00:01:16.810> are<00:01:16.959> capable

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.750 

the<00:01:20.990> Fidelia<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.560> center<00:01:21.860> allows<00:01:22.159> us<00:01:22.430> to

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
the Fidelia the center allows us to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.550 
the Fidelia the center allows us to
detect<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.390> difference<00:01:23.659> between<00:01:23.810> two<00:01:24.320> hand

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
detect the difference between two hand

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.290 
detect the difference between two hand
positions<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.159> also<00:01:25.340> allowed<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.820> detect

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
positions and it also allowed to detect

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.880 
positions and it also allowed to detect
subtleties<00:01:26.780> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> way<00:01:27.110> you're<00:01:27.290> leaning<00:01:27.530> and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
subtleties in the way you're leaning and

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.800 
subtleties in the way you're leaning and
standing<00:01:28.460> as<00:01:28.610> you're<00:01:28.760> playing<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.180> event<00:01:29.390> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
standing as you're playing the event and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.359 
standing as you're playing the event and
that<00:01:30.020> makes<00:01:30.229> a<00:01:30.320> huge<00:01:30.560> difference<00:01:30.920> when<00:01:31.159> you're

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
that makes a huge difference when you're

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:32.680 
that makes a huge difference when you're
trying<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.580> shave<00:01:31.820> tenth<00:01:32.150> of<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.330> second<00:01:32.630> off
