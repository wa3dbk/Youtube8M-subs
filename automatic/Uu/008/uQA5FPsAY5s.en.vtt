called Sun skimming or another term for

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
called Sun skimming or another term for
it<00:00:31.260> is<00:00:31.289> fuel<00:00:31.710> scooping<00:00:32.279> Sun<00:00:32.820> skimming<00:00:33.239> and

Corona and scooping hydrogen gases which

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.369 
Corona and scooping hydrogen gases which
are<00:00:39.809> then<00:00:39.960> converted<00:00:40.230> into<00:00:41.989> fuel<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.350> your

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
are then converted into fuel for your

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.880 
are then converted into fuel for your
hyperspace<00:00:44.010> engines<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.930> like<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> say<00:00:46.260> fuel

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
hyperspace engines I like I say fuel

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
hyperspace engines I like I say fuel
scooping<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.610> absolutely<00:00:48.239> essential<00:00:48.469> for

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
scooping is absolutely essential for

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.709 
scooping is absolutely essential for
those<00:00:49.920> long<00:00:50.190> range<00:00:50.460> bounty<00:00:50.940> hunting<00:00:51.329> missions

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
those long range bounty hunting missions

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
those long range bounty hunting missions
where<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.440> may<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.980> travel<00:00:53.219> through

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
where you may have to travel through

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.360 
where you may have to travel through
multiple<00:00:54.539> uninhabited<00:00:55.469> star<00:00:55.800> systems

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
multiple uninhabited star systems

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.900 
multiple uninhabited star systems
chasing<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.420> your<00:00:57.480> prey<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.789> there<00:00:59.789> may<00:00:59.879> be

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
chasing down your prey and there may be

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.520 
chasing down your prey and there may be
nowhere<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.899> stop<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> refuel<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:03.530> it's

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
nowhere to stop and refuel so it's

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.460 
nowhere to stop and refuel so it's
something<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.100> we<00:01:05.159> need<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.400> know<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> do

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
something that we need to know how to do

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.030 
something that we need to know how to do
so<00:01:07.670> without<00:01:08.670> further<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.210> do<00:01:09.710> i'm<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
so without further to do i'm going to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
so without further to do i'm going to
show<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.880> technique<00:01:12.470> I'm<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.680> saying

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
show you my technique I'm not saying

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.070 
show you my technique I'm not saying
it's<00:01:14.070> necessarily<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:15.119> best<00:01:15.360> technique<00:01:15.900> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
it's necessarily the best technique but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
it's necessarily the best technique but
it's<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.409> works<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.009> me<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.729> I'm<00:01:17.820> going

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it's one that works for me so I'm going

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
it's one that works for me so I'm going
to<00:01:18.030> share<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:19.439> hope<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.860> some

okay<00:01:36.650> guys<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.220> here's<00:01:37.490> my<00:01:37.900> technique<00:01:38.900> for

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
okay guys so here's my technique for

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.730 
okay guys so here's my technique for
fuel<00:01:39.860> scooping<00:01:40.750> okay<00:01:41.750> go<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.170> with<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.380> planet

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
fuel scooping okay go in with the planet

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.760 
fuel scooping okay go in with the planet
to<00:01:42.830> the<00:01:42.950> sides<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:43.760> okay<00:01:44.660> don't<00:01:45.560> do<00:01:45.710> it

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
to the sides of you okay don't do it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.740 
to the sides of you okay don't do it
that<00:01:45.860> way<00:01:46.160> okay<00:01:46.820> for<00:01:47.060> some<00:01:47.240> reason<00:01:47.540> every<00:01:47.720> time

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
that way okay for some reason every time

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.450 
that way okay for some reason every time
I<00:01:47.960> do<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.260> that<00:01:48.410> way<00:01:48.530> I<00:01:48.560> ended<00:01:48.950> up<00:01:48.980> getting<00:01:49.160> too

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
I do it that way I ended up getting too

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.600 
I do it that way I ended up getting too
close<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.060> crashing<00:01:51.050> find<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.040> easy<00:01:52.190> to<00:01:52.340> go

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
close and crashing find it easy to go

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.900 
close and crashing find it easy to go
this<00:01:52.790> way<00:01:53.560> okay<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.860> then<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.370> can<00:01:55.520> control

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
this way okay and then you can control

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.870 
this way okay and then you can control
the<00:01:56.180> distance<00:01:56.600> using<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.590> your<00:01:57.950> movement<00:01:58.760> of

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
the distance using the your movement of

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.320 
the distance using the your movement of
your<00:01:59.000> joystick<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.650> speeds<00:02:01.060> using<00:02:02.060> your

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
your joystick and the speeds using your

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.140 
your joystick and the speeds using your
throttle<00:02:02.750> okay<00:02:03.590> keep<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:04.040> very<00:02:04.370> careful<00:02:04.910> high

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
throttle okay keep it very careful high

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.460 
throttle okay keep it very careful high
on<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.660> heat<00:02:05.960> gauge<00:02:07.060> okay<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.020> get<00:02:09.229> too

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
on that heat gauge okay if you get too

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.730 
on that heat gauge okay if you get too
hot<00:02:09.790> okay<00:02:10.790> just<00:02:11.000> turn<00:02:11.270> out<00:02:11.510> like<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
hot okay just turn out like so and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.100 
hot okay just turn out like so and
throttle<00:02:13.160> up<00:02:13.280> a<00:02:13.430> bit<00:02:13.660> throttled<00:02:14.660> up<00:02:16.630> engage<00:02:17.630> if

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
throttle up a bit throttled up engage if

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.900 
throttle up a bit throttled up engage if
you<00:02:18.200> throttle<00:02:18.620> up<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:18.830> bit<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.040> fly<00:02:19.430> away<00:02:19.670> from

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
you throttle up a bit you fly away from

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.740 
you throttle up a bit you fly away from
the<00:02:20.000> plant<00:02:20.270> they<00:02:20.510> start<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.470> cool<00:02:22.100> down

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
the plant they start and it cool down

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.230 
the plant they start and it cool down
okay<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.020> we'll<00:02:24.260> try<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.620> again<00:02:24.910> okay<00:02:25.910> go<00:02:26.090> in

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
okay so we'll try that again okay go in

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.380 
okay so we'll try that again okay go in
nice<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.510> steady<00:02:27.580> okay<00:02:28.580> just<00:02:28.850> aiming<00:02:29.090> into

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
nice and steady okay just aiming into

okay<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:57.090> can<00:02:57.240> get<00:02:57.420> quite<00:02:57.630> fast<00:02:58.050> doing<00:02:58.470> this

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.950 

just<00:03:01.920> keep<00:03:02.070> an<00:03:02.220> eye<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.580> heat<00:03:02.820> gauge<00:03:03.090> is

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
just keep an eye on that heat gauge is

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.570 
just keep an eye on that heat gauge is
it<00:03:04.140> starts<00:03:04.440> getting<00:03:04.590> up<00:03:04.800> towards<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.310> hundred

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
it starts getting up towards one hundred

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.120 
it starts getting up towards one hundred
percent<00:03:05.660> just<00:03:06.660> like<00:03:06.780> yourself<00:03:06.900> pull<00:03:07.500> pull

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
percent just like yourself pull pull

away<00:03:08.250> from<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.610> star<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.390> bit<00:03:09.980> soon

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
away from the star a little bit soon

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.930 
away from the star a little bit soon
start<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.520> cool<00:03:11.730> down<00:03:13.280> you'll<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:14.520> as<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> get

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
start to cool down you'll see as you get

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.600 
start to cool down you'll see as you get
closer<00:03:15.470> that<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.590> fuel<00:03:16.890> intake<00:03:17.310> will

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
closer that you fuel intake will

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
closer that you fuel intake will
increase<00:03:19.580> the<00:03:20.580> trick<00:03:20.850> is<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> get<00:03:21.330> just<00:03:21.570> that

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
increase the trick is to get just that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.420 
increase the trick is to get just that
nice<00:03:21.930> balance<00:03:22.500> between<00:03:22.650> speed<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.400> distance

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
nice balance between speed and distance

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.860 
nice balance between speed and distance
once<00:03:26.430> you<00:03:26.550> find<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.880> sweet<00:03:27.150> spot<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.780> can

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
once you find that sweet spot you can

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:35.410 
once you find that sweet spot you can
just<00:03:28.230> sit<00:03:28.410> there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.290 

if<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:36.200> go<00:03:36.349> too<00:03:36.410> fast<00:03:37.360> if<00:03:38.380> your<00:03:39.380> movement

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
if you go too fast if your movement

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.440 
if you go too fast if your movement
won't<00:03:41.300> be<00:03:41.450> enough<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.750> keep<00:03:41.930> you<00:03:42.080> in<00:03:42.170> orbit

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
won't be enough to keep you in orbit

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.830 
won't be enough to keep you in orbit
okay<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.720> there<00:03:44.870> we<00:03:44.900> go<00:03:45.220> full<00:03:46.220> fuel<00:03:46.489> tanks<00:03:47.030> we

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
okay so there we go full fuel tanks we

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.290 
okay so there we go full fuel tanks we
could<00:03:48.020> peel<00:03:48.230> off<00:03:48.440> now<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.970> carry<00:03:49.970> on<00:03:50.120> our

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
could peel off now and carry on our

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.400 
could peel off now and carry on our
journey<00:03:52.090> okay<00:03:53.090> so<00:03:53.150> we'll<00:03:53.950> engage<00:03:54.950> hyperdrive

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
journey okay so we'll engage hyperdrive

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.640 
journey okay so we'll engage hyperdrive
so<00:03:57.410> as<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.770> said<00:03:58.100> Dale<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.730> feel<00:03:59.660> scooping<00:04:00.230> it's

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
so as I said Dale you feel scooping it's

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.940
