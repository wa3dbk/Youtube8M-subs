 like such as volkswagen audi also his 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.650
 can be for example to diagnose 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.740
 russian cars cars group 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 vaz gas today we will experience

 right-hand drive toyota ist 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.450
 we connect the adapter to the diagnostic 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.969
 connector 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.500
 obd2 connector is usually located area 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.520
 ruble 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.379
 conclusion we see that the indicator is lit 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.200
 can run diagnostic 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.100
 the program will use the program 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.749
 those q3 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.170
 here the program is used for 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:51.429
 diagnostic cornering toyota nissan of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.829
 the program can free download 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.219
 on our website 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.789
 we do 327 rus dot ru go 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:04.089
 settings choose gives a internal 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:06.280
 the market first thing to get 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.550
 information about the electronic unit 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.550
 of management 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 data is being exchanged 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.740
 your program received information about 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 car, you can start to diagnose 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.490
 your real time parameters he 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.509
 let's say we add momentum 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.560
 him as the parameters begin to change with 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.689
 using programs you can read 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.729
 parameters such as temperature 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.170
 engine coolant speed 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.840
 vehicle speed lead angle 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.939
 ignition air inlet temperature 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 and so on the more to understand 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.070
 program, the more different 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:54.250
 parameters you can learn about 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.899
 car now consider the main 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.030
 The main functions of the adapter program are 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.649
 error reading engine is valid from 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 you got a light bulb check you can
