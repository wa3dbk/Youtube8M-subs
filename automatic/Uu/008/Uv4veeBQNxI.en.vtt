00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
I think that's definitely a potential

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.640 
I think that's definitely a potential
next<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.190> we<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.430> ice<00:01:03.270> blonde<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:04.140> do<00:01:04.260> really

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
next up we have ice blonde I do really

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.010 
next up we have ice blonde I do really
like<00:01:04.860> ice<00:01:05.100> blonde<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.880> compare<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> two<00:01:06.750> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
like ice blonde if you compare the two I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
like ice blonde if you compare the two I
think<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.820> with

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
think you can see that the one with

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.260 
think you can see that the one with
Holly<00:01:09.270> on<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:10.159> actually<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> lot<00:01:11.610> more<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
Holly on it is actually a lot more I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359 
Holly on it is actually a lot more I
seed<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.439> might<00:01:13.890> be<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
seed so I don't know that might be a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.690 
seed so I don't know that might be a
contender<00:01:14.869> finally<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.650> shade<00:01:16.920> ultra

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
contender finally is the shade ultra

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.570 
contender finally is the shade ultra
light<00:01:17.850> beige<00:01:18.210> blonde<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.830> immediately

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
light beige blonde I can see immediately

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820 
light beige blonde I can see immediately
that<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.110> too<00:01:22.409> yellowy

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that this one is going to be too yellowy

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.490 
that this one is going to be too yellowy
for<00:01:23.220> me<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.360> overall<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.470> is

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
for me so I think overall it is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.620 
for me so I think overall it is
definitely<00:01:26.100> between<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.490> natural<00:01:26.880> baby<00:01:27.240> blonde

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
definitely between a natural baby blonde

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.710 
definitely between a natural baby blonde
and<00:01:27.960> ice<00:01:28.350> blonde<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:30.000> not

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
and ice blonde and you know I think not

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
and ice blonde and you know I think not
just<00:01:31.020> because<00:01:31.290> Holly<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.189> face<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.970> she<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
just because Holly is my face and she is

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
just because Holly is my face and she is
on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.570> front<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.530> I'm
