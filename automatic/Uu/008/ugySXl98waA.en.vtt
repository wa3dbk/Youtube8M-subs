00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.830
 hello today we will make a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.420
 quinoa with spring vegetables 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.199
 for his fun of that he will inevitably 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.900
 40 grams per person 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:22.160
 and then spring vegetables the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.140
 flat beans for gourmet peas 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.570
 small dots of beans is 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.279
 asparagus and to accompany her a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.109
 virgin sauce made with oil 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.969
 of olive necessarily olives of kalamata 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.820
 is a little bit of garbage grass 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.890
 note either to prepare the recipe on 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 start with a quinoa c to remove 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.020
 saponin which is a substance that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.460
 is bitter and that is not good for us 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.379
 then we put it in cooking in the 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.170
 tureen of the vital isr and we shout 20 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.850
 minutes with double home at 40 g 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.460
 quinoa rebounds but 80 grams of water 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 and we cook then during this time we 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.270
 prepare the vegetables 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.290
 we cut the asper to have 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.310
 heads on one side and stems cut 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:11.970
 in small sections flat beans 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:17.729
 are cut in the mouth and the peas 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.520
 shelled and the shallot in brunoise for 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.320
 the cooking times of the asparagus 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.460
 gourmet peas and beans plates 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.310
 four minutes 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.520
 it would remain firm then the little ones 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.880
 points the small asparagus stretches and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.740
 shallots leather have two minutes 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 while all this is cooking we prepare the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.030
 sauce that will accompany the kilo to the 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.229
 sauce and a virgin sauce because 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.799
 than made with olive oil 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.000
 blank and she's really simple 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:50.180
 so kalamata olives or other 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.299
 cut into thin strips of beans is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.509
 Scottish vintage and a little bit of oil 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.509
 olive 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.740
 she adds 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300
