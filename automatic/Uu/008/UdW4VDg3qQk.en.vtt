go<00:01:22.860> ahead<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.100> slide<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.640> bolt

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
go ahead and slide it on to the bolt

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
go ahead and slide it on to the bolt
leader<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:25.110> we'll<00:01:25.259> take<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> carriage

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
leader and then we'll take the carriage

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.920 
leader and then we'll take the carriage
bolt<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.189> we'll<00:01:26.820> wrap<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> threads<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
bolt and we'll wrap the threads of the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.690 
bolt and we'll wrap the threads of the
bolt<00:01:27.990> leader<00:01:28.170> around<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.340> threads<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.670> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700

bolt leader around the threads of the
carriage<00:01:30.000> bolt<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:30.840> there<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.110> want

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
carriage bolt so from there we just want

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.330 
carriage bolt so from there we just want
to<00:01:31.320> take<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.500> other<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.829> bolt<00:01:32.040> leader<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
to take the other in the bolt leader and

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
to take the other in the bolt leader and
go<00:01:32.400> ahead<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.640> pull<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:34.229> block<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.829> carriage

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
go ahead and pull the block and carriage

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.440 
go ahead and pull the block and carriage
bolt<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:36.000> into<00:01:36.270> place<00:01:38.210> alright<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> then
