to<00:01:02.760> drive<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> display

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to drive the display

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.460 
to drive the display
so<00:01:04.440> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.550> as<00:01:05.670> well<00:01:05.940> as<00:01:06.090> USB

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
so you can think of it as well as USB

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.340 
so you can think of it as well as USB
implementing<00:01:07.610> wireless<00:01:08.610> display<00:01:08.930> as<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
implementing wireless display as you can

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.899 
implementing wireless display as you can
see<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.740> display<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> driven<00:01:11.570> from

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
see the display is driven from

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.200 
see the display is driven from
from<00:01:14.539> the<00:01:14.659> notebook<00:01:15.280> it<00:01:16.280> is<00:01:16.429> so<00:01:16.579> wireless<00:01:17.030> we

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
from the notebook it is so wireless we

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.239 
from the notebook it is so wireless we
just<00:01:17.390> have<00:01:17.560> power<00:01:18.560> connected<00:01:19.039> in<00:01:19.159> the

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:19.249 
just have power connected in the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:20.830 
just have power connected in the
background<00:01:19.670> so<00:01:19.969> as<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.240> can<00:01:20.359> see<00:01:20.509> there<00:01:20.630> is<00:01:20.719> no

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
background so as you can see there is no

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.060 
background so as you can see there is no
wires

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.750 

very<00:01:25.790> cool<00:01:26.470> so<00:01:27.470> this<00:01:27.680> is<00:01:27.710> shipping<00:01:28.100> in

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
very cool so this is shipping in

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.780 
very cool so this is shipping in
production<00:01:29.390> with<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.659> x300<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:31.159> integrated

we<00:01:35.180> might<00:01:35.360> expect<00:01:35.630> those<00:01:35.810> are<00:01:35.960> seen<00:01:36.200> for<00:01:36.560> ultra

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
we might expect those are seen for ultra

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.490 
we might expect those are seen for ultra
wideband<00:01:37.520> what<00:01:37.910> are<00:01:38.030> some<00:01:38.360> of<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.540> things<00:01:38.810> we

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
wideband what are some of the things we
