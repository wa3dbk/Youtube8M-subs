00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
happy meal and back then I didn't think

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.150

of her hair it's come harder than the
others<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:00.950> maybe<00:03:01.130> it's<00:03:01.340> because<00:03:01.489> they<00:03:01.850> were

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
others but maybe it's because they were

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.509 
others but maybe it's because they were
played<00:03:02.750> with<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.260> what<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:03.980> used<00:03:04.160> to<00:03:04.280> do<00:03:04.400> before

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.650 
it you can check it out from time to
time<00:03:26.540> but<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.170> decided<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:28.329> give<00:03:29.329> tethers

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
time but I decided to give tethers

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.539 
time but I decided to give tethers
different<00:03:30.110> which<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:30.739> I'm<00:03:30.980> doing<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.370> video

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
different which is I'm doing this video

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.930 
different which is I'm doing this video
right<00:03:31.880> now<00:03:32.060> while<00:03:32.420> I<00:03:32.600> still<00:03:32.660> have<00:03:33.200> them<00:03:33.320> all<00:03:33.500> oh
