00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170
 what 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.730
 there 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.579
 mockus 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.189
 good afternoon clear rafael conception 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.960
 some benefits of home cameras is the ability to optenet 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.259
 the images in type 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.470
 I do not have here 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.110
 in the case atenco with image 1 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.890
 what a role means is that the camera 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.870
 do not try to do the image process 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.910
 inside the camera resulting 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.510
 in a triple image 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.530
 instead 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 All the information you will do in its original way 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.930
 in this file 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 but to be able to open this image and manipulate it 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 needed 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.809
 the program that company forums chat that is called 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.680
 I saw that he tied 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.560
 we are going to use that tutorial to be able to talk a little bit about how to manipulate 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:03.260
 the picture 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.060
 inside of the bizarre 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.680
 first what they will see in the images 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.390
 is going to see another mind mind this type of camera that I suso here 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.140
 in this type, different 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 and you see all the information about the camera 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.620
 here in this area 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.080
 first what can be corrected that white liquid of the image 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.579
 here there are different modes that correspond with the modes that are seen in 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:29.540
 the camera 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.050
 Well, if a person 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.620
 who the camera marked in a vote 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.420
 who does not 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 match the d mode the scene can be automatically corrected 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.410
 with these 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.850
 when one changes effective and acha a stent 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.200
 out wide 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.319
 the only thing that is changing is the temperature and the fifth 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.630
 the picture 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.630
 let's say for example we started counting 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.370
 maintains a temperature maintains an ink when it is not changed to continue 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.290
 the temperature goes up 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.290
 which roasts the image to look a little bit more yellow 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.129
 they lined 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:13.949
 has the temperature 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:14.799
 marine 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.960
 and make it seem 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.699
 the image a little bit more blue 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.449
 but that does not mean that one can not 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.189
 adjust this manually 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.699
 and many times it's something that I try to be when I want to correct 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:27.549
 images 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.579
 are this example what I'm going to do is 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.829
 so take the temperature thymus is at the temperature a little bit 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.150
 hottest 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.540
 and do not have the image now it gets a little hotter it gets a little bit 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.399
 more yellow 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:41.830
 and the ink I want that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.979
 and that 

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:47.089
 I appear a little more red I'm just going to raise the ink a little more 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.569
 that's different from what I automatically took 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.849
 the purito added the temperature 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.480
 for this example let's start in the way that I took the picture 

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:02.779
 Beijing - I do not like it because here it seems a little yellow 

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:07.269
 can only do is I'm going to take the temperature equal to lower it a little 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.630
 so you can see this a little bit more blue 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.630
 and you remove the yellow that you see in the image 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.009
 the computer more 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:17.949
 and that is looking a little better 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.009
 Now I want to climb the red akin 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:22.369
 bad picture 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:25.129
 and of bone and ink a little bit 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.609
 notice that the colors here mean 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.609
 what is going to happen with the image 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.609
 if I take the ink well the green 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.369
 we do not want you assured albert 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.269
 it was called a bolt 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.729
 pink 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 besides being pink 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.609
 adding three ere is light 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.159
 put a little ink 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.939
 pink 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:53.909
 the next crop can be modified is the exposure of the image 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:57.189
 control here by choosing 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.189
 it goes a little bit the image gets a little bit darker 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.579
 if I upload 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.249
 the image gets a little bit more 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.499
 bright and helps when one tries to correct 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.079
 problems with image layout 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.869
 for example 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.869
 I would like the image to be like that of villosa 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:19.489
 it was not what I took 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.129
 uploading automatically 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:24.189
 fix that problem 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:28.129
 now you see another problem notice that here in this area in this area is 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:29.840
 it's turning red 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.900
 and that is letting me know 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.210
 that there is no color in these areas 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:37.930
 that can be corrected 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.770
 as the copper increasing the public orcam takes those areas 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.229
 and makes them 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.159
 to look a little better 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.770
 Siliken increase the amount 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.259
 of Shadows 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:51.540
 what's in the picture 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.879
 department of you with the feoga etc 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.430
 going up the fifth 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.870
 Notice that the shadow part 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.490
 Shines a little more 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.309
 if I want to add 

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:05.349
 shadow after this 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.270
 I can add it by uploading 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:09.779
 aldo backs 

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.020
 the clarity 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.470
 offers the option of being able to grow 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.389
 sharpest image 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.719
 see if I drop the fall layer as much detail is lost here 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.339
 and the clarity added 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:24.400
 ps with a little more sharp 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.360
 many times it's not something I like to climb a lot here 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.790
 I like it better, try to modify it 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.790
 using more important bags 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.240
 the saturation 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.379
 it's an effect that I did not like sat 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.599
 take all the colors and upload all the colors and what in the image 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.309
 and it does not look very natural 

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:48.240
 I liked better saved llorens 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.639
 go press when it does not rise 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.129
 What it does is 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.400
 analyze the image 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.480
 and says any color good 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.480
 that is already well represented the image does not change 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.419
 has a preference not to make any changes to colors that are 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.169
 skin color 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.169
 you are an effect that is very intelligent 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.610
 and functional wine to try to correct your images 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.990
 when you configure those effects 1 automatically 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:23.099
 You can save your effects 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.099
 in the option of being beings 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:35.580
 here I have 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.180
 a series sac chivos what am I going to open 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:40.229
 in formosa 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.490
 I do not have all together effects are here 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:44.979
 available 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.990
 but the benefit of being able 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:48.909
 fix 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:50.819
 many images at the same time 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:53.969
 it's something so very well powerful of 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:55.139
 aldo villanueva 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.919
 for example let's say that this is the effect that I want 

00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.180
 for the images 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.259
 if I want to 

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:03.399
 this effect on all the other images 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:05.789
 photo select all images 

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:09.210
 i without tests and healthy 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.749
 all effects 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.889
 15 in the primary image 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.490
 oppressing vote do not believe 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.029
 it automatically changes 

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:19.619
 all the images 

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:23.259
 if they want to open the image lomas injured, vote less 

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:25.059
 If they want 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:25.949
 save 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:27.369
 these changes 

00:07:27.369 --> 00:07:29.599
