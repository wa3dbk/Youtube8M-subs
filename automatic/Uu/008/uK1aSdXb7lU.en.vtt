00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.440
 So hello to all my name is Artem 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.980
 love and in this video I want to touch 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:22.300
 one hot topic is grabbing them right 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.910
 grabbing strands with your fingers when you want to cut 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.490
 explain what the error is and what it is 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:33.300
 can lead very often I meet 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.290
 next grip strands 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.290
 students who come to us on 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.510
 trainings and it happens super easy 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.739
 mega often and even were very serious 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.329
 I will not be in this video now 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.720
 ever go we must 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.480
 I'll tell you in general the situation is not 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.550
 important on which part of the head except 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.550
 perhaps kobzon and for example here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.239
 take on the temple the master comes to that 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:02.110
 places where you need to cut this area and here 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.629
 the following situation occurs here we are 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.220
 We start to introduce some kind of capture line 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.990
 the outer side of the fingers going on here 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.910
 such is the story of hop-hop after that he 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.030
 highlights there and somehow moves on 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:21.810
 it can happen here on the bottom 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:27.849
 parts of the head stand out some kind of strand 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.450
 redirected chick-chik it may also 

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:36.399
 happen it from this side for example 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.220
 given some kind of strand and chick-chick in 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:42.190
 Generally a lot of situations when such a seizure 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.709
 happens in reality it's not 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.539
 quite right but rather you can say 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:49.209
 completely wrong but that's it exactly 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.459
 teaches many teachers and students 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.979
 use this cut and now I will explain 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.380
 why is it wrong i recommend it 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:03.070
 replace here with such a cut for such 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 capture when you work like this 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.149
 why because if you remember that in 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.780
 the structure of the haircut there are several concepts 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.760
 parting the zone quickdraw distribution and there 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.420
 cut lines 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:22.090
 for example, I need to endure 90 degrees 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.030
 delay the 90 degree distribution i 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.709
 combing the pores not hiding I hold 90 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.170
 degrees quickdraw 90 degrees 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.330
 distribution for example I would like 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.270
 here take a 45 degree delay and keep 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.220
 braces 45 degrees and i'm facing 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:41.050
 strands and can control my 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.270
 well controls your strand and 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.010
 see the result of their work very 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.130
 well I'm here inside of 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.480
 fingers can so controls the cut line 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.900
 will it really be parallel 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.989
 half or I will have to increase 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.989
 or decrease 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.820
 it turns out that I work visually drive 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 in this performance 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.870
 I am not very well controlled 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.840
 delay and distribution why 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.650
 that by and large I fall into 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.170
 blind zone all my whole my situation under 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.180
 root and it turns out that I was there for days 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.720
 control whether u really 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:26.019
 I did not succeed at that moment 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.650
 redirection i.e. it turns out 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.870
 extra strong load that me 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.630
 you need to increase your control and 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.329
 Here I have to rely here 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.720
 eyes and you know what if with two 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.739
 the parties I get unequally 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.239
 unequal hard not the same 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.760
 distribution is the result of me 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.530
 It turns out completely different very often 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.150
 there is such a situation that comes 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.989
 new client and she has a little 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.640
 differently tonsured from different sides and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.700
 even for example 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.630
 heifers or differently there lies or 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.620
 fit 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.420
 and it is increasingly that person 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.310
 which he cuts like this 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.500
 relies 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.150
 intuitive here is intuition but 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.660
 if you want to achieve good 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.030
 results and great results 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:20.620
 work fast then just you need 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.810
 change the grip and work so when you 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.970
 when you don't hit anything blind 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.640
 zone and when you see specifically what you 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.830
 make the biggest problems on 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.720
 seminars occur in students 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.730
 precisely because of what is wrong 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.550
 wrong hands 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.320
 staging 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.020
 relative to the client with this 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.780
 the biggest trouble happens if this 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.640
 establish the situation as an example here, we have 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.730
 we even have a special block when we 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.490
 we put our hands then the results are sharp 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.890
 grows better 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.910
 haircut becomes faster haircut 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.810
 performed 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.550
 and and many say that here yes yes yes to us 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.040
 not telling explained why and 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.290
 chock pilots look then next 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.630
 since it is quite possible that 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.450
 redirect to yourself either you or 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.430
 don't you keep stretching there and cut here 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.530
 it is also difficult to control 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.390
 exception for example i work in tucson 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.130
 Yes, and I am here of course with me and 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.780
 restaurants finger but already work not 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.460
 logical but on the other hand if you 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.460
 working in other zones then 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.690
 also not recommended work hope 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.610
 you will think about something and your 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:35.890
 Results will also become better is what I 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.190
 I wanted to say and now I say goodbye 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.190
 until
