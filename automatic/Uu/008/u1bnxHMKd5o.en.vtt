Texas heat and then also root stocks
that<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:44.760> for<00:00:44.789> our<00:00:45.000> soils<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
that are good for our soils we have a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
that are good for our soils we have a
lot<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.280> calcium<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.399> our<00:00:47.460> souls<00:00:47.700> from<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:48.000> the

lot of calcium in our souls from all the

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.760 
lot of calcium in our souls from all the
limestone<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.079> there<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
limestone out here so there are a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
limestone out here so there are a
rootstock<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.730> like<00:00:50.850> calcium<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
grapes are going to struggle and

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
grapes are going to struggle and
possibly<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.460> dying<00:00:53.699> also<00:00:54.090> took<00:00:54.149> into

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
possibly is dying also took into

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.040 
possibly is dying also took into
consideration<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:56.239> late<00:00:57.239> freezes<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.930> we

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
consideration the late freezes that we

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.470 
consideration the late freezes that we
always<00:00:58.199> have<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.770> Texas<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.420> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
always have here in Texas so you want to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.720 
always have here in Texas so you want to
have<00:01:00.600> late<00:01:00.809> bloomers<00:01:01.260> some<00:01:02.160> varietals<00:01:02.579> can

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
have late bloomers some varietals can

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.030 
have late bloomers some varietals can
blow<00:01:02.940> them<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.409> three<00:01:04.409> weeks<00:01:04.619> earlier<00:01:05.010> than

some others and three weeks can mean all
the<00:01:07.830> difference<00:01:08.100> between<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> good<00:01:08.850> harvest

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the difference between a good harvest

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.109 
the difference between a good harvest

area for eight years and every year was

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.620 
area for eight years and every year was
drastically<00:01:49.520> different<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.090> mean<00:01:50.300> we<00:01:50.510> had<00:01:50.600> a

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
challenge nonetheless the rain is

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.860 
challenge nonetheless the rain is
actually<00:01:57.350> problematic<00:01:58.510> we<00:01:59.510> have<00:01:59.690> high

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
actually problematic we have high

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.170 
actually problematic we have high
humidity<00:02:00.200> here<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:01.070> when<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:01.790> get<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:01.970> big

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
humidity here so when you get a big

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.110 
humidity here so when you get a big
canopy<00:02:02.480> and<00:02:02.750> your<00:02:02.900> vines<00:02:03.110> are<00:02:03.670> big<00:02:04.670> full<00:02:04.940> and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
canopy and your vines are big full and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.360 
canopy and your vines are big full and
beautiful<00:02:05.210> that<00:02:06.020> area<00:02:06.380> in<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:06.770> canopy<00:02:07.100> is<00:02:07.340> a

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
beautiful that area in the canopy is a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.340 
beautiful that area in the canopy is a
perfect<00:02:07.820> environment<00:02:07.940> for<00:02:08.390> growing<00:02:08.810> molds

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
perfect environment for growing molds

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.370 
perfect environment for growing molds
and<00:02:09.470> all<00:02:10.010> kinds<00:02:10.340> of<00:02:10.369> other<00:02:10.460> stuff<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.230> have

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and all kinds of other stuff so you have

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.780 
and all kinds of other stuff so you have
to<00:02:12.500> get<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.770> there<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.310> cut<00:02:13.610> that

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
to get in there you have to cut that

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.180 
to get in there you have to cut that
canopy<00:02:14.750> back<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.350> idea<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.860> make<00:02:16.160> sure

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
canopy back the idea is to make sure

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.680 
canopy back the idea is to make sure
that<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.670> that<00:02:16.820> breeze<00:02:17.030> picks<00:02:17.330> up<00:02:17.510> after

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
that when that breeze picks up after

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.290 
that when that breeze picks up after
that<00:02:17.930> rain<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:19.100> will<00:02:19.280> blow<00:02:19.850> through<00:02:20.120> your

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
that rain it will blow through your

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.170 
that rain it will blow through your
vineyard<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.840> dry<00:02:21.560> everything<00:02:21.800> out

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
vineyard and dry everything out

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.250 
vineyard and dry everything out
everything<00:02:23.180> is<00:02:23.330> hand-picked<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:23.959> don't<00:02:24.140> use

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
everything is hand-picked we don't use

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.740 
everything is hand-picked we don't use
any<00:02:24.410> mechanical<00:02:24.620> harvesting<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.580> we<00:02:26.390> start

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
