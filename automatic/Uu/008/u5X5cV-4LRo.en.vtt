00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
new phone and all the capability that we

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.230 
new phone and all the capability that we
we<00:02:24.380> needed<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.800> manage<00:02:25.040> space<00:02:25.580> inside<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.840 
we needed to manage space inside the
phone<00:02:26.450> very<00:02:26.870> carefully<00:02:27.530> we've<00:02:28.160> created<00:02:28.460> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
phone very carefully we've created the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.850 
phone very carefully we've created the
new<00:02:28.880> much<00:02:29.510> smaller<00:02:29.960> lightning<00:02:30.440> connector

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
new much smaller lightning connector

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.550 
new much smaller lightning connector
it's<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:31.880> digital<00:02:32.420> so<00:02:32.600> it's<00:02:32.990> designed<00:02:33.200> for

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:33.710> uses<00:02:34.280> and<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.390> made<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.720> reversible

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.000 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.860> fits<00:02:37.100> either<00:02:37.370> way<00:02:38.110> we<00:02:39.110> also<00:02:39.320> moved<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.890> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so it fits either way we also moved to a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.880 
so it fits either way we also moved to a
sapphire<00:02:40.100> lens<00:02:40.970> cover<00:02:41.450> which<00:02:42.050> is<00:02:42.080> thinner<00:02:42.230> and
