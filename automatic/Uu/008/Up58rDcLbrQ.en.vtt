00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.189 
pretty much two hooks in one this is
especially<00:00:59.520> important<00:01:00.120> for<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.719> bats<00:01:00.989> are

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
especially important for when bats are

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
especially important for when bats are
not<00:01:01.320> fully<00:01:01.620> committed<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.879> never<00:01:03.030> know

tape<00:01:11.430> frog<00:01:11.670> Lee<00:01:12.260> what's<00:01:13.260> so<00:01:13.409> unique<00:01:13.590> about<00:01:13.830> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
tape frog Lee what's so unique about the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.359 
tape frog Lee what's so unique about the
scope<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.540> puts<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.990> hook<00:01:16.590> on<00:01:16.740> both

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
scope is that it puts a hook on both

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
scope is that it puts a hook on both
sides<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> Frog<00:01:18.299> like<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:20.960> whenever

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
sides of the Frog like so now whenever

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719 
sides of the Frog like so now whenever
the<00:01:22.350> hooks<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.100> there's<00:01:23.369> one<00:01:23.610> on

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
the hooks are like that there's one on

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.630 
the hooks are like that there's one on
both<00:01:23.880> sides<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> bass<00:01:25.229> comes<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.710> two

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
both sides so when a bass comes up two

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
both sides so when a bass comes up two
short<00:01:26.880> strike<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.750> necessary<00:01:28.290> shorts

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
short strike or not necessary shorts

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.780 
short strike or not necessary shorts
right<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:28.890> when<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.100> just<00:01:29.250> slaps<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.700> from

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
right but when it just slaps at it from

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.490 
right but when it just slaps at it from
the<00:01:29.880> side<00:01:30.030> has<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> really<00:01:30.930> good<00:01:31.020> chance<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the side has a really good chance of

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.899 
the side has a really good chance of
getting<00:01:31.979> one<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.130> these<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.460> hooks

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
getting one of these two hooks

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.420 
getting one of these two hooks
whereas<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> had<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> single<00:01:34.680> hook<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
whereas if you had a single hook you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.710 
whereas if you had a single hook you
would<00:01:35.549> pretty<00:01:35.729> much<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.210> one<00:01:36.509> bar

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
would pretty much just have one bar

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.200 
would pretty much just have one bar
right<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> middle<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.759> back<00:01:38.909> them<00:01:39.150> up

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
right in the middle and to back them up

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
right in the middle and to back them up
kind<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.479> slide<00:01:39.689> at<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:40.320> bar<00:01:40.500> right<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
kind of slide at that one bar right in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.639 
kind of slide at that one bar right in
the<00:01:40.890> middle<00:01:41.100> would<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.790> less<00:01:42.119> likely<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
the middle would be less likely to

this<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.939> important<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.540> one<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
this is really important for one the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.240 
this is really important for one the
bass<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.649> bit<00:01:52.740> finicky<00:01:52.920> and

bass are you a little bit finicky and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.560 
bass are you a little bit finicky and
they're<00:01:53.430> not<00:01:53.520> fully<00:01:53.820> committed<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.240> your<00:01:54.360> bait

they're not fully committed to your bait
but<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.619> usually<00:01:56.009> use<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.579> anyway<00:01:57.000> because

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
but I usually use these anyway because

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.359 
but I usually use these anyway because
you<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.439> twice<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.710> chance<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.100> hooking<00:01:59.159> the

you have twice the chance of hooking the
fish<00:01:59.549> pretty<00:01:59.729> much<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.990> believe<00:02:01.409> they

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
fish pretty much and I believe they

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.830 
fish pretty much and I believe they
don't<00:02:01.710> tear<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:01.979> your<00:02:02.009> lures<00:02:02.310> fast<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.630> rod

the<00:02:43.000> reason<00:02:43.270> I<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.830> medium<00:02:44.830> heavy<00:02:44.980> is

the reason I like this medium heavy is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.190 
the reason I like this medium heavy is
because<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.790> can<00:02:45.910> catch<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.150> lot<00:02:46.300> further<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.810> I

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
because I can catch a lot further and I

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.780 
because I can catch a lot further and I
use<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> lighter<00:02:47.650> line<00:02:47.890> because<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.430> usually

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
use the lighter line because I usually

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.610 
use the lighter line because I usually
only<00:02:48.910> use<00:02:49.209> this<00:02:49.390> around<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.290> little<00:02:50.320> bit

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
only use this around a little bit

only use this around a little bit

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.319 

as<00:04:04.870> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.379> see<00:04:05.590> here<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.849> fish<00:04:07.030> got<00:04:07.239> me

tangled<00:04:07.480> up<00:04:07.780> in<00:04:08.349> the<00:04:08.500> grass<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.890> I

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
tangled up in the grass and I

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.160 
tangled up in the grass and I
immediately<00:04:09.069> realized<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.670> so<00:04:10.390> it's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
immediately realized that so it's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.199 
immediately realized that so it's
important<00:04:11.680> to<00:04:11.709> remember<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:12.849> whenever<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
important to remember that whenever a

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.209 
important to remember that whenever a
fish<00:04:13.420> tangles<00:04:14.019> you<00:04:14.109> up<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.890> have<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.040> better

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:15.219 
fish tangles you up you have a better

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.140 
fish tangles you up you have a better
chance<00:04:15.459> at<00:04:15.579> getting<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.790> fish<00:04:16.000> out

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
chance at getting the fish out

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.689 
chance at getting the fish out
especially<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.810> light<00:04:16.989> line<00:04:17.169> if<00:04:18.009> you<00:04:18.190> if<00:04:18.549> you

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
especially the light line if you if you

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.909 
especially the light line if you if you
hold<00:04:19.030> your<00:04:19.209> line<00:04:19.389> tight<00:04:19.709> don't<00:04:20.709> give<00:04:20.799> them<00:04:20.859> any

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
hold your line tight don't give them any

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.290 
hold your line tight don't give them any
slack<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.430> they're<00:04:21.519> just<00:04:21.639> going<00:04:21.820> after<00:04:22.180> them

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
slack and they're just going after them

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.110 
slack and they're just going after them
if<00:04:23.020> you're<00:04:23.229> fishing<00:04:23.410> thicker<00:04:23.740> line<00:04:24.030> most<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
if you're fishing thicker line most of

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.909 
if you're fishing thicker line most of
the<00:04:25.210> time<00:04:25.389> I<00:04:25.660> would<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.259> especially<00:04:26.560> in<00:04:26.740> grass

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
the time I would and especially in grass

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.830 
the time I would and especially in grass
this<00:04:27.130> then<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.610> would<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.360> just<00:04:28.539> pulled<00:04:28.720> them

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
this then I would have just pulled them

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.980 
this then I would have just pulled them
out<00:04:28.900> but<00:04:29.680> it<00:04:30.340> also<00:04:30.699> applies<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.060> thick<00:04:31.419> line<00:04:31.660> if

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
out but it also applies a thick line if

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.090 
out but it also applies a thick line if
you're<00:04:32.110> fishing<00:04:32.289> around<00:04:32.590> like<00:04:32.710> wood<00:04:32.949> and
