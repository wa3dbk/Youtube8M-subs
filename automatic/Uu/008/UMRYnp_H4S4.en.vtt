because i love Transformers Prime it's

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.700 
because i love Transformers Prime it's
one<00:02:30.310> my<00:02:30.460> favorite<00:02:30.850> series<00:02:31.120> however<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.380> comes

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
one my favorite series however it comes

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.190 
one my favorite series however it comes
down<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.550> believe<00:02:34.060> that<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.870> fake

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
down to it I believe that this is fake

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.100 
down to it I believe that this is fake
so<00:02:36.070> if<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.400> hear<00:02:36.640> about<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:37.090> don't<00:02:37.630> believe<00:02:37.930> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
so if you hear about it don't believe it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.110 
so if you hear about it don't believe it
because<00:02:38.790> again<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.090> fake<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:41.260> was<00:02:41.820> at<00:02:42.820> least

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
because again it's fake it was at least

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300 
because again it's fake it was at least
that's<00:02:43.450> why<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.660> believe<00:02:43.930> if<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.650> real<00:02:44.950> then

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
that's why I believe if it is real then

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.670 
that's why I believe if it is real then
it<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.880> real<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:47.160> got<00:02:48.160> it<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.750> anyways<00:02:50.440> that
