00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 how are you seeing this call 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.760
 You were in Afa also programs like 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.710
 parents this is your first preseason 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.230
 formal for formal and well I'm very 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.260
 happy is like living a dream 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.990
 be with players like like 3 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.779
 follow and put a couple more 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.169
 and for me it is like proud with me 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.480
 very cultural very calm you learn from 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.680
 they talk with them looks good 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.410
 also those that are in your exhibition 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.820
 as maidana as soon as they influence your 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.860
 growth the fact of sharing the 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.910
 plan with them and around around 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.800
 the practices 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.920
 sometimes players approach me like 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:51.699
 poncio lobo ledesma which like them 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.820
 because they see that there are some things that you 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.129
 they are going to correct but they come closer 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.400
 not with the intention of challenging me but with 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.500
 the intention to guide me and for me that 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.900
 it's very rewarding though expectations 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.479
 take on this preseason 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.909
 I guess you know it's hard to have 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.250
 many names over but fight it 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.119
 I imagine with the illusion of being able to reach 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.180
 debut if equal my great expectation of 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.610
 challenge me 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.470
 let's say on the campus first to have 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.300
 good performance during the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.840
 workouts the practices go 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.960
 growing and progressing and then god 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.470
 He will say the same, I do not have much trouble in 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.900
 let say 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:39.940
 debut or play for me is better 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 begin to correct some errors 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.000
 story I have to correct or things like that 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.950
 so that the day I get to be 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.600
 with all the conditions how much do you think 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.670
 that influenced the fact of good 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.010
 performance you had in Peru be 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.040
 champion of the liberators sub-20 and for 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.480
 me who was a big fan helped me 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.150
 Too much to have had a good performance 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.560
 in the cope freedom as they lived it 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:07.840
 how was this contest and was for the 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.050
 group was very rewarding 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.410
 let's say we were like the base of the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.900
 selective reservation and we already had more or 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.790
 less than a year without competition 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.060
 official on the issue that on river 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.920
 I was in the second division and everything is and 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.220
 when the tournament came and all this 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.610
 we face with much decision and 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.830
 We wanted to win it, we united a lot as 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 group and 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.220
 it was seen in the result of the 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.460
 preseason with who is and is 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.290
 concentrated in emirates 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.120
 with in the interim mateos clan editor is not 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.920
 imagine if he played with me in fifth and 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.050
 later I was also violent 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.970
 elective reserve and we have good 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.440
 relationship they could talk to almeyda 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.630
 with some member of the technical staff 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
 in the face of what comes a tournament that goes 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.630
 to be difficult they have to add 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.480
 points because good shriver also 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.530
 start with a complicated situation if 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.020
 there are several 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.560
 several people from the coaching staff more 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.720
 that everything to advise us yes 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.770
 to tell us how we have to do the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.770
 things very quiet 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.629
 with much desire because not always the 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.500
 genders below we come with many 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.500
 desire to face 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.510
 Thank you
