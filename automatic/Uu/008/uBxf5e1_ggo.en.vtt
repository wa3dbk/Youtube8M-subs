00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
store and will be around 60 euros it's a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.459 
store and will be around 60 euros it's a
very<00:00:11.280> boring<00:00:11.849> grey<00:00:12.450> box<00:00:12.809> you'll<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
very boring grey box you'll have to

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.620 
very boring grey box you'll have to
really<00:00:13.710> look<00:00:13.889> for<00:00:13.950> it<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.910> what<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.480> this

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
really look for it but what is this

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.410 
really look for it but what is this
thing<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.160> glorified<00:00:17.420> Wi-Fi

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
thing it is basically a glorified Wi-Fi

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.710 
thing it is basically a glorified Wi-Fi
dongle<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.230> one<00:00:19.439> end<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.740> have<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.100> HDMI

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
dongle so on one end you have here HDMI

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.210 
dongle so on one end you have here HDMI
plug<00:00:21.720> tingey<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:22.500> there's<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.769> cable<00:00:22.980> going

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
plug tingey then there's a cable going

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.849 
plug tingey then there's a cable going
out<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.670> USB<00:00:24.060> because<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.960> some<00:00:25.380> reason<00:00:25.410> it

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
out for USB because for some reason it

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
out for USB because for some reason it
doesn't<00:00:26.070> support<00:00:26.430> MHL<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.689> would<00:00:27.900> then

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
doesn't support MHL which would then

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.779 
doesn't support MHL which would then
mean<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> don't<00:00:28.830> need<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> USB<00:00:29.490> cable

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
mean that you don't need the USB cable

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.640 
mean that you don't need the USB cable
and<00:00:30.060> you'll<00:00:30.179> have<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> free<00:00:30.660> port<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.170> right

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and you'll have a free port but right

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.130 
and you'll have a free port but right
now<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> USB<00:00:32.279> cable<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.790> needed<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.510> powering

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
now the USB cable is needed for powering

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.700 
now the USB cable is needed for powering
the<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.190> Wi-Fi<00:00:36.059> stick<00:00:36.360> which<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> also<00:00:36.840> an

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the little Wi-Fi stick which is also an

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.310 
the little Wi-Fi stick which is also an
HDMI<00:00:38.219> stick<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:38.940> what<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.780> thing<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
HDMI stick so what is this thing it is

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.910 
HDMI stick so what is this thing it is
basically<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.040> 60<00:00:41.640> euro<00:00:41.850> HDMI<00:00:42.719> cable<00:00:43.170> without

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
basically a 60 euro HDMI cable without

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.580 
basically a 60 euro HDMI cable without
the<00:00:44.100> HDMI<00:00:44.690> that's<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.170> how<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.320> should

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
the right as usual and then you can just

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.980 
the right as usual and then you can just
say<00:01:19.220> connect<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.640> an<00:01:21.090> external<00:01:21.600> display

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
say connect to an external display

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.359 
say connect to an external display
it'll<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.380> treat<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.340> normal

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it'll just treat it like a normal

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.740 
it'll just treat it like a normal
display<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.450> all<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
display so you have all the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.469 
display so you have all the
functionality<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.799> normal<00:01:26.280> display<00:01:26.549> which

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
functionality of a normal display which

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.020 
functionality of a normal display which
is<00:01:27.509> pretty<00:01:28.110> cool<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.820> short

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
is pretty cool then there's the short

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
is pretty cool then there's the short
blackout<00:01:30.450> moment<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> then<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> can<00:01:31.590> see

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
blackout moment and then as you can see

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
blackout moment and then as you can see
it<00:01:31.950> goes<00:01:32.159> letterboxing<00:01:32.880> because<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.869> surface

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
it goes letterboxing because the surface

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
it goes letterboxing because the surface
pro<00:01:34.439> has<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> different<00:01:35.070> aspect<00:01:35.310> ratio<00:01:35.909> than<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
pro has a different aspect ratio than a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.719 
pro has a different aspect ratio than a
normal<00:01:36.659> monitor<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.920> come<00:01:38.280> home<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
normal monitor and so you come home and

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.410 
normal monitor and so you come home and
you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.060> continue<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.869> watch<00:01:40.020> your<00:01:40.259> content

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
you can continue to watch your content

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.960 
you can continue to watch your content
right<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.899> duplicate<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.820> you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
right now it's on duplicate so if you

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
right now it's on duplicate so if you
need<00:01:45.149> an<00:01:45.270> idea<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> how<00:01:45.840> much<00:01:45.990> lag<00:01:46.290> there<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
need an idea of how much lag there is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.210 
need an idea of how much lag there is
guys<00:01:47.329> it's<00:01:48.329> fairly<00:01:48.810> okay<00:01:49.380> this<00:01:49.590> lag<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.070> this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
guys it's fairly okay this lag on this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.710 
guys it's fairly okay this lag on this
thing<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.820> wouldn't<00:01:51.240> recommend<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.659> for

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
thing so I wouldn't recommend it for

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.230 
thing so I wouldn't recommend it for
gaming<00:01:52.079> obviously<00:01:52.950> because<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.060> some

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
gaming obviously because there is some

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.920 
gaming obviously because there is some
compression<00:01:55.490> but<00:01:56.490> image<00:01:57.210> quality<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.719> still

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
compression but image quality is still

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.469 
compression but image quality is still
pretty<00:01:58.290> good<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.850> would<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.119> use<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.450> for

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
pretty good so what would you use it for

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.780 
pretty good so what would you use it for
well<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.829> took<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.189> pictures<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
well you just took some pictures the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.359 
well you just took some pictures the
pictures<00:02:02.820> are<00:02:03.329> still<00:02:03.570> on<00:02:03.719> your<00:02:03.869> phone<00:02:04.369> you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
if you're something I have to do I have

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.750

to<00:02:24.550> take<00:02:24.730> some<00:02:24.910> pictures<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:26.340> then<00:02:27.340> the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
to take some pictures and then the

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.000 
to take some pictures and then the
client<00:02:28.239> which<00:02:28.390> was<00:02:28.569> basically<00:02:28.989> just<00:02:29.470> my<00:02:29.620> my

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
client which was basically just my my

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.009 
client which was basically just my my
aunt<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> uncle<00:02:30.700> they<00:02:30.849> wanted<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.660> see<00:02:31.840> them

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
also use it for for example would be

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.660 
also use it for for example would be
codecs<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.480> aren't<00:02:46.810> supported<00:02:47.670> usually

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
if you go with an A in one system like I

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.960 
if you go with an A in one system like I
did<00:03:01.269> some<00:03:01.420> time<00:03:01.630> ago<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.680> this<00:03:03.130> basically

did some time ago and this basically

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.690 
did some time ago and this basically
means<00:03:04.239> that's<00:03:04.540> no<00:03:04.750> longer<00:03:05.079> necessary<00:03:05.620> so<00:03:06.040> yeah
