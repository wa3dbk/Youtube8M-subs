00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 How did hamburgers come in? I went to two large Facebook pages . 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.450
 Oh, one year assignment can be found at any time, without regard to 365 one hour 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.450
 The secret of catching people's tastes, 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.450
 on 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.350
 We first decided to observe the cooking process and the hygiene environment of happiness. 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 The kitchen 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.980
 A fryer filled with dirty oil is noticeable 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.030
 Of course , when will I receive it now? 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 Ah today 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:53.510
 Put the prepared paper with your quick hands 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.240
 Then wipe off for a Growing naturally fell into bread as a source 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.240
 Pack 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.240
 U 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.260
 ode 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.409
 Oh , the hamburger cooking time that the 10th branch aims at is 25 seconds 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.020
 Make'll have just 25 seconds or less 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.990
 What about the sanitary condition of a petty cooker? 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.990
 d suggests that it is a method of baking with a pentru compressor 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.970
 Oh Oo Yeo 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:29.550
 Oh you guys got it and you got a lot of oil 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:35.180
 This towel-loaded tool is used again for baking patties 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 The ducks in this kitchen do not seem to be hygienically managed. 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.170
 Another Fes Pier 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.800
 It is crowded with many people. 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.180
 I can see the origin and nutrient checks. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.479
 But you can find a description of what the hamburger is going in. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.479
 There is not 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:01.610
 So what about hygiene? We decided to watch this a little more . 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.010
 I went into the kitchen. 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.950
 The two kitchens do not look much different from other stores. 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.950
 The hammers of the ham irrational staff are busy moving 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.630
 There is so much dirty oil that you do not know when you went. 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:27.440
 Yes , you are affordable. Yes. 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:31.460
 Watched the look Petit forces appeared to burn 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:36.770
 It is naturally impossible to put a battle on the 5th squad. 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.990
 How to burn directly from the fire. 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.760
 Fall 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.740
 U 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.740
 Why is there no problem with trace hygiene that has not been cleaned for a long time ? 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.740
 5 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.920
 The bizarre betrayal of Betty's customer leases and white flakes 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.920
 It's messy.
