oh<00:00:18.680> yeah<00:00:19.680> I'll<00:00:19.949> try<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.279> really<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.420> book<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
oh yeah I'll try to really the book is I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.910 
oh yeah I'll try to really the book is I
would<00:00:22.769> say<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:24.289> diagnosis<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> human

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
would say it's a diagnosis of the human

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.580 
would say it's a diagnosis of the human
condition<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.580> an<00:00:26.730> overview<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.380> how<00:00:28.380> we've

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
condition it's an overview of how we've

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250 
condition it's an overview of how we've
ended<00:00:28.890> up<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.460> situation<00:00:29.670> we're<00:00:30.210> in<00:00:30.260> looks

ended up in the situation we're in looks

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.590 
ended up in the situation we're in looks
at<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.560> origins<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.520> looks<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> current

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
state of mind and why we behave in such

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:49.580 
state of mind and why we behave in such
a<00:00:38.640> self-destructive<00:00:39.420> way<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> central

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a self-destructive way it is a central

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.160 
a self-destructive way it is a central
part<00:00:49.829> of<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.190> put<00:00:50.850> together<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.480> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
part of what I put together and it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
part of what I put together and it
initially<00:00:52.890> sounds<00:00:53.160> quite<00:00:53.340> familiar<00:00:53.520> because

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
initially sounds quite familiar because

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.700 
initially sounds quite familiar because
it's<00:00:54.059> been<00:00:54.210> talked<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.719> lot<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.140> 20<00:00:55.469> 30

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
it's been talked about a lot for 20 30

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.500 
it's been talked about a lot for 20 30
40<00:00:56.070> years<00:00:56.129> left<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.850> brain<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
40 years left and right brain and it's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
40 years left and right brain and it's
often<00:00:57.840> being<00:00:57.989> seen<00:00:58.289> as<00:00:58.500> overly<00:00:59.070> simplified

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
often being seen as overly simplified

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.849 
often being seen as overly simplified
and<00:00:59.910> so<00:01:00.090> on<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.420> I've<00:01:00.930> looked<00:01:01.140> again<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
and so on but I've looked again at the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.740 
and so on but I've looked again at the
information<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.789> actually<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.390> there's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
information and actually I think there's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.200 
information and actually I think there's
something<00:01:04.339> shockingly<00:01:05.339> obvious<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.030> been

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
something shockingly obvious it's been

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.789 
something shockingly obvious it's been
missed<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.689> everybody<00:01:07.020> including<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
missed by everybody including the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.310 
missed by everybody including the
researchers<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> field<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:10.080> sort<00:01:10.290> of

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
researchers in the field and it sort of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.039 
researchers in the field and it sort of
goes<00:01:10.470> along<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> lines<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.460> one<00:01:12.450> side<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
goes along the lines of one side of a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.219 
goes along the lines of one side of a
brain<00:01:14.000> no<00:01:15.000> longer<00:01:15.060> develops<00:01:15.720> its<00:01:16.020> full

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
brain no longer develops its full

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.230 
brain no longer develops its full
function<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.040> quite<00:01:17.610> limited<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.180> its

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
function it's quite limited in its

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.320 
function it's quite limited in its
perceptual<00:01:18.780> abilities<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.860> its<00:01:20.640> behaviors

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
perceptual abilities and its behaviors

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810 
perceptual abilities and its behaviors
quite<00:01:21.659> apparent<00:01:22.229> it's<00:01:22.650> sort<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.640> very

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
quite apparent it's sort of it's very

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.780 
quite apparent it's sort of it's very
frightened<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.479> very<00:01:24.689> deluded<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
frightened it's very deluded and

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.569 
frightened it's very deluded and
paradoxically<00:01:26.790> it's<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> control<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.579> what

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
paradoxically it's in control so what

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.249 
paradoxically it's in control so what
I'm<00:01:29.700> suggesting<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.360> we've<00:01:30.750> ended<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
I'm suggesting is we've ended up in a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
I'm suggesting is we've ended up in a
situation<00:01:31.409> where<00:01:32.030> we<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.240> very<00:01:33.810> eminent

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
situation where we have very eminent

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.069 
situation where we have very eminent
researchers<00:01:34.740> who've<00:01:34.890> looked<00:01:35.130> into<00:01:35.430> these

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
researchers who've looked into these

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.240 
researchers who've looked into these
apparently<00:01:37.079> different<00:01:37.290> abilities<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
apparently different abilities and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.460 
apparently different abilities and
they've<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.090> entirely<00:01:39.509> forgotten<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.320> they

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
they've all entirely forgotten that they

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.620 
they've all entirely forgotten that they
actually<00:01:40.619> have<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.400> left<00:01:41.729> brain<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.150> well<00:01:42.329> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
actually have a left brain as well and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.499 
actually have a left brain as well and
because<00:01:42.960> it's<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.229> charge<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.920> come<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.280> with

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
because it's in charge it's come up with

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.179 
because it's in charge it's come up with
conclusions<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.689> bear<00:01:45.899> no<00:01:46.140> resemblance<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
conclusions that bear no resemblance to

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.030 
conclusions that bear no resemblance to
the<00:01:47.399> data<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:49.140> we've<00:01:49.290> got<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.560> effect<00:01:49.860> is

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the data so what we've got in effect is

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.469 
the data so what we've got in effect is
the<00:01:50.159> side<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> brain<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.030> isn't<00:01:51.329> very

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the side of a brain that isn't very

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.660 
the side of a brain that isn't very
functional<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.049> all<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.829> in<00:01:53.040> charge<00:01:53.340> and

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
functional at all it's in charge and

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.160 
functional at all it's in charge and
it's<00:01:53.790> writing<00:01:54.149> all<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.540> conclusions

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
it's writing all the conclusions

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.319 
it's writing all the conclusions
interpreting<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.040> data<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:56.969> missed

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
interpreting all the data and we missed

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.090 
interpreting all the data and we missed
something<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.960> was<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.590> extremely

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
something that was really extremely

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.410 
something that was really extremely
obvious

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.370 

my<00:02:03.420> brain<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.780> also<00:02:04.290> referred<00:02:04.740> to

simplistically I mean there is a whole

simplistically I mean there is a whole

the left side of our brain what we call

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
long time his his research I think is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.170

excellent his data is excellent however
when<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.540> look<00:03:24.690> at<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.050> data<00:03:25.430> it's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
when you look at the data it's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.120 
when you look at the data it's
effectively<00:03:27.120> warning<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.050> to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.350> very<00:03:28.769> very

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
effectively warning you to be very very

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.670 
effectively warning you to be very very
wary<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.790> conclusions<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:31.019> he<00:03:31.410> has

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
wary of the conclusions because he has

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440 
wary of the conclusions because he has
the<00:03:32.010> same<00:03:32.220> piece<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.550> neural<00:03:33.000> equipment

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the same piece of neural equipment

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.540 
the same piece of neural equipment
Planets<00:03:33.959> his<00:03:34.290> left<00:03:34.560> brain<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:35.010> making<00:03:35.430> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
Planets his left brain is making the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.259 
Planets his left brain is making the
conclusions

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
conclusions

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.030 
conclusions
so<00:03:37.820> really<00:03:38.959> reframe<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.200> left-right<00:03:40.680> brain

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
so really reframe the left-right brain

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.040 
so really reframe the left-right brain
theories<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:41.940> ideas<00:03:42.090> look<00:03:42.750> at<00:03:42.900> them

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
theories and ideas look at them

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.320 
theories and ideas look at them
differently<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.769> remember<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.760> also<00:03:44.940> have<00:03:45.300> a

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
differently and remember you also have a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.810 
differently and remember you also have a
left<00:03:45.570> brain<00:03:45.810> and<00:03:46.110> it's<00:03:46.620> actually<00:03:47.280> looking<00:03:47.730> at

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
left brain and it's actually looking at

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.030 
left brain and it's actually looking at
the<00:03:47.910> data

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.160 

well<00:03:54.849> again<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.239> date<00:03:55.420> is<00:03:55.569> very<00:03:55.599> good<00:03:56.019> it

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
well again the date is very good it

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.740 
well again the date is very good it
looks<00:03:56.379> like<00:03:56.560> all<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:56.830> real<00:03:56.980> stuff<00:03:57.670> is<00:03:57.939> is

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
looks like all the real stuff is is

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.330 
looks like all the real stuff is is
somehow<00:03:59.079> linked<00:03:59.409> to<00:03:59.439> the<00:03:59.590> right<00:03:59.739> hemisphere<00:04:00.250> I

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
somehow linked to the right hemisphere I

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.190 
somehow linked to the right hemisphere I
mean<00:04:00.579> I'm<00:04:00.760> not<00:04:00.909> saying<00:04:01.239> we<00:04:01.390> are<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> brain<00:04:01.989> it's

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
mean I'm not saying we are a brain it's

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.380 
mean I'm not saying we are a brain it's
somehow<00:04:02.500> facilitates<00:04:03.310> who<00:04:03.519> we<00:04:03.670> are<00:04:03.819> that's<00:04:04.209> as

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
somehow facilitates who we are that's as

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.030 
somehow facilitates who we are that's as
much<00:04:04.480> as<00:04:04.810> much<00:04:04.989> as<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.230> can<00:04:05.290> say<00:04:05.590> on<00:04:05.739> that<00:04:05.890> but

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
much as much as I can say on that but

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.369 
much as much as I can say on that but
the<00:04:06.610> traits<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.269> behaviors<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> are

the traits the behaviors that are

a little bit better phenomenally better

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.730 
a little bit better phenomenally better
and<00:04:36.639> it's<00:04:37.210> also<00:04:37.630> very<00:04:38.080> closely<00:04:38.289> associated

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.800 
and it's also very closely associated
with<00:04:39.130> things<00:04:39.580> like<00:04:39.760> compassion<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.660> empathy

with things like compassion and empathy

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.860 
with things like compassion and empathy
and<00:04:41.440> I<00:04:42.160> propose<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.060> that's<00:04:43.240> the<00:04:43.419> Lhasa<00:04:43.630> Fez

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
and I propose it that's the Lhasa Fez

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.020 
and I propose it that's the Lhasa Fez
vestiges<00:04:44.590> of<00:04:44.710> our<00:04:44.830> sanity<00:04:45.039> that's<00:04:45.400> where<00:04:45.729> the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:53.279 
vestiges of our sanity that's where the
humanity<00:04:46.600> still<00:04:47.199> resides<00:04:50.940> well<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:51.970> think<00:04:52.289> the

humanity still resides well I think the

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.740 
humanity still resides well I think the
sort<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.530> simple<00:04:53.860> ideas<00:04:54.190> where<00:04:54.820> we<00:04:55.000> have<00:04:55.240> sort

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
sort of simple ideas where we have sort

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.840 
sort of simple ideas where we have sort

and yet there are individuals who can

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.830 
and yet there are individuals who can
they<00:05:00.370> can<00:05:00.520> be<00:05:00.610> presented<00:05:00.910> with<00:05:01.090> a<00:05:01.240> problem<00:05:01.539> and

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
they can be presented with a problem and

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.480 
they can be presented with a problem and
they<00:05:01.930> instantaneously<00:05:02.770> know<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.190> answer

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
they instantaneously know the answer

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.159 
they instantaneously know the answer
they<00:05:03.669> can<00:05:03.820> always<00:05:04.060> explain<00:05:04.419> how<00:05:04.810> they<00:05:05.020> know

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
they can always explain how they know

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.159 
they can always explain how they know
but<00:05:06.010> it's<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.580> like<00:05:06.669> a<00:05:06.849> direct<00:05:07.360> knowing<00:05:08.020> is

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
but it's it's like a direct knowing is

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.800 
but it's it's like a direct knowing is
one<00:05:08.380> way<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.620> describe<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.400> so<00:05:09.430> these<00:05:10.330> examples

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
one way to describe it so these examples

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.839 
one way to describe it so these examples
exist<00:05:11.050> in<00:05:11.380> whether<00:05:11.770> it<00:05:11.919> be<00:05:12.010> mathematics<00:05:12.669> or

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
exist in whether it be mathematics or

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.850 
exist in whether it be mathematics or
problem-solving<00:05:13.300> or<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.199> generally<00:05:14.710> what

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
problem-solving or just generally what

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.469 
problem-solving or just generally what
we<00:05:14.979> call<00:05:15.220> insight<00:05:15.729> and<00:05:15.940> intuition

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
we call insight and intuition

we call insight and intuition
remember<00:05:16.930> these<00:05:17.080> are<00:05:17.110> rational<00:05:18.070> labels<00:05:18.789> for

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
remember these are rational labels for
