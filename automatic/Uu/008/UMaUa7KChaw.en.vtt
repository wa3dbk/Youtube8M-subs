the<00:00:45.840> project<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.380> well<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.540> get<00:00:48.540> these<00:00:48.720> to

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the project as well so to get these to

the project as well so to get these to
look<00:00:49.260> nice<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.560> finished<00:00:50.070> we<00:00:50.370> need<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.149> weave

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
look nice and finished we need to weave

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.460 
look nice and finished we need to weave
them<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.610> that<00:00:54.000> they<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:54.480> integrated<00:00:55.079> into

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
them in so that they are integrated into

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.310 
them in so that they are integrated into
the<00:00:55.680> fabric<00:00:55.920> seamlessly<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.110> going<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
the fabric seamlessly so I'm going to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
the fabric seamlessly so I'm going to
show<00:00:58.469> you<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> do<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.630> now<00:01:01.760> what

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
show you how to do that right now what

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.080 
show you how to do that right now what
you're<00:01:02.910> going<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> need<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:04.670> darning<00:01:05.670> needle

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
you're going to need is a darning needle

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.230 
you're going to need is a darning needle
and<00:01:06.360> those<00:01:07.140> generally<00:01:07.740> look<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
and those generally look like this this

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.920 
and those generally look like this this
one's<00:01:09.450> plastic<00:01:09.990> they<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:11.370> metal

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
one's plastic they also come in metal

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.180 
one's plastic they also come in metal
sometimes<00:01:12.930> they're<00:01:13.170> called<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> tapestry

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
sometimes they're called a tapestry

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.530 
sometimes they're called a tapestry
needle<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.729> might<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.060> little<00:01:15.299> bend

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
needle and they might have a little bend

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.930 
needle and they might have a little bend
on<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.260> tip<00:01:16.590> they<00:01:17.159> usually<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> really

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
on the tip they usually have a really

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.510 
on the tip they usually have a really
big<00:01:18.180> eye<00:01:18.390> hole<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.440> get<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> yarn<00:01:20.130> through

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
big eye hole to get the yarn through

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.840 
big eye hole to get the yarn through
which<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.270> convenient<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:22.049> threading

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
which is really convenient for threading

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.200 
which is really convenient for threading
so<00:01:23.850> we're<00:01:24.690> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:26.280> wrong<00:01:26.909> side

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
so we're going to go to the wrong side

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.030 
so we're going to go to the wrong side
of<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:27.540> fabric<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:28.080> on<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.380> stockinette

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
of our fabric which on this stockinette

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.160 
of our fabric which on this stockinette
swatch<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.970> purl<00:01:30.240> side<00:01:30.510> of<00:01:30.750> someone<00:01:30.960> with

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
swatch is the purl side of someone with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.070 
swatch is the purl side of someone with
all<00:01:31.290> these<00:01:31.590> bumps<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:33.659> method<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> I'm

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
all these bumps and the method that I'm

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.469 
all these bumps and the method that I'm
going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.380> show<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:35.330> considered<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
going to show you is considered the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.260 
going to show you is considered the
proper<00:01:36.930> method<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.530> weaving<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.700> ends<00:01:39.060> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
proper method for weaving your ends and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.289 
proper method for weaving your ends and
it'll<00:01:39.570> keep<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.020> let<00:01:40.250> elasticity<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
it'll keep the let elasticity of the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.649 
it'll keep the let elasticity of the
fabric<00:01:42.900> while<00:01:43.320> still<00:01:43.650> securing<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:45.210> end<00:01:45.450> of

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
fabric while still securing the end of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.730 
fabric while still securing the end of
your<00:01:45.810> yarn<00:01:46.070> into<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.189> fabric<00:01:47.780> but<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:49.020> how

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
your yarn into the fabric but if how

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
your yarn into the fabric but if how
you've<00:01:50.130> been<00:01:50.310> weaving<00:01:50.580> in<00:01:50.880> your<00:01:51.060> ends<00:01:51.479> has

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
you've been weaving in your ends has

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.770 
you've been weaving in your ends has
worked<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.400> know

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
worked for you then you know

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.690 
worked for you then you know
just<00:01:54.710> keep<00:01:54.890> doing<00:01:55.040> what<00:01:55.280> you're<00:01:55.400> doing<00:01:55.460> so<00:01:57.700> if

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
just keep doing what you're doing so if

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.399 
just keep doing what you're doing so if
you<00:01:58.820> look<00:01:58.970> at<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.180> back<00:01:59.360> of<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.600> fabric<00:01:59.869> you

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
you look at the back of the fabric you

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.920 
you look at the back of the fabric you
can<00:02:00.979> see<00:02:01.280> that<00:02:01.760> we've<00:02:01.909> got<00:02:01.940> all<00:02:02.240> these<00:02:02.450> bumps

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
can see that we've got all these bumps

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.830 
can see that we've got all these bumps
and<00:02:03.080> they<00:02:03.140> kind<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.470> look<00:02:03.650> like<00:02:03.680> a<00:02:04.159> chain-link

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
and they kind of look like a chain-link

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.780 
and they kind of look like a chain-link
all<00:02:05.840> right<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:06.259> I'm<00:02:06.680> gonna<00:02:06.890> call<00:02:07.190> these<00:02:07.430> the

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
all right so I'm gonna call these the

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.690 
all right so I'm gonna call these the
top<00:02:08.060> chain<00:02:08.479> and<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.530> bottom<00:02:10.009> chain<00:02:10.340> so<00:02:10.640> you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
top chain and the bottom chain so you

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.830 
top chain and the bottom chain so you
can<00:02:10.819> see<00:02:11.030> top<00:02:11.410> bottom<00:02:12.410> top<00:02:12.980> bottom<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.480> we're

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
can see top bottom top bottom so we're

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.470 
can see top bottom top bottom so we're
going<00:02:14.989> to<00:02:15.200> go<00:02:15.410> into<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.910> first<00:02:17.470> top<00:02:18.470> chain<00:02:19.480> on

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
going to go into the first top chain on

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.479 
going to go into the first top chain on
the<00:02:20.690> back<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> fabric<00:02:21.410> we're<00:02:22.190> going<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.400> go

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
the back of the fabric we're going to go

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.410 
the back of the fabric we're going to go
up<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.090> add<00:02:23.870> an<00:02:24.080> angle<00:02:24.590> okay<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.090> we're<00:02:26.300> going

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
up and add an angle okay and we're going

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.920 
up and add an angle okay and we're going
to<00:02:26.450> go<00:02:26.600> through<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.290> bottom<00:02:27.530> chain<00:02:28.209> that's<00:02:29.209> at

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
to go through the bottom chain that's at

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.040 
to go through the bottom chain that's at
the<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.709> row<00:02:31.190> above<00:02:31.640> okay<00:02:32.510> we're<00:02:32.780> gonna<00:02:32.870> go

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
the the row above okay we're gonna go

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.960 
the the row above okay we're gonna go
just<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.530> I'm<00:02:36.620> using<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:37.010> contrasting<00:02:37.190> color

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
just and I'm using a contrasting color

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.580 
just and I'm using a contrasting color
of<00:02:38.090> yarn<00:02:38.269> just<00:02:38.870> to<00:02:38.989> make<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.230> a<00:02:39.260> little<00:02:39.380> bit

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
of yarn just to make it a little bit

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.150 
of yarn just to make it a little bit
easier<00:02:39.950> to<00:02:40.160> see<00:02:40.430> what's<00:02:41.239> going<00:02:41.569> on<00:02:41.750> while<00:02:42.530> I'm

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
easier to see what's going on while I'm

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.309 
easier to see what's going on while I'm
weaving<00:02:43.640> in<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.910> end<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:46.780> next<00:02:47.780> we're<00:02:48.110> going

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
weaving in the end so next we're going

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.770 
weaving in the end so next we're going
to<00:02:48.440> go<00:02:50.200> through<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.410> next<00:02:52.480> bottom<00:02:53.480> chain

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
to go through the next bottom chain

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.020 
to go through the next bottom chain
we're<00:02:53.959> gonna<00:02:54.050> skip<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.560> top<00:02:54.800> chain<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.489> go

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
we're gonna skip the top chain and go

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.490 
we're gonna skip the top chain and go
through<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.420> bottom<00:02:56.870> chain<00:02:57.110> we're<00:02:57.290> going<00:02:57.440> to

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
through this bottom chain we're going to

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.810 
through this bottom chain we're going to
come<00:02:57.680> back<00:02:57.709> add<00:02:58.640> an<00:02:59.510> angle<00:03:00.340> through<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.579> top

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
come back add an angle through the top

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.210 
come back add an angle through the top
chain

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
chain

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:13.780 
chain
below<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.760> like<00:03:07.320> that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.110 

now<00:03:14.500> we're<00:03:15.500> gonna<00:03:15.650> skip<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.310> bottom<00:03:16.819> chain

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
now we're gonna skip this bottom chain

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.759 
now we're gonna skip this bottom chain
and<00:03:17.840> you<00:03:17.930> can<00:03:17.959> kind<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.319> see<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> pattern

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
and you can kind of see a pattern

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.250 
and you can kind of see a pattern
starting<00:03:19.340> here<00:03:19.640> we're<00:03:20.420> gonna<00:03:20.569> go<00:03:20.780> through

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
starting here we're gonna go through

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.490 
starting here we're gonna go through
this<00:03:21.950> top<00:03:22.340> chain<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.840> instead<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.290> going

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
this top chain but instead of going

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.410 
this top chain but instead of going
through<00:03:24.680> this<00:03:25.129> diagonal<00:03:25.879> here<00:03:26.150> we're<00:03:26.329> going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
through this diagonal here we're going

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.559 
through this diagonal here we're going
to<00:03:26.480> come<00:03:26.720> back<00:03:26.750> through<00:03:27.879> the<00:03:28.879> bottom<00:03:29.269> chain

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
to come back through the bottom chain

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:41.030 
to come back through the bottom chain
that<00:03:29.840> was<00:03:29.989> on<00:03:30.170> this<00:03:30.440> side

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.869 

and<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.849> now<00:03:42.709> now<00:03:43.709> on<00:03:43.950> we're<00:03:44.099> gonna<00:03:44.189> come<00:03:44.549> back

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
and so now now on we're gonna come back

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:48.289 
and so now now on we're gonna come back
through<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.110> previous<00:03:46.760> one<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.970> we<00:03:48.090> went

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
through the previous one that we went

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.539 
through the previous one that we went
through<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.659> we're<00:03:48.780> going<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:48.989> skip<00:03:49.549> go

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
through so we're going to skip go

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.399 
through so we're going to skip go
through<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.879> bottom<00:03:51.090> chain<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.870> come

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
through the bottom chain and come

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.470 
through the bottom chain and come
through<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.890> top<00:03:53.310> chain<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.879> we<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.269> went

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
through the top chain that we just went

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:02.479 
through the top chain that we just went
through<00:03:59.569> and<00:04:00.569> be<00:04:00.810> careful<00:04:01.110> not<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.260> split<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
through and be careful not to split the

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:35.180 
through and be careful not to split the
yarn<00:04:02.670> when<00:04:03.629> you're<00:04:03.780> doing

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.380 

and<00:04:36.190> you<00:04:36.310> might<00:04:36.460> want<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.700> do<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:36.850> few<00:04:37.210> more

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
and you might want to do a few more

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:41.610 
and you might want to do a few more
repeats<00:04:38.100> just<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:39.460> safe<00:04:39.870> but<00:04:40.870> that's<00:04:41.320> gonna

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
repeats just to be safe but that's gonna

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.850 
repeats just to be safe but that's gonna
allow<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:42.070> fabric<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.910> still<00:04:43.390> move<00:04:43.660> if<00:04:44.080> you

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
allow the fabric to still move if you

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.540 
allow the fabric to still move if you
keep<00:04:45.040> it<00:04:45.190> just<00:04:45.220> a<00:04:45.580> little<00:04:45.910> bit<00:04:46.030> loose<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:47.550> then

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
keep it just a little bit loose and then

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.930 
keep it just a little bit loose and then
you<00:04:48.970> can<00:04:49.090> cut<00:04:49.300> off<00:04:49.450> your<00:04:49.480> end<00:04:50.700> when<00:04:51.700> you're

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
you can cut off your end when you're

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.770 
you can cut off your end when you're
done

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.560 

okay<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.140> can<00:04:58.290> see<00:04:58.610> that<00:04:59.610> it<00:05:00.300> doesn't

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
okay and you can see that it doesn't

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.210 
okay and you can see that it doesn't
show<00:05:00.930> even<00:05:01.710> though<00:05:01.800> I'm<00:05:01.890> using<00:05:02.070> the

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
show even though I'm using the

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.790 
show even though I'm using the
contrasting<00:05:02.820> color<00:05:03.200> you<00:05:04.200> can<00:05:04.350> barely<00:05:04.590> even

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
contrasting color you can barely even

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.120 
contrasting color you can barely even
see<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.370> through<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:06.690> fabric<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.950> that's

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
see it through the fabric and that's

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.440 
see it through the fabric and that's
probably<00:05:08.520> only<00:05:08.640> because<00:05:08.850> it's<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.090> contrasting

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
probably only because it's a contrasting

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.900 
probably only because it's a contrasting
color<00:05:09.900> so<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:11.070> that's<00:05:11.460> how<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.610> weave<00:05:11.880> in

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
color so and that's how you weave in

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.470 
color so and that's how you weave in
