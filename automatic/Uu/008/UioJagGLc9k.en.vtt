00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.200

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.399

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.640
 So much money because they are going to drive you and 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.660
 that some also tell me why 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.420
 some get so much money and two 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.740
 I do not give you the answer either 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 money and who takes the money because it is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.509
 who takes it is thus to try that to 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.640
 it's better to move away a little I'm going 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.890
 moving as you see I'm not moving 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 so everyone has to catch 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.590
 money that one does not stay still and then 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.970
 anything just consider the money 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.880
 what I said, I hope you like it 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.770
 it really is the button 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.770
 and that goodbye 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.340
