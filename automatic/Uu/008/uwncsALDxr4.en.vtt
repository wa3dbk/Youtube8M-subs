00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.930
 this 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.520
 I 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.579
 you 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.279
 very narrow exit hides an ambitious housing project that his 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.129
 owner of a hangar 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.630
 here we are in pontoise in the val-d'oise a historic city is 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.310
 judge and decide to build a timber frame house in this hen 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.210
 in this city they have an area parme fundraising a caricature 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.849
 is not a more complete game 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.630
 who will be implanted perfectly executed 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.360
 with the standards of the buildings of France 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.110
 I got to know it's the way of building through a friend 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.230
 who himself 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.170
 build it in timber frame in May so I went to see the yard and 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 I'm really something that seduced me right away his reform a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.540
 worksite and 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.070
 the team produces very little dust 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.100
 erdf that child a field that will perform so 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.800
 for the neighbors it's still more pleasant to see a building 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.500
 who does not 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.120
 not too much disturbance in this regard the court 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.480
 it is right that fits perfectly into the city and that final 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.399
 in simple to identify in front of dax 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.020
 to respect the spirit of the neighborhood 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.790
 foreign companies 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.050
 stÃ©phane the foll letter of support specialist of the construction of 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.020
 timber frame houses 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.400
 for this we have big beams in the melee paste 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.860
 e little known m and know them because it's fucking very much apparent 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.140
 the customer has something to keep the spirit of the wood for this job 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.140
 mainly we built on the spot we had access 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.840
 very complicated at the street level 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.840
 the fact of building wood frame allows 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.730
 do it from the mowing assembly that hopes that we would get that pieces 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.680
 we can cut in the workshop or the couple directly on the building site 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.710
 assembled on the site so even spent in a very small tent in 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.110
 the brand not very far 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.600
 pre-cut in a huge attack ascending simply or so we will 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
 contact sizes on the spot 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.700
 and we made small walls always wanted to inflate the lifting by 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.600
 little whites 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.099
 on the site we can always change the structure 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.179
 a small museum% and needs to be moved 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.549
 much more flexible than masonry is also especially the 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.949
 lintels masonry is then in its second place 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:17.919
 we leave for 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.859
 we are a porter 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:22.139
 and it works well on the models assembled on the site 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:25.169
 so we can change them quite easily during the championship 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:28.559
 inside the particular is mainly the speed of the adrets 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.789
 intervention avoid big trucks heavy trucks we are on the 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.119
 flank which one is completely dependent erogenous people 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.119
 while the owner sees the last details and passions to 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:40.720
 move forward at great speed v on the plans of the architect and thierry prignaud 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.810
 he is also specialized in timber frame house construction 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.099
 what we think about wood 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.840
 because I did not know the tree itself I like to drink it's a 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.220
 material a different opinion 10 years different areas of europe they form 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.900
 consistency it is on the menu it is comfortable in a comfortable atmosphere 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.859
 antastic wood frame which is interesting compared to 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.359
 traditional constructions are knotted did not have the thickness% and wall 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.389
 since she paints on the walls more insulation 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.409
 you have in front for the world had come out twice as desolate read 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.949
 science pursues softwood fiber based inside and rigid and 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.959
 the outside exists here to reach and we do not want it 'consumption 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.480
 other factor must for now is going very well we expect a great 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.179
 freedom out design invoice 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.019
 we can do traditional frame houses on the menu the most project 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.589
 modern more contemporary 

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:32.749
 it allows cantilever is allowed% verneuil framing 5'13 allows all 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.969
 and when corridors connecting you fall in love happy we do not 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.539
 flight 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.159
 it
