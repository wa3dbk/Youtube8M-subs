at tata technologies comm let's take a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.840 
at tata technologies comm let's take a
look<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.110> importing<00:00:43.110> inventor<00:00:43.860> geometry<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
look at importing inventor geometry and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.590 
look at importing inventor geometry and
creating<00:00:45.660> an<00:00:45.809> animation<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.570> inside<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
creating an animation of that inside of

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.439 
creating an animation of that inside of
3d<00:00:48.930> studio<00:00:49.110> max<00:00:49.760> so<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.300> we're

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
3d studio max so the first thing we're

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.930 
3d studio max so the first thing we're
going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.500> pick<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.010> design<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
going to do is to pick a design to

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.260 
going to do is to pick a design to
import<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:55.949> some<00:00:56.160> basic<00:00:56.550> settings<00:00:56.789> here

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
import and use some basic settings here

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:10.310 
import and use some basic settings here
go<00:00:57.809> ahead<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.050> let<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.440> open<00:00:59.039> up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.960 

so<00:01:11.320> at<00:01:11.439> this<00:01:11.590> point<00:01:11.950> our<00:01:12.100> geometry<00:01:12.490> is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
so at this point our geometry is

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.530 
so at this point our geometry is
imported<00:01:13.750> into<00:01:13.960> 3d<00:01:14.920> studio<00:01:15.100> max<00:01:15.460> but<00:01:16.450> we

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
imported into 3d studio max but we

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.480 
imported into 3d studio max but we
probably<00:01:16.840> need<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.290> give<00:01:17.530> it<00:01:17.680> some<00:01:17.710> additional

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
probably need to give it some additional

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.190 
probably need to give it some additional
intelligence<00:01:19.000> before<00:01:19.689> we<00:01:19.780> really<00:01:19.990> want<00:01:20.140> to

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
intelligence before we really want to

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100 
intelligence before we really want to
start<00:01:20.380> animating<00:01:20.799> anything<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.630> in<00:01:22.750> this<00:01:22.840> case

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
start animating anything so in this case

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.899 
start animating anything so in this case
I'm<00:01:23.350> going<00:01:23.439> to<00:01:23.500> switch<00:01:23.770> to<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:24.100> local

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
I'm going to switch to a local

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.600 
I'm going to switch to a local
coordinate<00:01:25.420> system<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.830> I<00:01:26.860> pick<00:01:27.189> different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
coordinate system when I pick different

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.789 
coordinate system when I pick different
components<00:01:28.180> I<00:01:28.330> can<00:01:28.539> right<00:01:28.720> click<00:01:28.750> and<00:01:29.350> select

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
components I can right click and select

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.520 
components I can right click and select
move<00:01:30.220> or<00:01:30.580> rotate<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.750> can<00:01:31.899> see<00:01:32.049> in<00:01:32.140> this<00:01:32.259> case

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
move or rotate you can see in this case

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.560 
move or rotate you can see in this case
the<00:01:33.189> rotation<00:01:33.670> or<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.789> pivot<00:01:34.119> point<00:01:34.390> isn't

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
the rotation or the pivot point isn't

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.889 
the rotation or the pivot point isn't
right<00:01:34.840> where<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.860> would<00:01:36.009> want<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.369> be<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.840> I

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
right where we would want it to be so I

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.740 
right where we would want it to be so I
can<00:01:37.990> go<00:01:38.259> ahead<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.970> hierarchy<00:01:39.970> area<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
can go ahead to the hierarchy area and

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.980 
can go ahead to the hierarchy area and
adjust<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:41.380> pivot<00:01:41.860> point<00:01:42.159> so<00:01:42.369> if<00:01:43.209> we<00:01:43.360> use<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
adjust that pivot point so if we use the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.219 
adjust that pivot point so if we use the
Move<00:01:44.289> command<00:01:44.319> now<00:01:45.250> it's<00:01:46.179> only<00:01:46.420> adjusting<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
Move command now it's only adjusting the

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.809 
Move command now it's only adjusting the
pivot<00:01:47.500> point<00:01:47.740> not<00:01:47.979> moving<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.340> component

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
pivot point not moving the component

00:01:48.819 --> 00:02:01.920 
pivot point not moving the component
itself

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.310 

so<00:02:02.930> now<00:02:03.079> that<00:02:03.140> looks<00:02:04.000> like<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.240> is<00:02:05.630> moved<00:02:06.049> into

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
so now that looks like it is moved into

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.240 
so now that looks like it is moved into
the<00:02:06.439> proper<00:02:06.890> position<00:02:08.259> if<00:02:09.259> we<00:02:09.470> go<00:02:09.619> ahead<00:02:09.739> and

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
the proper position if we go ahead and

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.300 
the proper position if we go ahead and
rotate<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.720> around<00:02:11.959> and<00:02:12.709> I<00:02:12.800> guess<00:02:13.040> we<00:02:13.129> need<00:02:13.220> to

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
rotate it around and I guess we need to

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.040 
rotate it around and I guess we need to
turn<00:02:13.550> off<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:15.700> adjust<00:02:16.700> pivot<00:02:17.030> point<00:02:17.269> so<00:02:17.510> as

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
turn off the adjust pivot point so as

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.440 
turn off the adjust pivot point so as
you<00:02:18.140> rotate<00:02:18.440> that<00:02:18.560> around<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.370> can<00:02:20.150> see

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
you rotate that around now you can see

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.979 
you rotate that around now you can see
how<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.780> would<00:02:20.900> function<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.780> there's<00:02:23.930> a

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
how it would function now there's a

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.800 
how it would function now there's a
bunch<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.319> AXI<00:02:24.769> still<00:02:25.069> turned<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.610> here<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.690> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
bunch of AXI still turned on here so you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.380 
bunch of AXI still turned on here so you
can<00:02:26.989> probably<00:02:27.500> also<00:02:27.950> go<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.549> link<00:02:28.849> info

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
can probably also go to this link info

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.630 
can probably also go to this link info
button<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.930> lock<00:02:30.799> some<00:02:31.099> of<00:02:31.190> these<00:02:31.250> degrees<00:02:31.459> of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
button and lock some of these degrees of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.759 
button and lock some of these degrees of
freedom<00:02:31.790> down<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.599> it<00:02:32.720> really<00:02:32.900> only<00:02:33.170> reacts<00:02:33.500> in

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
freedom down so it really only reacts in

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.490 
freedom down so it really only reacts in
the<00:02:33.980> ways<00:02:34.160> that<00:02:34.190> we<00:02:34.370> intended<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> I<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:36.290> see

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
the ways that we intended to I can see

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.259 
the ways that we intended to I can see
it<00:02:36.680> looks<00:02:36.769> like<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.220> rotation<00:02:37.790> about<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.120> Y

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
it looks like the rotation about the Y

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.809 
it looks like the rotation about the Y
is<00:02:38.330> really<00:02:38.840> only<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.400> motion<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.430> applies

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
is really only the motion that applies

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:47.949 
is really only the motion that applies
to<00:02:41.239> that<00:02:41.630> part<00:02:42.200> of<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:42.440> robotic<00:02:42.799> arm<00:02:46.959> once

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
to that part of this robotic arm once

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.140 
to that part of this robotic arm once
some<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.319> your<00:02:48.410> basic<00:02:48.560> import<00:02:49.370> and<00:02:49.670> set<00:02:50.000> ups

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
some of your basic import and set ups

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.080 
some of your basic import and set ups
been<00:02:50.360> done<00:02:50.890> let's<00:02:51.890> go<00:02:52.099> ahead<00:02:52.190> and<00:02:52.400> take<00:02:52.579> a<00:02:52.610> look

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
been done let's go ahead and take a look

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.559 
been done let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:53.360> creating<00:02:54.019> the<00:02:54.440> animation<00:02:54.920> itself<00:02:55.569> so

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
at creating the animation itself so

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.110 
at creating the animation itself so
again<00:02:56.900> now<00:02:57.079> that<00:02:57.110> we've<00:02:57.380> got<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.400> motions<00:02:58.790> set

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
again now that we've got the motions set

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.650 
again now that we've got the motions set
up<00:02:59.269> let's<00:02:59.900> make<00:03:00.110> sure<00:03:00.140> we're<00:03:00.410> on<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> local

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
up let's make sure we're on a local

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.860 
up let's make sure we're on a local
coordinate<00:03:02.660> system<00:03:02.690> for<00:03:03.049> that<00:03:03.170> part<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:04.870> all

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
coordinate system for that part and all

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.229 
coordinate system for that part and all
the<00:03:06.079> components<00:03:06.769> as<00:03:06.859> you<00:03:06.950> can<00:03:07.100> see<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:08.060> move

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
the components as you can see just move

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.780 
the components as you can see just move
on<00:03:08.389> their<00:03:08.540> own<00:03:08.630> right<00:03:08.900> now<00:03:09.019> so<00:03:09.829> if<00:03:09.980> we<00:03:10.100> move<00:03:10.489> or

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
on their own right now so if we move or

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.990 
on their own right now so if we move or
rotate<00:03:11.260> and<00:03:12.260> they<00:03:12.799> they<00:03:13.190> don't<00:03:13.400> really<00:03:13.579> stay

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
rotate and they they don't really stay

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.039 
rotate and they they don't really stay
with<00:03:14.180> each<00:03:14.269> other<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.630> we're<00:03:14.720> gonna<00:03:14.810> make<00:03:14.989> a

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
with each other so we're gonna make a

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.170 
with each other so we're gonna make a
link<00:03:15.530> between<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.340> components<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:17.090> know<00:03:17.150> I

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
link between the components you know I

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.240 
link between the components you know I
have<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.389> do<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.540> pick<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.900> link<00:03:18.079> command<00:03:18.470> and

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
have to do is pick the link command and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.180 
have to do is pick the link command and
drag<00:03:19.579> and<00:03:19.910> drop<00:03:20.090> from<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:21.410> end<00:03:21.620> of<00:03:22.069> that

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
drag and drop from the end of that

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.460 
drag and drop from the end of that
kinematic<00:03:22.700> chain<00:03:22.970> keep<00:03:23.480> dragging<00:03:23.900> from<00:03:24.139> part

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
kinematic chain keep dragging from part

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.379 
kinematic chain keep dragging from part
to<00:03:24.709> part<00:03:24.739> to<00:03:25.310> build<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.880> relationship

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
to part to build the relationship

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.410 
to part to build the relationship
between<00:03:26.600> those<00:03:26.840> components<00:03:31.180> once<00:03:32.180> that's

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
between those components once that's

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.970 
between those components once that's
been<00:03:32.510> done<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:33.170> we<00:03:33.319> use<00:03:33.470> something<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.769> a

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
been done if we use something like a

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.610 
been done if we use something like a
rotate<00:03:34.370> command<00:03:34.819> you<00:03:35.060> can<00:03:35.180> see<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.840> of<00:03:35.900> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
rotate command you can see all of the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.640 
rotate command you can see all of the
child<00:03:37.569> components<00:03:38.569> in<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.720> kinematic<00:03:39.350> chain

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
child components in that kinematic chain

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.240 
child components in that kinematic chain
follow<00:03:40.370> along<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.709> adhere<00:03:42.709> to<00:03:42.739> that<00:03:42.859> same

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
follow along and adhere to that same

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.129 
follow along and adhere to that same
motion<00:03:45.579> now<00:03:46.579> if<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.819> double-click<00:03:47.540> on<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
motion now if I double-click on the

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.780 
motion now if I double-click on the
first<00:03:48.500> element<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.069> the<00:03:49.099> kinematic<00:03:49.549> chain

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
first element in the kinematic chain

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.030 
first element in the kinematic chain
sometimes<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:50.810> useful<00:03:51.019> to<00:03:51.470> create<00:03:51.829> a

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
sometimes it's useful to create a

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.059 
sometimes it's useful to create a
selection<00:03:52.519> set<00:03:53.090> save<00:03:53.900> selection<00:03:54.349> set<00:03:54.709> I<00:03:54.859> just

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
selection set save selection set I just

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.569 
selection set save selection set I just
call<00:03:55.250> it<00:03:55.280> Robo<00:03:55.760> arm<00:03:56.260> because<00:03:57.260> later<00:03:58.160> on<00:03:58.280> when

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
call it Robo arm because later on when

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.729 
call it Robo arm because later on when
we<00:03:58.639> start<00:03:58.700> making<00:03:59.209> a<00:03:59.299> keyframe<00:03:59.959> animation

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
we start making a keyframe animation

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.370 
we start making a keyframe animation
it'll<00:04:01.489> be<00:04:01.579> easier<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.209> we<00:04:02.269> set<00:04:02.780> that<00:04:03.109> as<00:04:03.319> the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
it'll be easier if we set that as the

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.099 
it'll be easier if we set that as the
default<00:04:04.180> selection<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.690> we'll<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:05.959> pick

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
default selection so we'll just pick

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:08.319 
default selection so we'll just pick
that<00:04:06.319> Robo<00:04:06.709> arm<00:04:06.950> as<00:04:07.160> our<00:04:07.310> default<00:04:07.489> selection

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
that Robo arm as our default selection

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.050 
that Robo arm as our default selection
whenever<00:04:08.510> we're<00:04:08.780> making<00:04:09.109> keyframe<00:04:10.060> elements

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
whenever we're making keyframe elements

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.170 
whenever we're making keyframe elements
or<00:04:11.209> setting<00:04:11.750> our<00:04:11.870> keyframes<00:04:12.409> so<00:04:13.030> let's<00:04:14.030> do

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
or setting our keyframes so let's do

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.130 
or setting our keyframes so let's do
that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
that

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.240 
that
so<00:04:15.710> we've<00:04:15.830> got<00:04:16.010> our<00:04:16.190> timeline<00:04:16.940> down<00:04:17.180> here<00:04:17.450> I

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
so we've got our timeline down here I

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.030 
so we've got our timeline down here I
set<00:04:19.250> our<00:04:19.700> keys<00:04:20.600> when<00:04:21.230> it's<00:04:21.350> at<00:04:21.470> zero<00:04:21.769> just<00:04:22.010> like

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
set our keys when it's at zero just like

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.440 
set our keys when it's at zero just like
it<00:04:22.220> is<00:04:22.310> right<00:04:22.490> here<00:04:22.700> we'll<00:04:22.850> bump<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:23.210> up<00:04:23.270> to

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
it is right here we'll bump it up to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.490 
it is right here we'll bump it up to
about<00:04:23.630> 50<00:04:24.050> frames<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:26.390> we<00:04:27.080> can<00:04:27.200> start

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
about 50 frames and we can start

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.120 
about 50 frames and we can start
manipulating<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.340> geometry<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:33.130> let's

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
manipulating the geometry so let's

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.300 
manipulating the geometry so let's
rotate<00:04:34.460> this<00:04:34.880> down<00:04:35.480> so<00:04:36.080> it's<00:04:36.560> as<00:04:36.740> if<00:04:36.920> all<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
rotate this down so it's as if all the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.550 
rotate this down so it's as if all the
people<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.570> roller<00:04:38.720> coaster<00:04:38.840> ride<00:04:39.290> get

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
people on the roller coaster ride get

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.150 
people on the roller coaster ride get
pivoted<00:04:39.980> down<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> little<00:04:40.370> ways<00:04:40.550> like<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:42.160> we

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
pivoted down a little ways like that we

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.470 
pivoted down a little ways like that we
can<00:04:43.310> set<00:04:43.670> the<00:04:43.790> keyframe<00:04:44.000> for<00:04:44.480> that<00:04:44.600> now<00:04:49.480> one

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
can set the keyframe for that now one

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.080 
can set the keyframe for that now one
other<00:04:50.630> thing<00:04:50.780> we<00:04:50.870> may<00:04:51.020> want<00:04:51.200> to<00:04:51.230> do<00:04:51.440> is<00:04:51.650> to<00:04:52.550> turn

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
other thing we may want to do is to turn

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.240 
other thing we may want to do is to turn
off<00:04:53.120> some<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.870> filters<00:04:54.410> on<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.650> keyframe

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
off some of the filters on the keyframe

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.670 
off some of the filters on the keyframe
so<00:04:55.280> it's<00:04:55.640> in<00:04:56.060> this<00:04:56.180> case<00:04:56.390> only<00:04:56.720> considering

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
so it's in this case only considering

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.550 
so it's in this case only considering
the<00:04:58.070> rotational<00:04:58.730> changes<00:04:59.390> we<00:04:59.510> make<00:04:59.720> we<00:05:00.440> don't

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
the rotational changes we make we don't

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.780 
the rotational changes we make we don't
really<00:05:00.680> need<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.860> try<00:05:01.040> to<00:05:01.100> capture<00:05:01.370> any

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
really need to try to capture any

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.520 
really need to try to capture any
position<00:05:02.270> or<00:05:02.570> anything<00:05:02.720> like<00:05:02.930> that<00:05:02.960> so<00:05:03.410> it's

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
position or anything like that so it's

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.240 
position or anything like that so it's
just<00:05:03.590> gonna<00:05:03.830> start<00:05:04.100> capturing<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.760> rotation

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
just gonna start capturing the rotation

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.350 
just gonna start capturing the rotation
so<00:05:07.250> let's<00:05:07.460> bump<00:05:07.700> it<00:05:07.760> up<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.910> about<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> hundred

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
so let's bump it up to about a hundred

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.650 
so let's bump it up to about a hundred
and<00:05:12.490> actually<00:05:13.490> let's<00:05:13.669> go<00:05:13.790> ahead<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:14.300> give<00:05:14.570> it

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
and actually let's go ahead and give it

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.970 
and actually let's go ahead and give it
these<00:05:14.810> people<00:05:15.140> back<00:05:15.470> up<00:05:17.560> but<00:05:18.560> at<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.740> same

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:18.980 
these people back up but at the same

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.969 
these people back up but at the same
time<00:05:20.200> we're<00:05:21.200> gonna<00:05:21.260> want<00:05:21.470> them<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.770> start

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
time we're gonna want them to start

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:24.880 
time we're gonna want them to start
pivoting<00:05:22.610> around<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.450> kind<00:05:23.660> of<00:05:23.770> angling<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:24.890 
pivoting around and kind of angling to

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.100 
pivoting around and kind of angling to
the<00:05:25.010> left<00:05:25.220> and<00:05:25.460> then<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.580> whole<00:05:25.729> arm<00:05:26.419> is<00:05:26.900> going

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
the left and then the whole arm is going

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.360 
the left and then the whole arm is going
to<00:05:27.910> rotate<00:05:28.910> as<00:05:29.030> well<00:05:29.060> at<00:05:29.450> the<00:05:29.570> same<00:05:29.750> time<00:05:30.370> so

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
to rotate as well at the same time so

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.020 
to rotate as well at the same time so
we'll<00:05:31.460> set<00:05:31.700> our<00:05:31.790> keyframe<00:05:32.240> right<00:05:32.270> there<00:05:33.880> if<00:05:34.880> we

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
we'll set our keyframe right there if we

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.130 
we'll set our keyframe right there if we
go<00:05:35.150> back<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.510> take<00:05:35.630> a<00:05:35.690> look<00:05:35.870> at<00:05:35.930> what<00:05:36.020> we've

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
go back and take a look at what we've

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.880 
go back and take a look at what we've
done<00:05:36.350> so<00:05:36.620> far

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
done so far

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.280 
done so far
of<00:05:37.520> course<00:05:37.760> it<00:05:37.940> starts<00:05:38.210> out<00:05:38.330> moving<00:05:38.660> down<00:05:38.900> then

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
of course it starts out moving down then

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.600 
of course it starts out moving down then
when<00:05:39.380> it<00:05:39.440> hits<00:05:39.530> the<00:05:39.710> bottom<00:05:39.830> and<00:05:40.250> it<00:05:40.310> starts

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
when it hits the bottom and it starts

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.200 
when it hits the bottom and it starts
angling<00:05:41.120> to<00:05:41.450> the<00:05:41.630> right<00:05:42.169> and<00:05:43.030> turning<00:05:44.030> and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
angling to the right and turning and

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.390 
angling to the right and turning and
pivoting<00:05:44.570> out<00:05:44.690> at<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:44.870> same<00:05:45.080> time<00:05:51.100> so<00:05:52.100> we<00:05:52.220> can

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
pivoting out at the same time so we can

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.200 
pivoting out at the same time so we can
continue<00:05:52.729> this<00:05:53.030> process<00:05:54.550> to<00:05:55.550> create<00:05:55.729> the<00:05:55.970> very

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
continue this process to create the very

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.920 
continue this process to create the very
specific<00:05:56.930> animation<00:05:57.590> that<00:05:57.830> we<00:05:57.950> want<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.250> have

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
specific animation that we want to have

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.670 
specific animation that we want to have
and<00:06:01.210> eventually<00:06:02.210> you<00:06:02.960> might<00:06:03.140> have<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.350> bunch<00:06:03.620> of

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
and eventually you might have a bunch of

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.290 
and eventually you might have a bunch of
different<00:06:03.800> steps<00:06:04.160> with<00:06:04.460> different<00:06:04.790> sets<00:06:05.120> of

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
different steps with different sets of

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.050 
different steps with different sets of
geometry<00:06:05.900> all<00:06:06.080> moving<00:06:06.800> and<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.430> meeting<00:06:07.790> at

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
geometry all moving and a meeting at

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.719 
geometry all moving and a meeting at
different<00:06:08.390> points<00:06:08.690> in<00:06:08.780> time<00:06:09.490> basically<00:06:10.490> you

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
different points in time basically you

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.210 
different points in time basically you
could<00:06:10.850> have<00:06:11.000> an<00:06:11.090> entire<00:06:11.200> set<00:06:12.200> of<00:06:12.229> machinery<00:06:12.680> or

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
could have an entire set of machinery or

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.650 
could have an entire set of machinery or
multiple<00:06:13.669> machines<00:06:14.030> doing<00:06:14.419> different

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
multiple machines doing different

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.860 
multiple machines doing different
operations<00:06:15.290> and<00:06:15.700> animate<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.729> factory<00:06:17.510> floor

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
operations and animate a factory floor

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.620 
operations and animate a factory floor
or<00:06:18.610> manufacturing<00:06:19.610> process<00:06:20.180> or<00:06:20.419> something

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:20.630 
or manufacturing process or something

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.510 
or manufacturing process or something
like<00:06:20.810> that

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.900 

so<00:06:27.520> in<00:06:27.640> this<00:06:27.730> case<00:06:28.320> I've<00:06:29.320> got<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.530> good<00:06:29.770> start<00:06:30.040> to

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
so in this case I've got a good start to

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.530 
so in this case I've got a good start to
all<00:06:31.060> these<00:06:31.470> individuals<00:06:32.470> on<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:32.770> ride

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
all these individuals on the ride

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.920 
all these individuals on the ride
getting<00:06:34.540> spun<00:06:35.320> around<00:06:35.440> into<00:06:36.100> a<00:06:36.210> silly<00:06:37.210> stupor

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:37.930 
getting spun around into a silly stupor

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:51.540 
getting spun around into a silly stupor
of<00:06:39.330> roller-coaster<00:06:40.330> madness<00:06:50.310> and<00:06:51.310> making

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
of roller-coaster madness and making

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.100 
of roller-coaster madness and making
them<00:06:51.640> just<00:06:51.790> a<00:06:51.880> minor<00:06:52.120> adjustment<00:06:52.240> here<00:06:52.960> just

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
them just a minor adjustment here just

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.710 
them just a minor adjustment here just
to<00:06:53.170> make<00:06:53.290> this<00:06:53.380> look<00:06:53.440> more<00:06:53.920> natural<00:06:54.660> so<00:06:55.660> you

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 
to make this look more natural so you

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.840 
to make this look more natural so you
can<00:06:55.900> see<00:06:56.170> as<00:06:56.410> that<00:06:56.860> robotic<00:06:57.160> arms<00:06:57.520> started

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
can see as that robotic arms started

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.900 
can see as that robotic arms started
tilting<00:06:58.240> down<00:06:58.420> I<00:06:58.750> just<00:06:59.290> gave<00:06:59.680> the<00:06:59.920> seat<00:07:00.370> Bank<00:07:00.730> a

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
tilting down I just gave the seat Bank a

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.280 
tilting down I just gave the seat Bank a
slight<00:07:01.420> tilt<00:07:01.960> up<00:07:02.260> as<00:07:02.620> if<00:07:03.580> the<00:07:04.080> inertia<00:07:05.080> of

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
slight tilt up as if the inertia of

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.280 
slight tilt up as if the inertia of
those<00:07:05.440> seats<00:07:06.720> showed<00:07:07.720> it<00:07:07.870> a<00:07:07.900> little<00:07:08.050> bit<00:07:08.170> more

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.290 
those seats showed it a little bit more

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.650 
those seats showed it a little bit more
