connectivity issues wife's plane have
been<00:01:38.759> tuned<00:01:39.180> now<00:01:39.659> I'm<00:01:39.720> not<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.930> hundred

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
been tuned now I'm not one hundred

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
been tuned now I'm not one hundred
percent<00:01:40.200> sure<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.740> they<00:01:40.829> mean<00:01:40.860> by<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.220> but

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
percent sure what they mean by this but

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
percent sure what they mean by this but
I<00:01:41.549> assume<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.270> fine<00:01:42.600> tune<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.380> lag<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.189> we

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
I assume if fine tune the lag so we

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
I assume if fine tune the lag so we
should<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.729> experiencing<00:01:45.390> less<00:01:45.930> laggy<00:01:46.229> games

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
should be experiencing less laggy games
