00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.670 
you want to cook it down the soy sauce
so<00:04:48.800> that<00:04:49.040> it<00:04:49.340> doesn't<00:04:49.720> discolor<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.900> egg<00:04:51.200> so

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
so that it doesn't discolor the egg so

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.990 
so that it doesn't discolor the egg so
it's<00:04:51.830> going<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.040> take<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.310> second<00:04:52.850> and

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000
