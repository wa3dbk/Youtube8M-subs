00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.210
 Y 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.089
 d 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.089
 I will be dreaming 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 the moment arrived 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.060
 give him molar 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 but I do not know how to speak you must do it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.420
 I'm just a girl, it 's impossible, you should 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420
 do what 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.859
 but I can not, do not do this, I have 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.859
 fear 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.380
 the comedies do not miss it 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:01:03.240
 love has come to my heart but without 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:07.310
 mission to make a better world 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:10.210
 waiting for this if you stay 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.210
 why 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.440
 the final goal 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.950
 already 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.370
 we put it to 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.160
 we can reach them 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.040
 to the final goal for 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.490
 today we present someone abandoned the nest 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.930
 my friend and 27 candy farmers in 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.930
 a record time of three minutes 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 good 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.230
 and here 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.049
 I feel now me tell you a 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.049
 show on the floor would be fun 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.420
 a tip for me to shine 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.040
 and finally 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.250
 very exhausted 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.409
 I will also stop here a moment 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.180
 to catch your breath to sing for 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.950
 a moment this prize is not you 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.109
 doing since we opened this morning 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.000
 what can i say i feel aversion to 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.680
 serve customers or you feel that version 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.690
 to anything else stay 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.610
 sitting on all 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.310
 you are so childish I am always you think 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.420
 understand everything truth means you 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.300
 you know what this place is for, or yes 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.820
 of course it's a coffee, not something that is a coffee 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.440
 but that is not your true self the 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.150
 reason for making this coffee is that it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.590
 we have a base place so it serves 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.780
 also as a facade for our 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.730
 activities while taking tea and mint 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.350
 all day you run to serve all 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.590
 as unimportant slaves truth 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.360
 as a slave 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.250
 I generally tried to illustrate 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.190
 clarion situations to perfection 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.410
 he even tried 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.940
 thank good you had this tray at hand 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.760
 your face would have been like a cake 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.770
 cherry half eat and clear princess 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 many of us try to be civilized and not 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.740
 come to the basement with me I want 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.060
 show them something at all 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.880
 poor 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.319
 is what happens I found it lying in 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.940
 the park when I went for work 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.920
 this morning it seems that he has some 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.300
 wound 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.300
 let's see if this works 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.109
 is completely healed but it is 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.440
 amazing truth we call it water 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.420
 blue blue water is not my obvious maybe 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.640
 but it is the best we could achieve without 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.380
 much effort in any way this 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.960
 thing possesses all kinds of magical powers 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.750
 magical powers and that the question sounds 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.520
 very interesting is strange ever 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.420
 we had heard from her so far 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.280
 go bridget and she remembers what 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.110
 happened to you on the beach when you were 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.660
 underwater and suddenly it transforms you 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.510
 well something but to be honest not 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.970
 I remember a lot it was as if everything had 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:52.160
 been a dream as a kind of 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.160
 extra bodily experience or something like that 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.499
 I have a feeling that 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:59.809
 eventually all of you have 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:05:00.619
 experienced that dream risk in addition to 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.330
 to heal wounds 

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:04.099
 We believe that blue water can activate 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:05.749
 a higher level of transformation 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.489
 the day after the incident of 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.379
 wesley preacher and I went diving 

00:05:07.489 --> 00:05:11.839
 to see what we could find and there 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:14.209
 It was bright and we hid everything 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:16.129
 in a secret passage under the cafe the 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:18.289
 blue water seems to derive in a way 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.509
 greater crystallized I guess what 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.219
 we will call the blue water crystal not 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.749
 it will only help us in our fight against 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.699
 the cyclones but will endow them with 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:26.959
 much greater powers of transformation 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.819
 which we had not even dreamed 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:30.830
 that were possible we can see that they can 

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:34.129
 find and reports 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.339
 and be very careful with cyclones 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:36.339
 do not
