00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:05.540 
alright this is my review of the hubsan

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.410 
alright this is my review of the hubsan
FP<00:00:06.540> VIX<00:00:07.170> for<00:00:07.500> fpv<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.849> proto<00:00:09.150> x<00:00:09.620> fpv<00:00:10.759> i<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:12.210> a

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
FP VIX for fpv the proto x fpv i have a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.290 
FP VIX for fpv the proto x fpv i have a
standard<00:00:13.410> hubsan<00:00:13.799> x4<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.540> proto<00:00:16.199> x-small

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
standard hubsan x4 and the proto x-small

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.939 
standard hubsan x4 and the proto x-small
first<00:00:18.300> thing<00:00:18.539> i<00:00:18.570> want<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.810> point<00:00:18.900> out<00:00:19.140> is<00:00:19.380> with

all these that each one of the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.790 
all these that each one of the
controllers<00:00:23.789> work<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.109> with<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.560> eat

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
controllers work with it with with eat

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
controllers work with it with with eat
with<00:00:26.070> anyone<00:00:26.400> they'll<00:00:26.849> work<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.210> anyone

with anyone they'll work if anyone
course<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> got<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.260> change<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.619> trims

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
course you got to change the trims

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:36.850 
course you got to change the trims
you'll<00:00:30.150> notice<00:00:30.420> i<00:00:30.779> don't<00:00:31.320> have<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:33.170> hubsan<00:00:34.340> fpv

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
you'll notice i don't have my hubsan fpv

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
you'll notice i don't have my hubsan fpv
copter<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.129> that's<00:00:38.940> because<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.690> first

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
copter here that's because the first

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.440 
copter here that's because the first
thing<00:00:40.170> I<00:00:40.320> learned<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.760> don't<00:00:41.760> get<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> out<00:00:42.300> of

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
thing I learned was don't get it out of

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.830 
thing I learned was don't get it out of
range<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:44.219> flew<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.570> high<00:00:45.809> I

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
range and I basically flew it so high I

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
range and I basically flew it so high I
lost<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.219> never<00:00:47.460> found<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:48.030> still<00:00:48.809> have

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
lost it and I never found it still have

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.709 
lost it and I never found it still have
the<00:00:49.170> controller<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> got<00:00:51.180> something<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.539> can

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the controller so I got something I can

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.459 
the controller so I got something I can
you<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.100> mod<00:00:53.100> later<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:53.780> as<00:00:54.780> far<00:00:55.320> as

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
you know mod later on as far as

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.750 
you know mod later on as far as
comparing<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:59.510> x4<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> proto<00:01:01.739> x<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.640> know

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
comparing the x4 to the proto x you know

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.080 
comparing the x4 to the proto x you know
on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.059> fpv<00:01:03.539> sides<00:01:04.670> basically<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
on the fpv sides basically this is the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.840 
on the fpv sides basically this is the
same<00:01:06.330> same<00:01:06.720> copter<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.380> some<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.610> same

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
same same copter that some of the same

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.460 
same same copter that some of the same
similar<00:01:09.210> copter<00:01:09.930> as<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:11.420> x4<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.930> an<00:01:13.020> x<00:01:13.200> 4

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
similar copter as the x4 this is an x 4

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.499 
similar copter as the x4 this is an x 4
but<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.740> has<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.040> got<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.610> standard<00:01:15.270> camera

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
but this has just got a standard camera

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.440 
but this has just got a standard camera
it<00:01:15.810> doesn't<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:16.670> doesn't<00:01:17.670> broadcast<00:01:18.979> um

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
it doesn't have doesn't broadcast um

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.580 
it doesn't have doesn't broadcast um
great<00:01:21.450> little<00:01:21.689> copter<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.229> biggest

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
great little copter the biggest

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.899 
great little copter the biggest
difference<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.130> i<00:01:23.220> noticed<00:01:23.520> between<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
difference that i noticed between the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
difference that i noticed between the
two<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.060> them<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> battery<00:01:25.369> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:27.890> hubsan

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
two of them is the battery on the hubsan

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.499 
two of them is the battery on the hubsan
i<00:01:29.210> don't<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.390> if<00:01:30.540> i<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.630> get<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:32.509> see

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
i don't know if i can get this to see

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.780 
i don't know if i can get this to see
there<00:01:33.950> yeah<00:01:34.950> there<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.250> that<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:39.439> 360

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
there yeah there we go that is a 360

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.160 
there yeah there we go that is a 360
milliamp<00:01:41.790> battery<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.810> proto<00:01:45.810> x

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
milliamp battery and on the proto x

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.999 
milliamp battery and on the proto x
which<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.890> bigger<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.869> bigger<00:01:48.920> helicopter<00:01:49.920> in

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
which is a bigger a bigger helicopter in

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.179 
which is a bigger a bigger helicopter in
it<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.759> weighs<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.030> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.450> more<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:52.170> has<00:01:52.890> a

millivolt<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:02.329> couple<00:02:03.329> things<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.750> off<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
millivolt a couple things right off the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
millivolt a couple things right off the
bat<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.229> i'm<00:02:04.469> going<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> point<00:02:05.430> out<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
bat that i'm going to point out with the

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.990 
bat that i'm going to point out with the
protos<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.560> i<00:02:07.979> use<00:02:08.160> hot<00:02:08.399> glue<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
protos is i use hot glue to kind of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.750 
protos is i use hot glue to kind of
stabilize<00:02:09.899> stuff<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.590> that<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> big<00:02:11.520> no-no

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
stabilize stuff and that is a big no-no

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.840 
stabilize stuff and that is a big no-no
with<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.360> with

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
with the with

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.140 
with the with
these<00:02:12.970> because<00:02:13.420> if<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.320> have<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.650> peel<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.560 

hot<00:02:19.150> glue<00:02:19.390> off<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:20.440> ends<00:02:20.650> up<00:02:20.710> happening<00:02:20.770> is

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
hot glue off what ends up happening is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.480 
hot glue off what ends up happening is
the<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> hot<00:02:24.430> glue<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.850> on<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:26.490> LED

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
the if it's if the hot glue is on a LED

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.520 
the if it's if the hot glue is on a LED
when<00:02:27.970> you<00:02:28.060> pull<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.330> glue<00:02:28.750> off<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.170> pulls<00:02:29.410> the

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
when you pull the glue off it pulls the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.100 
when you pull the glue off it pulls the
LED<00:02:30.070> off<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.670> led<00:02:30.850> either<00:02:31.330> will<00:02:31.570> short

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
LED off and that led either will short

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.160 
LED off and that led either will short
out<00:02:32.200> or<00:02:32.440> won't<00:02:32.920> work<00:02:33.070> at<00:02:33.220> all<00:02:33.450> I've<00:02:34.450> had<00:02:34.780> had<00:02:35.080> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
out or won't work at all I've had had to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.750 
out or won't work at all I've had had to
take<00:02:35.290> two<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.650> them<00:02:35.770> off<00:02:35.860> on<00:02:36.070> each<00:02:36.220> one<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.550> them
