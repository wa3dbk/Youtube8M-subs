00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
so and that seems like a real good idea

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.690 
so and that seems like a real good idea
at<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.799> time<00:01:12.890> because<00:01:13.189> you're<00:01:13.400> not<00:01:13.490> really

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
at the time because you're not really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.640 
at the time because you're not really
hitting<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.090> tinder<00:01:14.330> but<00:01:15.049> what<00:01:15.170> happens<00:01:15.530> in

I'm<00:02:12.680> going<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.830> try<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.130> up<00:02:13.310> first<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:14.290> maybe

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
I'm going to try that up first and maybe

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.200 
I'm going to try that up first and maybe
I'll<00:02:15.470> try<00:02:15.620> initially<00:02:16.580> using<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.970> flick

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
I'll try initially using the flick

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.790 
I'll try initially using the flick
method

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
method

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.440 
method
and<00:02:19.800> actually<00:02:20.250> works<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> flash<00:02:21.150> tender

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
and actually works with a flash tender

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.730 
and actually works with a flash tender
like<00:02:21.570> that<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> flick<00:02:22.050> method<00:02:22.320> works<00:02:22.470> because

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
like that the flick method works because

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.810 
like that the flick method works because
you<00:02:22.800> don't<00:02:22.950> need<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> lot<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.250> heat<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.610> get<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
you don't need a lot of heat to get it

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.640 
you don't need a lot of heat to get it
to<00:02:23.880> combust<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.930> trial<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.320> works<00:02:25.500> pretty

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
to combust the trial that works pretty

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.720 
to combust the trial that works pretty
well<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.100> can<00:02:26.220> see<00:02:26.340> i'm<00:02:26.430> getting<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> nice

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
next version this is a again a man mein

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.740 
next version this is a again a man mein
tender<00:02:41.730> it's<00:02:41.850> a<00:02:41.880> natural<00:02:42.060> material<00:02:42.360> but

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
tender it's a natural material but

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.600 
tender it's a natural material but
man-made<00:02:43.080> material<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.680> man-made<00:02:44.040> tender

man-made material but a man-made tender
this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.820> jute<00:02:45.060> twine<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.830> again<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.950> will

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
this is jute twine and again this will

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.500 
this is jute twine and again this will
probably<00:02:47.310> work<00:02:47.520> with<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.820> other<00:02:47.940> method<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
probably work with that other method to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.420 
probably work with that other method to
the<00:02:49.200> flick<00:02:49.440> method<00:02:49.770> we<00:02:49.860> start<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.190> here<00:02:50.220> and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
basically because this way it'll just

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.680 
basically because this way it'll just
extend<00:03:08.490> it<00:03:08.610> I<00:03:08.760> prefer<00:03:09.240> to<00:03:09.360> use<00:03:09.540> natural

petroleum jelly cotton ball and what
this<00:03:29.519> is<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.090> piece<00:03:30.269> of<00:03:30.300> cotton<00:03:30.570> that's

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
this is is just a piece of cotton that's

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.560 
this is is just a piece of cotton that's
been<00:03:31.650> soaked<00:03:31.890> with<00:03:32.010> Vaseline<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:35.420> this<00:03:36.420> is

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
been soaked with Vaseline and this is

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.300 
been soaked with Vaseline and this is
pretty<00:03:36.720> forgiving<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.290> what<00:03:37.950> will<00:03:38.040> happen<00:03:38.070> is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
pretty forgiving and what will happen is

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.590 
pretty forgiving and what will happen is
the<00:03:38.370> cotton<00:03:38.640> will<00:03:38.760> ignite<00:03:39.000> but<00:03:39.330> then<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
the cotton will ignite but then the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.030 
the cotton will ignite but then the
Vaseline<00:03:39.989> will<00:03:40.110> make<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.350> burn<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.860> a<00:03:40.890> long

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
Vaseline will make it burn for a long

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.949 
Vaseline will make it burn for a long
long<00:03:41.220> time<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:41.820> very<00:03:42.030> forgiving<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.870> what

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
long time this is very forgiving so what

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.310 
long time this is very forgiving so what
I'm<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.110> to<00:03:43.170> do<00:03:43.350> is<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.220> as<00:03:45.320> I'm

grass here where I'm going to pin I'm
gonna<00:03:50.670> brace<00:03:51.120> my<00:03:51.300> hand<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> ground<00:03:51.900> and

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
gonna brace my hand on the ground and

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.270 
gonna brace my hand on the ground and
then<00:03:52.350> draw<00:03:52.620> against<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.780> and<00:03:54.780> now<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.739> mean<00:03:56.130> that

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
then draw against it and now I mean that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
then draw against it and now I mean that
works<00:03:56.430> well<00:03:56.640> for<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:56.850> kind<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.060> thing<00:03:57.120> cuz

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
works well for that kind of thing cuz

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.370 
works well for that kind of thing cuz
it's<00:03:57.420> very<00:03:57.570> forgiving<00:03:59.120> alright<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:01.110> that'll

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
it's very forgiving alright so that'll

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.479 
it's very forgiving alright so that'll
burn<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.650> will<00:04:01.800> burn<00:04:01.890> for<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:02.190> good<00:04:02.310> long<00:04:02.430> time

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
burn that will burn for a good long time

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.910 
burn that will burn for a good long time
like<00:04:02.850> if<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.030> were<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> pick<00:04:03.330> this<00:04:03.450> up<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:04.110> prop

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
like if I were to pick this up and prop

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.880 
like if I were to pick this up and prop
it<00:04:04.950> on<00:04:05.160> this<00:04:05.310> piece<00:04:05.550> of<00:04:05.670> wood<00:04:05.700> it's<00:04:05.940> gonna<00:04:06.030> burn

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
it on this piece of wood it's gonna burn

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.979 
it on this piece of wood it's gonna burn
you<00:04:07.890> know<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:09.150> know<00:04:09.269> three<00:04:09.600> or<00:04:09.630> four<00:04:09.840> minutes

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
you know you know three or four minutes

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.870 
you know you know three or four minutes
so<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.380> almost<00:04:10.500> build<00:04:10.980> a<00:04:11.160> fire<00:04:11.459> stages

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
so you can almost build a fire stages

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.220 
so you can almost build a fire stages
will<00:04:12.000> fly<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.420> around<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.840> it's<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.050> really

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
will fly right around that it's a really

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.170 
will fly right around that it's a really
great<00:04:13.440> source<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:14.190> my<00:04:14.340> favorite<00:04:14.700> source<00:04:14.940> of

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
great source it's my favorite source of

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.400 
great source it's my favorite source of
man-made<00:04:15.510> tender<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:15.989> I<00:04:16.019> bring<00:04:16.229> with<00:04:16.350> me

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
man-made tender that I bring with me

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.150 
man-made tender that I bring with me
wherever<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.799> go<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.040> very<00:04:17.190> reliable<00:04:19.040> hard<00:04:20.040> to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
wherever I go it's very reliable hard to

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.820 
wherever I go it's very reliable hard to
extinguish<00:04:20.549> as<00:04:20.729> you<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:20.940> see<00:04:21.320> now<00:04:22.320> as<00:04:22.350> we<00:04:22.650> move

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
extinguish as you can see now as we move

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.230 
extinguish as you can see now as we move
over<00:04:23.010> to<00:04:23.250> natural<00:04:23.640> tender<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.000> is<00:04:24.060> way<00:04:24.150> we

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
over to natural tender this is way we

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.020 
over to natural tender this is way we
get<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.419> little<00:04:24.570> less<00:04:24.810> forgiving<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:25.500> uh<00:04:26.030> maybe

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
get a little less forgiving and uh maybe

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.320 
get a little less forgiving and uh maybe
I'm<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.390> transfer<00:04:27.780> this

just kind of like the flick method and
it<00:04:41.379> does<00:04:41.530> work<00:04:41.710> sometimes<00:04:41.949> but<00:04:48.389> if<00:04:49.389> the

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
it does work sometimes but if the

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:51.420 
it does work sometimes but if the
natural<00:04:50.500> tender<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.830> wood<00:04:50.949> shavings<00:04:51.340> you

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
natural tender the wood shavings you

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.909 
natural tender the wood shavings you
just<00:04:51.580> need<00:04:51.699> a<00:04:51.729> higher<00:04:51.939> that<00:04:52.330> got<00:04:52.629> a<00:04:52.659> higher

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
just need a higher that got a higher

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.959 
just need a higher that got a higher
rate<00:04:53.919> of<00:04:53.949> combustion<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.490> higher<00:04:54.610> temperature

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 
rate of combustion a higher temperature

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.119 
rate of combustion a higher temperature
to<00:04:55.419> combust<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.409> it's<00:04:56.710> going<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.860> have<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.009> get

00:04:57.119 --> 00:04:57.129 
to combust so it's going to have to get

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:58.409 
to combust so it's going to have to get
hotter<00:04:57.370> before<00:04:57.550> it'll<00:04:57.819> catch<00:04:57.939> you<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> flame

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
hotter before it'll catch you to a flame

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.240 
hotter before it'll catch you to a flame
so<00:04:59.050> it's<00:04:59.139> not<00:04:59.259> as<00:04:59.379> forgiving<00:04:59.800> as<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.039> flash

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
so it's not as forgiving as the flash

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.070 
so it's not as forgiving as the flash
