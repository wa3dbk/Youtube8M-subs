00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone on my test today 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.910
 let's get smartphones 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.830
 This is sony xperia z1 f 0 and fx 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.540
 Today we will immerse them in the long-awaited 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.980
 a test that promised you a long time ago 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.910
 I propose to start with the more popular 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.910
 z1 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.940
 so we have accordingly 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:37.680
 room temperature water and telephone 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.110
 the phone is naturally working we will be on 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.200
 him with the process of exploitation 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.020
 test processes strictly speaking 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:52.670
 why you delay it is important to determine how 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.670
 running screen under water 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.860
 how does he react to pressing 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.810
 but so far it can be seen that it can not be 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.810
 do multiplier 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.620
 so ok that's paid off but apparently 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.620
 from water 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 hands do not react in any way 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.240
 let's try to call 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.389
 [music] 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.290
 [music] 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 and 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.060
 then call to call 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:15.990
 but for some reason, quite quiet visibility 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:19.680
 yes yes cancel 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.680
 no response 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 there is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:35.959
 Yes, it is very difficult to manage the screen after 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.060
 the phone went to the water 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:43.020
 strange let's test tapirs 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.739
 but it will turn out to be like 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.739
 if the phone does not respond 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:04.379
 well hands fly 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:08.849
 we and so we have 2 vehicles 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:12.810
 x501 f let's see how it will be 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.810
 work under water he 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.519
 testing on 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:22.500
 how much will hear it now find out 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.500
 under the water yes you can hear it 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.300
 [music] 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:43.970
 she responds to pressing as you can see 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.740
 I write my impression in more detail 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.050
 on principle in this all and so that we ourselves 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.450
 could see in the review on the site therefore 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.110
 go to the site will be glad to see you again 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.070
 see 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.070
 bye everyone
