00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.980
 in the chempark valencia it goes on 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.960
 heading south 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.960
 Welcome to a reportage 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.830
 But before we go on the highway 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.930
 Thank you again you have to go here 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:42.320
 in spain not necessarily pay attention 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.580
 that one refueled at the side street to the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.070
 Motorways it is not essential 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.070
 more expensive than on the other roads 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.340
 I think you can see that in Germany 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.170
 not more 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.850
 relax here every now and then 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.680
 sometimes a gas station with service 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.020
 I always calculate in advance about 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.880
 how much I like to drink and then how to drink 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.869
 so i have to pay the money then 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.670
 always so nice was fitting from the 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.890
 Parking space to the highway is not 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.680
 far and how we drove 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.280
 you now the explanation yes our ride 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.770
 yes continue 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.040
 we were driving from viterra again 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.410
 on the evasion of valencia 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.360
 this is all toll-free you recognize it 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.670
 here on this map 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 the red marked highways are 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.830
 toll free here the blue one is 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.770
 toll motorway 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.810
 In this case we are going up here 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.680
 this toll free was something else 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:51.340
 into the interior cut short and off here 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:55.939
 then drive down towards masia 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.600
 I say that right now you can 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.430
 Of course, drive along here and 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.780
 does not have to take the highway here 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.640
 here also the national roads 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.189
 but we want to reach this distance 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.580
 use return journey and therefore we drive 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:13.690
 yes, our goal is to go down 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.690
 parking space in cartagena 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.960
 as already said we have the here 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.480
 abkürzung were taken here 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.900
 Highway direction Elche next then 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.660
 We have to drive from Murcia 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.550
 then in the direction of katharina and here is 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.410
 then the pitch I yes too 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.630
 already on my youtube channel 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.130
 Had presented 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.260
 the route we drive now 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.870
 direction inside is not 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.930
 considerably further than if we were the other 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.100
 take the elbow and here 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.860
 is not that much traffic 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.500
 Everything goes very well something 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:57.050
 it is mountainous but there is little traffic 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.780
 from the toll free highway a 7 altitude 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.900
 I have to go on the a 30 times 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.640
 then , according to frey direction katharina have 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.440
 We took the departures to Dolores 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.440
 and drove to the pitch 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.760
 yes sometimes you can do better 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:20.980
 portray follow as the navi sometimes 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.980
 it is easier to describe the blue 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.360
 the coincidence 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.220
 so we reach the parking space in the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.160
 near catena in the early days 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.160
 in the afternoon about 250 km 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.060
 coordinates to the square and others 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.240
 You will find information again below 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.220
 the video in the text of a pitch spot 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.780
 now look good for example the 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.140
 city ​​of cartagena 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.820
 about 78 kilometers away and with the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.910
 bike but easy to reach or too 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.050
 with public transport for us 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.250
 it went on after a plate on 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.470
 heading south 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.070
 and here you get the description where 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.870
 we went there from katar gene 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.160
 always back on the toll free 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:09.110
 Highway direction easy driving 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 heading south our goal continues 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.720

 Side street to the small town of Palma 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.910
 hazards 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.729
 The journey goes through the small town 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.650
