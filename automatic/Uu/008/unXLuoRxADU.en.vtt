00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.599
 and with friends I am from a new series 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.110
 that leads to be this way of tricks and tips 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.719
 and look at this advice is about the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.090
 the final on the enchantment table and 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.560
 look at the problem with this table is that I 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.010
 I realized that in many worlds 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:27.950
 put on the table like that and the spells are 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:29.960
 come as well as look so 72 71 13 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.000
 effects that when it reaches them at 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.920
 30 and you can do something father and look 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.050
 here I will show you a stereotype that I 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.360
 I just did with some friends are about 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.090
 good subscribers called up and 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.760
 another bad the orchard look there is 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.340
 up and good look how you can see it 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.310
 they see parent letters getting in and then 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.450
 look here metola spadita and level 30 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.900
 that is 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.950
 level 30 gives you more power more more 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.480
 spells and it looks much better look here 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.800
 I'm going to show you the stereotype and 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.270
 Now we are going to do it in this video 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.250
 but that is not obligatory what it is 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.120
 mandatory is that the table should be a 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.190
 space a square next to and books of 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.630
 two blocks high here my friends already 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.060

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.170

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.750

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.750
 friend the call the moon guardamar 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.740
 let's go fast 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.770
 of Minecraft 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.570
 we did the circular style you can 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.200
 say no good the most circular thing that 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.200
 can minecraft 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.470
 here we are collaborating to walk like 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.960
 that very excited making it tobarra 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.180
 that we are wrong so we get into 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.170
 the part of the other but good we 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.780
 we coordinate well 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.880
 and I keep insisting that you can not 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.830
 present thus with the audio because the 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.459
 truth I am very very little and I do not know how 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.770
 to make them come up so 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:47.720
 what's going to be something like that already 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.060
 I'm investigating how to do it here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.760
 to set him free and all while my 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.910
 friend puts the floor and the other has to put 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 the roof look there is the car still 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.709
 it's not completely free crimes like this 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.530
 like the shelves of a whole magician 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.300
 if read not like us or just 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.260
 finish my first book and why do I 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.049
 I say 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.330
 because he forced me to school because 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.239
 I feel proud to read the only 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.519
 book that you give my whole life you do not know 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.110
 if I like to read but well that happens 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.330
 with many look there are the chicks 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.040
 you are already seeing everything nice to see 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:31.880
 where is the table to create fusion to see 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:36.250
 it's look has to be a little square 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:39.100
 in a box of difference of the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 from the booksellers look how 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.540
 are noticing right now is 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.480
 what is necessary to be able to have the power 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.090
 of a table are only two in height is not 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.250
 much to james the casting has already arrived 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.790
 they always saw the casting that is 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.600
 goal to see here covering to make it look 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:01.680
 so in this nice style 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.220
 and well look here it's almost like that almost 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.380
 all 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.590
 It looks pretty nice in looks similar to the 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.590
 other 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.710
 and good to see here, let's try it 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.350
 do not 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.060
 what else can I put it like that? 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.420
 check to see if and if 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.780
 it works that of the 30 come there is 30 the 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.070
 enchantments and this works for 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.820
 all weapons and armor except the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:31.050
 apes the fishing rod and the hoe and 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.200
