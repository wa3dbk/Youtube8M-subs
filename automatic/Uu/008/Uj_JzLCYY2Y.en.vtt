00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
something that yields under slight

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.290 
something that yields under slight
pressure<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> should<00:00:20.460> feel<00:00:20.699> like<00:00:20.970> if<00:00:21.150> you

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
pressure and it should feel like if you

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
pressure and it should feel like if you
squeeze<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.810> really<00:00:21.990> hard<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.070> smash

the story as far as slicing a mango goes
we're<00:00:33.510> going<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> demonstrate<00:00:33.870> two

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
we're going to demonstrate two

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
we're going to demonstrate two
techniques<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> i<00:00:36.090> will<00:00:36.899> start<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
techniques for you i will start with the

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.040 
techniques for you i will start with the
simpler<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:38.700> basically<00:00:39.120> we<00:00:39.840> want

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
simpler of the two and basically we want

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
simpler of the two and basically we want
to<00:00:40.110> keep<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.350> mind<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.680> that<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.070> pit<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
to keep in mind is that the pit of the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.819 
to keep in mind is that the pit of the
mango<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.120> in<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> center<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.230> runs<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.680> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
mango is in the center and runs up and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.260 
mango is in the center and runs up and
down<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> set<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> mango<00:00:45.059> down

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
down so you want to set the mango down

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690 
down so you want to set the mango down
on<00:00:45.510> your<00:00:46.020> cutting<00:00:46.170> board<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:47.160> narrow<00:00:47.430> edge

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
on your cutting board the narrow edge

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.139 
on your cutting board the narrow edge
not<00:00:48.329> flat<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.940> want<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
not flat like this this you want to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.240 
not flat like this this you want to
start<00:00:51.360> by<00:00:51.449> slicing<00:00:52.020> off<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.739> call<00:00:52.920> cheek

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
start by slicing off what we call cheek

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.430 
start by slicing off what we call cheek
one<00:00:56.250> cheek<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:58.590> cheek<00:00:59.090> set<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.690> then

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
one cheek to cheek set it down and then

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.840 
one cheek to cheek set it down and then
on<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.739> cutting<00:01:01.920> board<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.430> once<00:01:02.670> again

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
on your cutting board you once again

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.020 
on your cutting board you once again
want<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.239> cut<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.539> portion<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> half<00:01:04.439> and

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
want to cut this portion in half and

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.429 
want to cut this portion in half and
then<00:01:06.030> once<00:01:06.270> again<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.780> your<00:01:06.960> knife<00:01:07.140> blade

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
then once again with your knife blade

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
then once again with your knife blade
and<00:01:07.650> run<00:01:07.770> along<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.610> skin<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> cut<00:01:09.299> off<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
and run along the skin to cut off the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.630 
and run along the skin to cut off the
skin<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.650> very<00:01:10.680> last<00:01:10.979> moment<00:01:11.250> it's<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
skin and at the very last moment it's a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.100 
skin and at the very last moment it's a
good<00:01:11.760> idea<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> tip<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.360> up<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.930> don't

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
good idea to tip it up so that you don't

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.170 
good idea to tip it up so that you don't
get<00:01:13.320> your<00:01:13.439> finger<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.670> with<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:14.939> piece

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
get your finger and then with this piece

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.749 
get your finger and then with this piece
left<00:01:15.420> over<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.290> either<00:01:16.560> cut<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.520> into

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
left over you can either cut that into

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.550 
left over you can either cut that into
slices<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.420> leave<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> whole<00:01:18.900> like<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
slices or leave it whole like this and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350 
slices or leave it whole like this and
it's<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> great<00:01:19.920> snack<00:01:20.220> while<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:21.000> sitting
