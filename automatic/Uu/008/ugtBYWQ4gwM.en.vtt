00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
the inheritance of it is a little bit

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:53.450 
the inheritance of it is a little bit
unpredictable<00:00:49.210> but<00:00:50.210> basically<00:00:50.600> it's<00:00:51.110> used

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
on and a line it's there if you really

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.110 
on and a line it's there if you really
want<00:01:12.620> to<00:01:12.680> get<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.860> really<00:01:13.159> intense<00:01:13.310> Reds<00:01:13.940> like

want to get the really intense Reds like
this<00:01:14.240> once<00:01:14.420> you<00:01:14.720> know<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:14.960> pretty<00:01:15.170> red<00:01:15.470> but

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
this once you know it's pretty red but

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.110 
this once you know it's pretty red but
it's<00:01:15.710> not<00:01:15.830> like<00:01:15.950> screaming<00:01:16.460> red<00:01:16.610> like<00:01:16.820> some<00:01:17.030> of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
it's not like screaming red like some of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.300 
it's not like screaming red like some of
them<00:01:17.650> if<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:18.800> really<00:01:18.979> want<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.160> get<00:01:19.220> the

them if you really want to get the
intense<00:01:19.640> red<00:01:19.910> so<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> best<00:01:20.390> thing<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.600> do<00:01:20.750> is

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
intense red so the best thing to do is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.600 
intense red so the best thing to do is
debris<00:01:21.080> red<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.619> red<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.100> get<00:01:22.250> more<00:01:22.550> and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
debris red to red and you get more and

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.490 
debris red to red and you get more and
more<00:01:22.760> intensive<00:01:23.330> animals<00:01:23.690> and<00:01:24.140> their<00:01:24.320> brother

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
more intensive animals and their brother

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.050 
more intensive animals and their brother
seems<00:01:24.800> to<00:01:24.950> be<00:01:25.100> some<00:01:25.340> sort<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.580> relationship

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
seems to be some sort of relationship

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.390 
seems to be some sort of relationship
between<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.540> brown<00:01:26.810> coloration<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:28.310> the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
between the brown coloration and the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.249 
between the brown coloration and the
darkness<00:01:28.759> of<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.240> saddles<00:01:29.630> are<00:01:29.780> the<00:01:29.869> normals

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
darkness of the saddles are the normals

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.350 
darkness of the saddles are the normals
and<00:01:30.500> the<00:01:30.800> really<00:01:31.310> really<00:01:31.460> painted<00:01:31.970> lipstick

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and the really really painted lipstick

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.899 
and the really really painted lipstick
red<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.780> albino

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
red in the albino

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.279 
red in the albino
what's<00:01:34.390> really<00:01:34.570> interesting<00:01:34.780> is<00:01:35.109> sometimes

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:35.289 
what's really interesting is sometimes

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.529 
what's really interesting is sometimes
they<00:01:35.560> get<00:01:35.679> very<00:01:35.950> very<00:01:36.189> red<00:01:36.490> albino<00:01:36.850> babies<00:01:37.359> out

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
they get very very red albino babies out

00:01:37.539 --> 00:02:08.010 
they get very very red albino babies out
of<00:01:37.569> went<00:01:37.840> brown<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.469> very<00:01:38.710> dark

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.630 

and<00:02:09.020> these<00:02:09.380> are<00:02:09.530> actually<00:02:09.800> from<00:02:09.950> just

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
and these are actually from just

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.570 
and these are actually from just
emissions<00:02:11.060> extreme<00:02:11.569> line<00:02:11.860> which<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.099> got<00:02:13.280> into

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
emissions extreme line which I got into

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.729 
emissions extreme line which I got into
in<00:02:13.670> about<00:02:13.880> 2006<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.989> then<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.140> helped<00:02:15.410> frost

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
in about 2006 and then I helped frost

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.880 
in about 2006 and then I helped frost
some<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.310> my<00:02:16.430> f<00:02:17.239> ones<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:17.810> wild<00:02:18.140> type<00:02:18.350> to

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
some of my f ones for wild type to

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.370 
some of my f ones for wild type to
produce<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.400> little<00:02:20.000> line<00:02:20.180> of<00:02:20.420> snakes<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.200> you

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
produce a little line of snakes that you

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.140 
produce a little line of snakes that you
know<00:02:21.590> they're<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:21.739> as<00:02:22.010> red<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.700> some<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.060> the

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
know they're not as red as some of the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.580 
know they're not as red as some of the
really<00:02:23.450> intense<00:02:23.720> reds<00:02:24.080> but<00:02:24.230> they're<00:02:24.380> very

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
really intense reds but they're very

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.770 
really intense reds but they're very
consistent<00:02:25.069> red<00:02:25.610> breeders<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.480> they<00:02:26.630> produce

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
consistent red breeders and they produce

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.960 
consistent red breeders and they produce
these<00:02:27.080> nice<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.890> know<00:02:28.010> red<00:02:28.220> tones<00:02:28.519> which<00:02:28.819> when

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
these nice you know red tones which when

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.520 
these nice you know red tones which when
you<00:02:29.060> compare<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.480> to<00:02:29.510> say<00:02:29.870> you<00:02:30.110> know<00:02:30.410> what

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
you compare it to say you know what

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.220 
you compare it to say you know what
normal<00:02:30.980> here<00:02:31.670> we<00:02:31.849> grab<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> normal<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:33.080> can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
normal here we grab the normal you can

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.630 
normal here we grab the normal you can
definitely<00:02:33.470> see<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.069> difference<00:02:34.100> between

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
definitely see the difference between

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.820 
definitely see the difference between
what<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> wild<00:02:35.269> type<00:02:35.569> hog<00:02:35.810> nose<00:02:36.019> looks<00:02:36.350> like<00:02:36.410> and

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
what a wild type hog nose looks like and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.940 
what a wild type hog nose looks like and
the<00:02:37.370> red<00:02:37.550> looks<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.380> then<00:02:39.739> one<00:02:39.860> of

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the red looks like and and then one of

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.050 
the red looks like and and then one of
the<00:02:40.040> really<00:02:40.370> exciting<00:02:40.459> things<00:02:40.760> that's

the really exciting things that's
happening<00:02:41.360> in<00:02:41.450> hog<00:02:41.569> nose<00:02:41.750> right<00:02:41.989> now<00:02:42.170> is<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
happening in hog nose right now is the

the comparison of the three of those
there<00:02:56.870> that's<00:02:57.110> they<00:02:57.290> almost<00:02:57.410> play<00:02:57.680> different

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
there that's they almost play different

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.250 
there that's they almost play different

gene<00:03:00.560> seems<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.310> work<00:03:01.489> about<00:03:01.819> like<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.180> red

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
gene seems to work about like the red

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.059 
gene seems to work about like the red
team<00:03:02.600> does<00:03:02.870> but<00:03:03.319> maybe<00:03:03.470> with<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> little<00:03:03.950> bit

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
team does but maybe with a little bit

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.979 
team does but maybe with a little bit
more<00:03:04.220> dominance<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:04.880> its<00:03:05.000> inheritance<00:03:05.510> but

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
more dominance in its inheritance but

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.420 
more dominance in its inheritance but
what<00:03:06.109> it<00:03:06.200> does<00:03:06.350> is<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.650> actually<00:03:06.769> causes<00:03:07.400> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
what it does is it actually causes the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.839 
what it does is it actually causes the
the<00:03:08.420> dorsal<00:03:08.900> patterns

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
the dorsal patterns

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.640 
the dorsal patterns
most<00:03:10.329> of<00:03:10.480> its<00:03:10.599> melanin<00:03:11.049> in<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.230> day<00:03:11.379> that<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
most of its melanin in the day that is

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.089 
most of its melanin in the day that is
kind<00:03:11.859> of<00:03:11.920> grayish<00:03:12.340> ghostly<00:03:13.499> leftover<00:03:14.499> and<00:03:14.709> you

kind of grayish ghostly leftover and you
know<00:03:15.219> this<00:03:15.370> animals<00:03:15.700> only<00:03:15.819> had<00:03:15.969> one<00:03:16.180> shed

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
know this animals only had one shed

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.170 
know this animals only had one shed
since<00:03:16.780> attach<00:03:17.139> and<00:03:17.769> it<00:03:18.129> once<00:03:18.489> every<00:03:18.849> time<00:03:19.060> it

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
since attach and it once every time it

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.879 
since attach and it once every time it
sheds<00:03:19.389> will<00:03:19.540> actually<00:03:19.810> get<00:03:19.870> lighter<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.499> then

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
sheds will actually get lighter and then

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.949 
sheds will actually get lighter and then
the<00:03:21.010> ground<00:03:21.189> color<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.939> glowing<00:03:22.480> yellow

the ground color is this glowing yellow
and<00:03:23.379> green<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.859> then<00:03:24.099> the<00:03:24.310> older<00:03:24.609> they<00:03:24.730> get

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
and green and then the older they get

00:03:24.909 --> 00:04:02.869 
and green and then the older they get
generally<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.629> brighter<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.319> green

and then one other cool feature of the

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.670 
and then one other cool feature of the
lemon<00:04:06.180> ghost<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.540> the<00:04:06.660> belly<00:04:06.870> now<00:04:07.410> these<00:04:07.530> are

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
neat about the about the gust is it a is

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.310 
neat about the about the gust is it a is
it<00:04:39.280> a<00:04:39.340> kind<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:39.850> hypo<00:04:40.240> like<00:04:40.420> it<00:04:40.570> is<00:04:40.660> they<00:04:41.140> call

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
it a kind of a hypo like it is they call

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.920 
it a kind of a hypo like it is they call
it<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.530> lemon<00:04:41.800> hypo<00:04:42.130> or<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.460> lemon<00:04:42.790> ghost<00:04:43.180> and<00:04:43.630> you

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
it a lemon hypo or a lemon ghost and you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.590 
it a lemon hypo or a lemon ghost and you
know<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:45.040> my<00:04:45.280> experience<00:04:45.850> thus<00:04:46.090> far<00:04:46.120> it

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
know it's in my experience thus far it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.200 
know it's in my experience thus far it
seems<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.990> be<00:04:47.110> dominant<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.030> actually<00:04:49.030> this

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
seems to be dominant so actually this

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.970 
seems to be dominant so actually this
animal<00:04:49.690> was<00:04:49.810> produced<00:04:50.200> from<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.530> lemon<00:04:50.710> go

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:50.980 
animal was produced from a lemon go

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.710 
animal was produced from a lemon go
spread<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.550> what<00:04:51.790> is<00:04:51.880> basically<00:04:52.420> a<00:04:52.510> normal

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
spread to what is basically a normal

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.420 
spread to what is basically a normal
snake<00:04:53.140> and<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.590> then<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.860> babies<00:04:54.130> have<00:04:54.250> come

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
snake and it then the babies have come

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.490 
snake and it then the babies have come
out<00:04:54.580> as<00:04:54.970> intense<00:04:55.480> or<00:04:55.630> more<00:04:55.810> intense<00:04:56.170> than

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
out as intense or more intense than

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.040 
out as intense or more intense than
their<00:04:56.710> father<00:04:56.920> who's<00:04:57.280> 11<00:04:57.610> goes<00:04:57.790> so<00:04:58.300> it<00:04:58.750> seems

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
their father who's 11 goes so it seems

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.170 
their father who's 11 goes so it seems
to<00:04:59.140> be<00:04:59.320> dominant<00:04:59.740> in<00:05:00.160> almost<00:05:00.640> every<00:05:00.940> cross

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
to be dominant in almost every cross

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.120 
to be dominant in almost every cross
that<00:05:01.360> I've<00:05:01.450> been<00:05:01.540> privy<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.900> but<00:05:02.620> more

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
that I've been privy to but more

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.860 
that I've been privy to but more
greediness<00:05:03.550> needed<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.150> really<00:05:04.360> show<00:05:04.600> how

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
greediness needed to really show how

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.130 
greediness needed to really show how
it's<00:05:05.110> gonna<00:05:05.230> inherit<00:05:06.040> with<00:05:06.580> what<00:05:06.850> is

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
it's gonna inherit with what is

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.690 
it's gonna inherit with what is
consistent<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.230> the<00:05:08.260> belly<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.980> not<00:05:09.040> as<00:05:09.460> yellow

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
consistent is the belly is not as yellow

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.120 
consistent is the belly is not as yellow
when<00:05:10.030> you<00:05:10.090> have<00:05:10.240> cross<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:11.020> so<00:05:11.500> maybe<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:12.040> the

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
when you have cross so so maybe that the

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.430 
when you have cross so so maybe that the
belly<00:05:12.400> has<00:05:12.700> some<00:05:12.940> sort<00:05:13.150> of<00:05:13.240> a<00:05:13.419> less<00:05:13.960> dominant

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
belly has some sort of a less dominant

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.280 
belly has some sort of a less dominant
component<00:05:15.010> to<00:05:15.310> it<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:16.150> in<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.419> back<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:17.080> back

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
component to it and in the back the back

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.690 
component to it and in the back the back
and<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.560> dorsal<00:05:17.890> pattern<00:05:18.160> of<00:05:18.250> that<00:05:18.310> melanin

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
and the dorsal pattern of that melanin

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:19.970 
and the dorsal pattern of that melanin
reduction<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.270> dom

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
reduction is dom

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.190 
reduction is dom
no<00:05:20.070> it<00:05:20.310> really<00:05:20.400> is<00:05:20.640> hard<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.910> say<00:05:21.120> the<00:05:22.080> way

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
no it really is hard to say the way

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.020 
no it really is hard to say the way
these<00:05:22.350> jeans<00:05:22.620> work<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.640> know<00:05:23.730> there<00:05:23.850> can<00:05:23.970> be

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
these jeans work you know there can be

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.090 
these jeans work you know there can be
like<00:05:24.210> you<00:05:24.360> said<00:05:24.570> Polly<00:05:24.810> Tina<00:05:25.080> taken<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.890> jeans

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
like you said Polly Tina taken the jeans

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.370 
like you said Polly Tina taken the jeans
can<00:05:26.250> interact<00:05:26.670> and<00:05:27.030> you<00:05:27.750> know<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:27.960> may<00:05:28.080> be<00:05:28.140> that

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
can interact and you know it may be that

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.640 
can interact and you know it may be that
there<00:05:28.560> are<00:05:28.800> two<00:05:29.370> or<00:05:29.520> three<00:05:29.610> different<00:05:29.760> genes

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
there are two or three different genes

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.570 
there are two or three different genes
interacting<00:05:31.650> of<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.830> snake<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.190> produced

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
interacting of the snake that produced

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.060 
interacting of the snake that produced
this<00:05:32.820> outcome<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:34.170> it<00:05:34.290> may<00:05:34.440> be<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.740> some<00:05:34.980> of

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
this outcome and it may be that some of

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.040 
this outcome and it may be that some of
those<00:05:35.130> genes<00:05:35.460> occur<00:05:35.970> in<00:05:36.180> some<00:05:36.510> wild-type

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
those genes occur in some wild-type

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.350 
those genes occur in some wild-type
snakes<00:05:37.500> already<00:05:37.890> yeah<00:05:38.490> like<00:05:38.880> when<00:05:39.030> I've<00:05:39.120> read

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
snakes already yeah like when I've read

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.270 
snakes already yeah like when I've read
this<00:05:39.480> lemon<00:05:39.810> goes<00:05:39.960> to<00:05:40.230> a<00:05:40.260> normal<00:05:40.740> my<00:05:41.010> thing

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
this lemon goes to a normal my thing

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.590 
this lemon goes to a normal my thing
they<00:05:41.460> have<00:05:41.550> already<00:05:41.820> had<00:05:41.970> two<00:05:42.360> of<00:05:42.480> the

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
they have already had two of the

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.060 
they have already had two of the
components<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.260> that's<00:05:43.380> why<00:05:43.530> I<00:05:43.560> got<00:05:43.800> a<00:05:43.830> lemon

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
components and that's why I got a lemon

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:46.100 
components and that's why I got a lemon
go<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.640> it'll<00:05:45.180> take<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.360> lot<00:05:45.540> more<00:05:45.600> breeding<00:05:46.020> to

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
go so it'll take a lot more breeding to

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.990 
go so it'll take a lot more breeding to
really<00:05:46.290> show<00:05:46.530> what's<00:05:46.800> happening<00:05:46.890> but<00:05:47.790> I<00:05:47.940> do

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
really show what's happening but I do

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.530 
really show what's happening but I do
know<00:05:48.240> this<00:05:48.390> these<00:05:48.690> snakes<00:05:48.900> are<00:05:49.020> sexy<00:05:50.540> awesome
