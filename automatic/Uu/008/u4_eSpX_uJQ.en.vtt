00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
just like use the spawns you know

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.929 
just like use the spawns you know
against<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> other<00:01:44.250> team<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.759> start

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.929 
controlling them but this game you know
I<00:01:46.590> guess<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.860> did<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.460> beginning<00:01:47.579> I

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
I guess I did kind of in the beginning I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.149 
I guess I did kind of in the beginning I
was<00:01:48.060> controlling<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> spawns<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.860> no<00:01:50.009> one's

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
was controlling the spawns like no one's

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.250 
was controlling the spawns like no one's
even<00:01:50.250> spawned<00:01:50.579> right<00:01:50.729> here

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
even spawned right here

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.150 
even spawned right here

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
143 you could really control the spawns

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.290 
143 you could really control the spawns
how<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:57.800> wanted<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.460> in<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.030> game<00:01:59.150> you
