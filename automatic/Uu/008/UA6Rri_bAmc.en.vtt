00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
want to glue on the very end one you

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.590 
want to glue on the very end one you
want<00:00:34.250> to<00:00:34.340> glue<00:00:34.520> it<00:00:34.550> on<00:00:34.700> top<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:35.240> you<00:00:35.330> want<00:00:35.510> to

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
glue it underneath to really secure it

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.850 
glue it underneath to really secure it
so<00:00:37.460> they<00:00:37.730> won't<00:00:37.940> slide<00:00:38.330> off<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.600> edge<00:00:39.020> so

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
so they won't slide off the edge so

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.010 
so they won't slide off the edge so
after<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.550> we'll<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:40.850> be<00:00:41.240> gluing<00:00:41.630> about

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
after that we'll just be gluing about

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.080 
after that we'll just be gluing about
every<00:00:42.290> other<00:00:42.320> one<00:00:42.710> on<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.100> very<00:00:43.340> end<00:00:43.670> dissolve

and<00:00:44.270> you're<00:00:44.720> going<00:00:44.900> to<00:00:45.080> weave<00:00:45.350> you're<00:00:45.800> just

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
and you're going to weave you're just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.830 
and you're going to weave you're just
going<00:00:46.220> to<00:00:46.310> go<00:00:46.460> in<00:00:46.490> and<00:00:46.850> out<00:00:47.030> whatever<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:47.660> did

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
going to go in and out whatever you did

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.090 
going to go in and out whatever you did
on<00:00:47.960> the<00:00:48.080> first<00:00:48.290> one<00:00:48.530> you're<00:00:48.650> going<00:00:48.860> to<00:00:48.920> go<00:00:49.040> to

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
on the first one you're going to go to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.770 
on the first one you're going to go to
the<00:00:49.250> opposite<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.000> then<00:00:50.360> we're<00:00:50.570> going<00:00:50.660> to

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
the opposite and then we're going to

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.350 
the opposite and then we're going to
take<00:00:50.930> them<00:00:51.050> slide<00:00:51.440> it<00:00:51.680> right<00:00:51.710> up<00:00:52.460> next<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:53.090> the

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
take them slide it right up next to the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.870 
take them slide it right up next to the
next<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:54.020> right<00:00:54.650> next<00:00:54.890> to<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.160> get<00:00:55.460> it<00:00:55.580> snug

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
next one right next to it get it snug

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.690 
next one right next to it get it snug
we're<00:00:56.450> going<00:00:56.600> to<00:00:56.660> add<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:56.840> dot<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.290> hot<00:00:57.800> glue<00:00:58.100> to

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
we're going to add a dot of hot glue to

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.270 
we're going to add a dot of hot glue to
the<00:00:58.730> very<00:00:59.120> tip<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.900> right<00:01:00.170> on<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.500> each<00:01:00.740> end

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
the very tip of it right on the each end

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.160 
the very tip of it right on the each end
of<00:01:01.640> these<00:01:01.760> about<00:01:02.120> every<00:01:02.450> other<00:01:02.480> strip<00:01:03.020> you

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
of these about every other strip you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.140 
of these about every other strip you
need<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.470> do<00:01:03.620> that<00:01:03.829> just<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.309> hold<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.970> there

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
need to do that just to hold it in there

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.500 
need to do that just to hold it in there
in<00:01:05.299> place<00:01:05.600> so<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.380> won't<00:01:06.590> slide<00:01:06.950> down<00:01:07.510> again

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
in place so it won't slide down again

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.090 
in place so it won't slide down again
we're<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:08.930> going<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.110> weave<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.530> in<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:09.950> out

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
we're just going to weave it in and out

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.670 
we're just going to weave it in and out
going<00:01:10.790> opposite<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.570> what<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.960> other<00:01:12.140> one<00:01:12.409> was

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
going opposite of what the other one was

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.530 
going opposite of what the other one was
and<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.190> can<00:01:13.310> see<00:01:13.490> how<00:01:13.580> fast<00:01:13.909> and<00:01:14.150> easy<00:01:14.360> this

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
and you can see how fast and easy this

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.720 
and you can see how fast and easy this
is<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.900> do<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.680> once<00:01:16.010> you<00:01:16.130> get<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.370> up<00:01:16.550> the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:16.730 
is to do and once you get it up the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.790 
is to do and once you get it up the
right<00:01:16.970> snug<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:17.780> edge<00:01:17.960> then<00:01:18.470> grab<00:01:18.770> your

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
right snug to the edge then grab your

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.950 
right snug to the edge then grab your
hot<00:01:19.159> glue<00:01:19.370> gun<00:01:19.670> I<00:01:19.850> like<00:01:20.120> using<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.750> low

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
hot glue gun I like using the low

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.360 
hot glue gun I like using the low
temperature<00:01:21.260> and<00:01:21.710> then<00:01:21.800> I<00:01:21.830> don't<00:01:22.100> burn<00:01:22.310> myself

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
temperature and then I don't burn myself

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.719 
temperature and then I don't burn myself
as<00:01:23.000> often<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.690> works<00:01:24.050> great<00:01:24.380> it<00:01:24.590> it<00:01:24.920> hears<00:01:25.490> and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
as often it works great it it hears and

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.760 
as often it works great it it hears and
sticks<00:01:26.030> really<00:01:26.360> good<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.020> just<00:01:27.260> kind<00:01:27.470> of<00:01:27.530> put<00:01:27.740> a

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
sticks really good so just kind of put a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.320 
sticks really good so just kind of put a
little<00:01:27.950> dab<00:01:28.250> right<00:01:28.610> there<00:01:28.850> underneath<00:01:29.180> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
little dab right there underneath the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.300 
little dab right there underneath the
black<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.110> on<00:01:30.320> this<00:01:30.470> end<00:01:30.740> I'm<00:01:30.860> going<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.070> put<00:01:31.280> a

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
black and on this end I'm going to put a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.250 
black and on this end I'm going to put a
dot<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.240> on<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.479> black<00:01:32.659> and<00:01:32.930> lay<00:01:33.110> the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
dot just right on the black and lay the

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
and then we're just going to lay it in

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.240 
and then we're just going to lay it in
there<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.510> boy<00:02:50.960> I've<00:02:51.230> switched<00:02:51.530> my<00:02:51.830> hot<00:02:52.070> glue

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
there and boy I've switched my hot glue

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.280 
there and boy I've switched my hot glue
gun<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:52.970> I<00:02:53.000> go<00:02:53.240> again<00:02:53.270> I<00:02:53.630> burnt<00:02:54.080> myself

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
gun and here I go again I burnt myself

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.110 
gun and here I go again I burnt myself
again<00:02:54.920> that's<00:02:55.340> why<00:02:55.520> I<00:02:55.550> like<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> low
