in<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> charger<00:00:52.920> but<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> think<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
in with a charger but I think they have

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.010 
in with a charger but I think they have
another<00:00:53.820> one<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.300> coming<00:00:54.570> out<00:00:54.690> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
another one that they're coming out that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.910 
another one that they're coming out that
have

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
have

have
you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.280> same<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:56.730> just<00:00:56.940> less<00:00:57.210> power<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.750> so

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you know same one just less power so so

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.259 
you know same one just less power so so
far<00:00:57.899> other<00:00:58.230> devices<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.829> far<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.550> this<00:01:00.059> would

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
far other devices are far and this would

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.610 
far other devices are far and this would
help<00:01:00.449> great

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
help great

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.350 
help great

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
so I noticed that these are doing the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420 
so I noticed that these are doing the
DisplayPort<00:01:05.049> whereas<00:01:05.379> before<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.890> sony<00:01:06.159> ones

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
DisplayPort whereas before the sony ones

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.510 
DisplayPort whereas before the sony ones

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.040 
can we do a speedtest real quick my mom
is<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.100> ready<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.399> go<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.700> yeah<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:57.869> well

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.050 
is this ready to go or yeah it's well

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.660 
is this ready to go or yeah it's well
it's<00:01:58.200> basically<00:01:58.530> kind<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.830> running<00:01:59.100> in<00:01:59.190> silica

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
it's basically kind of running in silica

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.400 
it's basically kind of running in silica
and<00:02:00.119> these<00:02:00.330> have<00:02:00.479> actually<00:02:00.869> changed<00:02:01.080> since

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
and these have actually changed since

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.630 
and these have actually changed since
I've<00:02:01.560> been<00:02:01.830> painting<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.250> last<00:02:02.429> five

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
I've been painting in the last five

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.210 
I've been painting in the last five
minutes<00:02:02.910> and<00:02:03.119> it's<00:02:03.240> morphin<00:02:03.810> 677<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.770 

because<00:02:09.220> this<00:02:09.490> difference<00:02:09.910> there<00:02:10.690> are

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
because this difference there are

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.560 
because this difference there are
different<00:02:11.940> applications<00:02:12.940> running<00:02:13.240> at<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
different applications running at the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.650 
different applications running at the
same<00:02:13.780> time<00:02:14.100> and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
same time and

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.180 
same time and
he's<00:02:16.170> even<00:02:16.410> got<00:02:16.560> his<00:02:16.770> awareness<00:02:17.040> 702

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.130 

it<00:02:20.310> really<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.880> depends<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.390> how<00:02:21.630> much<00:02:21.870> it's

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
it really just depends on how much it's

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
it really just depends on how much it's
raining<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.740> reading<00:02:23.550> all<00:02:23.670> day<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.240> we

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
raining and reading all day so we

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
raining and reading all day so we
changed<00:02:24.900> something<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.320> here<00:02:25.620> against<00:02:26.040> them

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
changed something on here against them

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.240 
changed something on here against them
okay<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> optical<00:02:27.860> doesn't<00:02:28.860> carry<00:02:29.040> power

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
okay and the optical doesn't carry power

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.130 
okay and the optical doesn't carry power
right

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
right

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.770 
right
they<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:31.770> decided<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.310> me<00:02:32.940> for<00:02:33.420> bus<00:02:33.540> power

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
they really decided to me for bus power

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.620 
they really decided to me for bus power
right<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.140> couldn't<00:02:34.319> bust<00:02:34.530> power<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:36.090> have<00:02:36.120> we

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
right you couldn't bust power we have we

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.140 
right you couldn't bust power we have we
have<00:02:36.750> before<00:02:36.959> so<00:02:37.920> is<00:02:38.010> there<00:02:38.160> an<00:02:38.760> awesome<00:02:38.910> week

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
have before so is there an awesome week

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.420 
have before so is there an awesome week
are<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.360> talking<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.900> length<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:41.010> because<00:02:41.400> of

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
are you talking to length or because of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
are you talking to length or because of
the<00:02:42.110> topical<00:02:43.110> how<00:02:43.230> does<00:02:43.410> it<00:02:43.500> carry<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.800> charge

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
the topical how does it carry a charge

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.890 
the topical how does it carry a charge
the<00:02:44.790> power<00:02:44.970> thing<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:45.780> really<00:02:46.230> don't<00:02:46.380> know

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
the power thing I really don't know

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.660 
the power thing I really don't know
that's<00:02:48.900> fine<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:50.040> imagine<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.550> this

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
that's fine I just imagine that this

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.520 
that's fine I just imagine that this
probably<00:02:51.000> doesn't<00:02:51.060> carry<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.660> charge<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
probably doesn't carry a charge the

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.520 
probably doesn't carry a charge the
great<00:02:52.860> thing<00:02:52.890> about<00:02:53.250> this

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
great thing about this

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.890 
great thing about this
