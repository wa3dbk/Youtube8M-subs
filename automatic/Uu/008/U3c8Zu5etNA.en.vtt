00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.610 
of stuff that they like it was kind of
bit<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.790> learning<00:02:53.940> curve<00:02:54.150> for<00:02:54.750> me<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.170> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
bit of a learning curve for me and the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.170 
bit of a learning curve for me and the
thing<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:56.069> really<00:02:56.160> sticks<00:02:56.430> in<00:02:56.610> my<00:02:56.730> mind<00:02:57.000> that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
thing that really sticks in my mind that

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.730 
thing that really sticks in my mind that
I<00:02:57.240> really<00:02:57.630> had<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.200> kind<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.709> grips

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
I really had to kind of come to grips

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.120 
I really had to kind of come to grips
with<00:02:59.040> was<00:02:59.810> boyfriend's<00:03:00.840> I<00:03:00.990> was<00:03:01.530> counseled

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
with was boyfriend's I was counseled

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.130 
with was boyfriend's I was counseled
that<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.580> needed<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.120> create<00:03:03.360> some<00:03:03.690> sort<00:03:03.930> of

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that I needed to create some sort of

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.560 
that I needed to create some sort of
intimidation<00:03:04.980> force<00:03:05.490> on<00:03:05.670> it's<00:03:06.390> gonna<00:03:06.510> be

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
intimidation force on it's gonna be

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.360 
intimidation force on it's gonna be
tough<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.050> mean<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.290> see<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:07.650> size<00:03:07.920> most<00:03:08.280> of

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
tough I mean you see my size most of

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.340 
tough I mean you see my size most of
them<00:03:08.490> were<00:03:08.610> bigger<00:03:08.820> than<00:03:09.030> me<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.990> finally

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
them were bigger than me so I finally

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.770 
them were bigger than me so I finally
hit<00:03:10.650> on<00:03:10.830> this<00:03:11.040> technique<00:03:11.550> of<00:03:11.850> what<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> call<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
hit on this technique of what I call the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.250 
hit on this technique of what I call the
silent<00:03:13.560> guy

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
silent guy

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.809 
silent guy
and<00:03:14.349> what<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:14.830> ended<00:03:15.040> up<00:03:15.129> doing<00:03:15.190> when<00:03:15.550> they<00:03:15.640> came

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
and what I ended up doing when they came

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.910 
and what I ended up doing when they came
over<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.510> not<00:03:16.959> say<00:03:17.230> much<00:03:17.409> of<00:03:17.440> anything<00:03:17.769> can

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
over is not say much of anything can

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.559 
over is not say much of anything can
you'd<00:03:18.129> be<00:03:18.220> surprised<00:03:18.580> how<00:03:18.610> effective<00:03:18.909> that<00:03:19.299> is

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:19.569 
you'd be surprised how effective that is

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:21.059 
you'd be surprised how effective that is
they<00:03:19.840> don't<00:03:20.049> they<00:03:20.379> don't<00:03:20.500> know<00:03:20.650> what<00:03:20.890> you're

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
they don't they don't know what you're

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.880 
they don't they don't know what you're
thinking<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.879> works<00:03:22.540> pretty<00:03:22.720> well<00:03:22.840> but<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.680> you

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
thinking it works pretty well but as you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.250 
thinking it works pretty well but as you
can<00:03:24.010> see<00:03:24.069> somebody<00:03:24.879> broke<00:03:25.299> my<00:03:25.510> code<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:25.840> here

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
can see somebody broke my code and here

00:03:26.260 --> 00:04:27.290 
can see somebody broke my code and here
we<00:03:26.379> are<00:03:26.409> today

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.300 

Oh
