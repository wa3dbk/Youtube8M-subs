the movies and the only one that had a

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.680 
the movies and the only one that had a
good<00:02:45.500> rating<00:02:45.769> was<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.310> first<00:02:46.580> one<00:02:46.880> and<00:02:47.090> then<00:02:47.390> a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
good rating was the first one and then a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.030 
good rating was the first one and then a
couple<00:02:47.900> others<00:02:48.290> i<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.650> which<00:02:48.799> ones

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
couple others i don't know which ones

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.880

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.960 
but just a couple others had decent
ratings<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.400> then<00:02:52.489> all<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.670> rest<00:02:52.790> of<00:02:52.910> them

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970
