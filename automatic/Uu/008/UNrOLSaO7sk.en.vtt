00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
make sure you don't get glue it in a

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:24.700 
make sure you don't get glue it in a
battery<00:04:16.190> pack<00:04:16.370> area<00:04:16.940> of<00:04:17.180> your<00:04:17.360> control<00:04:23.710> like

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
battery pack area of your control like

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.280 
battery pack area of your control like
so<00:04:25.180> let<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.270> come<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.570> settle<00:04:26.720> first<00:04:26.990> on<00:04:27.200> the

so let it come and settle first on the
back<00:04:27.530> and<00:04:27.950> then<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.580> can<00:04:28.670> see<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:28.970> you<00:04:29.030> have

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
back and then you can see that you have

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.330 
back and then you can see that you have
more<00:04:29.480> space<00:04:29.780> to<00:04:29.840> do<00:04:30.110> more<00:04:30.350> and<00:04:30.470> just<00:04:30.560> don't<00:04:31.190> put

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
more space to do more and just don't put

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.940 
more space to do more and just don't put
the<00:04:31.460> gun<00:04:31.640> tip<00:04:31.850> in<00:04:32.060> s<00:04:32.240> far<00:04:32.450> or<00:04:33.170> get<00:04:33.410> more<00:04:33.590> glue<00:04:33.830> in

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
the gun tip in s far or get more glue in

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.830 
the gun tip in s far or get more glue in

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
controller sit for about roughly an hour

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.870 
controller sit for about roughly an hour
to<00:04:52.700> an<00:04:52.910> hour<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.270> half<00:04:53.450> alright<00:04:54.280> so<00:04:55.280> after
