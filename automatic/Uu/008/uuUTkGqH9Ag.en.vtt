00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 it is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
 not 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.580
 and then the youtube bar here on vacation and 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.230
 dense and that back a long time that I 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 I do not comment on you here, I'm going to give 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.640
 an explanation of himself for the last 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 video that I posted that were back to class 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.590
 and already must have a notion is that like me 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.590
 I spoke my life is very complicated 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.780
 mainly because of college is and 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 all these other things in the third year 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.040
 and I really want to do a college 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.290
 I want to spend a quiet year so everything 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.559
 was studied a little higher and trying to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.019
 one is to prioritize my time with things 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.320
 that I really think are important and 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.059
 the channel is it got stopped these times 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.699
 that I trying to get used to a little 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 with the return of the classes and all this I did 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.299
 my tasks all over and now I am 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.290
 a little quieter going into the 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:06.570
 time of proof but I know that even 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 and the third the year then review 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.750
 There are several things I can remember. 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.850
 the first and second year because at least in the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.110
 code study are not common are in the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.400
 the general type out there but the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 matter that I study in the first and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 second it sort of divides from type to 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.620
 that a normal person unfolds 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.690
 generosity in three years of study in 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.620
 Almost an entire year of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.380
 little school 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.530
 so to speak so do not have to work alone 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.690
 class type review revision proof review 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.300
 simulated proof 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.830
 It was a tricky choice, but I'm 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.040
 able to help my time and 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.320
 thankfully and I have not played code 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.940
 Last I last played code was 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.250
 The last day I posted my video 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.250
 then you have a sense of how much time 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.380
 I 'm without throwing the cosmo I go back 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.840
 A friend of mine even bought the code I 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.750
 I'm going back, I need to play with her. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.630
 she play because she is and I teach her to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.489
 play back to court that mansi stay 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
 three weeks without playing from here 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.790
 a short time because handling these 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.290
 things one thing that already has head 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 usually but look so much 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.720
 again all that my God will take is 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.700
 sting if these things I also had to 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.950
 stop doing everything i've been playing in 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.739
 flash book - a time 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.239
 I have a friend of mine, hd is him 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.519
 said to me that he some ideas of the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.530
 for beginners of league that has 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.830
 because it was not the people in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.680
 comparison with the code is a game that 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:43.440
 requires very much reasoning and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.690
 knowledge of the game so great for 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.340
 have notion I'm four-goal playing 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.019
 robotics without stopping 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.380
 the ranking he can already sign four 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:55.110
 so an example has a ranking of 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.819
 dolo of the code - that same style only 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.670
 that when you get level 30 on uol 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.560
 you release from the stepdaughter and delay 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.690
 possible 30 believe 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
 and when you release the match at home 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.530
 You have ten matches that will be the 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.660
 you can pick up a 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.799
 bronze silver and if you win all you can 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.680
 catch gold is divided into 1 from 5 to 15 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.980
 being the worst and one the best undivided 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.769
 stock then goes kind of silver 5 4 3 2 1 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.690
 and for you to change silver five silver 4 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.709
 Do you want to join the mp3 in the best of 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.079
 three 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.690
 and for you to pass on silver gold 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.420
 silver type one and five others have to 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.160
 do my best out of five so it's alright 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.680
 complicated but it's really fun to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.600
 play but as I said, I 'm going to play again 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.280
 code and tomorrow you already have a video 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 prepared for you to play live on my 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 first match live 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.780
 after so long that I was without 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.209
 Can you play and yes I will post zombies? 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.470
 I'll post all things and I promised you 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.450
 for you on the invitations only 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 unfortunately I did not because I started 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.459
 to study with that, so I'm going out a lot 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.510
 From home, I'm enjoying life like this. 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:06.829
 say no carnival everything else does not stop at 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.829
 house to do things not much 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.829
 recommended 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.769
 I would like to know and let us 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.880
 comments you made on the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.070
 carnival of you 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.590
 Please do not tell me you're at home where 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.930
 I played for let's go, shallow people, let's go 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.340
 the cabin discuss themes such as 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.050
 kurt wheels 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.900
 I hope you have enjoyed the carnival of 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.840
 You're going on a holiday because now 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.710
 now at least he's back to school and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.599
 I know that now I think it is today - 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.270
 second in the whole brazil will only vote 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:40.040
 So 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.500
 to the soles at least I think today to 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.610
 everyone came back and again 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.440
 question that I did in the last video 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.340
 how is the college of 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.050
 you 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.720
 Whoever graduated from college wants to know who 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.800
 already graduated because I graduated this 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.710
 ay ay, it's a little complicated 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.660
 think that for the whole routine of life that 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.200
 there were all the people who saw each other 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.470
 daily will not see more now type 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.600
 after this difficulty in what comes 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.620
 If you start all over again in the 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:15.680
 college is one that's complicated to think 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.720
 How is this the best and how did I say it? 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.480
 intends to do marketing but still has 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.430
 doubt incredibly last whole year 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.170
 I stayed but I will not do marketing or 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.140
 do marketing and arrive at the third 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:31.790
 come the doubt will be that I want to be that 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:33.500
 just want to make history and reform 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.320
 new stadiums and lyrics is what I want 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:41.540
 just really dedicate myself to writing you 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.300
 They want to make the future of you guys see 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.400
 in the previous video but I want to know 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.200
 new is emerging that if it were not a 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.290
 future of you who need everything else 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.770
 but someone may have come to an end and was 

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.490
 there that 53 giant that playing with mp 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.530
 11 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.570
 No, the technician did not remember. 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.460
 I remembered it was very old 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.640
 in the year I hope you are enjoying the video 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.400
 and courses with the back of the dn gives us a 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.660
 back so big because I stayed two 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:13.370
 weeks off 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:16.220
 so to say and until the eighth that I had 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.750
 I read these days if good does not talk but 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.730
 more or less this at the end of the video is 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.920
 because it's not good, but that's it 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.350
 gentlemen not tanned you liked it 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.090
 won and if possible with this your 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.800
 comment a favorite 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.010
 It's more or less that I'm staying for 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.050
 here I spoke until the next unit 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.050
 I gave youtube and went
