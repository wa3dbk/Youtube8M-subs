00:00:38.669 --> 00:00:38.679 
is a monster egg but the funny part is

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.419 
is a monster egg but the funny part is
really<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:40.149> egg<00:00:40.479> weighs<00:00:40.719> 700<00:00:41.140> grams<00:00:41.589> this

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
really this egg weighs 700 grams this

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.229 
really this egg weighs 700 grams this
one<00:00:42.670> weighs<00:00:42.850> 180<00:00:43.420> grams<00:00:44.819> honestly<00:00:45.819> the<00:00:45.940> snakes

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
one weighs 180 grams honestly the snakes

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.239 
one weighs 180 grams honestly the snakes
could<00:00:46.510> probably<00:00:46.749> be<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:46.989> same<00:00:47.229> size<00:00:47.499> what

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
could probably be the same size what

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.879 
could probably be the same size what
happens<00:00:48.609> is<00:00:48.789> they<00:00:49.479> they<00:00:49.870> pick<00:00:50.170> up<00:00:50.319> moisture<00:00:50.739> so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:50.889 
happens is they they pick up moisture so

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:52.469 
happens is they they pick up moisture so
this<00:00:51.039> one<00:00:51.190> got<00:00:51.370> bedded<00:00:51.789> in<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:51.969> water<00:00:52.179> and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
this one got bedded in the water and

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.509 
this one got bedded in the water and
just<00:00:53.049> drank<00:00:53.289> water<00:00:53.409> its<00:00:53.829> entire<00:00:54.100> time<00:00:54.370> and

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
just drank water its entire time and

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.520 
just drank water its entire time and
that's<00:00:54.670> why<00:00:54.819> eggs<00:00:55.059> are<00:00:55.239> stretchable<00:00:55.839> now

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
that's why eggs are stretchable now

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.930 
that's why eggs are stretchable now
normally<00:00:57.069> they<00:00:57.190> collapse<00:00:57.519> a<00:00:57.639> little<00:00:57.729> bit

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
normally they collapse a little bit

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.759 
normally they collapse a little bit
right<00:00:58.059> before<00:00:58.209> but<00:00:58.600> we've<00:00:59.079> decided<00:00:59.440> to<00:00:59.559> run

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769
