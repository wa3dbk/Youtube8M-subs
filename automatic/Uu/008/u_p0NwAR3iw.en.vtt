later<00:00:34.950> taking<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.940> mountains<00:00:36.329> tracks

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
later taking in the mountains tracks

that<00:00:37.380> people<00:00:37.620> have<00:00:37.710> never<00:00:37.950> even<00:00:38.070> gone<00:00:38.489> up

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
that people have never even gone up

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.420 
that people have never even gone up
unless<00:00:38.820> you're<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.239> sheep<00:00:39.719> farmer<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> goat

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
unless you're a sheep farmer or a goat

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.850 
unless you're a sheep farmer or a goat
herder<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.910> wouldn't<00:00:42.149> go<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.360> these<00:00:42.540> things

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
herder you wouldn't go up these things

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.290 
herder you wouldn't go up these things
so<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> original<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> best<00:00:45.149> in

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
so it is the original and the best in

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.150 
so it is the original and the best in
many<00:00:45.450> people's<00:00:45.750> opinions<00:00:46.410> up<00:00:46.590> some<00:00:46.950> people

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
me like the Tour of Spain for different

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
me like the Tour of Spain for different
reasons<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.239> it's<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.360> most<00:00:51.510> important<00:00:52.020> race

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
reasons but it's the most important race

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
reasons but it's the most important race
in<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.440> Canon<00:00:52.739> there<00:00:52.890> always<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.250> been<00:00:53.489> and

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
in the Canon there always has been and

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.369 
in the Canon there always has been and
probably<00:00:53.940> always<00:00:54.329> will<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.079> tour<00:00:55.260> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
probably always will be the tour of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.170 
probably always will be the tour of
France<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> last<00:00:56.699> 10-15

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
France is the one in the last 10-15

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.990 
France is the one in the last 10-15
years<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.870> think<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> started<00:00:59.850> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
years I think from the time I started in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.930 
years I think from the time I started in
the<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.350> early<00:01:01.379> 70s<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> tour<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.699> France

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the in the early 70s the tour or France

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.090 
the in the early 70s the tour or France
and<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> -<00:01:03.329> obviously<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.899> difference<00:01:04.379> in

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
and the - obviously the difference in

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800 
and the - obviously the difference in
interest<00:01:05.519> wasn't<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.030> great<00:01:06.299> where<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> is

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
interest wasn't that great where it is

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.810 
interest wasn't that great where it is
huge<00:01:07.080> now<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> tour<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> France<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.250> event
