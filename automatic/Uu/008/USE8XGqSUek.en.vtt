00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.279
 Hello in this video I would like 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.160
 show how to use a screen 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.070
 device like the spyder 3 per calibrated 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.660
 So it looks from that we succeed 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.530
 will use the now that 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.780
 both 3 per the software I have 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.630
 already started i want this 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:30.140
 Captain man budget as the model a multi 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.699
 So I have 27 11 wants the 2711 shop 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.880
 I calibrate that is also a wild one 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.850
 girls screen that dominates now 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:40.250
 that both 3 per model already the 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.910
 older not so far as I know and lay 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.010
 Let's go 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.649
 So important is that the screen 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.969
 half an hour before already running 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.760
 to keep things warm 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.130
 that the ambient lighting is about 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.450
 is the same as when we work now 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.510
 Now we turn and best set the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.370
 all monika settings back and forth 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.280
 of course you have to connect the device 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 and then we'll continue 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.720
 I will now only recall 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.360
 perform as it does not 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.150
 I calibrate again 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:20.840
 a-tec karl is only looked if the 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.540
 Calibration true success is a 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.080
 completely new calibration performed 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 that takes a little longer 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.240
 Here you have to look like the duo monika 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.430
 sitter 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.979
 as you can between were two months 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.030
 I'll take the eu 27 11 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.270
 because even the appliance they 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.830
 Of course I want to calibrate 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.790
 here so default settings taken 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.180
 gamal 2.2 to 6.500 kelvin and the 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.490
 brightness at 120 that fits most 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.869
 they 're about to do everything to me 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.850
 about further settings 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.399
 but I have ambient lighting 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.720
 I turned it off because that's me 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.340
 extremely strong at the 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.010
 I already have that too 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.380
 ambient lighting and once done 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.050
 my light turns on or the window 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.720
 opens comes no warning is the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.850
 calibrated that's behind it 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.350
 as though very well then everyday not 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.260
 very good to use 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.780
 that's why I made that up and me 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.710
 use that for a long time 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.320
 no problems at all 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.670
 as nuclear continues now here 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.630
 a picture where you get a device now 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.440
 that's what we should be now 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.690
 open 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.780
 best one tilted screen 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.680
 a bit back and here one 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.959
 counterweight and you see and that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.410
 is just the discrete hanging 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.150
 can 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:03:00.410
 and can lay close attention that I have 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:03.410
 was excited keep pushing and already 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:08.120
 the measurement is running now you have to 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.680
 Wait and the device is and is too 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.350
 let it be done by his things 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.910
 now in the beginning you can still one 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.140
 make some adjustments now is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.230
 I really want to add too 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.560
 that at this screen chamber too 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.530
 on the screen itself the rgb so red 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.720
 set blue green regulator 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.280
 many screens can not do that 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.920
 better screen all actually 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:37.700
 and that's why it comes now 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.390
 Menu on the luminance you see 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.470
 it worth my goal at 220, the current 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.570
 is a tick higher reputedly subordinate 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:53.330
 even its contrast or remains 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.070
 one down and then through 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.660
 update sunday about 122 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.930
 sufficient I think even now am 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:08.200
 I on 190 3 that fits in kelvin worth 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:11.150
 You can see that I am at 6,552 to 6,500 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.930
 and of course I want that better too 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.930
 hinbekommen 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.160
 Now I'm here on the screen and 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.620
 because the screen also has a rgb 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.310
 Riegler, I'll be right here 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.140
 it looks like honored 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.100
 tick too high 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:34.940
 Let's see if it's better 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.100
 of 6500 can never hit exactly 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.480
 now extremely close to it 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.540
 at 6,400 53 that you're worried about 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.340
 buther with darker 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.590
 I'll get that up again 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.650
 put 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:57.680
 you have to fit now and should be normal 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.080
 it now fits exactly now 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.630
 is back from 22 but that is now 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.210
 no matter 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.110
 Kelvin's worth is the color-deepest elders 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.340
 pretty much 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:12.919
 and there you can keep pushing 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.400
 Let's go and it works now 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.400
 easy 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.680
 So the calibration is done now 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.500
 there are measurements on the screen 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.450
 completed remove 23 and 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:39.360
 Click Finish do that 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:42.670
 I'm going to sit up again 100 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.690
 press finish and that was it 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.190
 actually already with Canada 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.170
 calibrations go to arms 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:52.530
 I'll just take the date 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.850
 Twenty-third Sutter 2 13 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.290
 and I have set so two 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.170
 weeks calibration to reminder 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:00.210
 most of the time I keep on doing it in the month 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:02.260
 to follow 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:07.000
 and here you can see the difference 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:09.430
 between before and after already one 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.470
 small difference the del monitor her 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.280
 they are very good anyway from home 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.960
 adjusted but with many monitors 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.550
 which are not already calibrated before 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.290
 you realize huge difference to 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.230
 example in which I left here 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.530
 stand from there I have enormous difference 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:30.250
 seen in constructing and that was it 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.750
 actually below came from Vienna 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.840
 display device calibrate 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.220
 I did not do that now and me 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.100
 I hope I could help you and 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.020
 if you ask questions you can ask in the quiet 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.560
 Write comments 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.560
 see you soon my job
