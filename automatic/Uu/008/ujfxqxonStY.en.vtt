00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 [Music] 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.570
 hello everybody, we're here on earth 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.180
 euro5 doing a search for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.250
 develop the master material for 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.660
 put this information to this copese 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.220
 the doctor online 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.460
 so when we do your research 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.720
 It revises item by item 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.630
 behavior of all components of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 all core strategies is how it is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.530
 that the sensors works so that people 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.370
 puts that information there information 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 you really need and reliable 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.050
 using this in this video that I go 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.239
 give an overview of this euro 5 mass and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.120
 show which are the main modules 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.360
 existing on the embedded electronics of this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.350
 vehicle and what are the probable 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 challenges where the repairer will 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 find in these modern vehicles 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.079
 Good, we are here on the master's part. 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.289
 take a look here 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:06.180
 here's her engine in this master's 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:10.590
 new 2014 and 2013 2014 euro5 she uses the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.780
 motor hemi 9 t 882 euros 5 ne 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.700
 then as the whole euro 5 she will have 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.970
 alisson broadband 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.369
 certain temperature sensor of the exhaust 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.210
 exhaust all vehicle details 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.430
 euro 5 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.040
 taking a look at the modules staff 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 here or in the central span box that this 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.979
 fuse box relays we have this 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 first module here, which is in the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.259
 fuse box here on top of the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.200
 waterfall 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.509
 this is the pc is a kind of 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
 power station, besides being a central 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.560
 electrical 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.600
 she communicates via redican with the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.270
 other modules then this new staff 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.399
 power station that the pc that is similar 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.100
 more or less there who is connected in 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.829
 new sprinter euro 5 that has there 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.840
 power plant called sam module is 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.049
 similar to the module are from sprinter 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.590
 similar to the base module and moan 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.509
 of the trucks actros né euro5 also has 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.270
 a power plant of this then one 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.459
 electric power plant is not 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.960
 a different thing that we have to 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.870
 learn to work with her 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.640
 li and in this power station there are three 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.110
 networks with different ne 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.580
 and if this control panel is not 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.080
 working does not work as the 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.500
 vehicle he does not get it right 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:29.220
 nor does it give a starting signal because even 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.570
 control of the starter is made 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.070
 by this power station after the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.560
 key recognition 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.080
 power plant that will power the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.060
 right engine and without the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.580
 electric same as the direct drive 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.390
 starting engine the vehicle does not handle 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.300
 so it's there 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.870
 this module the pc is that it is a new mode 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.300
 there is also the euro5 master 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.250
 conventional is the module of abs is that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.040
 many vehicles have né 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.680
 is not an optional et comes from being in the 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.140
 Mafia sure a peek inside here 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.870
 car inside the car we have the 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.120
 right panel panel that is also a module 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.370
 of the singer network is connected on the kan network 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 with the other modules we are 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.760
 giving everything here in the whole person 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.350
 disassembled here too 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.450
 that's right here so it is behind the box 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.380
 the fuse box here behind the 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.360
 fuses and royalty we already put 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.400
 down here until the central 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.650
 passenger compartment on this control unit of the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.740
 cockpit known as ch né to ch 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.050
 it acts as an immobilizer in the 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.420
 antenna attack of the starting world does not 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.940
 I know if you can see here the antenna of 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.980
 mobilizer ne and mobilizer antenna 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.290
 if you look at the diagram you will see that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.900
 it is linked not ch as it happens in 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.690
 many vehicles so renowned that the 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.600
 the mobilizer mode is the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.460
 immobilizer module in one of the 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.810
 anti- start system as it is known 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.570
 here in the french 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.360
 so if I turn the ch off it came too. 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.970
 it does not work like that if the ones and the gap is the 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.310
 immobilizer mode then without the pc and 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:12.180
 no skies works and gaia does not work 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.610
 not there are also several khan networks 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.489
 different then it's very important 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.560
 in these vehicles here staff learn to 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.480
 test the tania networks if I have one 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.790
 cac communication problem 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.520
 I will not be able to transmit the code 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.259
 of the key to the pc neither pro module 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.389
 Injection is the module of the 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:35.430
 electronic injection then we here 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.949
 we have as vital modules to ch to pc 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.930
 the electronic injection module and a 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.669
 innovative starting system was born not 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.139
 when he finds it a pity he did not have 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.800
 working had a problem the 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.169
 player 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.680
 he does not get it either, so it 's 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.800
 that's right 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.460
 the pc the ch control system 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.650
 injection a lot of embedded electronics 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.840
 this vehicle has seven field and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.380
 let's loose we have to learn to test 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.050
 the khan reds and learn to test all 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.180
 the sensors and actuators of the right system 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.400
 just out of curiosity also the pc too 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.710
 controls the personal wind blower and is 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.620
 controlled by relay who controls the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:16.080
 Relays is the pc on and down here and not 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.389
 I know, people can see down there and 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.419
 try to point out that the control unit 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.979
 electronic entertainment system 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.440
 certainly difficult to point out who is there 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.340
 right then command of the system 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:32.400
 electronic management euro5 beauty personal 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.349
 so this is it if you want to increase 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.830
 workshop productivity will increase the 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:39.960
 performance decreases the repair time of 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.539
 vehicles is to have a more precise repair 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.389
 think the encyclopedia doctor and think 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.550
 in the doctor's trainings and come to train 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.039
 with us there come to know the cycle asks 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.419
 You 'll be well taken care of by the 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.940
 by our staff for our staff 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.240
 personal beauty this was one more tip 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.630
 fast and doctor in the field thank you and until 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.630
 the next
