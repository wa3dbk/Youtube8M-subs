00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.430

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.459
 Turkey as I would like to continue with 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.950
 Turkish breakfast 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.920
 this recipe what I wanted to say now 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.780
 I actually do longer but 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.500
 I thought we were already doing that 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.960
 turkey where it gets it we too 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.860

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.000

 It is very much like eaten it 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.020
 normally eaten at noon 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 For this we need to feed this first 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.930
 Feed is also specially made by yourself 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 By the way, I'm with my cousin 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.600
 then we have church here extra for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.370
 Krupp does not do the reindeer now 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.340
 but you can also gouda with the gouda 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.399
 take or the turkish cheese from the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.110
 turkish load that zoff cheese then 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.989
 I have ever mae and that's how it works for him 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.580
 you can do a copper 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.880
 of course, a coated pan 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.940
 take but then the original will be in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 this suitcase flag will go as is 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.480
 First, the butter will melt 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.120
 to let 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.870
 It will be if you so about three tablespoons 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:27.460
 sugar is supposed to come now a glass of water 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.050
 so in about 200 milliliters of the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.390
 So you have to eat absolutely 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.880
 have the photo so far delicious and apps 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.010
 and sold from everywhere there is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.760
 Extra restaurants where you only krömer 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.070
 can eat 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.060
 Now we have another glass of water 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.440
 added 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:47.770
 it continues so that you have a total of 5 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:52.570
 600 milliliters of water 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.370
 so that is seasoned with salt 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.370
 The cover is now properly cooked 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.670
 Now we add maize flour and then 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:10.960
 so again, stirring constantly, he 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:13.600
 no lumps do not arise for 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.790
 a bit bad now i almost 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.500
 not for that one out I will 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.930
 Hope you can recognize that we will 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.170
 because as long as most to lead here 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.270
 is that a bit thick for itself 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.780
 is going to be as old as pudding 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.070
 it should look like it comes to an end 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 our cheese 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:38.850
 that will just be cut into small pieces 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.850
 and then put in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.640
 here is melted 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.510
 you can easily see it like that 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.540
 have about 500 grams of cheese 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.790
 added so to the end 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 we still a bit larger for 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:06.940
 bring melt 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:09.190
 That's about three tablespoons again 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.190
 really delicious I'm going for 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.630
 try you 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.840
 By the way, I will still give you more than one 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.000
 recipes from Turkey so send 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.940
 Mother is really called doing here 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.360
 cook properly 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.820
 the kitchen is right we do 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.310
 Unfortunately, the lighting conditions are not 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:36.430
 so good and here is still cooking our köhler 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:43.350
 Now the hot butter becomes easy 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.350
 given over and then again not 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.819
 and we can eat so now 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.450
 flag is simply placed in the middle 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.959
 and then you can dip flatbread 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.840
 and then eat so it will be original 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.700
 actually eaten so and the bread is 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.370
 just fun 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.239
 small now also tastes with the hands 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.340
 it best 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.500
 I hope it was fun while 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.870
