hi<00:00:01.770> friends<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:02.580> video<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.419> regarding<00:00:03.929> the

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
hi friends this video is regarding the

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.410 
hi friends this video is regarding the
benchmark<00:00:04.770> of<00:00:05.120> Micromax<00:00:06.230> f110<00:00:07.250> as<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.970> promised

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
benchmark of Micromax f110 as I promised

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.169 
benchmark of Micromax f110 as I promised
you<00:00:09.570> my<00:00:10.320> next<00:00:10.559> video<00:00:10.830> would<00:00:11.219> be<00:00:11.429> for<00:00:12.059> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
you my next video would be for the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.810 
you my next video would be for the
benchmarks<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.250> come

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
benchmarks so here I come

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.660 
benchmarks so here I come
with<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> benchmarks<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.929> have<00:00:16.770> customized<00:00:17.369> my

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
with the benchmarks I have customized my

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.170 
with the benchmarks I have customized my
phone<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.990> looked<00:00:19.350> like<00:00:19.520> galaxy<00:00:20.520> s3<00:00:23.180> first

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
phone and it looked like galaxy s3 first

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.800 
phone and it looked like galaxy s3 first
of<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.840> will<00:00:25.439> kill<00:00:25.740> all<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.670> tasks<00:00:26.970> which

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
of all I will kill all that tasks which

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.500 
of all I will kill all that tasks which
are<00:00:27.990> running<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.609> get<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> fair

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
are running so I can get the fair

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.020 
are running so I can get the fair
benchmark<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.070> fair<00:00:32.369> result<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
benchmark or the fair result of the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.430 
benchmark or the fair result of the
benchmarks<00:00:38.480> here<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> benchmark

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
benchmarks here is the benchmark

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.310 
benchmarks here is the benchmark
application

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:55.890 

they<00:00:46.890> aren't<00:00:47.100> fully<00:00:47.460> went<00:00:47.670> back

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:28.620 

it's<00:00:56.410> just<00:00:56.830> started<00:00:57.340> the<00:00:57.730> benchmark

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.490 

Bank<00:01:29.260> box<00:01:29.560> is<00:01:29.920> still<00:01:30.280> running<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:32.290> have<00:01:32.320> to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
Bank box is still running we have to

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.820 
Bank box is still running we have to
wait<00:01:32.740> for<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> few<00:01:33.430> minute<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.439> results

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
wait for a few minute and the results

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:51.990 
wait for a few minute and the results
will<00:01:35.950> be

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.380 

I<00:01:52.030> hope<00:01:52.690> you<00:01:52.930> can<00:01:53.110> see<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:55.770> 2535<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.880> two

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
I hope you can see it is 2535 it's two
