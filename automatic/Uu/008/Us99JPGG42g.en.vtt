we've<00:00:48.879> got<00:00:49.089> our<00:00:49.449> square<00:00:50.199> piece<00:00:50.409> of<00:00:50.589> paper<00:00:50.769> here

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
we've got our square piece of paper here

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.669 
we've got our square piece of paper here
now<00:00:51.609> with<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.030> color<00:00:52.239> side<00:00:52.510> facing<00:00:53.019> down<00:00:53.050> I'm

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
now with the color side facing down I'm

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:54.959 
now with the color side facing down I'm
just<00:00:53.739> going<00:00:53.980> to<00:00:54.010> go<00:00:54.159> ahead<00:00:54.219> and<00:00:54.370> fold<00:00:54.640> my<00:00:54.940> paper

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
just going to go ahead and fold my paper

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:01.229 
just going to go ahead and fold my paper
in<00:00:55.600> half<00:00:56.379> diagonally<00:00:59.550> open<00:01:00.550> it<00:01:00.640> up<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:00.999> then

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
in half diagonally open it up and then

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.000 
in half diagonally open it up and then
fold<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.659> other<00:01:01.780> way<00:01:02.050> go<00:01:02.260> ahead<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.649> keep<00:01:02.829> it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
fold the other way go ahead and keep it

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.950 
fold the other way go ahead and keep it
folded<00:01:03.309> in<00:01:03.609> half<00:01:03.819> the<00:01:04.150> second<00:01:04.570> time<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.900> you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
folded in half the second time that you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.590 
folded in half the second time that you
do<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.409> it's<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.430> nice<00:01:06.670> big<00:01:06.880> triangle<00:01:07.390> here

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
do this it's a nice big triangle here

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.780 
do this it's a nice big triangle here
and<00:01:07.780> then<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:09.310> want<00:01:09.550> to<00:01:09.640> go<00:01:09.730> ahead<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.150> take<00:01:11.790> all

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
and then I want to go ahead and take all

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.300 
and then I want to go ahead and take all
this<00:01:13.300> and<00:01:13.480> fold<00:01:13.690> it<00:01:13.810> over<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.620> about<00:01:14.860> 1/3

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
this and fold it over so it's about 1/3

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.760 
this and fold it over so it's about 1/3
of<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.520> way<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.330> can<00:01:16.360> kind<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.720> guess<00:01:16.960> how

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
of the way and you can kind of guess how

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.410 
of the way and you can kind of guess how
things<00:01:18.070> are<00:01:18.250> going<00:01:18.430> by<00:01:18.700> then<00:01:18.880> rolling<00:01:19.270> your

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
things are going by then rolling your

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.660 
things are going by then rolling your
paper<00:01:19.630> back<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:20.350> seeing<00:01:20.620> oh<00:01:20.890> maybe<00:01:21.310> that's<00:01:21.550> a

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
paper back and seeing oh maybe that's a

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.310 
paper back and seeing oh maybe that's a
little<00:01:21.700> too<00:01:21.850> far<00:01:22.240> so<00:01:22.540> I'll<00:01:22.630> roll<00:01:23.020> it<00:01:23.140> back<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
little too far so I'll roll it back a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.610 
little too far so I'll roll it back a
little<00:01:23.500> bit<00:01:23.910> more<00:01:24.910> here<00:01:25.390> about<00:01:25.990> about<00:01:26.380> the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
little bit more here about about the

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.560 
little bit more here about about the
same<00:01:29.190> looks<00:01:30.190> about<00:01:30.400> right<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:31.150> doesn't<00:01:31.390> have

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
same looks about right it doesn't have

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.940 
same looks about right it doesn't have
to<00:01:31.660> be<00:01:31.750> perfect<00:01:32.170> it's<00:01:32.350> just<00:01:32.410> more<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:32.890> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
to be perfect it's just more for a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.010 
to be perfect it's just more for a
balance<00:01:33.310> thing<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.850> kind<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.480> find<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.900> good

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
balance thing so kind of find a good

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.050 
balance thing so kind of find a good
spot<00:01:35.170> flip<00:01:35.680> it<00:01:35.800> over<00:01:35.890> for<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.250> second<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:36.850> then

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
spot flip it over for a second and then

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940 
spot flip it over for a second and then
just<00:01:37.090> make<00:01:37.450> sure<00:01:37.690> that<00:01:37.870> your<00:01:38.110> Center<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.620> lined

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
just make sure that your Center is lined

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.680 
just make sure that your Center is lined
up<00:01:39.130> because<00:01:39.220> it's<00:01:39.460> so<00:01:39.580> easy<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.940> get<00:01:40.150> this<00:01:40.390> part

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
up because it's so easy to get this part

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.720 
up because it's so easy to get this part
weird<00:01:40.930> so<00:01:41.650> if<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.920> your<00:01:42.070> Center<00:01:42.310> lined<00:01:42.580> up

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
weird so if you get your Center lined up

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.130 
weird so if you get your Center lined up
and<00:01:42.940> then<00:01:43.120> make<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> crease<00:01:43.630> everything

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
and then make the crease everything

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.470 
and then make the crease everything
should<00:01:44.350> look<00:01:44.470> pretty<00:01:44.770> good<00:01:45.150> they've<00:01:46.150> got<00:01:46.330> that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
should look pretty good they've got that

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.570 
should look pretty good they've got that
part<00:01:46.780> folded<00:01:47.170> over<00:01:47.260> then<00:01:48.130> I'm<00:01:48.190> going<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.370> take

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
part folded over then I'm going to take

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.610 
part folded over then I'm going to take
the<00:01:48.820> top<00:01:49.030> layer<00:01:49.300> and<00:01:49.630> fold<00:01:49.930> it<00:01:50.110> out<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.410> you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
the top layer and fold it out and you

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.130 
the top layer and fold it out and you
can<00:01:50.800> kind<00:01:51.010> of<00:01:51.040> choose<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:52.360> can<00:01:52.720> be<00:01:52.840> about

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
can kind of choose this can be about

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.110 
can kind of choose this can be about
right<00:01:53.410> in<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.680> center<00:01:54.010> probably<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.730> all<00:01:54.910> this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
right in the center probably of all this

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.870 
right in the center probably of all this
is<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> good<00:01:55.660> spot<00:01:55.960> fold<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:56.890> out<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.310> again

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
is a good spot fold that out and again

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.100 
is a good spot fold that out and again
if<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.090> will<00:01:58.210> make<00:01:58.330> sure<00:01:58.480> you're<00:01:58.600> folding<00:01:58.810> it

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
if you will make sure you're folding it

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.020 
if you will make sure you're folding it
across<00:01:59.590> straight<00:02:00.040> you<00:02:00.220> could<00:02:00.340> turn<00:02:00.520> over<00:02:00.580> and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
across straight you could turn over and

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.520 
across straight you could turn over and
just<00:02:01.210> make<00:02:01.360> sure<00:02:01.540> that<00:02:01.570> these<00:02:01.900> lines<00:02:02.230> are<00:02:02.440> all

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
just make sure that these lines are all

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.630 
just make sure that these lines are all
lining<00:02:02.800> up<00:02:03.040> here<00:02:03.250> good<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.940> center<00:02:05.640> then

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
lining up here good in the center then

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.890 
lining up here good in the center then
I'm<00:02:06.820> just<00:02:07.000> going<00:02:07.150> to<00:02:07.180> take<00:02:07.390> everything<00:02:07.660> and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
I'm just going to take everything and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.080 
I'm just going to take everything and
fold<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.349> in<00:02:08.440> half<00:02:08.470> right<00:02:08.890> on<00:02:09.069> that<00:02:09.190> crease

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.220 

get<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.180> turn<00:02:15.330> over<00:02:15.540> here<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.780> we've<00:02:15.870> got<00:02:16.050> that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
get it turn over here so we've got that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.580 
get it turn over here so we've got that
edge<00:02:16.770> now<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.520> top<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:19.230> I'm<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.530> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
edge now on the top and I'm going to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.330 
edge now on the top and I'm going to
take<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.989> flap<00:02:21.989> here<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> fold<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.040> up<00:02:23.190> to

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
take the flap here and fold it up to

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.610 
take the flap here and fold it up to
make<00:02:23.459> my<00:02:23.640> wing<00:02:23.849> now<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.630> want<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> be<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.500> an

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
make my wing now I want it to be at an

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.160 
make my wing now I want it to be at an
angle<00:02:26.220> so<00:02:26.550> that<00:02:26.580> this<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.989> tail

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
angle so that this this is the tail

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.559 
angle so that this this is the tail
section<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.130> head<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.700> want<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> tail

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
section this is the head I want the tail

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.059 
section this is the head I want the tail
part<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.019> be<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> little<00:02:31.380> narrower<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:31.980> I'm

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
part to be a little narrower so I'm

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.420 
part to be a little narrower so I'm
going<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.280> fold<00:02:32.519> up<00:02:32.819> and<00:02:33.750> then<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.069> find<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
going to fold up and then we can find a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.940 
going to fold up and then we can find a
nice<00:02:35.580> spot<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:36.090> here<00:02:36.120> too<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:37.080> generally

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
nice spot down here too and generally

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.600 
nice spot down here too and generally
you<00:02:38.310> want<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.760> try<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.030> kind<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.420> get<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
you want to try to kind of get it to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.550 
you want to try to kind of get it to
come<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:41.790> at<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> good<00:02:42.300> little<00:02:42.780> kind<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.200> slight

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
come up at a good little kind of slight

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.460 
come up at a good little kind of slight
slope<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:46.519> nice<00:02:47.519> little<00:02:47.730> fold<00:02:48.319> flip<00:02:49.319> it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
slope there a nice little fold flip it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.289 
slope there a nice little fold flip it
over<00:02:49.590> do<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.130> same<00:02:50.430> thing<00:02:50.640> on<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.850> side<00:02:50.910> and

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
over do the same thing on this side and

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.490 
over do the same thing on this side and
this<00:02:51.390> is<00:02:51.569> pretty<00:02:51.870> easy<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.380> just

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
this is pretty easy because you're just

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.110 
this is pretty easy because you're just
matching<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.100> everything<00:02:53.580> so<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.850> should<00:02:54.030> be

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
matching up everything so you should be

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.430 
matching up everything so you should be
able<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.450> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.690> match<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.230> crease

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
able to just kind of match it and crease

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.880 
able to just kind of match it and crease
it<00:02:55.470> down<00:02:57.049> now<00:02:58.049> I<00:02:58.080> want<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.410> just<00:02:58.560> create<00:02:58.799> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
it down now I want to just create a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.360 
it down now I want to just create a
little<00:02:58.920> bit<00:02:59.250> more<00:03:00.200> dip<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.470> wing<00:03:01.769> here<00:03:02.220> I'm

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
little bit more dip to the wing here I'm

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.850 
little bit more dip to the wing here I'm
going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.640> open<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.150> pocket<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.860> just

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
going to open up this pocket and just

going to open up this pocket and just
put<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.069> little<00:03:05.130> pressure<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.090> left<00:03:06.299> side

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
put a little pressure on the left side

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.190 
put a little pressure on the left side
here<00:03:07.250> get<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.910> come<00:03:08.940> open<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.690> far<00:03:09.930> as<00:03:10.049> you

here get that to come open as far as you
can<00:03:10.410> get<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.830> to<00:03:11.010> open<00:03:11.400> up<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:15.920> re-crease

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
can get it to open up and just re-crease

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.680 
can get it to open up and just re-crease
everything<00:03:17.459> here<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.180> you<00:03:18.269> get<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.450> nice

part of the body now I want to make a
little<00:03:35.190> head<00:03:35.459> section<00:03:35.790> there<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:36.450> if<00:03:36.630> you<00:03:36.780> can

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
little head section there so if you can

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.780 
little head section there so if you can
just<00:03:37.109> kind<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.440> hold<00:03:37.709> on<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:37.980> things<00:03:38.400> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
just kind of hold on to things and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.390 
just kind of hold on to things and
reverse<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.600> little<00:03:39.810> at<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.930> top<00:03:40.230> then<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.130> can

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
reverse a little at the top then you can

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.340 
reverse a little at the top then you can
get<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.730> little<00:03:42.030> bit<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.329> this<00:03:42.540> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.930> fold<00:03:43.200> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
get a little bit of this kind of fold it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.890 
get a little bit of this kind of fold it
over<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.889> create<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> little<00:03:44.850> head<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.329> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
over to create a little head and you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.960 
over to create a little head and you
could<00:03:46.049> choose<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:46.410> angle<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.280> everything<00:03:47.760> and

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
could choose the angle of everything and

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.309 
could choose the angle of everything and
how<00:03:48.090> much<00:03:48.269> beat<00:03:48.540> you<00:03:48.750> want<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.200> it<00:03:49.290> doesn't

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
how much beat you want but it doesn't

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.930 
how much beat you want but it doesn't
need<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> be<00:03:49.769> very<00:03:49.859> big<00:03:50.250> just<00:03:50.489> too<00:03:50.609> tiny<00:03:50.790> a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
need to be very big just too tiny a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.129 
need to be very big just too tiny a
little<00:03:50.970> bit<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.299> heads<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.630> end<00:03:51.780> up<00:03:51.900> there<00:03:52.049> is

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
little bit of heads to end up there is

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.800 
little bit of heads to end up there is
good<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.850> I'm<00:03:53.940> just<00:03:54.150> going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.510> do<00:03:54.630> one

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
good and then I'm just going to do one

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.170 
good and then I'm just going to do one
last<00:03:55.079> step<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.799> smoothing<00:03:56.459> out<00:03:56.579> this<00:03:56.819> tail

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
last step of smoothing out this tail

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.690 
last step of smoothing out this tail
section<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:59.040> easiest<00:03:59.310> way<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.459> do<00:03:59.670> that

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
section and the easiest way to do that

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.979 
section and the easiest way to do that
is<00:03:59.880> just<00:03:59.940> take<00:04:00.209> everything<00:04:00.660> we're<00:04:00.750> gonna<00:04:00.870> make

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
is just take everything we're gonna make

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.780 
is just take everything we're gonna make
like<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> crease<00:04:01.560> that<00:04:01.590> goes<00:04:01.950> from<00:04:02.190> where<00:04:02.579> all

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
like a crease that goes from where all

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.879 
like a crease that goes from where all
these<00:04:03.000> edges<00:04:03.480> meet<00:04:03.690> down<00:04:03.930> here<00:04:03.959> bring<00:04:04.799> it

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
these edges meet down here bring it

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:05.930 
these edges meet down here bring it
right<00:04:05.010> up<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.340> top<00:04:05.489> just<00:04:05.549> bring

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
right up to the top just bring

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.720 
right up to the top just bring
everything<00:04:06.209> all<00:04:06.420> at<00:04:06.450> once<00:04:06.980> fold<00:04:07.980> it<00:04:08.130> over<00:04:10.730> make

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
everything all at once fold it over make

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.990 
everything all at once fold it over make
a<00:04:11.760> good<00:04:12.030> crease<00:04:13.250> then<00:04:14.250> I'm<00:04:14.310> going<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.549> separate

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
a good crease then I'm going to separate

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.390 
a good crease then I'm going to separate
these<00:04:15.180> layers<00:04:15.540> now<00:04:16.200> the<00:04:16.289> back<00:04:16.889> one<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.280> already

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
these layers now the back one is already

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.370 
these layers now the back one is already
going<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.820> right<00:04:17.970> way<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.419> then<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:19.079> top

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
going the right way and then this top

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.130 
going the right way and then this top
one<00:04:19.680> you're<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.130> going<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.370> reverse<00:04:20.760> and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
one you're just going to reverse and

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.909 
one you're just going to reverse and
then<00:04:22.140> fold<00:04:22.650> on<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.789> crease<00:04:24.120> down

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
then fold on that crease down

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.520 
then fold on that crease down
underneath<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.629> I<00:04:26.659> get<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.139> kind<00:04:27.409> of

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
underneath so that I get that kind of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.589 
underneath so that I get that kind of
hidden<00:04:27.830> and<00:04:28.159> tucked<00:04:28.460> away<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.819> make<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.210> much

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
hidden and tucked away to make a much

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:32.679 
hidden and tucked away to make a much
narrower<00:04:30.169> kind<00:04:30.499> of<00:04:30.620> tail<00:04:30.830> section<00:04:31.280> and<00:04:31.689> that's

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:32.689 
narrower kind of tail section and that's

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:35.080 
narrower kind of tail section and that's
your<00:04:32.930> finished<00:04:33.139> little<00:04:33.439> bird<00:04:33.819> and<00:04:34.819> then<00:04:35.029> if

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
your finished little bird and then if

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.730 
your finished little bird and then if
you're<00:04:35.180> going<00:04:35.210> to<00:04:35.360> make<00:04:35.479> them<00:04:35.599> fly<00:04:35.930> you<00:04:36.560> just

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
you're going to make them fly you just

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.790 
you're going to make them fly you just
kind<00:04:36.949> of<00:04:36.979> hold<00:04:37.249> on<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.969> the<00:04:38.629> head<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.439> the<00:04:39.590> tail

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
kind of hold on to the head and the tail

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.519 
kind of hold on to the head and the tail
section<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.689> give<00:04:41.689> them<00:04:41.840> a<00:04:41.870> good<00:04:42.050> little<00:04:42.259> pull

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.529 
section and give them a good little pull

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.879 
section and give them a good little pull
here<00:04:43.900> it's<00:04:44.900> always<00:04:45.139> nerve-racking<00:04:45.710> doing

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
here it's always nerve-racking doing

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:46.959 
here it's always nerve-racking doing
this<00:04:45.979> in<00:04:46.099> the<00:04:46.189> beginning<00:04:46.279> because<00:04:46.639> you<00:04:46.669> don't

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969 
this in the beginning because you don't

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.749 
this in the beginning because you don't
want<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.360> mess<00:04:48.050> up<00:04:48.080> everything<00:04:48.620> obviously<00:04:49.490> but

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
want to mess up everything obviously but

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.850 
want to mess up everything obviously but
it<00:04:50.389> should<00:04:50.659> create<00:04:50.930> a<00:04:51.110> nice<00:04:51.319> little<00:04:51.590> tie

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
it should create a nice little tie

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.350 
it should create a nice little tie
tension<00:04:52.249> you<00:04:52.580> don't<00:04:52.759> want<00:04:52.909> to<00:04:52.969> pull<00:04:53.120> too<00:04:53.150> hard

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
tension you don't want to pull too hard

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.850 
tension you don't want to pull too hard
like<00:04:53.689> I<00:04:53.870> just<00:04:53.930> did<00:04:54.259> because<00:04:54.439> then<00:04:54.680> it<00:04:54.770> will

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
like I just did because then it will

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.439 
like I just did because then it will
fall<00:04:55.129> apart<00:04:55.400> but<00:04:55.669> you<00:04:55.819> should<00:04:55.999> be<00:04:56.060> able<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.210> get

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
fall apart but you should be able to get

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.439 
fall apart but you should be able to get
a<00:04:56.659> good<00:04:56.990> little<00:04:57.319> bit<00:04:57.529> going<00:04:57.879> with<00:04:58.879> the<00:04:59.060> tension

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
a good little bit going with the tension

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.089 
a good little bit going with the tension
that's<00:04:59.629> there<00:04:59.870> to<00:05:00.080> create<00:05:00.319> a<00:05:00.409> slight<00:05:00.710> bit<00:05:01.069> of

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
that's there to create a slight bit of

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.570 
that's there to create a slight bit of
this<00:05:01.699> movement<00:05:02.240> like<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.659> bird<00:05:02.840> is<00:05:02.990> flying

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
this movement like the bird is flying

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.850 
this movement like the bird is flying
again<00:05:04.580> don't<00:05:04.879> pull<00:05:05.330> too<00:05:05.539> far<00:05:05.810> here<00:05:06.139> if<00:05:06.439> you<00:05:06.680> do

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
again don't pull too far here if you do

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.920 
again don't pull too far here if you do
pull<00:05:07.099> it<00:05:07.219> kind<00:05:07.729> of<00:05:07.759> scoots<00:05:08.270> out<00:05:08.449> a<00:05:08.479> little<00:05:08.689> just

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
pull it kind of scoots out a little just

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.200 
pull it kind of scoots out a little just
tuck<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.259> back<00:05:09.379> inside<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.159> then<00:05:10.759> just<00:05:11.029> make

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
tuck it back inside and then just make

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.529 
tuck it back inside and then just make
the<00:05:11.680> wings<00:05:12.680> flap<00:05:13.159> up<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.669> down<00:05:13.909> pretty

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
the wings flap up and down pretty

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.800
