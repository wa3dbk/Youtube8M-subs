00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
organization once we get this

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.940 
organization once we get this

you<00:02:16.600> know<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.080> they<00:02:17.260> they're<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.040> gain

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
you know so they they're going to gain

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.370 
you know so they they're going to gain
some<00:02:18.520> valuable<00:02:18.550> skills<00:02:19.420> doing<00:02:19.900> that<00:02:20.080> to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
some valuable skills doing that to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.350 
some valuable skills doing that to

cooking skills I think once students see
after<00:02:28.540> working<00:02:28.870> together<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:29.350> really<00:02:29.560> making

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
after working together and really making

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.680 
after working together and really making
program<00:02:30.160> like<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:30.310> work<00:02:30.760> it'll<00:02:31.180> come<00:02:31.360> full

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
program like this work it'll come full

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.750 
program like this work it'll come full
circle<00:02:31.720> when<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.470> can<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.070> action<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
circle when we can see it in action and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.430 
circle when we can see it in action and
that's<00:02:34.150> what<00:02:34.300> it's<00:02:34.420> going<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.630> take<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.320> know

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
that's what it's going to take you know

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.410 
that's what it's going to take you know
like<00:02:35.590> just<00:02:35.740> making<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.280> program<00:02:36.520> come

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
like just making the program come

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.360 
like just making the program come
together<00:02:37.780> being<00:02:38.590> able<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.890> produce<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
together being able to produce it and

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.070 
together being able to produce it and
see<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> actual<00:02:39.970> impact<00:02:40.360> at<00:02:40.570> the<00:02:40.660> end<00:02:40.810> that

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
see the actual impact at the end that

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.199 
see the actual impact at the end that
these<00:02:41.260> families<00:02:41.680> will<00:02:41.860> have<00:02:42.090> it'll<00:02:43.090> be

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
these families will have it'll be

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.280 
these families will have it'll be
incredible

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:55.780 

you

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.849 

you
