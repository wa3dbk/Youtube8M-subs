00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
other thing when she knows the rail I

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.220 
other thing when she knows the rail I
learned<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.530> Pat<00:00:55.739> Fleming<00:00:56.539> is<00:00:57.539> if<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> can

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
if you've got a really loose grip you

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
if you've got a really loose grip you
won't<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.789> able<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> do<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.989> your

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
won't be able to do this but if your

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.160 
won't be able to do this but if your
take<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.250> part<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.609> your<00:01:02.730> hand<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> V<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
take this part of your hand this V and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.329 
take this part of your hand this V and
apply<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.769> down<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.159> bit<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
apply a little down little bit of

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.149 
apply a little down little bit of
pressure<00:01:05.869> on<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> come<00:01:07.770> through

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
pressure on this as you come through

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.640 
pressure on this as you come through
it'll<00:01:08.909> keep<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> it'll<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.110> two<00:01:10.290> things

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.960 
know I'm gonna keep you from miss cueing
but<00:01:15.750> it'll<00:01:16.439> give<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> solid<00:01:17.310> solid<00:01:17.670> hit

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
but it'll give you a solid solid hit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.460 
but it'll give you a solid solid hit
when<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.479> pressure<00:01:18.810> back<00:01:19.140> there

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
when you get that pressure back there

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.300 
when you get that pressure back there
and<00:01:20.159> pushing<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.630> cue<00:01:21.840> ball

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the whole thing anyways but I should

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.390 
the whole thing anyways but I should
have<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.740> little

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
have a little

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:48.530 
have a little
the<00:01:41.820> software<00:01:42.180> effect<00:01:46.520> all<00:01:47.520> right<00:01:47.700> there's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the software effect all right there's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.260 
the software effect all right there's
your<00:01:48.630> 30<00:01:48.990> shot<00:01:49.260> worked<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.850> what<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> want<00:01:51.150> you

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
your 30 shot worked out what I want you

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
your 30 shot worked out what I want you
to<00:01:51.360> get<00:01:51.570> from<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.430> not<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.670> those<00:01:53.760> 30

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
to get from this is not just those 30

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.750 
to get from this is not just those 30

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
shots put you on the path to improving

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.410 
shots put you on the path to improving
your<00:01:57.270> perception<00:01:58.100> learn<00:01:59.100> how<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.520> find<00:01:59.940> the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
your perception learn how to find the

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.980 
your perception learn how to find the
answer

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
answer

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.910 
answer
ahead<00:02:01.440> of<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:02.480> stick<00:02:03.480> to<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.870> guns<00:02:04.200> with

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
ahead of time stick to your guns with

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.060 
ahead of time stick to your guns with
your<00:02:05.130> stroke<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.640> your<00:02:05.940> mechanics<00:02:07.070> observe

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
your stroke and your mechanics observe

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.000 
your stroke and your mechanics observe
the<00:02:08.729> shots<00:02:09.350> then<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.340> find<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.850> if<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
the shots then you can find out if you

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.310 
the shots then you can find out if you
naturally<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.310> looking<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.910> shots

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
naturally I'm looking at the shots
