00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 video in which I am going to 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.059
 explain how to win at 2048 meaning 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.250
 with a little simple trick without 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.480
 difficulty and on a text that she 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.299
 especially because I was able to put 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.529
 a lot of videos where people are using 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.109
 2048 on the computer 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.800
 so here I am on samsung galaxy s iii 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.029
 and we're going to try to see so 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.099
 this very simple little trick that 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:33.090
 is to just end up organizing in 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.399
 doing movements see I'm doing 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.910
 like that and then I go down here so 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.719
 horizontally and vertically and that 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 allows me to put me to mix everything 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.000
 in the corner that until the moment I 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.770
 am stuck so I'm stuck I the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.670
 mounts and their drawings and I start again 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.360
 tac I had 32 hop like that 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.190
 quietly 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.820
 I'm stuck with bubbles and go down 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.700
 quietly I advance good ensures the 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 part in this and a little bit on the 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 after that it will be complicated a little bit because 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.990
 that with the big numbers we're going 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.070
 to have more trouble but you will see 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:27.450
 that we just get to have a little bit of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 patience you too you want you 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.880
 can advance a little video to that but 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.670
 it's basically that's it you're nothing 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 learn more after at the end of 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.180
 this video I'm the fact that I do not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.270
 going to do that and then final and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.479
 well we get there and I hope this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.079
 tip you will have pleased and see you soon for 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.079
 an upcoming video 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.680
 - in the hair also poses in the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.680
 Video is too long 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:17.200
 I do not know how we take a break 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.200
 but 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:27.970
 so either we had understood I can if 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.970
 you are still here but 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.130
 do not worry you're going to end up 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.360
 happen and then anyway if you 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.410
 may have a lack of a bowl this 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.260
 times you may not be able to get there 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.840
 first time you have to do 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.720
 but in any case any case you have 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.870
 already understood I'm at 256 I'm doing the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.870
 shit 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.700
 when you understand that this 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.630
 is not touch me but that in all 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.070
 this is a technique that will work 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.660
 more if you look in the video of 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.730
 others everyone says it takes 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.620
 have the big ones in a corner and then that 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.600
 little by little it becomes more 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.050
 smaller so there we can see that 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.930
 that's what we have so you see 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.800
 that it's the right technique to see 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.690
 alright I'm gonna cut the video 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.840
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.260
 not to put a small thumb the web the 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:28.960
 if you liked it 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.960
 and then and rape to the press
