 and now I want to introduce you to our 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:10.080
 brewer business our name is Sergey and 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:14.910
 he will introduce you to technology 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.910
 brewing passed Sergei I work saw 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.070
 makita just trash does not speak for 10 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.480
 years it is special keys in the Czech Republic 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.110
 small under the brewery for 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.930
 one famous side camp 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.920
 all the subtleties of this art is not taught 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.140
 famous 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.140
 paints the head on the film by the mother and 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.909
 man is always seven thousand years before our 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.729
 era you thought already drank beer in the diet 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.359
 as the builders of the pyramids so roman 

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:49.179
 legionnaires 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:51.129
 there was always a beer in then she 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.339
 underwent very big changes 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.769
 both as such technologies 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.159
 cooking we cook 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.649
 modern beer and a varieties but all 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:07.379
 are divided by 300 and he fell scientists and 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.379
 bright for our beer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.290
 books and antifreeze 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:24.120
 the milk 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.890
 black caramel black 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.680
 for light beer we use only 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.910
 chinese words i 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:39.120
 other varieties and others like this 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.680
 such a draw 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.810
 soaked missing dried can 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:53.220
 lightly fry on different varieties 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:56.430
 before it comes about squirrel get enough sleep 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.430
 amount of yourself 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:14.269
 here it turns out and panic here such here 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:20.959
 the mixture that goes on we now 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:23.690
 we give production curves divided by 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.349
 three parts of the first part of this park is the second 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.450
 part of the expression shouts part 2 kind for 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.819
 lamps are used a little tighten poor 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.090
 chat plans doomed 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.040
 100 people 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.260
 we have less than 200 liters of water 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.730
 fall asleep there to explain 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.920
 put there 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.920
 52 grams of gold at 37 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.620
 degrees is done the so-called mash in 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.459
 for half an hour 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.690
 then by changing the temperature 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.580
 heats up different degrees and 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.910
 pumped over parts of the filtration 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.890
 vat 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.250
 then defended including on 5 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.240
 a little bit here and 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.200
 history process 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:17.910
 about 10 hours to 11 hours to 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.910
 get 200 liters and 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:28.220
 the end of cooking is done 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:32.060
 straining remains robbed causes 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.340
 with hand cages 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.790
 brushes will be 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:42.879
 and pounce then live print amount 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.040
 stays overnight boss assign them 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:49.450
 highlighting of the wort wort that is 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.920
 we have such hops this is pellet change 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.459
 And here in such questions rushes three times 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.200
 during the barge various times in order 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 to give a distinctive flavor 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:08.849
 lathering but it's a reflection and 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:12.519
 using pipes from the top of the room 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:16.840
 wort hot poured tanks this 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:19.660
 fermentation at the same time fall asleep shivering and 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.360
 poured here such bags on 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.930
 acquire the Czech Republic yeast 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:28.270
 doctors there are about 2 thousand species 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:36.070
 called once and we use times and w 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:40.090
 95 tanks of 400 liters fermentation process 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:42.669
 Lasts 10 days 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.419
 temperature change temperature at 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.780
 This yeast fermentation us is eternal 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.420
 fights are besieged in the forest and the top remains 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.750
 young green 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:57.960
 it says beer further after 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:02.850
 the fermentation process is over it's not 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.010
 interrupting is one of 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.420
 main processes at which beer 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.630
 gets the necessary smell color 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:16.070
 transparency and taste and foaming 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:20.250
 so in these tanks it matures 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:24.720
 about two months and then you can 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:26.220
 will use it means density 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.570
 I wanted to focus on density 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.440
 density is an indicator to tell 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.100
 density that legion them up to 100 grams on 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.150
 100 to 100 milliliters of fluid 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.440
 percentage of relationships 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:46.140
 insoluble parts if you say that 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:48.320
 let's say there became has a density of 10 then 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.320
 our light beer has a density 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:57.140
 13 and dark first 16 this speaks of him in 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:01.830
 emptiness and alcohol on the nymph is contained 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:03.450
 538 about to brighter let's say 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.130
 Zhigulevsk if you take it contains 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.840
 only 2 and 8 percent 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.980
 you become 5 so we keep up with 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.860
 world 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:15.280
 indapamide want to say that beer 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:20.600
 Aim for the following indicators 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:24.200
 light transparency aroma foaming 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:26.270
 and it must be at least four 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:29.600
 centimeters to drain pours into a glass and 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:32.330
 stable back should change 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.890
 at least four minutes she should not 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:41.270
 drunk fall here are such an indicator 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:44.800
 of our beer come visit us try 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.800
 our wonderful to do
