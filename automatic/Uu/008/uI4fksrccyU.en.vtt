while just to show you the edges the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.160 
while just to show you the edges the
edges<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.369> got<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> be<00:01:47.579> honest<00:01:47.939> not<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.420> uh<00:01:48.450> not

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
edges I got to be honest not as uh not

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.929 
edges I got to be honest not as uh not
as<00:01:49.350> good<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.829> would<00:01:49.890> expect<00:01:52.399> hung<00:01:53.399> up<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.670> bit

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
as good as I would expect hung up a bit

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:07.660 
as good as I would expect hung up a bit
let's<00:01:54.750> try<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> other<00:01:55.110> one

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.750 

and<00:02:09.769> problem<00:02:10.769> with<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.099> edge<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.489> it's

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
and problem with the edge is that it's

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.979 
and problem with the edge is that it's
toothy<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.330> don't<00:02:12.599> know<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:14.220> see<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.580> there

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
toothy I don't know you see that there

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.490 
toothy I don't know you see that there
you<00:02:15.989> see<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.379> is<00:02:16.530> not<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.890> smooth<00:02:17.400> cut<00:02:18.500> all

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
you see that is not a smooth cut all

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.699 
you see that is not a smooth cut all
right<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:21.590> I've<00:02:22.590> cut<00:02:22.860> enough<00:02:23.099> paper<00:02:23.430> that

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
right and I've cut enough paper that

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.930 
right and I've cut enough paper that
that's<00:02:25.709> not<00:02:25.860> user<00:02:26.160> error<00:02:26.489> dude<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:29.519> edges

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
that's not user error dude the the edges

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.509 
that's not user error dude the the edges
on<00:02:30.120> these<00:02:30.500> it's<00:02:31.500> what's<00:02:31.739> called<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:32.069> toothy

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
on these it's what's called a toothy

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.839 
on these it's what's called a toothy
edge<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.930> see<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.349> they're<00:02:34.730> basically<00:02:35.730> on

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
edge you see that they're basically on

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.970 
edge you see that they're basically on
an<00:02:36.150> almost<00:02:36.450> micro<00:02:37.170> level<00:02:37.940> it's<00:02:38.940> not<00:02:39.090> smooth

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
an almost micro level it's not smooth

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.890 
an almost micro level it's not smooth
those<00:02:40.980> edges<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.610> quite<00:02:41.849> rough<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.599> called

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
those edges are quite rough it's called

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.759 
those edges are quite rough it's called
a<00:02:43.049> toothy<00:02:43.530> edge<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.930> will<00:02:46.110> result<00:02:46.590> in

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
a toothy edge and it just will result in

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.229 
a toothy edge and it just will result in
the<00:02:46.860> blade<00:02:47.069> not<00:02:47.959> slicing<00:02:48.959> through<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:51.120> know

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
the blade not slicing through you know

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.809 
the blade not slicing through you know
as<00:02:51.450> well<00:02:51.690> as<00:02:51.720> as<00:02:52.079> well<00:02:52.440> as<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.680> could<00:02:52.980> there's<00:02:53.730> a

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
as well as as well as it could there's a

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.670 
as well as as well as it could there's a
close-up<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.569> toothy<00:02:54.959> edge<00:02:55.079> yeah<00:02:55.379> I'm<00:02:55.470> not

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
close-up of the toothy edge yeah I'm not

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.830 
close-up of the toothy edge yeah I'm not
sure<00:02:55.920> why<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.370> did<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.849> mean<00:02:57.120> unless<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
sure why they did that I mean unless it

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.960 
sure why they did that I mean unless it
was<00:02:57.959> just<00:02:58.200> an<00:02:58.319> oversight<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.579> price

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
was just an oversight but for this price

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.839 
was just an oversight but for this price
of<00:03:00.299> knife<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.980> being<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.040> special<00:03:02.489> limited

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
of knife and being a special limited

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.690 
of knife and being a special limited
edition<00:03:02.879> knife<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:05.280> think<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.579> should

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
edition knife I just think it should

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.729

have<00:03:05.819> a<00:03:05.940> very<00:03:06.180> smooth<00:03:06.569> highly<00:03:07.019> polished<00:03:07.260> edge

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
have a very smooth highly polished edge

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.300 
have a very smooth highly polished edge
that<00:03:08.160> can<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.359> sharp<00:03:09.859> all<00:03:10.859> right<00:03:11.010> so

that edge myself all right let's go back

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.410 
that edge myself all right let's go back
outside<00:03:24.599> for<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.290> rest<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.650> video<00:03:25.950> and

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
outside for the rest of the video and

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.229 
outside for the rest of the video and
the<00:03:27.420> signature<00:03:27.930> knife<00:03:28.139> comes<00:03:28.590> with<00:03:28.799> this

the signature knife comes with this

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.390 
the signature knife comes with this
basically<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.359> leather<00:03:30.690> case<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.099> you<00:03:32.220> have

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
basically a leather case so if you have

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.699 
basically a leather case so if you have
it<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:32.639> your<00:03:32.760> pocket<00:03:33.169> that'll<00:03:34.169> prevent<00:03:34.470> it

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it in your pocket that'll prevent it

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.270 
it in your pocket that'll prevent it
from<00:03:34.739> getting<00:03:35.010> all<00:03:35.669> scratched<00:03:36.150> up<00:03:37.099> so<00:03:38.099> that's

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
from getting all scratched up so that's

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.909 
from getting all scratched up so that's
cool<00:03:38.639> one<00:03:39.299> reason<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.810> picked<00:03:40.079> this<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.349> I

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
saw it was 3.5 inches closed which is

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.229 
saw it was 3.5 inches closed which is
about<00:03:45.319> how<00:03:46.319> long<00:03:46.650> many<00:03:47.340> Victorinox<00:03:48.090> Swiss
