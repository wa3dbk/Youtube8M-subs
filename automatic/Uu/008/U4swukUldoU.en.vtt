00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Hi guys , I'm here today. 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 record a video that asked me a lot 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.750
 which is with backpacks and lunch bags 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.880
 accessories that the boys gave 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.440
 School, so let's go there last year. 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.450
 the boys stayed longer at school 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 he was carrying a large backpack of the same 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 brand of which they are nowadays and is 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.369
 very large cart because they 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.750
 they took more things 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.520
 only this year as it is getting less 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 time at school they take almost nothing in 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.930
 backpack and hence I prefer congress 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 From the hoff team that the backpack on 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.220
 original is normal the team hop and she 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.309
 today in the childlike size of a backpack 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 and how not to carry it on the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.610
 It's true, it was always me who took it. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 I bought tiny even not 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.570
 does it matter if she has a little more 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.280
 heavy but for me with the handle is better 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.620
 I want to get it, right? 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.149
 carton I had to carry that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.039
 part that we recorded by car or 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.870
 hurt a little you can not drag 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.950
 backpack because my little one and I do not 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.860
 could stay on the floor had to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.750
 hold and pack them is this is the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.670
 Bernardo is from thomaz da 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.109
 team oil and I bought everything in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.920
 set the chile the bottle 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 these things that I had the opportunity 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 lost in the United States but so I 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.540
 I like the quality of branded products 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 and so I bought everything just like it already 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 I knew the products and means I 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.180
 I bought a match and I'll show you 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.799
 What does he carry in the backpack? 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.280
 this one is the china than I more 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.409
 shark and the front is a pocket 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.990
 here inside has a touch toothbrush 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 and toothbrush is go all 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.049
 well explained decree of stuck in 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.630
 you have shown before and that you have 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.420
 toothpaste is also late in the day. 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.549
 school and asks so and is something that 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 it goes in the front pocket here on the side 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.320
 has this network to vote for a bottle and I 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.729
 I only bought team hop too 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.439
 matching in this bottle will only hold 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.090
 because they ask me to send one 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.100
 bottle a glass to drink water and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.590
 another glass to tell you the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.869
 south or send a gaffe in the same lunchbox 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.790
 here's only water because I think it's good 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.310
 because she is from straw and canada very 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.469
 I think it's too much to drink juice. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.030
 very upset in peace the bottle in so 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.189
 Good, it's only for the water itself. 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.450
 it is very practical because there are teachers 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.849
 with them 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 they took it open here has a channel 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.379
 tv that I end up cleaning every week 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.480
 because of the straw I get agony getting 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.290
 time and remember that it is very easy 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.150
 and here inside the backpack that bag that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.400
 that I said that I have more to go through 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.290
 phase of telling the one at the beginning of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.060
 year then teacher asks that still 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.580
 send a change of clothes with the poet 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.680
 so there is this bag that in the rock team 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.290
 It's a bag for wet or dirty clothes. 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.209
 and that in the front has this little chain 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.790
 without these effects of redinha and here in 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:45.060
 front goes to a change of uniform with 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.130
 a little cuequinha and that part of you 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.630
 open can put very wet laundry 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.849
 it is also permeable 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.549
 I think it's cool and synop itself. 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.640
 the backpack brand of the bottle and she goes 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.049
 then folded in the bag so the 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 People will act inside the backpack too. 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.739
 but it does not matter to show that ie6 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910
 next thing that also ends up in the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.160
 backpack because they take too 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.230
 little was in the backpack as I said is 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.819
 the lunch box the lunch box I bought 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.930
 matching how I got out of here 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:19.440
 thomas lunchbox and she tubarãozinho 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.700
 so it is all technical and here is the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.630
 starting off I did not like it until 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.220
 Axe 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.400
 maybe washing the shows too 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.530
 moist that has this network is how 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.030
 that I make inside the lunch box I take 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.569
 the pots for a pot with the food 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.350
 huh 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.000
 Hey, little pot I have this one. It 's okay. 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.690
 already showed a lot in the blog 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.579
 instagram but for those who did not see a 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.430
 he is not a technician 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.530
 but it's plastic has dividers 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.510
 here you can take advantage of it's 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.090
 place a divider on a banana that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.639
 nor can the four and do not think 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.599
 this little speck of silicone 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:00.030
 just to leave even a little nigga right now 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.380
 I graduated here and then just call 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.319
 attention to them because they were 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.060
 very close to eating I will do with these 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.900
 mounts here but cute spain 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.989
 brown color fruit 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.700
 and it gets more interesting to say who 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.220
 Never saw the snacks that I make. 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.199

 on instagram by hashtag mother's lunchbox 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.930
 Two things I can say is that I do 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.370
 for them 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.860

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.389

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.889
 I can see the little mounts that I 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.990
 I'll do it for you if you have interest 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.370
 besides that plastic pot that I showed 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.650
 I use a lot is what 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.780
 the United States now that this 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.250
 here with plastic cover not just 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.810
 Washing and this dot here that metallic 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.789
 ends up being the technician, right? 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.080
 and he has a part here give to 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.729
 to see that there are three settings in this 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.770
 I do not have to put these partitions and 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:53.110
 world here is the plastic cover and 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.669
 in this pot also uses these 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.100
 ants so that divides but 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.410
 whoever wants to see has to go in to see 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.849
 the photos of the snacks vote here for 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.750
 to understand more or less that I 'm talking 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.630
 Adão Teixeira goes the food pot 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:12.130
 with china was once a banana on the outside and 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.770
 go to the little bottle of juice 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.560
 this spelling of the earth calls a bottle 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.289
 and manufacturer says it maintains the 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.680
 liquid cooled to icy finance by 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.870
 up to 10 hours which is quite so me 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.479
 I make the juice just before leaving 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.930
 of camus type but of late they are 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:37.449
 Two o'clock enter college here. 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:39.789
 within the presence of metal and climbing 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.919
 also but still easy to tighten 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:46.419
 Leave and this one I like on day 4 but it's 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.919
 important to pay attention to cleaning 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.990
 Because of Canada it is mostly good 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.210
 punching another thing from the lunchbox 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.650
 but what is not every day is not always is it only 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.360
 When I do the leftover kicks, this is it. 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.490
 pot that also the leg is the same 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.560
 brand of the bottle of a continuous 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.260
 he keep food warm for up to 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.430
 six hours or is fresh 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.530
 Ice cold, right? 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.270
 up to 10 hours but said he will not 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:11.889
 center the human mind but still has a 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.620
 I think I already showed the video of 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:17.770
 comprinhas and they have also case I 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.009
 I want to send a sei la mango cream or 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.930
 a fruit salad and send it in here 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.129
 another thing that goes inside the lunchbox 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:28.110
 is this plastic pot with the cutlery 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:31.080
 looks like a matching ice too 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.719
 other things it's that simple 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.520
 a spoon in a cart because at 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.869
 Sometimes I order fruit salad cake 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.759
 Anything so they have no task 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:41.430
 so do not provide neps students at school 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:42.839
 She already told me not to find super super. 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.979
 important sandwich shop mainly 

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:46.800
 because normally the world fruits 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:48.539
 Decoradinho are such purchases 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.059
 Chinese so that we can 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.460
 freezes law sets with geninho in lunchbox 

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:55.080
 and I have several of these various models 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.099
 and this one is obviously frozen 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.349
 not all wet but at the bottom of the boat 

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:05.399
 usually set the cutlery in here 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:06.180
 but this Friday had already and there is already 

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:08.999
 right foot 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.620
 the genie goes down I put the pot 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:14.580
 over ice for ice pick up a pot 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.499
 in the background and there it was a banana or something 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.539
 so goes the bottle too and so on 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:21.270
 fechadinho and ended up giving the chile 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:24.899
 and here is the backpack that they 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:26.699
 take this one is more lonely than in 

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:28.709
 It's true, I carry it to school, right? 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.050
 even so it does not get full but there is a 

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:33.360
 lightweight then the handle is already 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.759
 adjusted is the one in the back 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.689
 side and I take and search at school with 

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:38.099
 the backpack on the back 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.199
 so people one of the things that less 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:42.330
 take pro college accessory style smells 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:44.699
 and I understand united states as outside 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.740
 né impress very very good goes 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:48.629
 get these backpacks for a price 

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:50.189
 cheaper than buying backpacks that 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:52.019
 We usually see Brazil. 

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.279
 They are also for sale in Brazil only. 

00:07:52.019 --> 00:07:54.479
 It's a bit expensive, right? 

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:56.399
 only I've seen several products here 

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:58.559
 the same proposal is very similar gives 

00:07:56.399 --> 00:08:00.689
 to lead the way is to set up the 

00:07:58.559 --> 00:08:02.099
 lunchbox that is what the staff but the 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:04.259
 question is where does it have a bottle? 

00:08:02.099 --> 00:08:06.209
 thermal she smelled is technical by 

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.559
 in the same way as boys who have a 

00:08:06.209 --> 00:08:09.449
 Because that helps a lot. 

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:10.860
 so if you like the video, no 

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:12.419
 Forget does not like it down here 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.490
 the channel that every second and 

00:08:12.419 --> 00:08:17.209
 fifth more video, it's okay 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.209
 a kiss
