00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.100
 hello everyone guys are well 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.320
 fetal tintin fi staff and I'm here with 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.500
 the player review by patrick herrmann se 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.380
 with German player info from Borussia 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.300
 moen sigla bak who made a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.230
 double in the 4 1 of borussia motion 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.290
 club bach in the house of the hoffenheim 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.230
 so this German player indeed 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:38.430
 this German sprinter will find goals 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.880
 in description then the player taken 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 25 thousand credits minimum price 27,000 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.440
 at a maximum of 20 and 35 milan if not 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 50,000 mistake I don't remember exactly 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.230
 however you find it at 27,000 is a 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.609
 fun and surprising player not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.550
 I expected it so much that when we have 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:01:02.190
 decided we have drawn who and who 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.760
 review was a bit unhappy then me 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.770
 the idea is made then the pro 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.159
 player's main note already 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.570
 from the paper at 90 of speed that then 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.710
 translates into a 90 91 acceleration 93 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.900
 of speed 94 agility 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.880
 impregnable impregnable above all 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.790
 in the last twenty thirty meters it begins 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.400
 to run and does not stop very agile yes 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.500
 untangles well in opposing defenses 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.840
 among the opposing defenses in the spaces 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.180
 tight exchanges well with the striker in 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.610
 this case used didier drogba but 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.860
 even with the left- handed attacker schurrle 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.830
 because I used it since a 4 3 2 1 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.710
 that in a 4 3 3 then as a right wing 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.000
 so the speed is really a bit for 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.880
 this game that is based above all 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 on speed is a crazy thing but the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.030
 which makes it different from the usual ones 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.450
 to and who run the fact that he has 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.540
 excellent passing statistics or 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:05.940
 it is better not to have them 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:07.440
 however in game they are much more more others 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.229
 syndromes much higher than 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.569
 what we read in fact we find a 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.800
 68 of long passages altogether 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.120
 unrealistic in the excellent long passages 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.440
 80 of short passages that it seems 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 definitely a higher value 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.790
 especially no 81 of cross that seen there 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.650
 it's a value 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.360
 while instead it is precisely the value 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.099
 better than this player apart from the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.859
 speed really does cross 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.900
 crazy made me de gauche and gods 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.579
 crazy cross for goals of drogba in 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.159
 particular but also schurrle other 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.049
 bad habit of head and I assure you that I 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.900
 I can't cross this year 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:45.689
 cross decently with those 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.689
 which have 92 cross then already from 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.799
 this you should understand that a great pro 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.930
 so the fact that he clicks on the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.849
 band and then half of the good big gods 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.459
 good passes makes it a player 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.430
 very useful is a lot of fun 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.950
 certainly not exceptionally strong, however 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.760
 just right with regards to the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.609
 dribbling 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.989
 we go to the first against dribbling in 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:12.750
 itself for itself with that 85 values is 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.659
 liar because he unfortunately has three stars 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.329
 skilled so you won't be able to do the 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:20.159
 skills that are done with four notes 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.169
 so what I usually do with 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.849
 parona high game normal ones here 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:28.169
 the simplest ones but which they are anyway 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:30.389
 very effective so you will find yourself 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's say a player who knows how to run e 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:36.060
 enough that it is not bad but it is not 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.859
 complete the other against that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.220
 unfortunately decisive that makes him lower 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:43.379
 the final vote the weak foot to three 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.739
 stars he is weak he and right and he plays 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.840
 on the right instead in the informa version 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.150
 which we reviewed at the beginning of the year 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.340
 he played on the left this maybe made it 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.729
 more for those who love to get back on the foot 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.829
 favorite and in fact pull with him 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:01.139
 you have to pull right back you have 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.169
 seen most of the beautiful goals and 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.900
 made right they are made right 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.939
 while normal ones in front of the door 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.439
 also goal of the half for charity yes 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:13.260
 they can do with any foot because 

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:14.790
 unfortunately I do not count three stars 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.760
 weak foot with the fact that it is really of 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.489
 left fails to score attract 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.979
 even the games on the right 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.229
 so it's a bit difficult to find 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.840
 to centralize and hold the ball 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.509
 on the right and then try a shot like that 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.090
 sometimes they fail me so unfortunately 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.630
 this is too important a meeting 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:40.030
 as far as I'm concerned 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.860
 but I have to say that the player has some 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.180
 potentiality here is according to me then between 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.190
 brackets next year will be a nice one 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.570
 surprise up on up to 16 maybe if you 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.160
 these two have increased 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.890
 problems in the stars written in the stars 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:57.120
 weak foot against these you go to yes 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.070
 it adds to the physical strength only 54 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.290
 however it is not as important as the other two 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.990
 against simply because if you do it 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.640
 play in the last few meters 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.500
 they do not take it and therefore it is impossible 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.000
 throw it to the ground if they don't take it 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.490
 you can throw it down 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.130
 furthermore it really has a positioning 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.990
 excellent 83 positioning in attack 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.970
 which makes him an added striker 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.550
 he will never give you a hand in defense but 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.620
 who cares but is always there in front 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:27.970
 ready to collect suggestions from 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:31.030
 comrades ready to attack even 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.680
 opponents for pressing and then 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.790
 trying to recover the ball immediately 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.220
 so all in all good here is the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.600
 physical does not feel that it is such a thing 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.180
 negative 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.350
 consequently I did not talk about shooting 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.370
 has a good shot 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.680
 an 80 strength of the power shots of 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:54.520
 show power indeed as you see I have it 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.420
 put on frey pro shoots on lap 80 as well goes 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.090
 well okay but unfortunately 78 of 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:03.070
 longshot indeed it is not azzeccava 1 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.230
 with the long shot unfortunately the shot is 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.210
 very penalized by the fact 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.190
 of the three stars weak foot for the 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.950
 finalization 73 as far as I am concerned 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.020
 made me many goals to be a la 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.120
 my done so definitely many goals then 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.400
 I did n't feel like putting them in, however, between 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.260
 the pros because I repeat this thing at 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.350
 weak thriller too negative though 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.630
 guys I have to say as an alternative and 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:27.790
 on the right for the bundesliga there is none 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.670
 then there are very many who are obama 

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.840
 young though if many use it as 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:37.840
 striker buying the hypo version 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.090
 csm that goes well is a good player as well 

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.280
 but at this price I say that hermann 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.960
 currently it could be the best 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.569
 alternative to robben in the sense it is 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:52.139
 right wing here don't get me wrong it's not 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:53.940
 the robben chip is a good wing 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.220
 right external right for the bundesliga 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.599
 a good external right to the right 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.199
 German 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:03.180
 then at that price I say it's great 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:05.400
 it doesn't have a high price you can try 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.289
 absolutely so you can for me 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.509
 try this player enough 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:12.840
 funny my final grade is a 7 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:14.819
 above all in relation to value for money 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:18.470
 I hope this review is there 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.470
 liked see you in the next video
