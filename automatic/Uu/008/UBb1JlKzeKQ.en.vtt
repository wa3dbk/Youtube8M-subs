usually you want your laptop to stay as

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.579 
usually you want your laptop to stay as
cool<00:00:02.550> as<00:00:02.790> possible<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.449> prolong<00:00:03.959> its<00:00:04.170> life<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
cool as possible to prolong its life to

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.820 
cool as possible to prolong its life to
keep<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.950> from<00:00:05.810> destroying<00:00:06.810> your<00:00:07.290> investment

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
keep it from destroying your investment

trench have ski let's take a look at a
picture<00:00:13.130> this<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.849> laptop<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.929> fry<00:00:16.260> a

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
picture this is a laptop you can fry a

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.939 
picture this is a laptop you can fry a
burger<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.100> ok<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:18.150> odd<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.720> imagine<00:00:19.710> such

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
burger on ok so it's odd to imagine such

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.340 
burger on ok so it's odd to imagine such
an<00:00:20.070> idea<00:00:20.400> where<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.270> can<00:00:21.420> fry<00:00:21.660> your<00:00:21.869> steak<00:00:22.170> on

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
an idea where you can fry your steak on

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.050 
an idea where you can fry your steak on
the<00:00:22.590> laptop<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> it's<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.550> close<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the laptop and it's that close to the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.429 
the laptop and it's that close to the
screen<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> grease<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.140> going

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
screen and the grease is going

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.970 
screen and the grease is going
everywhere<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.250> heat<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:27.769> desirable<00:00:28.769> in

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
everywhere and the heat is desirable in

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.089 
everywhere and the heat is desirable in
this<00:00:29.369> electronic<00:00:30.119> device<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.840> once<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:32.040> is

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
this electronic device for once it is

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.360 
this electronic device for once it is
just<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.880> concept<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:34.200> honestly<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.280> think

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
just a concept I think honestly I think

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.700 
just a concept I think honestly I think
it's<00:00:35.700> great<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.120> mean<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.930> joke<00:00:37.290> around<00:00:37.440> about

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's great I mean I I joke around about

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.450 
it's great I mean I I joke around about
like<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.520> being<00:00:38.760> insane<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.590> my

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
like this being insane and is but on my

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.000 
like this being insane and is but on my
show<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:42.059> talk<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> lot<00:00:42.420> about<00:00:42.570> crazy<00:00:43.230> new

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
show we talk a lot about crazy new

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.190 
show we talk a lot about crazy new
technology<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.879> robots<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.719> outer<00:00:46.050> space

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
technology like robots and outer space

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.150 
technology like robots and outer space
and<00:00:46.829> everything<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.910> between<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.750> me

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
and everything in between and for me

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.090 
and everything in between and for me
even<00:00:50.160> if<00:00:50.340> this<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.910> kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.570> one-off<00:00:52.100> crazy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
even if this is kind of a one-off crazy

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.520 
even if this is kind of a one-off crazy
idea<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.640> no<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> ever<00:00:54.870> going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.350> make

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
idea that no one is ever going to make

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.549 
idea that no one is ever going to make
into<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> commercial<00:00:56.129> product<00:00:57.199> something<00:00:58.199> from

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
into a commercial product something from

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.459 
into a commercial product something from
it<00:00:58.710> might<00:00:59.480> get<00:01:00.480> used<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.260> future

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
it might get used in some future

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.369 
it might get used in some future
technology<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.309> could<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.699> cool<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.539> like

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
technology that could be cool so I like

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
technology that could be cool so I like
sort<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.390> ingenuity<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:06.990> person

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
sort of the ingenuity of this person

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.100 
sort of the ingenuity of this person
seems<00:01:07.740> very<00:01:08.010> motivated<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> good<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:09.990> them

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
seems very motivated and good for them

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
seems very motivated and good for them
for<00:01:10.350> making<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:11.010> I've<00:01:11.280> never

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
for making something that I've never

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
for making something that I've never
heard<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> before<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:13.260> place<00:01:13.500> computing

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
heard of before one place computing

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770 
heard of before one place computing
technology<00:01:14.580> hasn't<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.240> taken<00:01:15.390> off<00:01:15.630> for

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
technology hasn't really taken off for

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.330 
technology hasn't really taken off for
home<00:01:15.930> computing<00:01:16.380> technology<00:01:16.950> hasn't<00:01:17.100> really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
home computing technology hasn't really

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.920 
home computing technology hasn't really
taken<00:01:17.460> off<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> kitchen<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.600> mean<00:01:18.780> every

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
taken off is the kitchen I mean every

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.210 
taken off is the kitchen I mean every
now<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.500> see<00:01:19.680> these<00:01:19.890> devices

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
now and then we'll see these devices

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
now and then we'll see these devices
like<00:01:20.790> this<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> smart<00:01:21.960> fridge<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.770> this

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
like this is the smart fridge and this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
like this is the smart fridge and this
is<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.790> stove<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.479> also<00:01:24.930> has<00:01:25.259> bluetooth<00:01:25.470> for

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
is the stove that also has bluetooth for

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.280 
is the stove that also has bluetooth for
some<00:01:26.250> reason<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.659> feel<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:27.930> that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
some reason how do you feel about that

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.289 
some reason how do you feel about that
well<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.250> any<00:01:29.430> future<00:01:29.640> there<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.119> that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
well is there any future there in that

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.100 
well is there any future there in that
area<00:01:30.810> at<00:01:31.049> all<00:01:31.170> well<00:01:31.860> we've<00:01:32.009> seen<00:01:32.340> at<00:01:33.110> trade

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
area at all well we've seen at trade

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.249 
area at all well we've seen at trade
shows<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.530> CES<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.450> Aoife<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.720> Berlin<00:01:37.049> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
shows like CES and Aoife and Berlin I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.390 
shows like CES and Aoife and Berlin I
mean<00:01:37.640> every<00:01:38.640> year<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.509> home<00:01:39.840> automation<00:01:40.400> gets

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
mean every year the home automation gets

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.940 
mean every year the home automation gets
this<00:01:42.119> section<00:01:42.689> gets<00:01:42.899> bigger<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.560> bigger<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
this section gets bigger and bigger and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.160 
this section gets bigger and bigger and
bigger<00:01:44.340> even<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> kitchen<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.990> would

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
bigger even the kitchen you would

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.590 
bigger even the kitchen you would
believe<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.860> best<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.240> we

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
believe we have the best and we have we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.660 
believe we have the best and we have we
do<00:01:48.720> lighting<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.409> from<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.460> view

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
do lighting from from I think the view

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.170 
do lighting from from I think the view
yeah<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:51.630> were<00:01:51.960> yeah<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.530> fill<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
yeah we were yeah the fill to you and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
yeah we were yeah the fill to you and
there's<00:01:54.360> other<00:01:54.540> bulbs<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:55.110> are<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.380> really

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
there's other bulbs that are also really

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.980 
there's other bulbs that are also really
really<00:01:55.829> good<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.630> just<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> general

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
really good but I think just in general

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
really good but I think just in general
even<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.680> kitchen<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.250> people<00:01:59.939> are<00:02:00.000> starting

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to find ways to sort of make it a little

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170 
to find ways to sort of make it a little
bit<00:02:03.659> smarter<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> question<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.790> how

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
bit smarter there is a question of how

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.619 
bit smarter there is a question of how
do<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.160> how<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.369> make<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> refrigerator

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
do you how do you make a refrigerator

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.710 
do you how do you make a refrigerator
like

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
like

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.710 
like
what<00:02:10.990> can<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.710> even<00:02:11.950> do<00:02:12.490> with<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.030> refrigerator

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
what can you even do with a refrigerator

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.340 
what can you even do with a refrigerator
how<00:02:13.960> far<00:02:14.380> can<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.800> go<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.520> so<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.080> just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
how far can you go and so is that just

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.780 
how far can you go and so is that just
something<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.770> doesn't<00:02:18.010> even<00:02:18.160> need<00:02:18.460> like<00:02:18.760> a

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
something it doesn't even need like a

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.820 
something it doesn't even need like a
computer<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.570> bed<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.780> kitchen<00:02:20.320> device<00:02:20.560> though

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
computer in bed a kitchen device though

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.500 
computer in bed a kitchen device though
right<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:21.730> that's<00:02:22.150> sort<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
right and I think that's sort of the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.660 
right and I think that's sort of the
question<00:02:23.020> is<00:02:23.140> like<00:02:23.290> way<00:02:23.620> for<00:02:24.190> a<00:02:24.220> lot<00:02:24.370> in<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.640> lot

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
question is like way for a lot in a lot

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.230 
question is like way for a lot in a lot
of<00:02:24.820> ways<00:02:25.030> i<00:02:25.390> get<00:02:26.050> a<00:02:26.760> refrigerator<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.850> tells

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
legs syndrome is already dangerous

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.450 
legs syndrome is already dangerous
enough<00:05:29.210> it<00:05:29.930> is<00:05:30.320> not<00:05:30.560> that<00:05:30.590> dangerous<00:05:31.039> but

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
enough it is not that dangerous but

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.060 
enough it is not that dangerous but
seriously<00:05:32.180> I<00:05:32.300> why<00:05:33.229> would<00:05:33.409> you<00:05:33.500> ever<00:05:33.650> want<00:05:33.800> to

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
seriously I why would you ever want to

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.939 
seriously I why would you ever want to
heat<00:05:34.400> up<00:05:34.430> your<00:05:34.849> laptop<00:05:35.120> any<00:05:35.599> laptop<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.800> the

heat up your laptop any laptop to the

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:39.040 
heat up your laptop any laptop to the
degree<00:05:37.099> that<00:05:37.310> you<00:05:37.550> could<00:05:37.849> cook<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.150> burger<00:05:38.449> like

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
degree that you could cook a burger like

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.529 
degree that you could cook a burger like
that<00:05:39.199> seems<00:05:39.669> horrible<00:05:40.669> I<00:05:40.849> would<00:05:41.120> never<00:05:41.389> want

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
that seems horrible I would never want

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.640 
that seems horrible I would never want
to<00:05:41.630> do<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:41.870> like<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.080> said<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.349> grease

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:42.650 
to do and like you said the grease

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.010 
to do and like you said the grease
factor<00:05:43.159> I<00:05:43.190> mean<00:05:43.460> what<00:05:44.090> is<00:05:44.240> even<00:05:44.479> happening<00:05:44.510> I

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
factor I mean what is even happening I

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.140 
factor I mean what is even happening I
don't<00:05:45.289> know<00:05:45.409> yeah<00:05:45.860> I<00:05:45.889> do<00:05:46.070> agree<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.490> it<00:05:46.849> is<00:05:46.880> a

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
don't know yeah I do agree that it is a

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.520 
don't know yeah I do agree that it is a
bad<00:05:48.050> idea<00:05:48.370> in<00:05:49.370> general<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:50.300> have<00:05:50.720> that<00:05:50.990> what<00:05:51.440> do

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
bad idea in general to have that what do

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.499 
bad idea in general to have that what do
you<00:05:51.620> think<00:05:51.949> of<00:05:52.070> not<00:05:52.490> only<00:05:52.729> well<00:05:53.389> not

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
you think of not only well not

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.270 
you think of not only well not
particularly<00:05:54.139> the<00:05:54.320> laptop<00:05:54.740> you<00:05:54.919> can<00:05:55.039> fry<00:05:55.250> a

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
particularly the laptop you can fry a

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.920 
particularly the laptop you can fry a
steak<00:05:55.639> or<00:05:55.820> a<00:05:55.849> hamburger<00:05:56.090> on<00:05:56.300> because<00:05:56.720> could

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
steak or a hamburger on because could

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.200 
steak or a hamburger on because could
come<00:05:57.349> on<00:05:57.500> that's<00:05:57.770> not<00:05:57.830> a<00:05:57.949> great<00:05:58.130> idea<00:05:58.220> but

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
come on that's not a great idea but

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.939 
come on that's not a great idea but
maybe<00:05:59.330> more<00:05:59.599> niche<00:05:59.870> technology<00:06:00.560> around<00:06:00.770> the

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
maybe more niche technology around the

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.029 
maybe more niche technology around the
home<00:06:01.159> or<00:06:01.840> weird<00:06:02.840> technology<00:06:03.560> like<00:06:03.740> this<00:06:03.770> in

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
home or weird technology like this in

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:05.439 
home or weird technology like this in
general<00:06:04.310> it<00:06:04.430> does<00:06:04.610> make<00:06:04.940> you<00:06:04.970> explore

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
general it does make you explore

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.149 
general it does make you explore
different<00:06:05.630> ideas<00:06:06.169> but<00:06:06.409> do<00:06:06.530> we<00:06:06.650> necessarily

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
different ideas but do we necessarily

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.550 
different ideas but do we necessarily
want<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.729> buy<00:06:07.880> or<00:06:08.150> need<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:08.360> at<00:06:08.690> all<00:06:08.840> and<00:06:09.080> what
