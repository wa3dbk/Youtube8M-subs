00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
a telescopic sight for precision and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.940 
a telescopic sight for precision and
also<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.879> has<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.989> standard<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.710> piece

trigger lock mechanism but this time it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.069 
trigger lock mechanism but this time it
is<00:00:44.190> finely<00:00:44.640> tuned<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.690> pull<00:00:45.899> is

in the toilet brush it also has a bipod
which<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.699> extend<00:00:54.440> like<00:00:55.440> this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
which you can actually extend like this

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.729 
which you can actually extend like this
and<00:00:55.949> this<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.260> rest<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and this so that you can rest it on a

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.180 
and this so that you can rest it on a
table<00:00:59.010> for<00:00:59.219> true<00:00:59.670> accuracy<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.710> course<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
table for true accuracy and of course it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.420

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and a very very deadly small fork let's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.070 
and a very very deadly small fork let's
test<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.320> out<00:01:10.439> here<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.250> could<00:01:11.400> see<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.729> setup

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
test it out here you could see my setup

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
test it out here you could see my setup
see<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.260> chair<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.860> table<00:01:14.070> down<00:01:14.549> there<00:01:14.580> in

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
see the chair and table down there in

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.450 
see the chair and table down there in
the<00:01:15.060> corner<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:17.000> see<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.360> target<00:01:18.810> here

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
the corner and see that target here

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.380 
the corner and see that target here
that's<00:01:20.460> 20<00:01:20.909> meters<00:01:21.180> apart<00:01:23.090> let's<00:01:24.090> see<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.299> we

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that's 20 meters apart let's see if we

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.700 
that's 20 meters apart let's see if we
could<00:01:24.570> hit<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> zombie<00:01:24.840> brain<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.530> that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
could hit a zombie brain from that

00:01:25.710 --> 00:02:05.000 
could hit a zombie brain from that
distance

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:13.070 

and<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:07.360> is<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.690> result<00:02:10.770> from<00:02:11.770> 20<00:02:12.220> meters

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and here is the result from 20 meters

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.680 
and here is the result from 20 meters
and<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.230> one<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:15.280> only<00:02:15.490> thing<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
and this one the only thing is that the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.560 
and this one the only thing is that the
chef<00:02:16.959> broke<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.850> thing<00:02:19.090> popped<00:02:19.360> right

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
chef broke and so the thing popped right

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.370 
chef broke and so the thing popped right
out<00:02:21.030> simply<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.540> was<00:02:22.660> too<00:02:22.870> tight<00:02:23.080> here

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
out simply because it was too tight here

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.070 
out simply because it was too tight here
and<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.709> brushes<00:02:24.360> came<00:02:25.360> into<00:02:25.510> contact<00:02:25.780> with

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and the brushes came into contact with

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.080 
and the brushes came into contact with
each<00:02:26.230> other<00:02:26.440> that's<00:02:27.280> why<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.550> brush<00:02:27.850> was

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
each other that's why the brush was

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.930 
each other that's why the brush was
stopped<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:29.530> nail<00:02:29.709> went<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:32.760> some<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.850> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
stopped and the nail went on some of the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.580 
stopped and the nail went on some of the
plywood<00:02:34.480> into<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.260> archery<00:02:35.709> map<00:02:40.260> Wow

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
plywood into the archery map Wow

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.320 
plywood into the archery map Wow
I<00:02:41.620> don't<00:02:42.280> think<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.640> could<00:02:42.820> have<00:02:42.850> been<00:02:42.970> any

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
I don't think it could have been any

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.090 
I don't think it could have been any
more<00:02:43.510> accurate<00:02:43.959> because<00:02:44.140> see<00:02:44.590> how<00:02:44.769> close

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
more accurate because see how close

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.810 
more accurate because see how close
together<00:02:45.640> the<00:02:46.269> arrows<00:02:46.570> are<00:02:47.519> well<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.610> seems

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
together the arrows are well it seems

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.910 
together the arrows are well it seems
like<00:02:49.000> I<00:02:49.090> have<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.269> tune<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:49.750> down<00:02:49.989> and<00:02:50.320> left<00:02:50.739> a

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
like I have to tune it down and left a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.520 
like I have to tune it down and left a
little<00:02:51.040> bit<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.459> hit<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.150> center<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:53.320> other

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
little bit to hit the center but other

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.890 
little bit to hit the center but other
than<00:02:53.709> that<00:02:53.950> I<00:02:54.220> think<00:02:54.580> that's<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.690> pretty

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
