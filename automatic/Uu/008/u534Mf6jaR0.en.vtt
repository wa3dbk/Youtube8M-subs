00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.029
 hello how am i like today's night 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.580
 cole and today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.050
 bag with a shirt first we're going 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.690
 to do with a tank top 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.580
 like this you see that does not have sleeves 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.710
 then we can reuse again if 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.470
 we need as a shirt I'm going too 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.730
 to use a cord the first thing 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.520
 what to do is to turn the 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.920
 T-shirt put it inside out like this 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.860
 we stretch it well and we will tie it with the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.330
 cord the bottom part is idea os 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.190
 can get out of trouble when you are 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.820
 for example on vacation and you need 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.000
 a bag to go down to the beach 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.010
 we turn it over again equal to 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.110
 our shirt has become a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.590
 bag to go to the beach or the pool 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.170
 summer bag I will use my new 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.170
 bag for the pool 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.220
 as you see here it fits perfectly a 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.800
 towel maybe the swimsuits the flip flops 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.780
 sun cream etcetera etcetera ideal 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.050
 for children or with shirts that you have 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.090
 that have remained old for example 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.640
 this shirt am not perfect bad time 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.670
 limited edition I'm not perfect but I'm 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.440
 limited edition great the message what 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.270
 happens if we do it with a shirt 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.119
 sleeves like this for example that to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.070
 we do not need we have 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.560
 that cut the bottom part that then 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.940
 we are going to use as cord we are going to 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.940
 also cut the sleeves 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.670
 that are going to be the handles of our bag 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.920
 or bag 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.360
 and we are also going to cut the neck what 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.030
 It is best done by the front 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.710
 to cut it well is usually more 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.689
 under the front 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.780
 we already have a tank top and 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.670
 we repeat the operation turning it around 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.710
 in this case we're going to tie it down with the 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.000
 little piece of shirt that we have trimmed 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:57.300
 before we make a couple of nuditos 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.160
 and we will turn it again this you can 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.150
 do with old shirts not new 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.220
 because it would spoil because here we have 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 our shirt with the spine and daniela 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.850

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.160
