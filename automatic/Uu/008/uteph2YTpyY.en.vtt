00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.330
 The most awaited event for fans of club music 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.330
 Kostroma: Dj Rich Art in the club "ZhiR" 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.520
 The ZhiR Club welcomes the most fashionable guests 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:31.099
 and popular DJ Rich Art. 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:47.480
 - Did you sacrifice something for success? 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.820
 Had to. 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.070
 You sacrifice every day. 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.040
 Instead of sleeping a little longer, you get up and make 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.040
 work yourself. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.960
 And if we talk about the global, I probably donated 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.180
 normal education, because somehow I graduated 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.759
 Institute for dozens of extra retake. 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.640
 - Your musical preferences? 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:32.880
 One of the most exciting speeches I have attended is 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.380
 when we went for a week to ibiza. 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.150
 Of the Swedes, only Axwell spoke, and it was very 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 cool. 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.680
 This is the coolest thing I've heard in recent years. 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.530
 from the music collection and from the filing. 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.890
 A day later I was listening to Tiesto, and it was 5 levels lower. 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.599
 - How is the selection of material? 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.640
 Based on personal taste preferences. 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:31.260
 I monitor what is on TV, radio, constantly 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.280
 looking through the charts. 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:45.830
 I know what consumes popular pop hits 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.760
 people. 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.920
 Trying to understand what I’m interested in remixing 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:05.260
 what will sound and like the audience. 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:29.819
 I used to work on the mix for a month, now it's a day or two. 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.670
 The first mix was in the year 2004. 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:04:03.960
 Guests came to Kostroma, and they are delighted with the music, 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.650
 cities and people. 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:37.031
 - Whom do you plan to bring to Kostroma? 

00:04:37.031 --> 00:04:38.099
 DJ Baur. 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:49.199
 He is a very good and popular DJ. 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.939
 - Did your expectations about the public come true today? 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:54.539
 Everything was justified. 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:56.800
 Everything is just super. 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.800
 - Work with what musicians do you remember most? 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.140
 There is personal contact with the Russians, but all 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.839
 equals to a minimum because there is no such 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:11.089
 all gathered together at the studio, ten double recordings 

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:12.089
 tracks. 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:14.979
 No, usually everything is set for routine. 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.510
 You send the material, then adjustments. 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.070
 This is how the work develops. 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.089
 A live chat comes down to one meeting. 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:36.319
 The only thing that recently was written by Ilya Zudin’s vocal 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.639
 member of the group "Dynamite". 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.439
 He rehearsed their old song. 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:46.340
 We re-recorded it live in our studio. 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.300
 I also communicate well with Sergey Zhukov, we recently 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.719
 were at the group "Hands Up" at a concert. 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:06:02.039
 We have plans to start creating together. 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.030
 But while we are very busy. 

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:20.639
 - with what mood you leave 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:21.639
 to the stage? 

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.319
 Almost always with good. 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:34.020
 But it happens that no mood. 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.289
 Very much exhausting travel, flights, lack of sleep. 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.029
 Already affects the amount of work, sometimes you think - what for 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.400
 I need all this, I want to sit at home. 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.309
 But still tune myself, because it is mine 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:51.309
 a business. 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:07:04.229
 We must do everything so that people enjoy. 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:13.740
 - How do you plan to spend the New Year holidays? 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:14.740
 At work. 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:24.849
 New Year for any artist - it is always earnings. 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:46.319
 - Will you come to Kostroma? 

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:51.699
 Of course. 

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:53.059
 If you invite, I will definitely come.
