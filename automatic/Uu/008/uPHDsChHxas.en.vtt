like that we make sure that our

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.610 
like that we make sure that our
batteries<00:02:22.180> are<00:02:22.300> already<00:02:22.570> always<00:02:23.140> fresh<00:02:23.440> in

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
batteries are already always fresh in

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.890 
batteries are already always fresh in
there<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:23.950> new<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.340> working<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.660> that's

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
there and new and working so that's

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.050 
there and new and working so that's
basically<00:02:26.280> underneath<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.460> sink<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.820> then

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
basically underneath the sink and then

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.090 
basically underneath the sink and then
so<00:02:28.300> one<00:02:28.480> tip<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.780> have<00:02:28.810> for<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.410> use<00:02:29.860> the
