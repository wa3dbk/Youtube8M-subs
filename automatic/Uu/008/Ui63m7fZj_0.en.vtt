00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
fingers now one thing that I didn't

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.230

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
mention in my previous video that i

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.670 
mention in my previous video that i
actually<00:01:48.479> had<00:01:48.780> edit<00:01:49.079> because<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.350> was<00:01:49.469> too

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
actually had edit because it was too

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.700 
actually had edit because it was too
long<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.219> i<00:01:50.399> did<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> shower<00:01:51.710> i

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
long is that i did take on the shower i

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
long is that i did take on the shower i
find<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.399> saves<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.700> lot<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:53.969> because

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
find that it saves a lot of time because

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
find that it saves a lot of time because
um<00:01:55.409> typically<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.250> i<00:01:56.280> would<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.909> i<00:01:57.090> would

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
um typically what i would do is i would

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.760 
um typically what i would do is i would
wait<00:01:57.450> until<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.869> out<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.290> shower<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
wait until i got out of the shower and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.770 
wait until i got out of the shower and
then<00:01:59.219> i<00:01:59.280> would

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
then i would

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.850 
then i would
