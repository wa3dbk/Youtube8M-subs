I<00:00:34.649> guess<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.700> chapter<00:00:36.270> self<00:00:36.510> went<00:00:36.750> by<00:00:36.870> quick

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
I guess the chapter self went by quick

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.600 
I guess the chapter self went by quick
but<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.620> kind<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.010> happens<00:00:38.399> with

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
but that's kind of what happens with

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.060 
but that's kind of what happens with
bleach<00:00:39.050> action<00:00:40.050> chapters<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> last<00:00:40.770> three

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bleach action chapters the last three

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
bleach action chapters the last three
have<00:00:41.219> been<00:00:41.370> very<00:00:41.790> fast<00:00:42.090> reads<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.719> imagine<00:00:43.410> when

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
have been very fast reads I imagine when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.900 
have been very fast reads I imagine when
you<00:00:43.620> read<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:44.010> three<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.460> row<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.760> all

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you read these three in a row all all

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.069 
you read these three in a row all all
flow<00:00:45.149> together<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.600> this<00:00:45.660> fight<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.020> be

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
flow together and this fight will be

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
flow together and this fight will be
much<00:00:46.289> more<00:00:46.500> impressive<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.550> think<00:00:47.670> probably

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
much more impressive so I think probably

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
much more impressive so I think probably
for<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.329> next<00:00:48.690> review<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.110> bleach<00:00:49.320> if<00:00:49.590> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
for my next review of bleach if this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
for my next review of bleach if this
fight<00:00:49.980> doesn't<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.430> continue<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:50.969> it

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
fight doesn't in continue and it

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
fight doesn't in continue and it
probably<00:00:51.570> will<00:00:51.840> reaches<00:00:52.320> climax<00:00:52.770> next<00:00:53.160> week<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
probably will reaches climax next week I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.330 
probably will reaches climax next week I
will<00:00:54.090> probably<00:00:54.420> read<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:54.870> four<00:00:55.070> chapters<00:00:56.070> or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
will probably read all four chapters or

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.400 
will probably read all four chapters or
four<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.030> five<00:00:57.149> chapters<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> fight<00:00:58.020> all

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
four or five chapters of this fight all

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
four or five chapters of this fight all
in<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.859> hit<00:00:59.039> again<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> can<00:00:59.609> give<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.850> know

in one hit again so I can give you know
a<00:00:59.969> proper<00:01:00.149> flavor<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.840> my<00:01:01.559> thoughts<00:01:01.949> on<00:01:02.160> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
a proper flavor of my thoughts on this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.100 
a proper flavor of my thoughts on this
whole<00:01:02.430> battle<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> whole<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:04.019> know

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
whole battle as a whole because you know

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.050 
whole battle as a whole because you know
it<00:01:04.260> doesn't<00:01:04.439> seem<00:01:04.680> quite<00:01:05.189> right<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.939> know

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
it doesn't seem quite right me you know

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.940 
it doesn't seem quite right me you know
kind<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> picking<00:01:06.930> apart<00:01:07.049> all<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.619> chapters

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

kind of picking apart all this chapters
seem<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.310> quick<00:01:08.580> when<00:01:09.060> actually<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:09.810> you
