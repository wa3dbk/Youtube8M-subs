work yes when I originally read on this

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.080 
work yes when I originally read on this
years<00:01:29.620> ago<00:01:29.770> I<00:01:29.890> made<00:01:30.220> a<00:01:30.280> point<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.790> I<00:01:30.850> thought

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
years ago I made a point that I thought

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.300 
years ago I made a point that I thought
the<00:01:31.360> story<00:01:31.690> went<00:01:31.990> from<00:01:32.200> Jesus<00:01:32.620> being<00:01:32.860> servant

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
the story went from Jesus being servant

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.880 
the story went from Jesus being servant
Messiah<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.910> Lord<00:01:34.180> a<00:01:34.470> nuances<00:01:35.470> slightly

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
Messiah to Lord a nuances slightly

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.460 
Messiah to Lord a nuances slightly
differently<00:01:36.280> now<00:01:36.550> and<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.840> point<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:38.440> that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
differently now and the point is is that

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.110 
differently now and the point is is that
all<00:01:38.800> those<00:01:39.040> titles<00:01:39.490> are<00:01:39.640> there<00:01:39.790> early<00:01:40.090> on

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
all those titles are there early on

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.930 
all those titles are there early on
including<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:40.900> idea<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.470> war

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
including the idea of war

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.420 
including the idea of war
but<00:01:42.510> I<00:01:42.540> think<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.290> way<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.800> movement<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
but I think the way the movement of the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.520 
but I think the way the movement of the
story<00:01:44.730> basically<00:01:45.300> works<00:01:45.510> is<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.080> first<00:01:46.350> we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
story basically works is that first we

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440 
story basically works is that first we
work<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.100> developed<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.640> categories<00:01:48.210> that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
work in developed the categories that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.960 
work in developed the categories that
we're<00:01:48.900> familiar<00:01:49.230> with<00:01:49.530> Messiah<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.430> prophet

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
we're familiar with Messiah and prophet

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.600 
we're familiar with Messiah and prophet
and<00:01:51.210> then<00:01:51.690> in<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.260> middle<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.980> gospel<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
and then in the middle of the gospel and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.360 
and then in the middle of the gospel and
then<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.000> two<00:01:54.150> acts<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:55.020> prominent<00:01:55.560> shifts<00:01:56.250> to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
then in two acts the prominent shifts to

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.670 
then in two acts the prominent shifts to
emphasizing<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.120> Jesus<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.900> Christ<00:01:58.320> we

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
emphasizing how Jesus this Christ we

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.630 
emphasizing how Jesus this Christ we
still<00:01:58.920> keep<00:01:59.190> that<00:01:59.400> base<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.380> Lord<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.770> through

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
still keep that base is Lord and through

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.000 
still keep that base is Lord and through
many<00:02:02.940> scenes<00:02:03.330> that<00:02:03.540> demonstrate<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
many scenes that demonstrate this the

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.680 
many scenes that demonstrate this the
authority<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.580> his<00:02:05.730> name<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.210> other<00:02:06.360> things

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
authority of his name and other things

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.380 
authority of his name and other things
that<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.800> show<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.610> Jesus<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.149> Lord
