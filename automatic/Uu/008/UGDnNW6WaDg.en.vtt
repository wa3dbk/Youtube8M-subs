00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.160
 so you would have animals to the next player 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.020
 review and today there is alexis sanchez 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.610
 second in form is now on the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.710
 left wing of his originality 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.420
 right on love for crm and now on 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.540
 the left wing had 86 euros 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.490
 rettinger thereby new tempo 139 80 80 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.609
 fit 70 46 and workroom right foot 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.500
 drive on the ground has left me 577 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.910
 cost and the city just by award 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.230
 and has up for it in four games 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 Thus achieved is ever quite good 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.460
 his ingolstadt are not hat you have to 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.679
 say but the are outstanding 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.840
 really just awesome and crass 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.300
 Decreases red cross and it has easy 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.890
 already very much about alexander 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.649
 Waibl we drive a lot again, of course 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 used to all over with his 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.510
 pace and of course if you are a player 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.760
 is the almost 3 worth over 90 and pace 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 is one of these values then it is already there 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.820
 sometimes relatively practical and secondly 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.680
 the tempo just about abnormal that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.090
 The guy is just as fast as you can 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.260
 about the super pace so for all 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.340
 people who simply did not want to cheat 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.199
 Just run and run 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.049
 run alexis sanchez textform is yours 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.589
 because you could because you can not do anything 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.580
 do wrong 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.380
 The guy is just really easy if 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 one against ferrari there on the left 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.260
 In each case, some of them fly 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.420
 there you can do what you want and 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.560
 she had no problems in herself 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.549
 to bring surplus position but that is 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 necessary because he can not even 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.659
 black like this one for example 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.310
 proves it is longchance in there 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.439
 no problem with him at all 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.060
 I nem long time with so 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 good wage protégé played like 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.700
 dumb player opponent lied so 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.920
 I 've played hirschmüller for 20 years 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.290
 totti and alexander are in fact even 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.310
 I did not find anything alexander exactly the same 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.530
 hopefully a bit better 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.579
 weather with the sister stood him in 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.350
 nothing after 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.450
 we'll see a few if that 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 people go or just minimal about it 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.549
 So it's just right 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.140
 proven at lexar sanchez and his 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.750
 conclusion even in the 16er no 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.549
 problem for him because you're reading 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.810
 with his left foot that is not 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.070
 more practical because he has his 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.049
 Record with three digits is natural 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700
 very questionable and that really 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.770
 not good but with the shoots 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.720
 partly also like a closed one 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.880
 lama on leprosy 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.530
 is as left as you have seen but 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.630
 completely free and just complete 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.520
 build next to it is not his left 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.940
 Strength otherwise , I will be right everything hotel 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 purely 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.940
 the triple is just right too 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 horny dribbling while living possible 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.360
 thanks i said i only believe in 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.750
 last preview but otherwise in three 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.880
 lengths 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.680
 that's so good that's what makes him feel that way 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.120
 much better than his first in shape 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.710
 a mannheimer informs his first 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.780
 also a very good dribbling was included 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.550
 in the middle he often became strong 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.060
 doubt if I'm going against his body 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.490
 goes down 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.020
 not at the way and that has mine 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.310
 opinion after extremely weak and now 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.170
 also not the most blatant body poses 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.970
 The land needs but he seems simple 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.450
 a little stronger he just acts 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.010
 a bit stronger 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 and he even becomes that for a wing 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700
 very strong in my opinion has many 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.990
 has twice won often the two 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.430
 not lost that on the one hand to 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.959
 to drilling and that he no longer 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.610
 against the strong players in the body 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.020
 but it must be done for you 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.440
 me very much better than 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.420
 his 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.490
 first in terms of agility 90 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.660
 agility in the games is too 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.270
 phenomenal 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.560
 the wind turns tricky situation 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.490
 out and has no problem with that too 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.400
 with the defenders to stand 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.540
 That's why the agility is also very good 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.459
 imaginable that even so be 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.080
 can work perfectly with no problems 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.489
 of course, the game's point of departure would still be 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.560
 but nice in front of it comes naturally 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.530
 always so on and the positional game is 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.239
 with homework and whether 88 positions now 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 also outstanding no problem somehow 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.459
 we do not use it ourselves 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.840
 would dribble otherwise poorly 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.970
 Just advise the one ahead 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.930
 hit the left and overflow the 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.340
 below no problem somehow in 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.190
 scene have to put the negative 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.120
 already raised his anger is 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.230
 really stupid 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.450
 So not really stupid but 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.680
 really shit and therefore left 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.870
 you should really try too 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.070
 avoid closing with him and 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 his award and should I get in 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:52.530
 first in shape is not quite even 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.420
 stronger today I believe in 626 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.709
 but if paid then buy 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.630
 probably now he will go further 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.519
 rise because of very cheap then 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.200
 not anyway he has me by far 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.150
 better than 1 had made sense 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.950
 at a later date just because he is still like that 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.690
 many gates shot alexis sanchez 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.459
 Eckmann format similar many gates 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.320
 shot i believe one or two me 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.790
 just do not know but he has 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.440
 much more fun if you just 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.580
 can be used to play out much mentor 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.049
 because he just on the left wing 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.150
 was and had room for more and so on 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.570
 a lot of 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.280
 room to do had horny is english 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.930
 otherwise on the wing of them really 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.600
 I am therefore much better in front of me 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.640
 the end effect is 9.3 out of 10 and one 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.130
 village upwards so for all the the 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.750
 can afford it and in their bpm 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.150
 or in any one third trophy 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.770
 part or so in fashion alexander alexis 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.990
 Sanchez has on the left wing us 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.720
 you can take the type 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.130
 perfect no problem not mine 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.450
 every case a thumb high but that 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.420
 was again from this player 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.500
 I was finished 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.810
 There are now I believe one or more 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.520
 two player reviews for the expired in 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.110
 Team of the week so next time 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.280
 the current team is already again 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.990
 so half are seven players or something 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.360
 I want to get around but the time 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.800
 is not enough right now I'm trying this 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.120
 be kind of if I am 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.190
 nasty if it's a week later 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.840
 the player reviews a team on the way 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.250
 he lived almost in front of me 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.890
 can my comment write that 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.260
 pretty shitty or he says 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.410
 tobi is not a problem we take so too 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.150
 otherwise the days i will now 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.500
 try to start a new series 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.000
 by the way, promise themselves 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.080
 right straight three fastest of course 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.390
 it falls in the report 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.000
 but otherwise it was really from this 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.300
 Video sunday bring our everyday life 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300
 at least
