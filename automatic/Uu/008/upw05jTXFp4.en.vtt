00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.750 
then your pink goes underneath it on six
string<00:02:48.260> or<00:02:48.500> third<00:02:49.070> fret<00:02:50.230> ok<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.650> now<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.370> I've

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
string or third fret ok so now that I've

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.850 
string or third fret ok so now that I've
shown<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.360> chords<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.170> cord<00:02:54.829> passion<00:02:55.670> is

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
shown you the chords the cord passion is

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.460 
shown you the chords the cord passion is
what<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.100> for<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.430> verse<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.450> minor<00:02:59.959> F<00:03:01.239> see

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
what so for the verse it's a minor F see

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:10.210 
what so for the verse it's a minor F see
G<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.829> then<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:05.060> is<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:06.049> same<00:03:08.590> for<00:03:09.590> everything

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
G and then it is the same for everything

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.550 
G and then it is the same for everything
yeah<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:11.180> lets<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.870> cord<00:03:12.079> pant<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.470> whole

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
yeah it lets the cord pant for the whole

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
yeah it lets the cord pant for the whole
dresser<00:03:12.980> oh<00:03:13.220> yeah<00:03:13.910> so<00:03:15.220> they're<00:03:16.220> a<00:03:16.700> basic

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
dresser oh yeah so they're a basic

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.890 
dresser oh yeah so they're a basic
strong<00:03:17.750> pattern<00:03:18.170> I<00:03:18.590> would<00:03:19.100> probably<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:20.060> do

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
strong pattern I would probably just do

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.870 
strong pattern I would probably just do
a<00:03:21.760> Down<00:03:22.760> stroke<00:03:23.000> and<00:03:24.070> so<00:03:25.070> just<00:03:25.459> sound<00:03:25.790> like

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
a Down stroke and so just sound like

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.750 
a Down stroke and so just sound like
this

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.000 

but<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.690> all<00:03:34.870> very<00:03:35.110> complicated<00:03:35.380> but

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
but for it's all very complicated but

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.780 
but for it's all very complicated but
you<00:03:36.190> need<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.550> get<00:03:36.700> into<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.940> rhythm<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.420> it<00:03:37.600> is

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
you need to get into the rhythm of it is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.640 
you need to get into the rhythm of it is
down<00:03:39.790> down<00:03:40.650> down<00:03:41.650> up<00:03:41.710> up<00:03:42.340> down<00:03:43.080> up<00:03:44.080> down<00:03:44.110> up

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
down down down up up down up down up

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.860 
down down down up up down up down up
down<00:03:44.950> down<00:03:45.610> down<00:03:45.990> so<00:03:46.990> this<00:03:47.620> is<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:48.010> in<00:03:48.870> normal

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
down down down so this is it in normal

00:03:49.870 --> 00:04:01.950 
down down down so this is it in normal
speed

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:08.250 

and<00:04:02.640> then<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:05.490> down<00:04:06.490> down<00:04:07.240> down<00:04:07.600> up<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.140> down

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
and then so down down down up and down

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.830 
and then so down down down up and down
up<00:04:08.410> down<00:04:08.620> up<00:04:08.860> down<00:04:09.240> down<00:04:11.490> down<00:04:12.600> down<00:04:13.600> up<00:04:13.630> down

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
up down up down down down down up down

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.750 
up down up down down down down up down
down<00:04:14.650> up<00:04:14.710> down<00:04:15.450> down<00:04:16.450> up<00:04:17.080> down<00:04:17.140> down<00:04:17.980> down<00:04:18.370> down

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
down up down down up down down down down

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.610 
down up down down up down down down down
down<00:04:19.410> down<00:04:20.410> down<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.550> then<00:04:22.300> each<00:04:22.540> of<00:04:22.960> those

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
down down down and then each of those

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:29.310 
down down down and then each of those
are<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:24.960> bait<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.380> it's<00:04:27.000> one<00:04:28.000> two<00:04:28.030> three<00:04:28.960> four

know the bed feels warmer and then for

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.960 
know the bed feels warmer and then for
the<00:04:53.260> pre-course<00:04:53.890> which<00:04:54.190> is<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.610> think<00:04:54.820> are

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
the pre-course which is you think are

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:08.210 
the pre-course which is you think are
the<00:04:55.060> best<00:04:55.180> of<00:04:55.360> me<00:04:55.510> it<00:04:55.720> is<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.680> same<00:04:56.980> so

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.720 

okay<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:10.080> that<00:05:11.080> is<00:05:11.110> the<00:05:11.680> verse<00:05:12.130> and<00:05:12.340> creeks<00:05:12.610> or

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
okay so that is the verse and creeks or

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.880 
okay so that is the verse and creeks or
so<00:05:13.000> for<00:05:13.630> the<00:05:13.840> chorus<00:05:14.380> I'm<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:17.080> good<00:05:17.680> thing

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
so for the chorus I'm the good thing

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.830 
so for the chorus I'm the good thing
about<00:05:17.920> this<00:05:18.280> is<00:05:18.340> it's<00:05:18.760> the<00:05:18.910> same<00:05:19.120> cool<00:05:19.390> parent

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
about this is it's the same cool parent

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.100 
about this is it's the same cool parent
and<00:05:20.140> usually<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.190> same<00:05:21.370> strong<00:05:21.760> so<00:05:22.210> we're

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
and usually the same strong so we're

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.050 
and usually the same strong so we're
doesn't<00:05:23.410> kill<00:05:23.590> you<00:05:23.710> makes<00:05:23.740> you<00:05:24.010> stronger<00:05:24.430> yeah

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
doesn't kill you makes you stronger yeah

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.960 
doesn't kill you makes you stronger yeah
it's<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.660> same<00:05:25.900> show<00:05:26.200> me<00:05:26.380> again<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.700> only

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
it's the same show me again and the only

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.660 
it's the same show me again and the only
place<00:05:28.720> it<00:05:29.110> would<00:05:29.260> probably<00:05:29.740> change<00:05:30.070> is<00:05:30.520> the

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
place it would probably change is the

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.470 
place it would probably change is the
bridge<00:05:31.740> which<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.980> more<00:05:33.370> just<00:05:33.730> a<00:05:33.790> basic<00:05:34.030> one

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
bridge which is more just a basic one

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:47.250 
bridge which is more just a basic one
which<00:05:34.720> would<00:05:34.870> be<00:05:44.640> she's<00:05:45.640> down<00:05:45.970> down<00:05:46.630> up<00:05:46.660> down

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
which would be she's down down up down

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:56.310 
which would be she's down down up down
down<00:05:47.980> up<00:05:48.310> down<00:05:52.470> it's<00:05:53.470> a<00:05:53.650> lot<00:05:53.800> slower<00:05:54.010> so<00:05:54.820> I<00:05:55.320> sure

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
down up down it's a lot slower so I sure

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:57.990 
down up down it's a lot slower so I sure
