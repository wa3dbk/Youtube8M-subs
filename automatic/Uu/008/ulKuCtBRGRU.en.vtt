lifecycle<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.400> mean<00:05:31.550> look<00:05:31.699> at<00:05:31.819> the<00:05:32.979> dearth<00:05:33.979> of

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
lifecycle I mean look at the dearth of

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.490 
lifecycle I mean look at the dearth of
games<00:05:34.550> for<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.090> wii<00:05:35.210> right<00:05:35.479> now<00:05:35.629> no<00:05:36.050> one<00:05:36.199> cares

games for the wii right now no one cares

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.990 
games for the wii right now no one cares
they're<00:05:36.770> all<00:05:36.889> moved<00:05:37.099> on<00:05:37.190> to<00:05:37.370> the<00:05:37.460> wii<00:05:37.580> u<00:05:37.819> and

they're all moved on to the wii u and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.089 
they're all moved on to the wii u and
this<00:05:38.690> does<00:05:38.930> sort<00:05:39.139> of<00:05:39.199> start<00:05:39.379> to<00:05:39.500> happen<00:05:39.710> once

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
this does sort of start to happen once

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.830 
this does sort of start to happen once
the<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.550> new<00:05:40.669> technology<00:05:41.270> is<00:05:41.389> out<00:05:41.539> there

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
the the new technology is out there

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.749 
the the new technology is out there
developers<00:05:42.770> start<00:05:43.009> looking<00:05:43.370> at<00:05:43.460> that<00:05:43.580> new

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
developers start looking at that new

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.430 
developers start looking at that new
tech<00:05:44.060> and<00:05:44.270> with<00:05:44.360> every<00:05:44.690> new<00:05:44.840> project<00:05:45.319> they're

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
tech and with every new project they're

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.379 
tech and with every new project they're
coming<00:05:45.680> up<00:05:45.740> with<00:05:45.919> i<00:05:46.009> got<00:05:46.159> to<00:05:46.250> think<00:05:46.490> do<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.150> go

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
coming up with i got to think do I go

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.959 
coming up with i got to think do I go
current-gen<00:05:47.960> do<00:05:48.380> I<00:05:48.440> go<00:05:48.680> next<00:05:48.919> gen<00:05:49.310> and<00:05:49.490> there's

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
current-gen do I go next gen and there's

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.219 
current-gen do I go next gen and there's
going<00:05:50.120> to<00:05:50.180> be<00:05:50.210> that<00:05:50.449> breaking<00:05:50.900> point<00:05:51.110> we're

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
going to be that breaking point we're

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.080 
going to be that breaking point we're
going<00:05:51.319> to<00:05:51.409> be<00:05:51.529> a<00:05:51.560> big<00:05:51.919> swing<00:05:52.250> and<00:05:52.279> we're<00:05:52.699> you're

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
going to be a big swing and we're you're

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.430 
going to be a big swing and we're you're
not<00:05:53.330> going<00:05:53.539> to<00:05:53.599> see<00:05:53.719> much<00:05:53.930> coming<00:05:54.259> for<00:05:54.380> the

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
not going to see much coming for the

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.290 
not going to see much coming for the
current<00:05:54.620> consoles<00:05:55.219> that's<00:05:55.849> why<00:05:56.000> I<00:05:56.029> think

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
current consoles that's why I think

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.180 
current consoles that's why I think
we've<00:05:56.449> seen<00:05:56.630> a<00:05:56.659> lot<00:05:56.779> of<00:05:56.990> delays<00:05:57.409> into<00:05:58.009> the

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
we've seen a lot of delays into the

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.070 
we've seen a lot of delays into the
spring<00:05:58.639> is<00:05:58.909> there's<00:05:59.479> a<00:05:59.539> lot<00:05:59.659> of<00:05:59.690> people<00:05:59.870> saying

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
spring is there's a lot of people saying

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.959 
spring is there's a lot of people saying
well<00:06:00.139> we<00:06:00.319> got<00:06:00.440> to<00:06:00.529> finish<00:06:00.620> up<00:06:00.830> this<00:06:00.949> game<00:06:01.219> but

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:01.969 
well we got to finish up this game but

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.790 
well we got to finish up this game but
it's<00:06:02.300> either<00:06:02.479> this<00:06:02.659> holiday<00:06:03.110> or<00:06:03.319> the<00:06:03.469> spring

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
it's either this holiday or the spring

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.430 
it's either this holiday or the spring
and<00:06:04.039> that's<00:06:04.940> it<00:06:05.150> because<00:06:05.360> after<00:06:05.779> that<00:06:05.810> you're

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
and that's it because after that you're

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.110 
and that's it because after that you're
going<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.620> be<00:06:06.680> a<00:06:06.800> generation<00:06:07.400> behind<00:06:07.580> and

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
going to be a generation behind and

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.279 
going to be a generation behind and
that's<00:06:08.300> always<00:06:08.449> going<00:06:08.659> to<00:06:08.750> have<00:06:08.779> some<00:06:09.020> sales

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
that's always going to have some sales

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.540 
that's always going to have some sales
issues<00:06:09.680> when<00:06:09.860> you're<00:06:09.979> selling<00:06:10.129> a<00:06:10.279> game<00:06:10.400> that's

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
issues when you're selling a game that's

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.360 
issues when you're selling a game that's
a<00:06:10.639> generation<00:06:11.150> behind<00:06:11.590> but<00:06:12.590> it<00:06:12.680> also<00:06:12.860> shows<00:06:13.219> I

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
a generation behind but it also shows I

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.129 
a generation behind but it also shows I
think<00:06:13.550> a<00:06:13.610> very<00:06:13.639> good<00:06:14.029> thing<00:06:14.180> that<00:06:14.240> Sony<00:06:14.690> has<00:06:14.779> no

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
think a very good thing that Sony has no

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.800 
think a very good thing that Sony has no
plans<00:06:15.440> to<00:06:15.650> fall<00:06:15.860> a<00:06:16.069> year<00:06:16.550> behind<00:06:16.810> Microsoft

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
plans to fall a year behind Microsoft

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.209 
plans to fall a year behind Microsoft
like<00:06:17.990> they<00:06:18.080> did<00:06:18.229> with<00:06:18.319> the<00:06:18.409> PlayStation<00:06:18.919> 3

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
like they did with the PlayStation 3

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.850 
like they did with the PlayStation 3
they've<00:06:19.879> been<00:06:20.090> playing<00:06:20.300> catch-up<00:06:20.590> the<00:06:21.590> whole

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
they've been playing catch-up the whole

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.409 
they've been playing catch-up the whole
time<00:06:22.190> because<00:06:22.639> of<00:06:22.849> that<00:06:23.029> and<00:06:23.120> I<00:06:23.180> think

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
time because of that and I think

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.269 
time because of that and I think
obviously<00:06:23.569> they<00:06:23.930> learned<00:06:24.139> a<00:06:24.259> lesson<00:06:24.409> and<00:06:24.800> he

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:25.279 
obviously they learned a lesson and he

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.309 
obviously they learned a lesson and he
says<00:06:25.490> both<00:06:25.879> of<00:06:26.090> them<00:06:26.210> are<00:06:26.419> planning<00:06:27.139> to<00:06:27.169> launch

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
says both of them are planning to launch

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.790 
says both of them are planning to launch
in<00:06:27.620> about<00:06:28.159> a<00:06:28.190> year's<00:06:28.490> time<00:06:28.819> so<00:06:29.300> it<00:06:30.169> can<00:06:30.560> be<00:06:30.710> an

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
in about a year's time so it can be an
