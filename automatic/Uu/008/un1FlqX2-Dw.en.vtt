00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
body so one of the first things I'll see
to<00:00:27.840> deteriorate<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.039> terms<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.429> someone<00:00:29.820> who's

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
their hair and their nails because the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.410 
their hair and their nails because the
body<00:00:35.340> doesn't<00:00:35.670> really<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.120> them<00:00:36.239> for

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
body doesn't really need them for

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
body doesn't really need them for
survival<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.140> we'll<00:00:37.290> use<00:00:37.500> nutrition<00:00:38.070> for

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
survival and we'll use nutrition for

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.110 
survival and we'll use nutrition for
other<00:00:39.360> more<00:00:39.870> essential<00:00:40.290> parts<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> system

so what happens is that what is the skin

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.190 
so what happens is that what is the skin
made<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> what<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.780> hair<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.020> nails
