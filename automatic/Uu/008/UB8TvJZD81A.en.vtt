00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
slide test we tested both phones sliding

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.490 
slide test we tested both phones sliding
on<00:00:35.040> plastic<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.670> wood<00:00:35.940> surfaces<00:00:36.660> bones<00:00:37.290> are

made of the exact same material the 6
plus<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> heavier<00:00:43.320> so<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.710> took<00:00:43.829> me<00:00:43.890> longer<00:00:44.190> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
plus is heavier so it took me longer to
