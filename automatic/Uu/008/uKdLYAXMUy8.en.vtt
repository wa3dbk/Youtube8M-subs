00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.550
 the most difficult games in the world 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:29.189
 let's start that our amazing list 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:33.030
 with the game metal slug but anyway and maybe 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.579
 call 1 was released in 1986 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.370
 So if you are from this time, and until 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 place where he had several arcades to buy 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 a record that at that time was 25 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.840
 cents put there and played and a 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.660
 curiosity that for you air names 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.480
 hot rolling metal slug was neo 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:57.390
 Geo mvs dude, but where are you from? 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.760
 wondering so calm face beauty 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.340
 I made this operation in play 2 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.010
 There is one collection but I did not 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.900
 play in the arcade what is the difference then 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 The only difference you have is when 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.290
 You die in the arcade and you pay 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 collection version of the PlayStation 2 or 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.479
 in pc arcade controllers you already 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.580
 have those virtual chips or even 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.250
 even the game scheduled for you 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.439
 die and continue but in the hot air face 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 it was not like that you died and had to 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.009
 pay 25 cents for another token 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.799
 can play 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.700
 Okay, if you do not understand, this is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.350
 you buy a 25 cent chip 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.770
 put it on the machine and play you have 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 three lives died at three in game over 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.479
 30 and another pretended to be able to continue 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.700
 basically that's what I told you to drink 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.670
 careful not to die such a thing 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.009
 it is of utility even I will be already walk 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 in the air cage did not tick off locals 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.820
 I played and played I played in our 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 wallet everything here 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 but anyway guys is this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.400
 2 on the river the two and the three are very good 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.369
 I used 11 and 12 at my friend's house I 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.020
 I'm not mistaken, it was very crazy, man. 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 Ball show and highly recommend you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.000
 playing metal slug nowadays is not 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.590
 as popular and as it was then I 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.580
 I'm not mistaken the last game was released 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.790
 in 2011 for the ps but there it is not expensive 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.170
 the difficulty was losing that thing 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.170
 insane so tone fuller a baiano 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.650
 playing skrillex mann 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.080
 the other very difficult game the guy is the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.209
 against 3 released for super nintendo 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.209
 will play a lot in san 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.630
 just remembering here that exists against the oo 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.959
 against 2 against 3 and controlling for the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.510
 play 2 that no one knows against 36 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.880
 in the same style as the metal slug you 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.860
 go run in shoot jump and so will 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.360
 I looks like the angry talking right you 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.120
 crouch, run, run, jump, shoot, mine 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.000
 but that leaves the game very much 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.900
 difficult and you took a shot you far 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.380
 and back there at the beginning of the expensive phase is this 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.380
 there 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.900
 unless you take the check point in 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.360
 half of the sentence you return in the middle of the phase 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.870
 but it still follows the same style as 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.570
 The metal slug you died three months ago 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.600
 back at the beginning of the phase, even understood 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:44.000
 Like you give total game over and bike 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.670
 since the beginning of the game but without that 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.709
 face has phases you have that bonus 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.450
 which also increases from one life or more 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.090
 a chance for you 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.370
 so this is it every game is very difficult and 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.220
 on the normal difficulty setting to tell if 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.239
 I can not go wrong with two power plants and the easy 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.489
 there are five 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.579
 but it's still very difficult for you to 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.239
 there taking life and stuff but 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.700
 Finally compra3 stands out because of it 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.320
 and now every one has finally arrived and 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.480
 current games 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.979
 but let's talk the following today in 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.470
 day there is no difficult game me or another 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.110
 which is difficult because the rest is super 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.880
 easy has that huge tutorial there 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.940
 before the game starts for you 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.840
 dies it 's like it hits like it jumps like it goes 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.120
 phase 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.700
 so today it 's complicated a 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.590
 I spit indy in quotation marks because I was going 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:42.650
 hacked me 'supermando' from hell clothes 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.490
 Just here in beautiful now so I have to 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.380
 give a peck to fall up there 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.360
 Wow, these lady 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.830
 both in the normal game they leave me 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.419
 very pissed because they have a team 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.810
 disgusting 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:59.800
 some want to go bullet goes 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.020
 paving sp on hand game screen 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.289
 It is that I'm already taking a beating from 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.990
 business right here bitch 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.389

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.300
 there 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.509
 the other game that is impossible to play 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.330
 It's practically very difficult even if it is 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:27.639

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.880

 Calm down, calm down, what I'm going to explain is 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:18.039
 The next I'm thinking of doing is 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.719
 let's say that this video will come 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.409
 various parts 

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:26.620
 this first was, say, what games is 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:29.710
 compound say old games that the super 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.720
 nintendo games indies a little bit of 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.060
 indian games 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.780

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.270
 April to evolve a bit until you reach the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.570
 generations and the like. 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:50.070
 bringing you content hacking 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:53.310

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:55.260
 proof of you is in your evaluations if 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.410
 the video was good then that lag 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.290
 Marauder is not to continue the unmik and 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.930
 if you liked it more commonly there I will not 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.900
 continue because it will not be legal 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:10.350
 except everything depends on you and if 

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.950
 you get here face comment cats 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:17.190
 If it is now official, my previous video 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.160
 I had left him in the state then only 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.560

 He even comments and cats and got here. 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:29.040
 But anyway, people are as follows. 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:32.490
