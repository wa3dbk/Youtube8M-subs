00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.650
 how about everyone in this video I'm going to do 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.020
 a tutorial on how to solve the cube 2 x 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.320
 two 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.570
 they are going to be practically two parts but 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 I'm going to make this be the most summary 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.250
 possible this cone is brand 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.850
 clarifying once and first we're going 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.850
 in that center 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:33.530
 perfect the first thing we should do is 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.960
 solve a face because it is that that is 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.840
 basic in all the cubes for example in 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.480
 the classic cube three times the first 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.670
 face is resolved in the white but that 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.379
 is in the majority because I also go to 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.879
 solve by ado by the white 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.079
 here it has no orientation of centers 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.739
 because it is a cube two by two 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:55.100
 then it is not any kind of problem 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:58.719
 here I have the white green and red 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.190
 so I'm going to look for the red one 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.530
 white or yellow green 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.399
 so I look for it in the cube for example 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.649
 here is the green the white green and 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.410
 white green then it's just how 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.080
 guide the way so and this is already what 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.110
 they leave it quiet because they would break it and 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.159
 Well, they would not be doing anything 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.360
 here we can present a 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:26.040
 situation that may be this orange 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.260
 accompanied with this other orange and here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.080
 can see the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.660
 I can do this and I already 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.640
 would have but this is the most 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.100
 simple 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 then they see it like that and without good here 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.980
 could go then take the cube like that and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 they do this this and this 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.870
 and we would already have three must have in 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.810
 mind that it is very important that 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.460
 must undo the cube so if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.980
 you are going to exemplify some movement 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.409
 they have to leave it in its form 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.429
 natural 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.189
 then here you see blue blue white 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.799
 how to know if you are going to see if it will be 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.330
 Well, they place it like this and it's already 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:14.750
 then or you can also do this 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:19.280
 this this and this or they can also do 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.700
 this this this this and this though it would be 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:25.610
 a little more extensive then here I'm going 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.970
 to explain well they are going to explain the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.430
 another situation d 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.430
 how to solve the last layer 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.540
 as it is already as good as golden years 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.830
 I explain I will finish they will finish 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.980
 to explain how to do it without including 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.160
 for two that we 're going to do let's leave 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.930
 the entire face of a single color as if 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
 you remember in three by three 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.240
 to finish the whole cube well we go the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.370
 next movement low left goes up 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.740
 right low left or right 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.750
 low left rises right down 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.340
 left rises right 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.910
 remember that this movement imagines them 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.140
 to accommodate the corners to finish 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.940
 all the cube so here we are going to do what 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.390
 same we have these two well true 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:15.430
 then we are going to orient this by the 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.540
 movement then lower left goes up 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.019
 right 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.689
 again low left rises right 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.680
 we put the other corner and do the 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:33.349
 low left rises right low 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.569
 left sweat right low left it 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.870
 v right and the last left down 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.489
 on right ready after that 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.239
 we have the whole street a single color 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:48.260
 we're going to have to learn a single 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.849
 movement is a very easy movement of 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.579
 soon the people who know how to solve 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.840
 the body and by another method as method 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.879
 more advanced may this movement 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.730
 I want the movement to be simple in itself 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.129
 does not require more than two layers 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.500
 and come on then we need to first 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.769
 by executing this mind we have a 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 corner well which temple is that 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.170
 is the blue yellow red and that in the 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.170
 right part we have a block like 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.870
 this with two equal 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.910
 what do we do we take the cube like this and 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.220
 we make the next move 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:29.130
 12 12 upload 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:33.090
 flipped under 82 times subo raffle and 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:35.490
 I arrange colors and it automatically 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.010
 it solves better but well there is another 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.650
 situation that presents itself to us that is a 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.650
 the other situation in the next 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.780
 is in previous situation we had a 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.630
 Parejita very true in this situation 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.780
 that we have two corners, it's fine and 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.540
 it is or 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.400
 this and this is that we make a 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.380
 week we do again in a movement 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.889
 by any of the corners then 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:17.340
 the movement is twice 1 2 ups 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:18.670
 flips twice ups to like colors and 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.890
 bring back 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.660
 and ready as you will see that we have done 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.680
 turned that situation into this 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.990
 situation we have the couple well and a 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.190
 corner well conscience and I put is 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.080
 the moment I do it again 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:38.040
 third is to make it clear two 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.460
 twice twice his count went down twice 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.230
 subo I turn and arrange colors ready 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.450
 so I had solved the co2 because they are 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.110
 as very simple you do not need many 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:51.800
 movements only that is very basic already 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.770
 That would be all 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.659
 Well I hope you liked it and we 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.659
 we see next time thanks
