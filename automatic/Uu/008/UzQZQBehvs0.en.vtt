with a really interesting effect so I've

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.390 
with a really interesting effect so I've

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
show you how they look as I turn each

add<00:02:53.989> a<00:02:54.230> slight<00:02:54.590> texture<00:02:55.100> to<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.400> model<00:02:55.700> and<00:02:55.820> I

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
add a slight texture to the model and I

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.870 
add a slight texture to the model and I

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
see how blur would look you can see I

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.330 
see how blur would look you can see I

model<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.719> little<00:03:25.109> bit<00:03:25.200> more<00:03:25.319> blended<00:03:25.739> with<00:03:25.890> a

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
model a little bit more blended with a

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.569 
model a little bit more blended with a
grey<00:03:26.189> gradient<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.540> then<00:03:28.379> for<00:03:28.620> f5<00:03:29.069> I've<00:03:29.370> added

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
grey gradient and then for f5 I've added

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.300 
grey gradient and then for f5 I've added
just<00:03:29.819> a<00:03:30.000> slight<00:03:30.269> green<00:03:30.599> tint<00:03:31.140> and<00:03:31.439> I'm<00:03:32.010> putting

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
just a slight green tint and I'm putting

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.770 
just a slight green tint and I'm putting
this<00:03:32.430> in<00:03:32.609> the<00:03:32.670> am<00:03:32.700> buick<00:03:33.180> lucerne<00:03:33.390> of<00:03:33.689> the

this in the am buick lucerne of the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
model so sort of a compliment to the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.940 
model so sort of a compliment to the
warm<00:03:36.299> colors<00:03:36.569> then<00:03:37.109> it's<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.409> found<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.859> the

end and the crevices of the month in the
f6<00:03:41.459> lot<00:03:41.930> I've<00:03:42.930> turned<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.379> intensity<00:03:44.129> just<00:03:44.879> to

f6 lot I've turned on intensity just to

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.580 
f6 lot I've turned on intensity just to
sort<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.299> pump<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:45.659> up<00:03:45.719> a<00:03:45.870> little<00:03:46.079> bit<00:03:46.319> i'm

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
sort of pump it up a little bit i'm

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.860 
sort of pump it up a little bit i'm
using<00:03:46.889> the<00:03:46.980> furnell<00:03:47.340> slider<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:48.329> push<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.659> to

using the furnell slider to push that to
the<00:03:48.959> edges<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.530> lowering<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.920> strength<00:03:50.220> a

the edges and lowering the strength a
little<00:03:50.579> bit<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.299> as<00:03:51.359> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.540> see<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.049> as<00:03:52.439> I

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
little bit so as you can see that as I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.649 
little bit so as you can see that as I
accumulate<00:03:53.040> more<00:03:53.459> filters<00:03:54.000> each<00:03:54.239> one<00:03:54.450> has<00:03:54.629> a

accumulate more filters each one has a

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.869 
accumulate more filters each one has a
subtle<00:03:54.930> effect<00:03:55.379> but<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.040> end<00:03:56.189> result<00:03:56.639> has<00:03:56.849> a

subtle effect but the end result has a

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.879 
subtle effect but the end result has a

very nice quality to the rendered image

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.039 
very nice quality to the rendered image
then<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.639> control<00:03:59.970> after<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.780> render

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049

integrated<00:04:17.430> into<00:04:17.759> the<00:04:17.849> background<00:04:18.359> but<00:04:19.019> I've

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
integrated into the background but I've

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.960 
integrated into the background but I've
loaded<00:04:19.259> a<00:04:19.500> panorama<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.250> used<00:04:20.639> it<00:04:20.789> as<00:04:20.940> the

loaded a panorama and used it as the
background<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:21.750> have<00:04:21.930> also<00:04:22.199> created<00:04:22.349> the

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
background and have also created the

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.620 
background and have also created the
Lightcap<00:04:23.039> from<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.669> image<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.389> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
Lightcap from this image so that the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.939 
Lightcap from this image so that the
lighting<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.110> model<00:04:25.409> match<00:04:25.620> at<00:04:25.830> the

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
lighting and the model match at the

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.610 
lighting and the model match at the
background<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.400> little<00:04:26.430> bit<00:04:26.729> better<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.990> now

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
background a little bit better and now

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.340 
background a little bit better and now
I'll<00:04:29.099> do<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.310> bpr<00:04:29.849> render

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.530 

when<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.220> render<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.640> done<00:04:34.670> you<00:04:35.030> can<00:04:35.060> see<00:04:35.360> that

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
when the render is done you can see that

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.060 
when the render is done you can see that
the<00:04:35.630> lighting<00:04:35.960> has<00:04:36.110> helped<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.530> integrate<00:04:36.980> it

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
the lighting has helped to integrate it

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.950 
the lighting has helped to integrate it
somewhat<00:04:37.430> in<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.640> background<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.780> needs

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
somewhat in the background but it needs

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.900 
somewhat in the background but it needs
a<00:04:39.080> little<00:04:39.230> bit<00:04:39.380> of<00:04:39.470> extra<00:04:39.680> help<00:04:40.100> from<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.460> bpr

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
a little bit of extra help from the bpr

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.420 
a little bit of extra help from the bpr
filters<00:04:41.390> so<00:04:42.230> I'm<00:04:42.380> going<00:04:42.410> to<00:04:42.530> turn<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.860> the<00:04:42.980> f7

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
filters so I'm going to turn on the f7

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.570 
filters so I'm going to turn on the f7
slot<00:04:43.880> and<00:04:44.210> a<00:04:44.480> turn<00:04:44.750> on<00:04:44.870> the<00:04:45.080> fade<00:04:45.410> filter<00:04:46.010> the

slot and a turn on the fade filter the
fade<00:04:46.850> filter<00:04:47.330> fades<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:48.020> model<00:04:48.380> into<00:04:48.770> the

fade filter fades the model into the

fade filter fades the model into the
background<00:04:49.370> image<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.880> you<00:04:49.940> can<00:04:50.090> see<00:04:50.240> that<00:04:50.270> it

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
background image so you can see that it

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.150

all the way up the model is literally

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.040 
all the way up the model is literally
invisible<00:04:55.370> so<00:04:56.270> I'm<00:04:56.360> going<00:04:56.540> to<00:04:56.600> accept<00:04:56.870> the

blending<00:04:57.440> mode<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.680> screen<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:59.290> turn<00:05:00.290> up<00:05:00.410> the

blending mode to screen and turn up the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.350 
blending mode to screen and turn up the
masking<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.100> little<00:05:01.340> bit<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.700> then<00:05:02.060> we<00:05:02.180> use<00:05:02.300> the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
masking a little bit and then we use the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.290 
masking a little bit and then we use the
fernell<00:05:02.870> slaughter<00:05:03.290> to<00:05:03.890> push<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.430> fade<00:05:04.850> to

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
fernell slaughter to push that fade to

fernell slaughter to push that fade to
the<00:05:05.450> edges<00:05:05.840> of<00:05:05.870> the<00:05:06.080> model<00:05:06.500> and<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.740> can<00:05:06.890> see

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
the edges of the model and you can see

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.550 
the edges of the model and you can see
as<00:05:07.160> I<00:05:07.280> do<00:05:07.340> this<00:05:07.670> the<00:05:08.240> transparent<00:05:08.990> aspect<00:05:09.440> of

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
as I do this the transparent aspect of

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.230 
as I do this the transparent aspect of
the<00:05:09.620> model<00:05:09.920> starts<00:05:10.190> to<00:05:10.310> look<00:05:10.460> a<00:05:10.550> bit<00:05:10.730> more<00:05:10.760> like

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
the model starts to look a bit more like

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.380 
the model starts to look a bit more like
a<00:05:11.270> reflection<00:05:11.960> more<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:12.890> the<00:05:13.190> colors<00:05:14.060> in<00:05:14.300> the

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
a reflection more of the colors in the

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.120 
a reflection more of the colors in the
background<00:05:14.840> are<00:05:14.960> now<00:05:15.080> bleeding<00:05:15.440> onto<00:05:15.860> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
background are now bleeding onto the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.100 
background are now bleeding onto the
model<00:05:16.430> itself<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.390> helps<00:05:17.690> it<00:05:17.810> to<00:05:17.960> make

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
model itself and this helps it to make

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.110 
model itself and this helps it to make
it<00:05:18.140> look<00:05:18.290> a<00:05:18.740> lot<00:05:18.920> more<00:05:18.980> integrated<00:05:19.730> into<00:05:20.030> the

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
it look a lot more integrated into the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.210 
it look a lot more integrated into the
background<00:05:20.630> as<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.140> turn<00:05:21.320> the<00:05:21.440> filter<00:05:21.680> on<00:05:21.980> and

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
background as I turn the filter on and

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.830 
background as I turn the filter on and
off<00:05:22.370> you<00:05:22.580> can<00:05:22.640> see<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.030> difference<00:05:23.480> and<00:05:23.660> how

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
off you can see the difference and how

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.630 
off you can see the difference and how
that<00:05:23.900> adds<00:05:24.290> just<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:24.890> little<00:05:25.070> bit<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.370> a

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
that adds just that little bit of a

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.940 
that adds just that little bit of a
extra<00:05:26.450> lighting<00:05:26.660> and<00:05:26.990> color<00:05:27.200> that<00:05:27.590> helps<00:05:27.830> to

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:27.950 
extra lighting and color that helps to

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:29.710 
extra lighting and color that helps to
integrate<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.550> model<00:05:28.850> into<00:05:29.150> the<00:05:29.240> background

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
integrate the model into the background

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.450 
integrate the model into the background
another<00:05:30.380> thing<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:30.710> can<00:05:30.830> do<00:05:30.950> with<00:05:31.010> vpr

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
another thing you can do with vpr

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.550 
another thing you can do with vpr
filters<00:05:31.850> is<00:05:32.000> add<00:05:32.270> an<00:05:32.480> overall<00:05:32.900> tint<00:05:33.200> to<00:05:33.470> the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
filters is add an overall tint to the

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.880 
filters is add an overall tint to the
entire<00:05:33.890> image<00:05:34.190> so<00:05:34.700> in<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:34.880> f8<00:05:35.270> slot<00:05:35.770> turn<00:05:36.770> this

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
entire image so in the f8 slot turn this

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.820 
entire image so in the f8 slot turn this
on<00:05:37.100> and<00:05:37.310> I'm<00:05:37.490> going<00:05:37.640> to<00:05:37.700> set<00:05:37.910> this<00:05:38.120> to<00:05:38.390> the<00:05:38.830> blue

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
on and I'm going to set this to the blue

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.400 
on and I'm going to set this to the blue
color<00:05:40.190> tint<00:05:40.610> and<00:05:40.790> lower<00:05:41.480> the<00:05:41.720> strength<00:05:42.110> and

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
color tint and lower the strength and

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.440 
color tint and lower the strength and
you<00:05:42.890> can<00:05:43.010> see<00:05:43.160> the<00:05:43.280> tint<00:05:43.520> is<00:05:43.670> applied<00:05:44.030> to<00:05:44.270> both

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
you can see the tint is applied to both

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.180 
you can see the tint is applied to both
the<00:05:44.660> model<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.230> background<00:05:45.770> at<00:05:45.890> the<00:05:45.980> same

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
the model and the background at the same

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.010 
the model and the background at the same
time<00:05:46.400> because<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.880> mask<00:05:47.120> is<00:05:47.360> still<00:05:47.600> at<00:05:47.750> zero

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
time because the mask is still at zero

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.320 
time because the mask is still at zero
and<00:05:48.320> this<00:05:48.950> just<00:05:49.250> creates<00:05:49.370> an<00:05:49.610> overall<00:05:50.030> blue

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
and this just creates an overall blue

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.050 
and this just creates an overall blue
tinting<00:05:51.110> which<00:05:51.650> can<00:05:51.830> also<00:05:52.010> help<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:52.520> integrate

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
tinting which can also help to integrate

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.120 
tinting which can also help to integrate
the<00:05:53.210> model<00:05:53.540> into<00:05:53.870> the<00:05:53.990> background<00:05:54.470> image<00:05:54.710> and

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
the model into the background image and

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.190 
the model into the background image and
then<00:05:55.580> in<00:05:55.760> the<00:05:55.850> f6<00:05:56.360> slot<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.840> turn<00:05:57.050> on<00:05:57.080> the

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
then in the f6 slot I turn on the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.080 
then in the f6 slot I turn on the
intensity<00:05:57.800> filter<00:05:58.280> to<00:05:58.370> help<00:05:58.550> deal<00:05:58.730> with<00:05:58.790> some

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
intensity filter to help deal with some

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.640 
intensity filter to help deal with some
of<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.470> darkness<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.920> shadows<00:06:01.370> and

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
of the darkness and the shadows and

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.830 
of the darkness and the shadows and
finally<00:06:03.650> in<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:03.860> f5<00:06:04.430> slot<00:06:04.820> I've<00:06:05.090> added<00:06:05.570> a

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
finally in the f5 slot I've added a

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.340 
finally in the f5 slot I've added a
little<00:06:06.050> bit<00:06:06.140> of<00:06:06.260> noise<00:06:06.530> to<00:06:07.280> the<00:06:07.430> overall<00:06:07.700> image

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
little bit of noise to the overall image

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.440 
little bit of noise to the overall image
so<00:06:09.350> i<00:06:09.380> can<00:06:09.620> continue<00:06:09.890> to<00:06:10.220> add<00:06:10.400> filters<00:06:10.940> adjust

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
so i can continue to add filters adjust

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.300 
so i can continue to add filters adjust
the<00:06:11.600> settings<00:06:12.020> and<00:06:12.320> tweak<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.680> overall<00:06:13.040> look

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
the settings and tweak the overall look

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.550 
the settings and tweak the overall look
and<00:06:13.550> i'll<00:06:14.090> have<00:06:14.270> it<00:06:14.450> exactly<00:06:14.780> the<00:06:14.990> way<00:06:15.110> I<00:06:15.260> want

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
and i'll have it exactly the way I want

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.920 
and i'll have it exactly the way I want
and<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.190> great<00:06:16.370> thing<00:06:16.400> about<00:06:16.640> bpr<00:06:17.270> filters<00:06:17.690> it

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
and the great thing about bpr filters it

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.050 
and the great thing about bpr filters it
allows<00:06:18.140> me<00:06:18.380> to<00:06:18.500> do<00:06:18.710> this<00:06:18.980> without<00:06:19.490> having<00:06:19.940> to

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
allows me to do this without having to

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.120 
allows me to do this without having to
leave<00:06:20.300> ZBrush<00:06:20.810> I<00:06:21.050> can<00:06:21.230> do<00:06:21.320> all<00:06:21.530> this<00:06:21.800> image

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
leave ZBrush I can do all this image
