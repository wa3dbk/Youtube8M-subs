00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
you have to do is you have to actually

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
you have to do is you have to actually
depressurize<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.960> like<00:00:58.469> door<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.370> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
depressurize that that like door and it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.150 
depressurize that that like door and it
takes<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.690> very<00:01:00.960> long<00:01:01.109> time<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.739> probably<00:01:01.829> takes

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
takes a very long time it probably takes

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.600 
takes a very long time it probably takes
about<00:01:02.309> 45<00:01:02.940> seconds<00:01:03.390> total<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
about 45 seconds total of you

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.859 
about 45 seconds total of you
depressurizing<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:05.850> what<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> had<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
depressurizing it so what I had to do a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
depressurizing it so what I had to do a
couple<00:01:07.290> times<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:08.010> would<00:01:08.189> leave<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> crawler

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
couple times is I would leave a crawler

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.660 
couple times is I would leave a crawler
and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.140> far<00:01:11.070> away<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.400> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and then I would go far away from the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.429 
and then I would go far away from the
map<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> crawler<00:01:12.659> got<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
map and when the crawler got there I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.260 
map and when the crawler got there I
would<00:01:13.830> sprint<00:01:14.189> over<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> tried

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
would sprint over and tried

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.330 
would sprint over and tried
depressurizing<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.560> usually<00:01:16.950> ended<00:01:17.189> up

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
depressurizing it and I usually ended up

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.700 
depressurizing it and I usually ended up
working<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.790> me<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> long<00:01:19.409> process

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
working for me so it is a long process
