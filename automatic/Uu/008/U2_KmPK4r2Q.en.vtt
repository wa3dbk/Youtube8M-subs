00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.290
 we want the camera of the htc here 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.549
 we will take a closer look at desire 816 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.980
 are here already in the interface 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.180
 interface is relatively simple 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.970
 you can still use it here 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.410
 some functions and settings 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.420
 make 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.300
 Generally, first I come here with the 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.440
 Finger first a bit more often 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.840
 the lens we can see then must 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.750
 of course, keep the device that way 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.119
 keep that you are not hiding anything inside 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 we have a 3 10 megapixel camera like 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.930
 in a maximum resolution of 2592 x 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.610
 1944 pixel dissolves which could also 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 videos in full HD with 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.140
 demanded a front camera 5 megapixel 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.629
 So pretty good too 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.239
 well suited for self-portraits 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.470
 of course, when boys are on the go and 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.629
 was going to make of you 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.369
 or somebody whatsapp 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.839
 also wanted to send one here 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:03.790
 resolution of 2592 x 1944 pixels and also 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.590
 here you can record in full hd 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.030
 here changed the front camera by 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.789
 you just once from top to bottom 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.130
 not here above right, we have velvet 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:13.930
 Nail for the to switch to the gallery 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
 here on the top left you can open the flash 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.079
 on automatically or off 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.759
 continued taking me down here right 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:25.409
 the possibility to change the mode 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:28.329
 So camera or video camera 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.920
 self-portrait here have more 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:32.409
 attitudes and we see that yourself 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.079
 here always have a touch focus 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:37.990
 very well on the nerves goes with the 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.820
 trigger noise once to zoom here 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.740
 you can pinch to zoom here with 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.210
 Two fingers once ran or rausgesucht 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.219
 told her you can be some 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.960
 make settings automatically 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.329
 we have the mode here then we have 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.920
 here continue night mode 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.289
 we can do a hdr photos here 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.060
 so that hdr panorama scanndy do there 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.380
 you get such a horizontal one here 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:02.409
 line and then makes virtually photos goes 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.569
 then this line and then he creates 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.380
 from that a panorama that does not have now 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.349
 folded 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.080
 because of course I get that down 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:15.220
 keep anti-blurring, we have here 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.920
 portrait landscape backlit photos text 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.660
 shots or macro shots marco 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.730
 I would make sense here, for example 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.739
 we can provide more settings 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 make if we still here automatically 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.050
 Go for example so you can 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.459
 We have adjustment here 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.550
 more filters over here 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.599
 can distortion and so on the whole 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.590
 of course, it works live there 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.910
 can you ever so still 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.760
 change settings 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.220
 For example, move the blur 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.349
 yes and there are a number of filters 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.849
 which you can easily use 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.069
 So it can be used on everyone 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.720
 cool your attitudes come her 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.940
 then to the other settings 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.799
 namely can cut image to fit 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.079
 the whole you can do the resolution 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.709
 From this select the maximum america 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:07.840
 selected and so on raster photos 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:11.470
 geotec camera option there actually solved 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.220
 relatively fast, we can see 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.500
 can also have several photos 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.750
 make one after another 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.049
 the store then not all because you 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.329
 can here almost the best shots 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.100
 select and so click on the and 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.650
 rest will be deleted 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.930
 Here are a few sample photos 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.940
 that we did with the camera from 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.940
 htc desire 816 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.599
 in video mode you can as mentioned in 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.109
 hd here take immerdrauf 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.620
 then pressed ten animals and we see 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:55.019
 can you synonymous with the film here per 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.030
 pinch zoom on or zoom out 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.189
 here too you can get some attitude 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.049
 from take like iso and also filter 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.969
 could also lay over it, of course 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.349
 not quite as many more 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:09.989
 Settings are video quality here 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:13.739
 I have also unscrewed full hd from 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:17.190
 htc desire 816 movies in full hd 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:30.440
 he swings me the internal microphone 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:33.919
 and we also have the possibility here 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.419
 to use a touch focus 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.120
 they know you are focusing with the 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:43.800
 background and once again one 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.449
 play figure here because the front of course 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.830
 especially with recordings 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:51.180
 that is a very difficult thing 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.590
 right it is okay here 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.610
 better 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.440
 you see, but here are the ones 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.699
 darkened foreground could be too 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.860
 take pictures while you're filming 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.470
 front camera knows the movies in full hd 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.300
 this is just here in the nose 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.940
 It would look similar in space 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.199
 if your video telephony operates if 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.880
 you give me a light source from further 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.740
 the back is then good is always so 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.620
 of course, the face becomes something 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.169
 darker but should be pictured 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.090
 First of all in the room that's fine 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.419
 if now on albums presses then have 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:31.219
 As I said here first thanks and 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.599
 the possibility also photos of our art 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.940
 show a section 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.130
 you can select individual pictures 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.880
 you can of course show this 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:44.250
 or continue to send 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.680
 or we'll work on it below 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.300
 bottom right we can see that could do that 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.789
 whole too 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:54.949
 cut rotate so for example so 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:56.810
 actually have quite interesting there 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:59.139
 her the one other function he was 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.639
 can select the whole mirror 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:05.060
 turn now and mirror that 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:08.259
 whole picture ails you about it again 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.770
 So you can put some 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:14.000
 There are options here 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:16.759
 frame so that makes fun effects if 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.500
 Now you have face cards you can 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.840
 The red eyes distort eyes 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.669
 optimize and so on 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.699
 from the camera function you get 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:27.349
 In any case, which is very good 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.590
 a good performance a high resolution 

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:33.080
 Camera 3 10 megapixel in a good 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.690
 resolution photos and videos also does 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.669
 this is the middle class user tell me 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:39.650
 so do not be disappointed we have here 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.310
 Of course not as with the 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.719
 high-end devices different lightning 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.039
 temperatures as it is now 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:50.960
 needs or the motion function but 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.759
 you will only get good pictures from this camera 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.819
 and videos do now in any case 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:57.409
 Do not be disappointed it is not 

00:06:55.819 --> 00:06:59.300
 do not flex games me 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.130
 selective mode and so on how to 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.469
 as I said so there is also here again 

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:05.389
 in the meantime the better devices 

00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:07.639
 great knickknack those you 

00:07:05.389 --> 00:07:09.949
 that can not be used 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.229
 but at the same time a big plus point 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:15.490
 Here is the sweet for pixel front camera 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:17.920
 you can take good pictures for 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.320
 wozzeck 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.900
 facebook and so on and also for the 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.520
 I could use video calling here with one 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.520
 very good camera work
