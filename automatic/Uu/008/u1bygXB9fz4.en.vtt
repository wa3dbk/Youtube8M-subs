00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 and then people on the games channel are 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.430
 welcome an indication of the week 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.830
 frame of the channel where with games movies and 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 even books for you that indicated 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 This week 's game is ex-half origins 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 wolverine x men origins wolverine is a 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.450
 adaptation of the film of the same name to the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 video games as you know adaptations 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.950
 of movies do not usually give in good games 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 but wolverine is a separate case 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.390
 okay, the story is kind of weak even though 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.910
 be a recapitulation of the long 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.640
 misinterpretations and no scenes 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.129
 but the game shines in gameplay 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.340
 frenetic doing justice to the genre rheg 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.649
 slash wolverine is angrier than 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.690
 never to the point of starting the game falling 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.390
 from the top of a helicopter on the head of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.609
 an enemy graphic game violence is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.580
 very high with blood gushing 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.900
 time and mutilations with land and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.150
 arms everywhere 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 the anti-hero slice enemies as if 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.420
 logan pieces of cake is capable of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 run jump defend yourself dodge and 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.970
 logically attack can form combos 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 mixing weak attacks with strong 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.150
 including interacting with the scenario or 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.009
 catch an opponent 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.229
 if the stadium is near by 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.659
 example the wolverine takes its enemy and the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.020
 it takes all and more blood flying in 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.020
 screen 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.600
 certainly the most fun movement 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 of all is called away with it 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.800
 wolverine can jump from a long 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.110
 distance to your opponent 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.060
 his claws on the chest of the poor guy 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.760
 then the player decides what to do 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.220
 then even fatigue right there with several 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.509
 to make a finishing jump or 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.970
 play away 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.490
 I repeat the violence of the game is very high 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.560
 It is very exaggerated when you kill the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.690
 last face of a group of enemies 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.619
 the game presents with a death in 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.420
 slow motion 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.340
 showing the fierce havoc wolverine 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.340
 Who do you mess with him? 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 wolverine can also scale some 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.860
 places as well as hanging on ropes 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.020
 and move objects 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.330
 there is a system of upgrades where the player 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.850
 distributes points to improve attributes 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.800
 long and gain new skills 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.350
 the game uses the regeneration system 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.420
 as well as in some games of 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.519
 fps as koff lasts 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.290
 Obviously this fits in very well. 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.549
 because the hero has powers 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.260
 regenerative 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.290
 but the producers gave a touch more 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.209
 in that aspect every shot struck 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.680
 blast that wolverine gets his 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.209
 wounds are opening 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.690
 showing his flesh and bones 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.790
 if after leaving the middle of the action the 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.230
 and observe and wait a little will be 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.600
 see these injuries if 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.880
 closing just like in movies 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.290
 not that this is spectacular but it is a 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.170
 extra care that the producers had 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.600
 to create something more faithful to the character 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.370
 the game beck in simple aspect like the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.950
 graphics and bosses 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.329
 graphics are beautiful but rely on 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.570
 large frame drops per second 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.820
 besides being grotesque affiliates and the 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.010
 heads are practically all the same with 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.989
 little challenge and forcing the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.340
 same thing over and over again 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.260
 defeat 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.670
 the only bosses to be saved are the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.890
 which are the same size as wolverine 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.959
 such as your brother's teeth 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.959
 saber that provides an epic struggle 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.460
 and only a tip if you have a playstation 2 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.380
 does not play the game 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.500
 is such that the difference reaches the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.660
 look like a children's game 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.430
 finally the former half wolverine origins do not 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.470
 is the best superhero game in the world 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.230
 getting well behind batman arkham city 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.140
 for example but it's a great game rec 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.790
 slash if you like violence and 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.310
 get down on everybody who sees 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.660
 ahead try the game and if you 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.400
 for wolverine fan 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.950
 This is undoubtedly the best game of the 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.080
 anti-hero so far and it is for these and 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:13.240
 many other reasons that originate from 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.240
 wolverine is the nominee of the week 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.370
 although of ama and the position
