handles<00:01:55.030> over<00:01:55.119> cement<00:01:55.569> there's<00:01:56.110> a<00:01:56.170> good

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
handles over cement there's a good

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.399 
handles over cement there's a good
chance<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.830> could<00:01:56.950> break<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.250> flow<00:01:57.520> light<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
chance you could break a flow light so

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.080 
chance you could break a flow light so
they<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:00.039> stand<00:02:00.429> up<00:02:00.520> quite<00:02:00.849> a<00:02:00.880> lot<00:02:01.060> of
