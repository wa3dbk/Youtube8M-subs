00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.689
 two 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.830
 ah 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.290
 if we think about the next planting of the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.730
 alfalfa cultivation of pastures 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.710
 alfalfa 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.980
 we can take into account some aspects 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.870
 that will allow us to improve 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.440
 characteristics of this crop if 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.699
 we think about growing alfalfa is a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.070
 key resource in our system of 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.010
 milk production because it gives us 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.620
 high high volume of forage and a 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.809
 high value of a high nutritional value 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.899
 this form combines these characteristics 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.570
 positive but if from the planting 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.200
 we can think about carrying out 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.060
 a management that optimizes and that allows 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.789
 achieve this potential that the 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.640
 growing in our region in this way 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:16.100
 in the inta inta here in Rafaela 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.450
 they work in various trials with the idea 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.690
 to generate information that allows us 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.670
 better adjust crop management a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.140
 little comment on some 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.620
 results of experiments that have 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.620
 made recently 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:33.280
 in the first instance they have been evaluated 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 for two years two plantings decision 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.230
 in autumn for two consecutive years 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.360
 different types of tillage in the 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.550
 sowing of alfalfa and also the 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.800
 they try combined with different 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.660
 treatments of the seed and what 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.940
 we found was that planting 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.160
 both conventional sowing and sowing 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.470
 direct in a year were very similar 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.660
 while in another year the planting 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.120
 conventionally stood out above the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.430
 direct sowing achieving greater 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.560
 density of plants and a greater and a 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.030
 increased forage production this 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.649
 difference between direct sowing and 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.680
 conventional planting in the second year 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.690
 which was evaluated that was evaluated was found 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.390
 mostly when direct seeding 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.100
 had a lot of surface coverage what 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.750
 that hindered the implementation of 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.610
 alfalfa seedlings decreasing the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.530
 density of this probably associated 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.810
 the presence of diseases 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.220
 develop in the crop stubble 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.200
 predecessor 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.970
 in this case these trials were 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.390
 about a soybean predecessor crop 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.270
 on the other hand 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.580
 he mentioned that the 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.340
 seed treatment in this case 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.100
 if we find positive differences to 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.200
 please that the seed be treated in 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.350
 What will be the good treatment? 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.150
 inclusion of a pellet with fungicide and 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.209
 the inoculant of the seed and the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.850
 differences were greater even when 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.569
 we were under direct seeding then 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.730
 so we have we can see that you can 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.770
 think about making direct seeding taking 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.620
 greater precautions as soon as it is 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.870
 seed treatment and trying to that 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.390
 there are not many coverages in the lot 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.390
 where we are going to plant the crop another 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.760
 experience that came about in the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.980
 last time and also related to 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.870
 the implementation of the crop is what 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.600
 refers to the distance between the rows 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.420
 of planting 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.690
 we have tested different distances between 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.300
 rows going from 20 centimeters 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.970
 bringing the rows closer to 17 5 and 15 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:42.270
 centimeters and what we find is that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.670
 the same planting density when 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.460
 we bring the rows closer, the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.560
 forage production between variation 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.360
 of the improvement that we found was between 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.970
 the 5 and the 20 percent increase of the 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:56.640
 production which is interesting and 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.410
 It has to do with the plants 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.090
 approach the rows and have the same 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.520
 density are better 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.320
 distributed in space in this way 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.150
 make it possible to better capture the resources of the 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.360
 environment and compete less among 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.400
 between the plants of the same crop 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.200
 then it is a practice that also 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.030
 we can keep in mind when we think 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.730
 in achieving highly productive pastures 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.190
 finally we should not stop having in 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.410
 account another aspect that is very 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.570
 important that is the choice of the 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.090
 variety that we are going to plant in this 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.800
 sense in rafaela are being made 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.480
 many years ago the evaluation of 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.790
 cultivars of the network 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.800
 in 2010, 30 were planted 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.200
 cultivars without winter rest and 10 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.090
 as opposed to intermediate in general 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.820
 the ones that stand out the most are the 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.590
 winter rest reaching production in 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.230
 the first year of those of better 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.390
 behavior up to 18,000 kilos of 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.840
 dry matter of forage per year 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.460
 distributed in 910 cuts so good 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.620
 this information is available and it is 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.330
 good that the producers know that this 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.800
 you can access you can approach 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.800
 sale and is also available online 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.420
