00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:10.360
 I 'm trying to attach this Baume tire to this wheel of the band saw 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:15.670
 a thus clamping the side 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.670
 I'm trying to fit, but I'm hard and that 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.750
 I can not fit 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:27.070
 That the rubber tires in Esoko 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.440
 I would like to eat in hot water again so that it is easy to grow 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:37.650
 Thank you like this 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:37.650
 Put the rubber in a slightly hot hot votive hot water of about 50 degrees and leave it for about 5 minutes 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.380
 I put it in hot water for about 5 minutes 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.550
 Heavy rain belt 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 I accept this 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.940
 I would like to exchange 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.780
 While not fall temperature of the belt 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.780
 I want to work 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.359
 Ha 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 That the temperature was raised 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.710
 It is not easy to stretch a little 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 I entered sweetly 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:39.150
 Because this belt is different from the other, there is a groove in the wheel 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:42.110
 For example in Gon in the groove a large amount now finger 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.110
 I am preparing 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:51.770
 Well this is that genuine 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.770
 It is perfect because it is rubber 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.230
 For example it entered without this problem 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.230
 Something like this 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.740
 Well then the other two 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.500
 I will do the same 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.500
 Well here is the second wheel 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:30.950
 The exchange is over and it is the third one 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:35.060
 The exchange is over, I just couldn't clamp it here 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:40.880
 That 9 that this 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.010
 I unexpected of time being in the place where consuming belts be installed in Tamagokai to a cell of the above from it 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.910
 It was possible 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.980
 Anou without this clamp 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.350
 As it was said that there was warmth with hot water of maa , and it turned red 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.900
 9 I can take it to this point 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.940
 Well then we shifted to the side 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:05.380
 Well here too 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:05.380
 Installation is complete Now all three tires are 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.560
 I was able to replace Gon rubber which was able to be renewed 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.520
 Hey Well Anou 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:22.000
 In the temperature maximum of 60 degrees of the water heater Atsushi HiroshiYuAsa 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.730
 Put the handle basin is doing some rubber in this 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.160
 Huh 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.860
 Install the blade 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.090
 Attach that table too 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.380
 Excuse me 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:38.360
 Also check if vertical 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.200
 Table for this blade is that even vertical activists 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.530
 this 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.360
 We confirmed using Kenya 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.960
 Eh hey this problem is-this is confusing 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960
 in this way 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:04:00.470
 So that 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:03.440
 Fixing this table for a while, as it may not be possible to maintain it even if it is vertical 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.880
 It is useless if you don't think about the method separately 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.880
 Let's cut it a little 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.790
 Nee yeah 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.790
 I can not cut the saw blade at all 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.330
 Can not use a little and this is not to buy a little new that blade 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:49.330
 now I can not go backboard 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.330
 It will not be all close to the radar
