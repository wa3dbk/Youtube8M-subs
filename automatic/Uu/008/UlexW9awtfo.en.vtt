because the last video I posted where I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.029 
because the last video I posted where I
showed<00:00:13.969> you<00:00:14.120> how<00:00:14.330> I<00:00:14.360> make

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
showed you how I make

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.099 
showed you how I make
Tector<00:00:16.309> for<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:16.660> circularly<00:00:17.660> polarized

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:18.109 
Tector for the circularly polarized

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:19.749 
Tector for the circularly polarized
antenna<00:00:18.320> a<00:00:18.679> lot<00:00:18.800> of<00:00:18.890> people<00:00:19.130> asked<00:00:19.460> about<00:00:19.489> this

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:19.759 
antenna a lot of people asked about this

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.790 
antenna a lot of people asked about this
coax<00:00:20.239> I'm<00:00:20.419> using<00:00:20.630> this<00:00:20.810> cable<00:00:21.079> because

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
coax I'm using this cable because

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.710 
coax I'm using this cable because
traditionally<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:23.089> know<00:00:23.149> people<00:00:23.480> have<00:00:23.570> used

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
traditionally you know people have used

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.139 
traditionally you know people have used
this<00:00:23.960> cable<00:00:24.410> here<00:00:24.649> for<00:00:24.890> antennas<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:25.969> notice

00:00:26.139 --> 00:00:26.149 
this cable here for antennas you notice

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.720 
this cable here for antennas you notice
it's<00:00:26.269> quite<00:00:26.390> thin<00:00:26.719> and<00:00:26.960> it<00:00:27.529> is<00:00:27.919> springy<00:00:28.369> so<00:00:28.669> you

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's quite thin and it is springy so you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.040 
it's quite thin and it is springy so you
can't<00:00:29.029> really<00:00:29.179> sort<00:00:29.449> of<00:00:29.509> bend<00:00:29.719> it<00:00:29.839> I<00:00:29.929> won't

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
can't really sort of bend it I won't

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.839 
can't really sort of bend it I won't
stay<00:00:30.320> in<00:00:30.349> shape<00:00:30.679> it<00:00:30.890> will<00:00:31.039> straighten<00:00:31.640> itself

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
stay in shape it will straighten itself

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.750 
stay in shape it will straighten itself
out<00:00:32.079> most<00:00:33.079> noticeably<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:33.710> what<00:00:34.399> do<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:34.519> do<00:00:34.610> if

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
out most noticeably so what do you do if

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.160 
out most noticeably so what do you do if
you<00:00:34.820> want<00:00:35.000> one<00:00:35.120> of<00:00:35.180> those<00:00:35.329> cool<00:00:35.570> antennas<00:00:36.019> that

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
you want one of those cool antennas that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.290 
you want one of those cool antennas that
just<00:00:36.379> stays<00:00:36.979> bent<00:00:37.460> when<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:37.879> bend<00:00:38.059> it<00:00:38.180> well

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
just stays bent when you bend it well

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700 
just stays bent when you bend it well
obviously<00:00:38.960> you've<00:00:39.079> got<00:00:39.229> to<00:00:39.320> use<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.470> different

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
obviously you've got to use a different

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.920 
obviously you've got to use a different
sort<00:00:40.100> of<00:00:40.159> coaxial<00:00:40.550> cable<00:00:40.909> and<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:41.420> cable<00:00:41.449> I'm

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
sort of coaxial cable and the cable I'm

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.630 
sort of coaxial cable and the cable I'm
using<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.350> this<00:00:42.530> one<00:00:42.739> and<00:00:43.100> as<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:43.339> can<00:00:43.399> see<00:00:43.460> it

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
using is this one and as you can see it

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.490 
using is this one and as you can see it
comes<00:00:43.820> in<00:00:43.879> a<00:00:43.970> little<00:00:44.089> Hank<00:00:44.540> of<00:00:44.690> cable<00:00:45.379> you<00:00:45.469> can

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
comes in a little Hank of cable you can

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.560 
comes in a little Hank of cable you can
buy<00:00:45.680> this<00:00:45.739> on<00:00:45.949> ebay<00:00:46.280> it's<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:47.180> cheap<00:00:47.449> I

making fpv antennas circular polarized
fpv<00:00:57.019> antennas<00:00:57.379> because<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.489> when<00:00:59.150> you<00:00:59.239> bend<00:00:59.479> it

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
fpv antennas because it when you bend it

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.359 
fpv antennas because it when you bend it
it<00:00:59.780> stays<00:01:00.080> bent<00:01:00.350> look<00:01:00.619> here<00:01:00.949> we<00:01:01.009> go<00:01:01.159> you<00:01:01.220> can

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
it stays bent look here we go you can

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.310 
it stays bent look here we go you can
straightened<00:01:01.850> out<00:01:01.939> you<00:01:02.449> can<00:01:02.629> bend<00:01:02.869> it<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.140> it

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
straightened out you can bend it and it

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.439 
straightened out you can bend it and it
stays<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.589> way<00:01:03.799> that's<00:01:04.070> just<00:01:04.250> brilliant<00:01:04.820> so

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
stays that way that's just brilliant so

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.020 
stays that way that's just brilliant so
four<00:01:06.200> antennas<00:01:06.560> it's<00:01:06.979> ideal<00:01:07.520> whether<00:01:07.880> it's

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
four antennas it's ideal whether it's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.880 
four antennas it's ideal whether it's
for<00:01:08.119> your<00:01:08.240> goggles<00:01:08.630> or<00:01:08.840> for<00:01:09.020> your<00:01:09.140> model<00:01:09.439> this

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.200 
is cheapest beans on eBay no problems at
all<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.010> can<00:02:01.250> save<00:02:01.430> yourself<00:02:01.729> a<00:02:01.820> fistful

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
all so you can save yourself a fistful

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.090 
all so you can save yourself a fistful
of<00:02:02.270> money<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.720> get<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.260> really<00:02:03.530> good<00:02:03.740> result

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
of money and get a really good result

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.620 
of money and get a really good result
because<00:02:04.610> sometimes<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.030> only<00:02:05.090> want<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.390> short

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
because sometimes you only want a short

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.330 
because sometimes you only want a short
what<00:02:05.780> antenna<00:02:06.229> sometimes<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:06.890> want<00:02:07.070> a<00:02:07.130> long

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
what antenna sometimes you want a long

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.889 
what antenna sometimes you want a long
one<00:02:07.580> it's<00:02:07.850> really<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:08.330> choice<00:02:08.629> that<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:08.869> can

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
one it's really a choice that you can

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.050 
one it's really a choice that you can
make<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:09.530> there<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.920> can<00:02:09.950> see<00:02:10.069> there's<00:02:10.789> the

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
make so there you can see there's the

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.910 
make so there you can see there's the
coax<00:02:11.599> cables<00:02:11.989> got<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.140> braid<00:02:12.319> on<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.590> outside

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
coax cables got a braid on the outside

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.270 
coax cables got a braid on the outside
and<00:02:13.159> it<00:02:13.580> has<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.909> inner<00:02:14.780> cable<00:02:15.140> there<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.129> this

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
and it has a inner cable there so this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.100 
and it has a inner cable there so this
braid<00:02:16.519> here<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.819> actually<00:02:17.090> it<00:02:17.510> doesn't<00:02:17.870> fray

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
braid here is actually it doesn't fray

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.570 
braid here is actually it doesn't fray
like<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:18.470> braid<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.950> other<00:02:19.069> cakes<00:02:19.430> is

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
like the braid on the other cakes is

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.399 
like the braid on the other cakes is
it's<00:02:19.730> really<00:02:20.060> really<00:02:20.420> good<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:20.989> one<00:02:21.260> thing

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
it's really really good and one thing

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.050 
it's really really good and one thing
you'll<00:02:21.530> notice<00:02:21.709> when<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:21.950> compare<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.519> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
you'll notice when you compare this to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.530 
you'll notice when you compare this to
the<00:02:23.180> other<00:02:23.209> cable<00:02:23.870> that<00:02:24.519> we<00:02:25.519> use<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
the other cable that we use it's

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.569 
the other cable that we use it's
actually<00:02:26.719> a<00:02:26.930> bit<00:02:27.049> thicker<00:02:27.409> that<00:02:28.400> we're

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
actually a bit thicker that we're

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.320 
actually a bit thicker that we're
tracking<00:02:28.849> this<00:02:28.999> line

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
tracking this line

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.210 
tracking this line
here<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.050> she<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.230> bit<00:02:30.350> thicker<00:02:30.710> than<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.070> other

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
here so she a bit thicker than the other

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.830 
here so she a bit thicker than the other
cable<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:31.880> actually<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.150> lower<00:02:32.330> loss<00:02:32.600> so

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
cable and it's actually a lower loss so

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.090 
cable and it's actually a lower loss so
in<00:02:33.100> theory<00:02:34.100> using<00:02:34.820> this<00:02:35.110> silver<00:02:36.110> cable<00:02:36.410> you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
in theory using this silver cable you

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.380 
in theory using this silver cable you
won't<00:02:37.310> waste<00:02:37.520> as<00:02:37.670> much<00:02:37.700> power<00:02:38.120> from<00:02:38.300> your

won't waste as much power from your
video<00:02:38.570> transmitter<00:02:38.960> you<00:02:39.080> won't<00:02:39.260> lose<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.620> much

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
video transmitter you won't lose as much

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.160 
video transmitter you won't lose as much
signal<00:02:40.310> from<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.610> receiver<00:02:41.150> antenna<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.050> in

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
signal from your receiver antenna but in

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.200 
signal from your receiver antenna but in
reality<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.950> difference<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.550> small<00:02:43.580> as<00:02:44.030> to

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
reality the difference is so small as to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.420 
reality the difference is so small as to
be<00:02:44.240> negligible<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.770> there<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:46.070> go<00:02:46.220> that's

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
be negligible but there you go that's

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.490 
be negligible but there you go that's
the<00:02:46.540> coax<00:02:47.540> cable<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.170> buy<00:02:48.290> on<00:02:48.350> eBay

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
the coax cable you can buy on eBay

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.310 
the coax cable you can buy on eBay
really<00:02:48.890> cheap<00:02:49.070> and<00:02:49.190> use<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.460> for<00:02:49.640> your<00:02:50.320> fpv

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
really cheap and use it for your fpv

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.740 
really cheap and use it for your fpv
