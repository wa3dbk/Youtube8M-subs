00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.789 

that<00:01:55.900> was<00:01:56.140> mostly<00:01:56.890> about<00:01:57.100> 90<00:01:57.490> sit<00:01:58.680> there<00:01:59.680> were

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
that was mostly about 90 sit there were

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.600 
that was mostly about 90 sit there were
those<00:02:00.670> fractional<00:02:02.280> imperfections<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.430> that

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
those fractional imperfections in that

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.940 
those fractional imperfections in that
instruction<00:02:04.119> I'm<00:02:04.899> going<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.350> be<00:02:05.409> able<00:02:05.560> to
