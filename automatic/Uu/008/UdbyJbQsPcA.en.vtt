 Sub-20 championship of Pernambuco 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.800
 the hit game is not worth the lead 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 isolated from the group 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.480
 the port wasted no time and in the first 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 opportunity but threw 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.219

 right midfielder crossed trailing and danilo 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.160
 with opportunism appeared free to 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.870
 make the second goal two for port 0 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.299
 for the nautical 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.390
 in the second half the nautical tried to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.460
 general reaction received in a legal position and 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 He kicked the goalkeeper out of the goal 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.040

 but the reaction of the nautical stopped there 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.939
 VinÃ­cius charged foul and everything from a slight 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.070
 head turning 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.970
 enough to get out of reach of the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.350
 goalkeeper bruno 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.259

 final scoreboard 4 ao ao gabon 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.159
 leads the group with nine points and a 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.819
 quilombo is second with six 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.190
 points 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.819
 this shows that we are also in the 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.100
 goodbye right? 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.200
 our team humbly with very 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.630
 work with dedication on the day of 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.950
 work has been putting into practice 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.229
 field what you are asking and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.849
 I hope we can keep a 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.929
 good and we got some results 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.180
 positive 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.549
 today the changes in the team did not 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.250
 the effects and it can have a pattern 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.799
 throughout the game and its sequence of 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.989
 week job was and is also 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.540
 important you have a group or height 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.970
 players and you do not only have 11 teams 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.650
 There's a tall cast so I believe that 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.269
 we're getting it keeps a 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.280
 strong group is the one that goes 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.140
 always keep the level so I think 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.870
 the way to get far is that 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.790
 has a strong group a group that 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.630
 enters the field knowing the goal is 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.760
 Always win 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.680
 What evaluation do you make of this defeat? 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.310
 nautical by 4 to 1 before the team of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.019
 port evaluation defeat is difficult right 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.700
 we had good times in the game 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.829
 especially in the first part where 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.989
 have more opportunities than on the second 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.780
 and we scored on the second in the first 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.700
 we did not make the goal but soccer as I said 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.780
 in the break and if you do not enjoy the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.989
 opportunities 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.880
 the other that gains confidence and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.010
 goal gives more tranquility and that's what 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.510
 happened in the game right when we entered 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.299
 in the game at the beginning of the second half 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 we did the 21 but only then did she call 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.100
 We do not think there is a goal 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.470
 any disorganized moment, right? 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.180
 counter-attack to search the 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.230
 tc, especially on the dead ball. 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.620
 fourth goal, right? 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:28.400
 It is normal part of the game our loch 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.739
 The team is much better than they presented 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.299
 today a game of today but the team of 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.690
 Congratulations, Port made a big 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.340
 game 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.080
 I was able to take advantage of the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.100
 goal opportunities that had soccer 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:46.240
 2014 offering rockers soft drinks 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.240
