hello<00:00:06.110> this<00:00:06.530> week<00:00:06.800> I've<00:00:07.040> been<00:00:07.100> working<00:00:07.760> on<00:00:08.000> the

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
hello this week I've been working on the

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.629 
hello this week I've been working on the
rosette<00:00:08.870> for<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.139> part<00:00:09.380> of<00:00:09.500> guitar<00:00:09.770> and<00:00:10.190> I

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
rosette for the part of guitar and I

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.080 
rosette for the part of guitar and I
really<00:00:11.090> enjoy<00:00:11.389> making<00:00:11.690> rosettes<00:00:12.440> for<00:00:12.590> guitars

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.090 
really enjoy making rosettes for guitars

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.850 
really enjoy making rosettes for guitars
it's<00:00:14.090> a<00:00:14.240> focal<00:00:14.690> point<00:00:14.990> of<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.230> instrument<00:00:15.740> so

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
it's a focal point of the instrument so

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.400 
it's a focal point of the instrument so
it<00:00:16.010> has<00:00:16.160> to<00:00:16.309> be<00:00:16.400> absolutely<00:00:16.970> spot-on<00:00:17.420> people's

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
it has to be absolutely spot-on people's

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.710 
it has to be absolutely spot-on people's
eyes<00:00:18.590> are<00:00:18.950> drawn<00:00:19.550> to<00:00:19.700> it<00:00:19.850> to<00:00:20.090> that<00:00:20.240> that's

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
eyes are drawn to it to that that's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.460 
eyes are drawn to it to that that's
about<00:00:20.990> straight<00:00:21.470> away<00:00:22.539> by<00:00:23.539> the<00:00:23.599> nature<00:00:24.140> it's

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
about straight away by the nature it's

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.120 
about straight away by the nature it's
very<00:00:24.769> small<00:00:25.130> very<00:00:25.400> fiddly<00:00:26.000> to<00:00:26.589> make<00:00:27.589> so<00:00:28.099> I

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
very small very fiddly to make so I

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.380 
very small very fiddly to make so I
think<00:00:28.220> it's<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.429> real<00:00:28.640> test<00:00:29.119> of<00:00:31.390> craftsmanship

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
think it's a real test of craftsmanship

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.920 
think it's a real test of craftsmanship
to<00:00:32.570> create<00:00:32.960> a<00:00:33.260> good<00:00:33.710> rosette<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.480> that's<00:00:35.810> what

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
to create a good rosette so that's what

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.479 
to create a good rosette so that's what
I've<00:00:35.990> been<00:00:36.050> doing<00:00:36.350> this<00:00:36.620> week<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.100> come<00:00:37.399> and

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
I've been doing this week so come and

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.010 
I've been doing this week so come and
have<00:00:37.610> a<00:00:37.640> closer<00:00:38.180> look<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.539> I'll<00:00:38.809> talk<00:00:38.989> you

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
have a closer look and I'll talk you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.170 
have a closer look and I'll talk you
through<00:00:39.200> it<00:00:39.550> so<00:00:40.550> here's<00:00:40.760> that<00:00:40.879> here's<00:00:41.030> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
through it so here's that here's the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.700 
through it so here's that here's the
rosette<00:00:41.539> and<00:00:41.690> one<00:00:41.870> of<00:00:41.989> the<00:00:42.140> first<00:00:42.379> things<00:00:42.620> that

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
rosette and one of the first things that

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.470 
rosette and one of the first things that
you'll<00:00:42.860> notice<00:00:43.250> is<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.789> I've<00:00:44.000> taken<00:00:44.239> the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
you'll notice is that I've taken the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.810 
you'll notice is that I've taken the
rosette<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.289> way<00:00:45.410> up<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.550> edge<00:00:46.670> of

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
rosette right the way up to the edge of

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
rosette right the way up to the edge of
this<00:00:47.000> sound<00:00:47.360> hole

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
this sound hole

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.549 
this sound hole
many<00:00:48.350> of<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.070> early<00:00:49.640> guitars<00:00:50.030> had<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:51.140> style

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
many of the early guitars had this style

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.500 
many of the early guitars had this style
of<00:00:51.710> rosette<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:52.280> wanted<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:52.640> be<00:00:52.699> faithful<00:00:53.000> to

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
of rosette I wanted to be faithful to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.900 
of rosette I wanted to be faithful to
that<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.770> that's<00:00:54.980> what<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:55.190> wanted<00:00:55.520> what<00:00:55.789> I've

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
that so that's what I wanted what I've

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.939 
that so that's what I wanted what I've
done<00:00:56.059> done<00:00:56.480> here<00:00:56.780> number<00:00:57.739> of<00:00:57.949> quite<00:00:58.399> tricky

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
done done here number of quite tricky

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:02.560 
done done here number of quite tricky
techniques<00:01:00.949> involved<00:01:01.460> here<00:01:01.670> first<00:01:02.180> of<00:01:02.420> all

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
techniques involved here first of all

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.310 
techniques involved here first of all
this<00:01:03.050> rope<00:01:03.489> purfling<00:01:04.489> which<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.850> quite<00:01:05.510> quite

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
this rope purfling which is quite quite

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.859 
this rope purfling which is quite quite
why<00:01:06.620> quite<00:01:07.040> rigid<00:01:07.910> i<00:01:08.090> had<00:01:08.480> to<00:01:08.630> bend<00:01:08.900> that<00:01:09.340> to

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
why quite rigid i had to bend that to

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.929 
why quite rigid i had to bend that to
obviously<00:01:11.869> to<00:01:12.049> tip<00:01:12.290> to<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.799> the<00:01:12.920> circle<00:01:13.369> so

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
obviously to tip to the to the circle so

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:15.760 
obviously to tip to the to the circle so
those<00:01:14.090> two<00:01:14.360> pieces<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.750> perfectly<00:01:15.409> went<00:01:15.650> in

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
those two pieces of perfectly went in

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.319 
those two pieces of perfectly went in
first<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.520> then<00:01:17.210> each<00:01:17.689> piece<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.729> abalone<00:01:19.729> was

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
first and then each piece of abalone was

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.160 
first and then each piece of abalone was
cut<00:01:20.630> by<00:01:20.840> hand<00:01:21.700> it's<00:01:22.700> only<00:01:22.939> about<00:01:23.360> one<00:01:23.960> point

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
cut by hand it's only about one point

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.920 
cut by hand it's only about one point
seven<00:01:24.470> millimeters<00:01:25.040> wide<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.490> other<00:01:25.640> line

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
seven millimeters wide the other line

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.450 
seven millimeters wide the other line
and<00:01:28.270> terribly<00:01:29.270> fragile<00:01:29.979> broke<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.009> number<00:01:31.369> of

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
and terribly fragile broke a number of

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.490 
and terribly fragile broke a number of
pieces<00:01:31.670> before<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.210> actually<00:01:32.630> obtained<00:01:33.320> a

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
pieces before I actually obtained a

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.889 
pieces before I actually obtained a
complete<00:01:34.310> circle<00:01:34.790> probably<00:01:35.299> on<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.509> limits

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
complete circle probably on the limits

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.480 
complete circle probably on the limits
of<00:01:36.079> what's<00:01:36.560> possible<00:01:37.780> to<00:01:38.780> cut<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.130> as<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.340> can

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
of what's possible to cut but as you can

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.609 
of what's possible to cut but as you can
see<00:01:40.700> once<00:01:40.909> it's<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.299> looks<00:01:41.930> very<00:01:42.259> very<00:01:42.380> nice

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
see once it's in looks very very nice

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.069 
see once it's in looks very very nice
and<00:01:43.009> then<00:01:43.880> what<00:01:44.090> I've<00:01:44.210> done<00:01:44.390> around<00:01:44.659> the

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
and then what I've done around the

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.789 
and then what I've done around the
inside<00:01:45.649> of<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.640> sound<00:01:46.939> hole<00:01:47.180> itself<00:01:47.659> is<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:48.320> put

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
inside of the sound hole itself is I put

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.429 
inside of the sound hole itself is I put
a<00:01:48.829> piece<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.100> an<00:01:49.790> even<00:01:50.090> ear<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:50.840> trims<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
a piece of an even ear so trims the

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.069 
a piece of an even ear so trims the
rosette<00:01:51.829> up<00:01:52.009> nicely<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:52.759> when<00:01:53.630> anybody's

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
rosette up nicely and when anybody's

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.679 
rosette up nicely and when anybody's
looking<00:01:54.469> into<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.280> guitar<00:01:55.610> they<00:01:56.180> don't<00:01:56.450> see

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
looking into the guitar they don't see

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.889 
looking into the guitar they don't see
any<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.170> any<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.649> soundboard<00:01:58.130> at<00:01:58.520> all<00:01:58.899> and

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
any of any of the soundboard at all and

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.690 
any of any of the soundboard at all and
on<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.409> other<00:02:00.619> side<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.490> just<00:02:02.210> flip<00:02:02.630> this<00:02:02.750> over

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
on the other side I just flip this over

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.109 
on the other side I just flip this over
you'll<00:02:04.700> also<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.479> that<00:02:05.750> I've<00:02:06.500> glued<00:02:07.399> on<00:02:07.759> a

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
you'll also see that I've glued on a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.420 
you'll also see that I've glued on a
piece<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:08.960> Sycamore<00:02:09.440> veneer<00:02:09.710> it's<00:02:10.190> only<00:02:10.310> about

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
piece of Sycamore veneer it's only about

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.790 
piece of Sycamore veneer it's only about
half<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.940> millimeter<00:02:11.120> metre<00:02:11.840> thick<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:12.650> that's

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
half a millimeter metre thick but that's

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.070
