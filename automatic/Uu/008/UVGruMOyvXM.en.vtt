hair as a day old I always find that
this<00:00:58.129> isn't<00:00:58.430> it<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.519> bit<00:00:58.640> easier<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:59.030> work<00:00:59.239> with

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
this isn't it a bit easier to work with

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.289 
this isn't it a bit easier to work with
in<00:00:59.720> styling<00:01:00.589> because<00:01:00.979> some<00:01:01.250> I'm<00:01:01.519> very<00:01:01.580> clean

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
in styling because some I'm very clean

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.329 
in styling because some I'm very clean
hair<00:01:02.570> it's<00:01:02.720> a<00:01:02.839> slippy<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:03.500> my<00:01:03.979> hair<00:01:04.159> doesn't

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
hair it's a slippy and my hair doesn't

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.120 
hair it's a slippy and my hair doesn't
hold<00:01:04.640> when<00:01:05.210> it's<00:01:05.299> very<00:01:05.479> clean<00:01:05.720> so<00:01:06.409> day<00:01:06.920> old

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
hold when it's very clean so day old

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.830 
hold when it's very clean so day old
hair<00:01:07.400> which<00:01:07.820> is<00:01:07.940> good<00:01:08.090> news<00:01:08.240> because<00:01:08.479> it's<00:01:08.690> one

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
hair which is good news because it's one

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.390 
hair which is good news because it's one
less<00:01:08.990> thing<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.290> do<00:01:09.409> before<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.100> have<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.369> go

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
less thing to do before you have to go

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.530 
less thing to do before you have to go
out<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.290> Here<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.320> am<00:01:12.760> sectioning<00:01:13.760> off<00:01:13.790> my<00:01:14.300> hair

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
out and Here I am sectioning off my hair

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.350 
out and Here I am sectioning off my hair
I<00:01:15.070> think<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.130> most<00:01:16.280> important<00:01:16.940> thing<00:01:16.970> with

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
I think the most important thing with

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.350 
I think the most important thing with
using<00:01:17.630> this<00:01:17.990> profile<00:01:18.830> is<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.880> make<00:01:20.060> sure<00:01:20.090> that

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
using this profile is to make sure that

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.850 
using this profile is to make sure that
you<00:01:20.420> get<00:01:20.510> the<00:01:20.660> sectioning<00:01:21.200> rights<00:01:21.440> because

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
you get the sectioning rights because

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.590 
you get the sectioning rights because
it's<00:01:22.040> a<00:01:22.070> very<00:01:22.100> clever<00:01:22.580> little<00:01:22.910> gadget<00:01:23.390> this

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
it's a very clever little gadget this

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.960 
it's a very clever little gadget this
what<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.440> does<00:01:24.620> is<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:24.950> put<00:01:25.250> a<00:01:25.280> strand<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.760> hair

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
what it does is you put a strand of hair

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.870 
what it does is you put a strand of hair
into<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.660> machine<00:01:27.020> clamp<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:27.830> down<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.370> then

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
into the machine clamp it down and then

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.520 
into the machine clamp it down and then
when<00:01:29.030> you<00:01:29.120> clamp<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.510> it<00:01:29.630> kind<00:01:29.870> of<00:01:29.930> gobbles<00:01:30.440> it

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
when you clamp it it kind of gobbles it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.160 
when you clamp it it kind of gobbles it
all<00:01:30.680> up<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.070> then<00:01:31.760> heats<00:01:32.060> it<00:01:32.270> into<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.510> curl<00:01:32.810> and

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
all up and then heats it into a curl and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.140 
all up and then heats it into a curl and
then<00:01:33.800> it<00:01:33.980> waits<00:01:34.160> little<00:01:34.520> while<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> then<00:01:35.000> you

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
then it waits little while and then you

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.760 
then it waits little while and then you
release<00:01:35.270> it<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.720> you've<00:01:35.870> got<00:01:36.020> this<00:01:36.170> car<00:01:36.410> now

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
release it and you've got this car now

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370 
release it and you've got this car now
if<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:37.820> not<00:01:38.000> completely<00:01:38.420> right<00:01:38.720> it<00:01:39.050> just

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
if it's not completely right it just

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.720 
if it's not completely right it just
doesn't<00:01:39.560> let<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.860> curl<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.400> little<00:01:40.490> go<00:01:40.700> bit

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
doesn't let you curl it a little go bit

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.840 
doesn't let you curl it a little go bit
of<00:01:41.060> a<00:01:41.150> movie<00:01:41.510> and<00:01:41.750> then<00:01:42.230> go<00:01:42.530> bit<00:01:42.950> crazy<00:01:43.550> and

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
of a movie and then go bit crazy and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.310 
of a movie and then go bit crazy and
then<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.210> just<00:01:44.330> have<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.660> release<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.110> hair

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
then you just have to release the hair

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.860 
then you just have to release the hair
so<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.190> kind<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.580> foolproof<00:01:47.000> but<00:01:47.600> you<00:01:47.720> really

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
so it's kind of foolproof but you really

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.080 
so it's kind of foolproof but you really
need<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.200> make<00:01:48.740> sure<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:49.030> preparation<00:01:50.030> is

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
need to make sure that preparation is

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.850 
need to make sure that preparation is
key<00:01:50.300> basically<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.930> need<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.170> make<00:01:51.350> sure<00:01:51.380> that

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
key basically you need to make sure that

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.380 
key basically you need to make sure that
you've<00:01:52.190> got<00:01:52.370> all<00:01:52.550> of<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:52.790> sections<00:01:53.240> right

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
you've got all of your sections right

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.260 
you've got all of your sections right
it'd<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.780> really<00:01:53.990> nice<00:01:54.290> neat<00:01:55.270> compact

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
it'd be a really nice neat compact

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.960 
it'd be a really nice neat compact
section<00:01:57.230> of<00:01:57.350> hair<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.800> then<00:01:58.340> placing<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.820> in

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
section of hair and then placing that in

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.750 
section of hair and then placing that in
the<00:01:59.030> Machine<00:01:59.350> clamping<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.470> down<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:01.010> then

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
the Machine clamping it down and then

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.080 
the Machine clamping it down and then
there's<00:02:02.120> protocol<00:02:02.570> gobbling<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.230> all<00:02:03.350> up<00:02:03.470> into

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
there's protocol gobbling it all up into

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.330 
there's protocol gobbling it all up into
into<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.180> main<00:02:05.330> body<00:02:05.360> of<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.930> machine<00:02:06.350> and<00:02:06.620> I

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
into the main body of the machine and I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.009 
into the main body of the machine and I
think<00:02:07.880> this<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.209> closest<00:02:08.599> thing<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.989> the

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
think this is the closest thing to the

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.649 
think this is the closest thing to the
hair<00:02:09.349> magic<00:02:09.769> that<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.159> get<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.519> little<00:02:11.390> bit

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
hair magic that you can get a little bit

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.149 
hair magic that you can get a little bit
of<00:02:11.690> weight<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.200> then<00:02:12.500> release<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.920> and

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
of weight and then release it and

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.369 
of weight and then release it and
there's<00:02:13.459> your<00:02:13.640> car<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.720> can<00:02:14.870> see<00:02:15.080> that

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
there's your car and you can see that

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.459 
there's your car and you can see that
once<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:16.129> release<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.730> pro<00:02:16.909> Cal<00:02:17.180> I'm<00:02:17.659> not<00:02:18.079> kind

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
once I release the pro Cal I'm not kind

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.800 
once I release the pro Cal I'm not kind
of<00:02:18.560> stretching<00:02:19.310> out<00:02:19.459> the

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
of stretching out the

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.220 
of stretching out the
running<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> pro<00:02:20.860> curler<00:02:21.130> back<00:02:21.489> through<00:02:21.849> it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
running the pro curler back through it

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.630 
running the pro curler back through it
you<00:02:23.230> literally<00:02:23.560> want<00:02:23.739> to<00:02:23.860> release<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> machine

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
you literally want to release a machine

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.720 
you literally want to release a machine
and<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:25.270> grab<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.780> away<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:26.800> curl<00:02:27.099> is<00:02:27.430> not

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
and and grab it away so the curl is not

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.210 
and and grab it away so the curl is not
disturbed<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.450> then<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.620> cow<00:02:29.800> calls

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
disturbed and then as the cow calls

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.550 
disturbed and then as the cow calls
that's<00:02:30.849> when<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.150> sets<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.020> hair<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.349> still

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
that's when it sets so the hair is still

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.710 
that's when it sets so the hair is still
very<00:02:32.680> warm<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.280> comes<00:02:33.489> out<00:02:33.700> really<00:02:33.940> but
