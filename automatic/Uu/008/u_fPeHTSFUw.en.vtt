the diamond both sides for example see
this<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.670> isn't<00:02:05.969> that<00:02:06.090> good<00:02:06.570> great<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.560> at

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
this one isn't that good great but at

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.320 
this one isn't that good great but at
least<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:08.039> side<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.429> nice<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.819> i'm<00:02:08.940> curious

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
least one side is nice and i'm curious

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.740 
least one side is nice and i'm curious
if<00:02:09.599> I'm<00:02:10.200> gonna<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.300> ones

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
if I'm gonna do it right with the ones

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.700 
if I'm gonna do it right with the ones
it's

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it's

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.440 
it's
you<00:02:14.010> know<00:02:14.130> after<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.790> finished<00:02:15.120> cleaning

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you know after the finished cleaning

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.660 
you know after the finished cleaning
after<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.290> heat<00:02:16.440> treat<00:02:16.740> very<00:02:17.190> curious<00:02:17.550> about

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
after the heat treat very curious about

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.140 
after the heat treat very curious about
that<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:19.040> these<00:02:20.040> are<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.400> flat<00:02:20.850> ground

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
that and these are all just flat ground

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.000 
that and these are all just flat ground
so<00:02:21.330> they<00:02:21.450> will<00:02:21.600> get<00:02:21.750> convexed<00:02:22.470> after<00:02:22.890> they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
so they will get convexed after they

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.930 
so they will get convexed after they
come<00:02:23.250> back<00:02:23.430> from<00:02:23.460> heat<00:02:23.820> treat<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:25.940> kinda

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
come back from heat treat and kinda

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.390 
come back from heat treat and kinda
excited<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.780> it<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.920> one<00:02:29.190> last

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
piece of steel this one here this is

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.560 
piece of steel this one here this is
what<00:02:32.910> point<00:02:33.830> 14.1<00:02:34.830> for<00:02:35.160> so<00:02:35.940> little<00:02:36.150> thicker

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
what point 14.1 for so little thicker

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.790 
what point 14.1 for so little thicker
it's<00:02:37.290> something<00:02:37.710> between<00:02:38.040> 18<00:02:38.850> and<00:02:39.200> 316<00:02:42.800> just

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
it's something between 18 and 316 just
