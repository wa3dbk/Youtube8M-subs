them into practice it's a waste of time
you<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.610> wasting<00:01:45.030> your<00:01:45.060> time<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.799> you<00:01:46.799> know

best fighting tip so what is it what's

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.310 
best fighting tip so what is it what's
your<00:01:58.979> number<00:01:59.219> one<00:01:59.250> straight<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.570> positive

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
your number one straight go to positive

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.350 
your number one straight go to positive
or<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.860> me<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.030> arms

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
or for me to make sure that the arms

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.429 
or for me to make sure that the arms
hang<00:02:03.570> naturally<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
hang naturally and

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.080 
hang naturally and
when<00:02:05.740> we're<00:02:05.859> looking<00:02:05.920> from<00:02:06.219> the<00:02:06.369> front<00:02:06.399> angle

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
when we're looking from the front angle

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.570 
when we're looking from the front angle
we<00:02:07.210> don't<00:02:07.420> see<00:02:07.600> too<00:02:07.749> many<00:02:07.929> changes<00:02:08.259> from<00:02:09.039> what

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
we don't see too many changes from what

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.180 
we don't see too many changes from what
would<00:02:09.729> be<00:02:09.910> considered<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.750> be<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.929> normal<00:02:11.190> set

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
would be considered to be a normal set

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.710 
would be considered to be a normal set
up<00:02:12.340> position<00:02:12.489> but<00:02:12.970> when<00:02:13.120> we<00:02:13.239> look<00:02:13.420> from<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
up position but when we look from the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.440 
up position but when we look from the
side<00:02:13.959> you'll<00:02:14.920> see<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.370> if<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.879> arms<00:02:16.299> are

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
side you'll see that if the arms are

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.080 
side you'll see that if the arms are
hanging<00:02:17.040> naturally<00:02:18.040> from<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> shoulders<00:02:18.819> so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
hanging naturally from the shoulders so

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.009 
hanging naturally from the shoulders so
basically<00:02:20.019> when<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> arms<00:02:20.739> hang<00:02:21.239> their<00:02:22.239> hands

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
basically when the arms hang their hands

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.410 
basically when the arms hang their hands
as<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.830> can<00:02:23.980> see<00:02:24.160> from<00:02:24.430> here<00:02:24.640> are<00:02:24.910> in<00:02:25.060> front<00:02:25.299> of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
as you can see from here are in front of

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.880 
as you can see from here are in front of
the<00:02:25.540> shoulders<00:02:26.019> they're<00:02:26.260> not<00:02:26.379> underneath<00:02:26.739> the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the shoulders they're not underneath the

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.789 
the shoulders they're not underneath the
shoulders<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.730> are<00:02:28.030> inside<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.900> arms<00:02:29.349> are

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
shoulders and are inside the arms are

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.640 
shoulders and are inside the arms are
not<00:02:30.190> connected<00:02:30.819> tight<00:02:31.209> to<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.599> body<00:02:31.780> creating

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
not connected tight to the body creating

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.490 
not connected tight to the body creating
unnecessary<00:02:33.129> tension<00:02:34.060> so<00:02:34.900> that's<00:02:35.080> really<00:02:35.290> for

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
unnecessary tension so that's really for

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.020 
unnecessary tension so that's really for
me<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.709> most<00:02:36.010> important<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.819> course<00:02:36.879> that

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
me the most important of course that

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670 
me the most important of course that
does<00:02:37.330> change<00:02:37.629> the<00:02:37.690> ball<00:02:37.930> position<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
does change the ball position and the

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.710 
does change the ball position and the
concept<00:02:39.129> of<00:02:39.280> ball<00:02:39.489> position<00:02:39.879> as<00:02:40.000> well<00:02:40.150> okay<00:02:40.660> so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
concept of ball position as well okay so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.990 
concept of ball position as well okay so
if<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.379> have<00:02:41.650> soft<00:02:41.980> hands<00:02:42.250> does<00:02:42.610> that<00:02:42.790> mean

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
if you have soft hands does that mean

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.350 
if you have soft hands does that mean
that<00:02:43.329> it's<00:02:44.110> going<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.430> improve<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:45.489> field

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
that it's going to improve your field

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.449 
that it's going to improve your field
for<00:02:46.540> one<00:02:46.840> thing<00:02:47.140> but<00:02:47.379> also<00:02:47.530> consistency<00:02:48.370> at

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
for one thing but also consistency at

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.160 
for one thing but also consistency at
the<00:02:48.549> same<00:02:48.760> time<00:02:49.180> when<00:02:49.480> your<00:02:49.599> arms<00:02:49.900> are<00:02:50.019> hanging

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the same time when your arms are hanging

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.380 
the same time when your arms are hanging
like<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.890> or<00:02:51.250> when<00:02:51.430> they<00:02:51.519> are<00:02:51.549> here<00:02:52.030> yeah

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
like that or when they are here yeah

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.390 
like that or when they are here yeah
well<00:02:52.599> the<00:02:52.840> idea<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.590> get<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> arms<00:02:54.099> into<00:02:54.250> a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
well the idea is to get the arms into a

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.309 
well the idea is to get the arms into a
position<00:02:54.549> where<00:02:54.940> they<00:02:55.150> hang<00:02:55.390> naturally<00:02:56.049> so

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
position where they hang naturally so

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.680 
position where they hang naturally so
that<00:02:56.470> there<00:02:57.069> is<00:02:57.190> no<00:02:57.370> tension<00:02:57.670> yeah<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.510> once

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
that there is no tension yeah and once

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.390 
that there is no tension yeah and once
we've<00:02:58.840> got<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.109> tension<00:02:59.560> out<00:02:59.650> of<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.920> arms

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
we've got the tension out of the arms

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.369 
we've got the tension out of the arms
then<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:01.120> can<00:03:01.269> actually<00:03:01.390> increase<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.170> grip

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
then we can actually increase the grip

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.020 
then we can actually increase the grip
pressure<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.069> that<00:03:03.190> we're<00:03:03.340> nice<00:03:03.489> and<00:03:03.730> firm

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
pressure so that we're nice and firm

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.390 
pressure so that we're nice and firm
with<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.420> hands<00:03:04.780> right<00:03:05.260> o'clock<00:03:05.709> okay<00:03:06.160> that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
with the hands right o'clock okay that

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.220 
with the hands right o'clock okay that
doesn't<00:03:06.640> increase<00:03:07.090> pressure<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.720> tension<00:03:07.900> up

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
doesn't increase pressure and tension up

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.539 
doesn't increase pressure and tension up
in<00:03:08.379> the<00:03:08.500> upper<00:03:08.829> body<00:03:09.010> because<00:03:09.340> they<00:03:09.459> are

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
in the upper body because they are

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.670 
in the upper body because they are
yanking<00:03:09.970> naturally<00:03:10.569> we<00:03:11.230> would<00:03:11.319> hold<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
yanking naturally we would hold the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.949 
yanking naturally we would hold the
hammer<00:03:11.889> whether<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.849> toffee<00:03:13.209> hammer<00:03:13.420> you

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
hammer whether it's a toffee hammer you

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.449 
hammer whether it's a toffee hammer you
know<00:03:14.049> making<00:03:14.440> toffee<00:03:14.739> in<00:03:14.950> our<00:03:15.069> hand<00:03:15.310> or

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
know making toffee in our hand or

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.250 
know making toffee in our hand or
whether<00:03:15.670> we're<00:03:15.819> holding<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.180> station<00:03:16.599> or<00:03:16.750> you

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
whether we're holding the station or you

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.900 
whether we're holding the station or you
know<00:03:17.380> smaller<00:03:17.680> hammer<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.190> hold<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.489> firm

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
know smaller hammer would hold that firm

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.670 
know smaller hammer would hold that firm
so<00:03:19.299> that<00:03:19.420> we<00:03:19.510> had<00:03:19.660> control<00:03:19.959> over<00:03:20.079> that<00:03:20.500> hammer

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
so that we had control over that hammer

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.830 
so that we had control over that hammer
because<00:03:21.549> we've<00:03:21.819> got<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> be<00:03:22.180> precise<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.720> a

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840
