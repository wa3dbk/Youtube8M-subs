00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.399 
was gone and I would lose where my feet
were<00:02:43.280> that's<00:02:43.819> big<00:02:44.030> part<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.329> it<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.720> then

were that's big part of it and then
another<00:02:45.709> thing<00:02:46.129> I<00:02:46.159> noticed<00:02:46.609> is<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:47.599> type<00:02:48.079> of

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
another thing I noticed is a type of

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.649 
another thing I noticed is a type of
proprioception<00:02:49.069> which<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:50.000> your<00:02:50.420> body

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
proprioception which is your body

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.399 
proprioception which is your body
awareness<00:02:51.409> in<00:02:51.829> space<00:02:52.190> so<00:02:52.900> because<00:02:53.900> it<00:02:54.200> was<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:54.409 
awareness in space so because it was so

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.770 
awareness in space so because it was so
limited<00:02:54.680> which<00:02:55.489> is<00:02:55.609> like<00:02:55.760> one<00:02:56.000> path<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.450> vision

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
limited which is like one path of vision

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.740 
limited which is like one path of vision
I<00:02:56.989> would<00:02:57.230> grab<00:02:58.220> something<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.329> feel<00:02:59.540> a<00:02:59.599> little

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
I would grab something and feel a little

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.420 
I would grab something and feel a little
bit<00:02:59.900> scared<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.530> then<00:03:00.739> not<00:03:00.950> know<00:03:01.129> where<00:03:01.340> the

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
bit scared and then not know where the

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.879 
bit scared and then not know where the
rest<00:03:01.609> of<00:03:01.819> my<00:03:01.879> body<00:03:02.060> was<00:03:02.590> because<00:03:03.590> like<00:03:03.739> my

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
up real foggy because I was sweating a

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.229 
up real foggy because I was sweating a
lot<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.829> I<00:03:22.160> thought<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> was<00:03:22.489> going<00:03:22.609> to<00:03:22.669> be<00:03:22.819> a

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
lot and I thought it was going to be a

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:26.589 
lot and I thought it was going to be a
lot<00:03:23.569> easier<00:03:23.780> than<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.530> was<00:03:24.709> because<00:03:25.609> when<00:03:26.569> I

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
lot easier than it was because when I

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.659 
lot easier than it was because when I
tried<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.260> walk<00:03:27.560> with<00:03:27.799> it<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.220> couple<00:03:28.489> times

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
tried to walk with it a couple times

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.449 
tried to walk with it a couple times
before<00:03:29.030> i<00:03:29.329> was<00:03:30.169> like<00:03:30.319> awesome<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.889> bad<00:03:31.069> I

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
before i was like awesome that bad I

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.339 
before i was like awesome that bad I
like<00:03:31.730> know<00:03:32.169> how<00:03:33.169> to<00:03:33.230> walk<00:03:33.709> but<00:03:34.549> when<00:03:34.699> you<00:03:35.349> apply

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
like know how to walk but when you apply

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.439 
like know how to walk but when you apply
it<00:03:36.410> to<00:03:36.859> something<00:03:36.889> that<00:03:37.489> involves<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.299> your

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
it to something that involves like your

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.229 
it to something that involves like your
whole<00:03:38.569> body<00:03:38.810> especially<00:03:39.549> off<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.940> ground

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
whole body especially off the ground

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.680 
whole body especially off the ground
it's<00:03:41.989> much<00:03:42.519> much<00:03:43.519> more<00:03:43.730> difficult<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.690> guess

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
it's much much more difficult I guess

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.119 
it's much much more difficult I guess
yeah<00:03:47.690> there's<00:03:48.199> a<00:03:48.290> higher<00:03:48.470> risk<00:03:48.919> of

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:49.129 
yeah there's a higher risk of

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.000 
yeah there's a higher risk of
consequences<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:51.500> wasn't<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:51.859> much<00:03:51.889> about

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
consequences and it wasn't so much about

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.439 
consequences and it wasn't so much about
scared<00:03:52.639> of<00:03:52.900> falling<00:03:53.900> off<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.470> wall<00:03:54.620> cookies

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:55.449 
scared of falling off the wall cookies

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.490 
scared of falling off the wall cookies
giant<00:03:56.449> paths<00:03:56.659> but<00:03:57.139> more<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.489> was<00:03:58.730> scared<00:03:59.000> that

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
giant paths but more I was scared that

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.920 
giant paths but more I was scared that
my<00:04:00.500> body<00:04:00.799> didn't<00:04:01.549> feel<00:04:01.579> connected<00:04:01.970> like<00:04:02.510> all

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
my body didn't feel connected like all

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.259 
my body didn't feel connected like all
of<00:04:03.199> our<00:04:03.290> senses<00:04:03.470> are<00:04:04.280> relying<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:05.030> each<00:04:05.120> other

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
of our senses are relying on each other

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.659 
of our senses are relying on each other
and<00:04:05.449> everything<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:06.079> think<00:04:06.290> like<00:04:06.560> oh<00:04:06.799> my<00:04:07.519> gosh

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
and everything you think like oh my gosh

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.780 
and everything you think like oh my gosh
if<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.030> didn't<00:04:08.239> have<00:04:08.359> the<00:04:08.479> ability<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.790> even

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
if I didn't have the ability to even

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.339 
if I didn't have the ability to even
have<00:04:11.060> peripheral<00:04:11.389> vision<00:04:11.840> or<00:04:12.019> even<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
have peripheral vision or even the

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.740 
have peripheral vision or even the
ability<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.829> touch<00:04:13.069> like<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.760> would<00:04:14.299> be<00:04:14.419> my

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
ability to touch like I would be my

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.089 
ability to touch like I would be my
Center<00:04:15.019> we<00:04:15.199> completely<00:04:15.590> throw<00:04:15.889> it<00:04:15.949> off

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
Center we completely throw it off

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:19.360 
Center we completely throw it off
because<00:04:17.289> over<00:04:18.289> senses<00:04:18.590> meet<00:04:18.769> each<00:04:18.889> other<00:04:19.099> and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
because over senses meet each other and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.779 
because over senses meet each other and
like<00:04:19.579> I<00:04:19.700> found<00:04:19.880> myself<00:04:20.950> instead<00:04:21.950> of<00:04:22.010> trying<00:04:22.760> to

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
like I found myself instead of trying to

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.870 
like I found myself instead of trying to
look<00:04:23.090> through<00:04:23.479> the<00:04:23.599> glasses<00:04:23.870> and<00:04:24.440> like<00:04:25.250> let<00:04:25.760> my

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
look through the glasses and like let my

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.950 
look through the glasses and like let my
brain<00:04:26.469> figure<00:04:27.469> out<00:04:27.789> site<00:04:28.789> that<00:04:29.090> way<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.510> more

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
brain figure out site that way I more

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.240 
brain figure out site that way I more
like<00:04:30.380> felt<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.940> rock<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.510> tried<00:04:32.719> to<00:04:32.840> guess

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
like felt the rock and tried to guess

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.209 
like felt the rock and tried to guess
because<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.430> were<00:04:35.180> so<00:04:35.389> uncomfortable<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:36.440> my

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
because I were so uncomfortable that my

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:42.209 
because I were so uncomfortable that my
site<00:04:37.550> was<00:04:38.539> different<00:04:39.050> than<00:04:39.169> usual<00:04:39.320> so<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.039> said

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
site was different than usual so I said

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:49.089 
site was different than usual so I said
I<00:04:46.990> have<00:04:47.990> something<00:04:48.289> I<00:04:48.500> want<00:04:48.710> trying<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:48.950> think

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
I have something I want trying to think

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:51.580 
I have something I want trying to think
about<00:04:49.159> it<00:04:49.450> when<00:04:50.450> you<00:04:50.510> look<00:04:50.750> at<00:04:50.870> something<00:04:51.110> in

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
about it when you look at something in

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.339 
about it when you look at something in
the<00:04:51.650> image<00:04:52.639> goes<00:04:53.479> through<00:04:53.690> your<00:04:53.779> lens<00:04:53.990> and

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
the image goes through your lens and

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:58.000 
the image goes through your lens and
it's<00:04:54.500> actually<00:04:55.690> reversed<00:04:56.690> and<00:04:57.080> then<00:04:57.830> your

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
it's actually reversed and then your

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.580 
it's actually reversed and then your
brain<00:04:58.219> perceives<00:04:58.909> it<00:04:59.210> as<00:04:59.240> a<00:04:59.450> right<00:05:00.050> way<00:05:00.200> up<00:05:00.349> its

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
brain perceives it as a right way up its

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.300 
brain perceives it as a right way up its
cool<00:05:00.880> where<00:05:01.880> enough<00:05:02.150> glasses<00:05:02.389> cuz<00:05:02.930> its

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
cool where enough glasses cuz its

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.610 
cool where enough glasses cuz its
opposite<00:05:04.310> so<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.669> goes<00:05:04.880> in<00:05:05.180> reverse<00:05:05.620> reverse

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
opposite so it goes in reverse reverse

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.890 
opposite so it goes in reverse reverse
is<00:05:06.950> technically<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.789> correct<00:05:08.300> way<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.570> then

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
is technically the correct way so then

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.399 
is technically the correct way so then
what<00:05:09.080> does<00:05:09.200> your<00:05:09.320> brain<00:05:09.469> dear<00:05:09.740> visit

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
what does your brain dear visit

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.969 
what does your brain dear visit
as<00:05:10.860> in<00:05:11.669> like<00:05:11.849> yes<00:05:12.119> this<00:05:12.449> is<00:05:13.139> normal<00:05:13.709> or<00:05:14.539> no<00:05:15.979> like

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
as in like yes this is normal or no like

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:22.069 
as in like yes this is normal or no like
you<00:05:17.429> are<00:05:17.639> upside<00:05:18.059> down<00:05:18.619> does<00:05:19.619> any<00:05:19.769> sense
