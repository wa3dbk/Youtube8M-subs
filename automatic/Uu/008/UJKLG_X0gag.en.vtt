00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.350
 Hello, I call it an old Olympian. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.840
 professional organizer and today I am 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.050
 here to teach folds of towels 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.579
 Let's start with the bath towel we 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.759
 let's take a towel we will double it 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:29.489
 in half 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:33.329
 always taking care of the size and 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.629
 labels then we have done more 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:39.180
 one fold in half 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:44.250
 once again always ensuring with the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.030
 same size on both sides and when doing 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 fold in half but we guarantee the 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.570
 uniformity of the towel always 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.260
 have a closet with all the towels 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.179
 rounded in the same way let's do 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.149
 so with the face cloth 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:04.830
 We opened the towel again and made a 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.689
 a little different even because 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.810
 It has a different size but always 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.290
 taking care of the labels for 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.759
 that they stay inside the label is 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 always important sometimes some 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:18.360
 people cut the labels but part 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.130
 window where said 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.009
 the care we have to take with the towel 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.460
 then we fold once again to the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.460
 and we guarantee the same uniformity 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.240
 an easy work so you guarantees 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.299
 wardrobe 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.049
 It's always beautiful and organized. 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.789
 let's go to the used crayon plans 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.630
 daily a dish towel 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:53.270
 a washcloth 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.360
 let's do the fold in half as well and 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.270
 we are going to use a system that calls 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.039
 enveloping we will make a fold 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.619
 the middle plus a fold in half folding 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.890
 at the height of the bar at half height 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.209
 of the towel bar but we will send it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:21.890
 to the outside in the first part 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:24.620
 here but we guarantee a drawer 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.349
 organized with towels you can 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.410
 move during the day and choose the 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.459
 choose the towel she will use and she will not 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.709
 cut 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:38.450
 so here we have a nice towel 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:41.560
 with the bar showing but not 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.560
 cutter on top 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.560
 These were the tips today for you. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.939
 towels organized in the house 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.780
 of you and I hope you have 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.349
 liked 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.349
 to the next
