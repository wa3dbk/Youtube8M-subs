00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.000
 Why don't we start talking with your name? 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 47. 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.860
 It's not a name. 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.800
 No ... but my name. 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.520
 You're exactly what? 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.500
 An assassin. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.100
 And who did you come here to kill? 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.000
 You should really let me go. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.960
 You're the one who's locked in here, and I'm the guy with the gun. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.720
 No, Mr. Sanders. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.720
 You're locked in here with me. 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 And I just got out of here. 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.600
 What I'm going to say is, it sounds strange, because it is. 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.700
 It was transformed into a human being by engineers. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.100
 More strong. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.800
 Faster. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.200
 Smarter than normal people. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.200
 They're called agents. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.200
 What does all this have to do with me? 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.400
 Your father was the one who started the program. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 He knows their weaknesses. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 You're the key to finding your father. 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.400
