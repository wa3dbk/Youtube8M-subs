to be in the perfect spot at the right
moment<00:03:37.769> I<00:03:38.630> think<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:40.080> did<00:03:40.200> a<00:03:40.230> great<00:03:40.470> work

moment I think we we did a great work
and<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.820> end<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.060> worked<00:03:42.239> out<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.600> was

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
and in the end it worked out that I was

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.870 
and in the end it worked out that I was

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
in the perfect position and could do my

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.090 
in the perfect position and could do my
sprints<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.540> always<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> bit<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.500> relaxing

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
sprints and always a bit of a relaxing

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.770 
sprints and always a bit of a relaxing
moment<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.730> get<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:47.970> first<00:03:48.239> victory<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> the
