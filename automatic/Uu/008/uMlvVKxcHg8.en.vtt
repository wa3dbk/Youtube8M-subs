00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.259
 her have been made then you can 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.350
 their creed on assassin's own page 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.150
 make sense and have somehow 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.520
 Get Rated by people so halt 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.780
 player against player the one is nice 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.670
 further and there is still for each time 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.690

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.770

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290
 read through again if you want that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.050
 otherwise I would like a little bit more 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:43.019
 These watches show it is engraved 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.750
 is not so bad looks very stable 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.790
 It also makes a stable impression 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.440
 what I've always had is what it is 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.540
 just a bit nostalgic bit 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.480
 medieval he many women stand 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.400
 Of course not that, but no matter 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.410
 so it looks from the inside there you can 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.740
 stop picture eventually put it in 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.420
 This is a break that turns you on 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.120
 a certain time and you have to 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.360
 every day then do otherwise 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.070
 of course the power the energy is there 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.250
 is also a guide with it for 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:19.190
 people who are unfamiliar with it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.470
 otherwise it is not very nice 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.330
 bad, no battery needs the beautiful 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.680

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.150

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.440
 Of course he did not do anything later 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.880

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.130

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.540
 dirt bags is then bitched about 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.670
 Of course, this is how it looks like 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.670
 I can do it with one 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.460

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:56.180

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.700
