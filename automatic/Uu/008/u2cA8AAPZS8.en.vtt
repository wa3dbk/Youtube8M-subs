00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.389
 i study ancient orientalism because of me 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.480
 old languages ​​and rare languages ​​already 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.210
 always fascinated and I think so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.830
 quite exciting that one from so old 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.509
 still learn things 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 can and can read out the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.500
 funnily today still up-to-date 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.720
 and interesting and that I have the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.150
 People's problems is a 3,000 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.270
 4,000 years, sometimes not big 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.320
 have changed 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.150
 I am in favor of ancient Near Eastern Studies 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.140
 decided when I decided 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.880
 to cancel my first studies and me 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.830
 wanted to study what was me what me 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.570
 really fun and what makes me 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.700
 Interested where I with all my heart 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.410
 stand behind it and just have in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.270
 Studies catalog of the University of Leipzig 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.110
 looked what kind of study courses one 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.390
 can study 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.070
 who have to do with languages ​​and am 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.900
 simply hang in ancient orientalism 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.350
 stayed and informed me there 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.880
 on the website and then noticed 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.730
 that appeals to me a lot and that 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.030
 I would like to study that 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.920
 So the most important of all 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.470
 prerequisite is love to speak 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.410
 and the interest in talking 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 just need the willingness one 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.310
 new language to learn vocabulary too 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.810
 learn a scripture to learn one 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 needs the willingness to say 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.710
 I deal with it more than 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.780
 a week or two weeks but man 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.330
 it just has to stay on the ball because of it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.710
 it's not so easy to talk languages 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.600
 are like German or English especially since one 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:47.880
 in the Semitic languages, for example, a whole 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:50.700
 other system, it is important that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.980
 you look good in the specialist literature too 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.050
 right that means good english 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.760
 It is absolutely necessary that you 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.160
 Do not be afraid of books and 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.930
 reading literature in a foreign language 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.850
 language are written and otherwise 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.970
 just the patience to stay on the ball 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.070
 and to learn and all that then 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.090
 even if it happens 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.870
 thirsty trails where it possibly tips 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.330
 bit theoretically will exactly 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.530
 yes , my first impression of my studies 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.470
 I can not really care 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.599
 remember because it started just now 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.819
 with the language lessons and you had 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.170
 always so much to do that you do not 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.150
 thought big over it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.620
 just done so you do it 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.040
 homework it is similar in the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.680
 school 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.780
 one does not learn a language through two 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.760
 once a week lessons but 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.239
 by working according to the in residence in 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.640
 you prepare yourself for the next one 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.010
 hour vocabulary learns that's all right 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.180
 classic as you know it and stop 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.690
 in parallel one can say are the 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.459
 first two semesters basic studies 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.120
 basic study you learn an overview 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.709
 about the stories and cultures back then 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.750
 and then you just deepen it up 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 to the bachelor 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.069
 I did not expect that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.599
 the whole viennese school runs off i know 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.340
 not me I actually have 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.400
 thought when studying then studying 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.030
 man and in the end it is not like that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.330
 different 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.459
 I think the only thing that really matters 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.200
 different is that you are a lot self-determined 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.849
 you have to learn that yourself in the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
 butt and I have to say 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.769
 sit down and learn and even if 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.709
 no one is the whole controlled 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.080
 and what I did not expect 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.200
 is that we are such a small study course 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.940
 although that is to be expected because 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.239
 hardly anyone knows ancient Near Eastern Studies 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.920
 but you did not expect that 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.430
 still so well received in the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.989
 already established group in principle and 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.819
 that there is so much helpfulness 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.829
 even if you have to ask where you think oh 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.140
 that's very stupid because the others 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.110
 have been studying this for so long but it is 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.160
 really great how helpful people are 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.660
 are and that you are so good 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.890
 knows each other 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.560
 especially in the old tallis tick 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.020
 I like that we are a very small one 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.600
 institute we are very small 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.060
 learning groups and this is natural 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.010
 Immediately possible a very close contact 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.080
 to build up to the lecturers 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.110
 you know each other you have the 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:26.220
 possibility of flexible times 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.100
 shape or for example 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.290
 flexible dates to deny if 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.910
 you have other things to do that 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.890
 is quite cheap we have here in 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.070
 Leipzig has its own at our institute 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.840
 library which is absolutely necessary 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.270
 Of course, there's a lot to study with you 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.950
 books to do you have to film sets 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.450
 doing self-study and leipzig 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.320
 Of course, it's also great 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.140
 student city 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.370
 Apart from that, there is a lot of culture there 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:59.980
 that is very diverse yes the the 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.070
 Of course, campus is in the city center 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:06.220
 Absolutely well you represent it immediately 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:09.870
 in the middle of the center and I think that 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.420
 quite a topic these days as well 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.640
 Living expenses a big issue are Leipzig 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.250
 Of course, it's a big city and offers 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.080
 everything a big city needs 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.850
 Of course, in terms of price, it's a lot 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.020
 cheaper than if you are in Hamburg or 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.020
 would like to study in munich 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:30.389
 wrong ideas of 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.740
 Ancient Near Eastern Studies is always one 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.540
 bit difficult the bulk of the 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.430
 people do not know that is 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.300
 Ancient Near Eastern is let alone 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:41.970
 what we do the people they think 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:46.410
 know what we think about it 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.110
 are indiana jones and traveling on the 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.860
 search and dig out that is rarely so 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.139
 Of course we always plan that 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.060
 together with the archaeologists the 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.760
 then dig out all of us while we 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.830
 Of course this is not a question 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.940
 but not our main focus 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.780
 actually on the translation of the 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.010
 primary sources, that is the findings 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.560
 which are found 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:12.630
 we dedicate ourselves to that and try out the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.370
 The texts that we found there are in 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.720
 figure that out and then try it out 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.530
 the history and the culture too 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.530
 reconstruct 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.929
 the advice for freshmen it 's whole 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:29.459
 it is clear that to take this to heart 

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:32.759
 I really want to inform you 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.769
 say that there are many to read 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.279
 Studies lead where you can look 

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:40.349
 what in the different study subjects 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:41.729
 the topic is and what is offered there 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.529
 and what you have to bring 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.119
 there is the possibility with us for 

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.469
 For example, have a personal appointment 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:48.539
 to let give 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:50.819
 with our instructors and one 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.469
 I would do that 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:54.360
 necessarily if you say that one 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:56.610
 topic what interests me with languages 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.029
 or historically that one necessarily 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.529
 Look that's really the right one 

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:04.309
 Another advice is necessarily 

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:06.659
 Do not be discouraged because it is 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:08.399
 partly really difficult languages 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.110
 are or because the systems we are 

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:13.709
 you do not even know it 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.360
 stays and that you also help in 

00:07:13.709 --> 00:07:17.039
 claim takes if you ask that 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.860
 you just go to the lecturer and 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.860
 asks questions and helps oneself 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.700
 after the bachelor in the 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.820
 I would like to speak to all oriental people 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.650
 case the master make that belongs 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:34.350
 somehow to it 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:37.290
 and there is an old orientalism 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.800
 most jobs later at the uni 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:41.430
 So you stay in research and in 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.860
 the teaching 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:47.160
 so it is also very big topic that 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.960
 to give whole and of course 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.230
 I want to go there too, I want to 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.840
 like that things from antiquity 

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:56.490
 so know what's missing at the moment 

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.350
 because we are not there yet 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.790
 have discovered that passed on 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:08:03.140
 and that you can use that 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:03.140
 for the future
