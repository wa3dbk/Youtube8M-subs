easy<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.899> stack<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.760> I'm<00:00:56.760> almost<00:00:57.000> at<00:00:57.210> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
easy to stack so I'm almost at a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.569 
easy to stack so I'm almost at a
milestone<00:00:58.070> which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.250> reason<00:00:59.430> why<00:00:59.520> I'm

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
milestone which is the reason why I'm

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.860 
milestone which is the reason why I'm
making<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.850> video<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.660> five

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870

hundred dollars and face in US silver

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
hundred dollars and face in US silver
here<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.869> may<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> lower

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
here so we may just get like a lower

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.719 
here so we may just get like a lower
shot<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.490> these<00:01:08.670> are<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.450> halves<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.220> have<00:01:11.220> in<00:01:11.460> a

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
shot so these are the halves I have in a

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
shot so these are the halves I have in a
five<00:01:12.030> dollar<00:01:12.299> face<00:01:12.720> except<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.530> front

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
row just how it worked out so yeah each

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.219 
row just how it worked out so yeah each

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.310 
one of those is five dollar face and by
five<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.180> $25<00:01:24.180> face<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.689> each<00:01:24.780> one<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> those

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.730 

each<00:01:28.320> row<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:30.200> then<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.290> gonna<00:01:31.380> start<00:01:31.590> with

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
each row and then we're gonna start with

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.350 
each row and then we're gonna start with
the<00:01:31.890> quarters<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.950> then

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.040 

all<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.110> way<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.260> on<00:01:38.410> top<00:01:38.440> those<00:01:38.890> last<00:01:40.050> eight

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
all the way if on top those last eight

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.290 
all the way if on top those last eight
rows<00:01:41.350> those<00:01:41.680> are<00:01:41.830> 40%<00:01:43.170> Kennedy's<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.180> in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
rows those are 40% Kennedy's and then in

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.300 
rows those are 40% Kennedy's and then in
the<00:01:46.390> back<00:01:48.480> those<00:01:49.480> are<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.660> same<00:01:49.870> four<00:01:50.650> rows<00:01:50.920> of

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
the back those are the same four rows of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:58.650 
the back those are the same four rows of
a<00:01:51.460> 35%<00:01:54.030> silver<00:01:55.030> nickels<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.970> then<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.240> believe

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
a 35% silver nickels and then I believe

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:07.680 
a 35% silver nickels and then I believe
there's<00:01:58.840> 21<00:01:59.740> rolls<00:02:00.130> of<00:02:02.850> Roosevelt's<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:06.690> has

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
there's 21 rolls of Roosevelt's and has

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.590 
there's 21 rolls of Roosevelt's and has
like<00:02:07.810> 11<00:02:08.170> rolls<00:02:08.440> of<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:10.470> overhead<00:02:11.470> here

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
like 11 rolls of a overhead here

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.990 
like 11 rolls of a overhead here
Mercury's<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.739> back<00:02:18.040> row<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.580> just<00:02:18.610> sort

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
Mercury's and this back row is just sort

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.490 
Mercury's and this back row is just sort
of<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.410> mixture<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:21.300> barbers<00:02:22.500> Roosevelt's

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
of like a mixture of barbers Roosevelt's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.060 
of like a mixture of barbers Roosevelt's
and<00:02:24.340> Mercury's<00:02:24.910> just<00:02:25.150> what<00:02:25.450> didn't<00:02:25.750> make<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and Mercury's just what didn't make a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.760 
and Mercury's just what didn't make a
full<00:02:27.070> row<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:28.020> usually<00:02:29.020> click<00:02:29.140> overhead<00:02:29.620> of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
full row I usually click overhead of

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.540 
full row I usually click overhead of
that<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.880> then<00:02:34.239> just<00:02:34.630> some<00:02:35.370> probably<00:02:36.370> picked

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
that and then just some probably picked

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
that and then just some probably picked
it<00:02:36.670> up<00:02:36.730> on<00:02:36.880> eBay<00:02:36.940> some<00:02:38.310> sellers<00:02:39.310> just<00:02:39.450> sell<00:02:40.450> it

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
it up on eBay some sellers just sell it

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.070 
it up on eBay some sellers just sell it
in<00:02:40.630> these<00:02:40.720> cards<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.070> left<00:02:42.280> it<00:02:42.400> alone

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
in these cards and it's left it alone

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.870 
in these cards and it's left it alone
this<00:02:44.080> is<00:02:44.140> like<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> rare<00:02:44.620> date<00:02:44.860> whoops<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.670> was

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
this is like a rare date whoops this was

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.460 
this is like a rare date whoops this was
in<00:02:46.000> one<00:02:46.180> of<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.650> rows<00:02:47.650> it's<00:02:47.920> a<00:02:48.010> 21<00:02:49.320> picked<00:02:50.320> up

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
in one of the rows it's a 21 picked up
