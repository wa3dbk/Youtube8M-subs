00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.480
 helen ripley who is on board nostromo 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.820
 faced with strangers survived very few 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.789
 everyone who watched the movie was interested 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.920
 knew that ellen had a daughter but she 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.439
 never was what character 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.090
 stories and that's just now decided it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.810
 use as the main character 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.820
 new games we meet the mandu technique in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.279
 and you think for repairing some 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.920
 devices one of androids say 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.290
 that after 15 years of searching were found 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.680
 clues on the disappearance case on the stroma and 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.930
 the very fish ship thorens are ready 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.350
 deliver amanda to sevastopol station 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.239
 where she finally get my answers 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.489
 it is at this moment that begins and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.840
 guilt for lei shi 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.210
 the developers did not during the break 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 come up with a story and invited for 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.100
 this one is some very good authors 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.710
 example of the main arose is never 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 by 1 author of a huge number of comics 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.990
 including the best aryk terrible cases 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 made really interesting 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.430
 the story is largely due to her freud 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 perceived not just as usual 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 the game is rather full 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.140
 interactive offer great 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.240
 film isolation game really 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.000
 scary places even worse for example 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.729
 outlast but if outlast 2 has a lot of blood 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.619
 7 100 bones and even more saying for 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.780
 angle and harsh sounds then in or nsarray 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.180
 tire developers are so easy ways 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 atmospheric discharge is used very 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.509
 seldom 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 instead used to satisfied 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.270
 exotic reception for example in particular 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.550
 tense moments we hear how 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.369
 pounding the heart of the protagonist is changing 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.830
 music hair starts to tremble and so do we 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.530
 together with him personally and fear loading 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.990
 lights flashing light the next room 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.649
 and gnash like types of taube end skills 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 the corridor 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.630
 believe me scare much more than 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.850
 image unnecessarily pc field game 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.429
 captures you with its atmosphere and not 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.470
 lets go until the final captions she 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.479
 slowly accelerates and you are no longer 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.790
 have time to wake up as you find yourself on 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.250
 them down the whole space station on 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.650
 which the most catastrophe occurred 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.690
 important that the work of others about what we have promised 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.329
 developers are not somehow 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.670
 the main opponent, he rather stands 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.980
 as main 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.110
 force majeure movement which 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.300
 you can not just take and kill and maybe not 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.310
 run off risk some ways and be deceived 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.040
 I would like to note that for the first time 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.720
 does not appear immediately at the beginning of the game as 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.880
 it would be in some action 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.260
 and on the second feeling of passing we are only 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.650
 caught a glimpse 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.959
 first time the main opponents are people 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.970
 survivors at the station and trying by all 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.400
 forces somehow live another day at 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.530
 They have no hope of salvation right now, they have 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.239
 what do you think we don't understand than 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.340
 faced and how to deal with it 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.709
 appearance same at the station of amanda they 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.690
 perceive ambiguously someone is ready 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.150
 eliminate it immediately then can become 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.340
 our ally in the general atmosphere of their 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.440
 faces tense and nickname around 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.830
 alien and somehow contributes to 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.900
 jerusalem the most important thing in this game then 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.760
 that we don't get to the point where 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.360
 you can shoot Chizhov under fun 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 music 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.220
 Yes, we have weapons including 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.830
 flamethrower need to understand that our opponent 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.380
 not very afraid of people their weapons and he 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.109
 himself is capable of 2 head to anyone by one 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.209
 movement so far we are opposed 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.459
 people can and survive the shootout and 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.350
 someone else has a head cop 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.390
 when we merge in the same room with 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.820
 price morph then you need to sit under the table 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.730
 want your head with your hands and hope that you 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:43.670
 will not be found a special highlight 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.530
 adding something besides plot points 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 when we encounter someone else's command 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.910
 screenwriter there is another option random 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.430
 meetings in the most unexpected places so 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.100
 what if we pick out the door 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.650
 immediately after saving and nose up in 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.420
 a foreign carcass in the corridor is not a fact that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.540
 next time everything happens just like that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.310
 for example, it may or may not 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.620
 be near or he will wait for us 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.079
 another room and maybe do everything 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.500
 fenil ventilation due to this account 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.780
 simply 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.580
 when sneaking down the hall look 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.040
 the tasks of motion and here it is unexpected 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.780
 one of the trees opens up behind you 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.840
 another space is a stranger's figure 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.940
 You can and mouse in the monitor throw gameplay 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.050
 based on searching for items to solve 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.180
 different puzzles 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.910
 we walk around the station looking for different 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.100
 ownerless things of which, by the way, you can 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.889
 painting is not useful and breaking locks 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.900
 we can read their letters 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.030
 hints and access codes for the panel 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.300
 you need to really read the text to 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.910
 don't miss anything important communicate 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.130
 we hide and occasionally use weapons though 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.200
 most often we use the surrounding 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.050
 situation to bring down the enemy with 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.330
 sense and distract from yourself for example shine 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.910
 flashlight in one place can translate 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.250
 all hostile attention on this point and by 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:01.320
 crawl to the other end of the room and there 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.840
 already use the panel to de-energize 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.360
 the main body to the negative plot 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.460
 parts of the game can be attributed perhaps its 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.780
 the duration of the passage will go 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.780
 about 15 hours 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.740
 if not much distracted on display 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.260
 attractions and not hold 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.810
 all this time in the locker but agree 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.330
 and this is quite graphic all 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.070
 done very cool artists 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.560
 managed to create that very atmosphere 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.050
 films which now looks a bit 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.030
 archaic even consoles to save 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.460
 the form on the video apparatus on reception 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.990
 some punch cards graphics on monitors 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.060
 horrible pins curves 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.260
 It seemed suddenly to find yourself on 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.169
 80s movie 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.860
 at the same time the level of graphics is completely 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.229
 modern 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.360
 with honors character models facial 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.370
 animations with quality textures and 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.560
 very subject to applied asses 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.900
 filter making the picture as if you were 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.240
 see the film there are a number of claims to 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.169
 animating people in the game but hand on 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.400
 heart and look at these animations rarely 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.070
 recommend project ellen and lie down on 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:04.260
 one and all I will not take but those who 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.110
 wants a good horror movie in the universe 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.210
 strangers as well as those who are bored 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.789
 don't pass by this 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.160
 fans of the action and fun the krovische 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.310
 there is simply nothing to do this project I 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:18.910
 hoped for 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.410
 them all with you was glen if you
