a beautiful dress and a nice Orchestra
do<00:01:43.880> you<00:01:43.970> think<00:01:44.180> that<00:01:44.329> time<00:01:44.509> was<00:01:44.720> better<00:01:44.930> before

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
do you think that time was better before

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.240 
do you think that time was better before
or<00:01:46.159> now<00:01:46.420> well<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.450> love<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.990> idea<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.409> making<00:01:48.950> it

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
or now well I love the idea of making it

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.490 
or now well I love the idea of making it
huge<00:01:49.579> and<00:01:49.909> having<00:01:50.180> two<00:01:50.390> semi-finals<00:01:51.170> that's<00:01:51.439> a

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
huge and having two semi-finals that's a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.359 
huge and having two semi-finals that's a
wonderful<00:01:51.829> idea

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
wonderful idea

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.690 
wonderful idea
but<00:01:53.119> I<00:01:53.390> would<00:01:53.990> love<00:01:54.290> the<00:01:54.649> orchestra<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.399> come

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
but I would love the orchestra to come

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.170 
but I would love the orchestra to come
back

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
back

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.789 
back
that's<00:01:56.390> another<00:01:56.719> feeling<00:01:56.990> if<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.380> hear<00:01:57.530> live

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
that's another feeling if you hear live

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.280 
that's another feeling if you hear live
music<00:01:57.829> it's<00:01:58.759> better<00:01:59.030> than<00:01:59.210> music<00:01:59.600> on<00:01:59.750> tape<00:01:59.990> so

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
music it's better than music on tape so

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.080 
music it's better than music on tape so
that<00:02:00.799> would<00:02:00.950> be<00:02:01.070> a<00:02:01.100> good<00:02:01.250> idea<00:02:01.399> but<00:02:01.729> it's<00:02:01.850> very

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
that would be a good idea but it's very
