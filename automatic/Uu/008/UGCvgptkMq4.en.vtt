00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
the eye line and that's represented by

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.889 
the eye line and that's represented by
this<00:00:48.159> dotted<00:00:48.609> line<00:00:48.789> that<00:00:49.179> you<00:00:49.210> see<00:00:49.269> going<00:00:49.479> from

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
this dotted line that you see going from

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.669 
this dotted line that you see going from
Fred<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.440> Julie<00:00:50.800> or<00:00:51.579> journey<00:00:51.969> to<00:00:52.089> Fred<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.679> the

Fred to Julie or journey to Fred and the

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.849 
Fred to Julie or journey to Fred and the
eye<00:00:54.460> line<00:00:54.879> is<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> direction<00:00:55.719> of<00:00:56.050> your

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:56.859 
eye line is the direction of your

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:59.939 
eye line is the direction of your
subjects<00:00:57.519> eyes<00:00:57.729> so<00:00:58.690> whatever<00:00:59.469> way<00:00:59.739> they're

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
subjects eyes so whatever way they're

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.860 
subjects eyes so whatever way they're
looking<00:01:00.309> that's<00:01:00.489> their<00:01:00.760> eyeline<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
looking that's their eyeline and of

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.270 
looking that's their eyeline and of
course<00:01:01.929> they're<00:01:02.289> looking<00:01:02.589> directly<00:01:02.799> at<00:01:03.069> each

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
course they're looking directly at each

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.039 
course they're looking directly at each
other<00:01:03.519> that's<00:01:04.150> why<00:01:04.299> we<00:01:04.420> have<00:01:04.540> a<00:01:04.570> straight<00:01:04.870> line

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
other that's why we have a straight line

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.920 
other that's why we have a straight line
across<00:01:05.500> here<00:01:06.330> now<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.390> may<00:01:07.660> have<00:01:07.780> heard

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
across here now you may have heard

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.990 
across here now you may have heard
people<00:01:08.200> say<00:01:08.560> this<00:01:08.740> before<00:01:08.890> don't<00:01:09.430> cross<00:01:09.790> the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
people say this before don't cross the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.270 
people say this before don't cross the
line<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.650> haven't<00:01:11.890> heard<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.250> before

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
line and if you haven't heard it before

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.030 
line and if you haven't heard it before
it<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.790> it's<00:01:13.750> definitely<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.320> fundamental

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
it is it's definitely a fundamental

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.440 
it is it's definitely a fundamental
filmmaking<00:01:15.550> it<00:01:15.760> doesn't<00:01:16.120> just<00:01:16.180> apply<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
filmmaking it doesn't just apply to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.250 
filmmaking it doesn't just apply to
interviews<00:01:19.450> it's<00:01:19.720> when<00:01:19.960> you're<00:01:20.080> filming

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
drama and things like that so it's

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.280 
drama and things like that so it's
definitely<00:01:22.270> important<00:01:22.660> that<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.900> get<00:01:23.110> this

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
and I'll try my best to explain it we

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.390 
and I'll try my best to explain it we
want<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.410> make<00:01:26.470> sure<00:01:26.560> that<00:01:26.920> all<00:01:27.100> of<00:01:27.160> our

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
want to make sure that all of our

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.720 
want to make sure that all of our
cameras<00:01:27.880> camera<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.480> B<00:01:28.900> and<00:01:29.110> C<00:01:29.200> or<00:01:29.800> on<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> same

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
cameras camera a B and C or on the same

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.260 
cameras camera a B and C or on the same
side<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.480> line<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.740> if<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.280> had<00:01:33.490> Fred's

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
side of that line so if we had Fred's

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.510 
side of that line so if we had Fred's
camera<00:01:34.720> which<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.170> kind<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.440> see<00:01:35.620> here<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
camera which is kind of see here on the

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.250 
camera which is kind of see here on the
opposite<00:01:36.970> side<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.210> the<00:01:37.390> line<00:01:37.540> which<00:01:37.960> would<00:01:38.170> be

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
opposite side of the line which would be

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.640 
opposite side of the line which would be
over<00:01:38.500> here<00:01:38.760> when<00:01:39.760> we<00:01:39.850> come<00:01:40.030> to<00:01:40.150> edit<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
over here when we come to edit that it's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.110 
over here when we come to edit that it's
going<00:01:41.800> to<00:01:41.860> look<00:01:42.010> very<00:01:42.040> strange<00:01:42.580> is<00:01:42.790> not<00:01:43.000> going

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
going to look very strange is not going

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.090 
going to look very strange is not going

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
to look natural it's not going to look

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.070 
to look natural it's not going to look

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.840 
like he's looking at her it's almost
going<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.350> look<00:01:47.530> like<00:01:47.560> they<00:01:48.310> could<00:01:48.370> be<00:01:48.580> sitting

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
going to look like they could be sitting

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to look like they could be sitting
next<00:01:49.180> to<00:01:49.420> each<00:01:49.540> other<00:01:49.720> talking<00:01:50.650> to<00:01:50.770> someone<00:01:51.040> on

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
next to each other talking to someone on

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.060 
next to each other talking to someone on
the<00:01:51.340> other<00:01:51.460> side<00:01:51.670> of<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.060> room<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.800> very

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
the other side of the room so it's very

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.470 
the other side of the room so it's very
important<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.790> make<00:01:54.970> sure<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.390> all

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
important that you make sure that all

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.810 
important that you make sure that all
your<00:01:55.750> cameras<00:01:56.230> are<00:01:56.440> all<00:01:56.680> on<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.890> same<00:01:57.220> side<00:01:57.280> of

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
your cameras are all on the same side of

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.870 
your cameras are all on the same side of
the<00:01:57.910> two<00:01:58.660> peoples<00:01:59.020> eye<00:01:59.200> lines<00:01:59.470> make<00:02:00.430> sure<00:02:00.460> your

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
the two peoples eye lines make sure your

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.000 
the two peoples eye lines make sure your
subjects<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.480> lines<00:02:01.900> are<00:02:02.200> level<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
subjects I lines are level and the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.220 
subjects I lines are level and the
cameras<00:02:03.460> are<00:02:03.640> the<00:02:03.730> same<00:02:03.970> height<00:02:04.270> this<00:02:05.080> is

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
cameras are the same height this is

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.089 
cameras are the same height this is
quite<00:02:05.380> simple<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:07.000> don't<00:02:07.240> want<00:02:07.450> Fred<00:02:07.990> to<00:02:08.099> be

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
quite simple you don't want Fred to be

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.360 
quite simple you don't want Fred to be
higher<00:02:09.459> than<00:02:09.879> Julie<00:02:10.710> so<00:02:11.710> Julie<00:02:12.160> will<00:02:12.280> be

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
higher than Julie so Julie will be

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.530 
higher than Julie so Julie will be
looking<00:02:12.490> up<00:02:12.730> at<00:02:12.880> friend<00:02:13.150> and<00:02:13.300> he'll<00:02:13.450> be

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
looking up at friend and he'll be

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.210 
looking up at friend and he'll be
looking<00:02:13.660> down<00:02:14.020> at<00:02:14.170> her<00:02:14.319> it's<00:02:14.860> not<00:02:15.010> going<00:02:15.130> to

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
looking down at her it's not going to

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.620 
looking down at her it's not going to
look<00:02:15.310> too<00:02:15.520> great<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:15.850> I'd

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
look too great so I'd

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.050 
look too great so I'd
I mean<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.230> measure<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.830> the

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
I mean you have to measure it to the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.670 
I mean you have to measure it to the
centimeter<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.660> inch<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.140> mean<00:02:20.650> just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
centimeter to the inch I mean just

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.080 
centimeter to the inch I mean just
roughly<00:02:21.280> make<00:02:21.580> sure<00:02:21.730> they're<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> same

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
roughly make sure they're the same

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.640 
roughly make sure they're the same
height<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:22.690> they're<00:02:22.810> not<00:02:22.900> looking<00:02:23.170> up<00:02:23.320> or<00:02:23.470> down

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
height so they're not looking up or down

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.460 
height so they're not looking up or down
they're<00:02:23.950> just<00:02:23.980> looking<00:02:24.250> straight<00:02:25.030> ahead<00:02:25.470> now

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
they're just looking straight ahead now

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.050 
they're just looking straight ahead now
in<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> same<00:02:27.040> way<00:02:27.220> we<00:02:27.370> want<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.610> cameras<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
in the same way we want the cameras to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.580 
in the same way we want the cameras to
be<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.450> same<00:02:28.720> height<00:02:29.140> as<00:02:30.030> their<00:02:31.030> eyeline<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
be the same height as their eyeline so

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.810 
be the same height as their eyeline so
we<00:02:32.830> don't<00:02:33.010> want<00:02:33.130> our<00:02:33.190> cameras<00:02:33.640> will<00:02:33.730> be

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
we don't want our cameras will be

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.670 
we don't want our cameras will be
pointing<00:02:34.210> up<00:02:34.330> at<00:02:34.480> Fred<00:02:34.720> or<00:02:34.930> pointing<00:02:35.440> down<00:02:35.650> at

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
pointing up at Fred or pointing down at

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.640 
pointing up at Fred or pointing down at
Julie<00:02:36.190> then<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.630> looks<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.020> lot<00:02:38.290> better<00:02:38.500> a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
Julie then it just looks a lot better a

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.220 
Julie then it just looks a lot better a
lot<00:02:38.710> look<00:02:38.980> more<00:02:39.100> natural<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.050> it's<00:02:41.050> a<00:02:41.110> lot

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
lot look more natural and it's a lot

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.800 
lot look more natural and it's a lot
easier<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.770> watch<00:02:42.150> ok<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.210> frame<00:02:43.600> your<00:02:43.780> subject

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
easier to watch ok so frame your subject

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.930 
easier to watch ok so frame your subject
either<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> left<00:02:44.830> or<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> right<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
either on the left or the right of the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940 
either on the left or the right of the
frame<00:02:46.150> to<00:02:46.300> give<00:02:46.540> them<00:02:46.720> looking<00:02:46.900> room<00:02:47.170> your

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
frame to give them looking room your

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.680 
frame to give them looking room your
subjects<00:02:48.400> are<00:02:48.580> line<00:02:48.820> will<00:02:49.120> go<00:02:49.240> into<00:02:49.510> their

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
subjects are line will go into their

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.080 
subjects are line will go into their
living<00:02:49.960> room<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:50.950> this<00:02:51.100> is<00:02:51.130> he<00:02:51.250> here<00:02:51.460> I've<00:02:51.640> got

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
living room so this is he here I've got

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.970 
living room so this is he here I've got
this<00:02:52.240> image<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:52.990> it<00:02:53.080> says<00:02:53.200> interviewer<00:02:53.800> and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
this image and it says interviewer and

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.490 
this image and it says interviewer and
it<00:02:54.100> says<00:02:54.250> looking<00:02:54.670> room<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.260> mean<00:02:56.260> that's

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
it says looking room I mean that's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.410 
it says looking room I mean that's
pretty<00:02:57.160> straightforward<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:58.270> of<00:02:58.390> course

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
pretty straightforward now of course

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.120 
pretty straightforward now of course
this<00:02:58.810> image<00:02:59.140> on<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.380> right<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.740> can<00:02:59.920> see<00:02:59.950> that

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
this image on the right you can see that

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.380 
this image on the right you can see that
I've<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.550> literally<00:03:00.940> flipped<00:03:01.270> it

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
I've just literally flipped it

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.180 
I've just literally flipped it
horizontally<00:03:02.110> it's<00:03:02.560> why<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.740> writings

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
horizontally it's why the writings

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.440 
horizontally it's why the writings
backwards<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.790> are<00:03:03.940> just<00:03:04.150> trying<00:03:04.360> to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
backwards but are just trying to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.960 
backwards but are just trying to
illustrate<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.530> point<00:03:05.590> here<00:03:06.040> let's<00:03:06.670> say<00:03:06.820> this

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
illustrate a point here let's say this

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270 
illustrate a point here let's say this
is<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.180> interviewer<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.080> this<00:03:08.890> guy<00:03:09.070> on<00:03:09.190> the

is the interviewer and this guy on the
right<00:03:09.400> is<00:03:09.460> his<00:03:09.760> twin<00:03:10.060> brother<00:03:10.300> he<00:03:10.810> looks

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
right is his twin brother he looks

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.510 
right is his twin brother he looks
exactly<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.440> same<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.190> guy<00:03:12.310> who's

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
exactly the same this is the guy who's

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.580 
exactly the same this is the guy who's
actually<00:03:12.670> interviewing<00:03:13.330> him<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:14.380> what

actually interviewing him this is what

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.400 
actually interviewing him this is what
your<00:03:14.800> two<00:03:15.070> different<00:03:15.490> shots<00:03:15.730> would<00:03:15.910> look<00:03:16.120> like

one will be on the left hand side of the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.460 
one will be on the left hand side of the
frame<00:03:18.730> looking<00:03:19.540> into<00:03:19.930> their<00:03:20.050> looking<00:03:20.350> room
