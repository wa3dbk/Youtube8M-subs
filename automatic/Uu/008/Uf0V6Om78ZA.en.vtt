all<00:00:08.190> right<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:08.640> doing<00:00:08.880> this<00:00:09.059> brief<00:00:09.840> video

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
all right we're doing this brief video

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.640 
all right we're doing this brief video
here<00:00:10.860> for<00:00:11.389> John<00:00:12.389> who<00:00:12.660> had<00:00:12.930> a<00:00:12.959> question

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
here for John who had a question

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.540 
here for John who had a question
regarding<00:00:13.680> the<00:00:14.309> wiring<00:00:14.879> on<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:16.020> Duramax<00:00:16.590> XP

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
regarding the wiring on the Duramax XP

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.480 
regarding the wiring on the Duramax XP
10,000<00:00:18.539> he<00:00:18.630> generator<00:00:19.200> so<00:00:20.160> what<00:00:20.280> I'm<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
10,000 he generator so what I'm going to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.860 
10,000 he generator so what I'm going to
do<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.850> going<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.120> a<00:00:21.150> close<00:00:21.510> up<00:00:21.840> here

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:21.870 
do is I'm going to get a close up here

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.200 
do is I'm going to get a close up here
so<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.440> can<00:00:22.590> hopefully<00:00:22.880> answer<00:00:23.880> John's

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
so we can hopefully answer John's

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.380 
so we can hopefully answer John's
question<00:00:24.570> regarding<00:00:25.820> where<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.940> white<00:00:27.120> wire

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
question regarding where the white wire

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.960 
question regarding where the white wire
is<00:00:27.420> actually<00:00:28.140> connected<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.760> so<00:00:29.760> I'm<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.940> to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
is actually connected to so I'm going to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.190 
is actually connected to so I'm going to
go<00:00:30.090> ahead<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.420> pan<00:00:30.660> around<00:00:30.690> over<00:00:31.290> here<00:00:33.200> we're

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
go ahead and pan around over here we're

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.440 
go ahead and pan around over here we're
gonna<00:00:34.320> look<00:00:34.410> over<00:00:34.950> here<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.790> see<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.210> can't

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
gonna look over here and see if I can't

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.360 
gonna look over here and see if I can't
get<00:00:38.510> farther<00:00:39.510> down<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.379> I've<00:00:41.190> got<00:00:41.339> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
get farther down in here I've got a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.919 
get farther down in here I've got a
trouble<00:00:41.850> light<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:42.359> so<00:00:42.539> we<00:00:42.629> can<00:00:42.780> hopefully

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:42.929 
trouble light here so we can hopefully

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:46.340 
trouble light here so we can hopefully
light<00:00:43.350> things<00:00:43.679> up<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.039> little<00:00:44.100> bit<00:00:45.350> really

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
light things up a little bit really

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.430 
light things up a little bit really
don't<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:47.179> too<00:00:48.179> much<00:00:48.359> wiring<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.109> because

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
don't see too much wiring and because

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.040 
don't see too much wiring and because
it's<00:00:49.620> covered<00:00:49.890> by<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.219> shielding<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.780> over

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
it's covered by the shielding right over

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.779 
it's covered by the shielding right over
here<00:00:53.870> see<00:00:54.870> ya

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
here see ya

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.680 
here see ya
probably<00:00:56.789> get<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.969> better<00:00:57.239> angle<00:00:57.600> over<00:00:58.019> here

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
probably get a better angle over here

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.490 
probably get a better angle over here
and<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.780> can<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> look<00:01:02.749> inside<00:01:03.749> here<00:01:04.290> we

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and we can take a look inside here we

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.969 
and we can take a look inside here we
can<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.370> wiring<00:01:05.790> back<00:01:06.000> there

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
can see some of the wiring back there

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
can see some of the wiring back there
that's<00:01:07.979> not<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> white<00:01:08.520> wire<00:01:08.790> though<00:01:09.119> that's<00:01:09.329> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
that's not a white wire though that's a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.319 
that's not a white wire though that's a
black<00:01:09.719> wire<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> we're<00:01:11.579> looking<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.090> white

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:12.329 
black wire so we're looking for a white

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:25.490 
black wire so we're looking for a white
wire<00:01:13.520> my<00:01:14.520> guess<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.950> some<00:01:16.950> sort<00:01:17.219> of<00:01:17.280> ground<00:01:24.500> or

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
wire my guess is some sort of ground or

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
wire my guess is some sort of ground or
possibly<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> starter<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.759> we<00:01:29.939> see<00:01:30.149> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
possibly for the starter and we see the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.260 
possibly for the starter and we see the
white<00:01:30.479> wire<00:01:30.719> over<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.850> we'll<00:01:33.030> take<00:01:33.060> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
white wire over here and we'll take a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.569 
white wire over here and we'll take a
look<00:01:33.539> at<00:01:33.659> this<00:01:33.899> let<00:01:34.649> me<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.039> situated

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
look at this let me get this situated

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.649 
look at this let me get this situated
here<00:01:36.680> take<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.710> look<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.250> 16<00:01:39.149> horsepower

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
here take a look there 16 horsepower

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.690 
here take a look there 16 horsepower
engine<00:01:42.350> find<00:01:43.350> somewhere<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> clip<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.430> Sun

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
engine find somewhere to clip to the Sun

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.080 
engine find somewhere to clip to the Sun
-<00:01:47.299> yeah<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.109> find<00:01:49.409> anything

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
- yeah I'm not gonna find anything

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.789 
- yeah I'm not gonna find anything
anyway<00:01:51.090> we<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.420> take<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> look<00:01:51.929> here<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.590> white

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
anyway we can take a look here the white

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:01.069 
anyway we can take a look here the white
wire<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.340> coming<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.829> right<00:01:58.829> here<00:02:00.079> and

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
wire and it's coming up right here and

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.999 
wire and it's coming up right here and
that<00:02:01.619> white<00:02:01.920> wire<00:02:02.390> goes<00:02:03.390> into<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.869> transfer<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
that white wire goes into a transfer and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.350 
that white wire goes into a transfer and
then<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.579> goes<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.179> main<00:02:06.420> wiring<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:09.330> I

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
then it goes into the main wiring so I

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.900 
then it goes into the main wiring so I
don't<00:02:09.630> know<00:02:09.780> if<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.990> can<00:02:10.050> actually<00:02:10.520> answer<00:02:11.520> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
don't know if I can actually answer that

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.970 
don't know if I can actually answer that
question<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.629> don't<00:02:12.810> see<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.440> into<00:02:13.860> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
question I don't see it going into the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.370 
question I don't see it going into the
battery<00:02:15.050> what

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
battery what

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.380 
battery what
but<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.100> can<00:02:17.250> recall<00:02:17.580> when<00:02:17.820> I<00:02:17.880> did<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> wiring

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
but I can recall when I did the wiring

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.430 
but I can recall when I did the wiring
on<00:02:18.780> it<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:20.010> white<00:02:20.300> wire<00:02:21.300> did<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.870> go<00:02:22.050> into<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
on it the white wire did not go into the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.220 
on it the white wire did not go into the
battery<00:02:22.830> but<00:02:23.700> it's<00:02:23.880> possible<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.540> it's<00:02:24.840> just

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
battery but it's possible that it's just

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.570 
battery but it's possible that it's just
tied<00:02:25.590> off<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:26.070> here

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
tied off in here

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.280 
tied off in here
and<00:02:26.670> maybe<00:02:27.030> they<00:02:27.180> switched<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.840> design

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
and maybe they switched the design

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.210 
and maybe they switched the design
slightly<00:02:29.960> but<00:02:30.960> many<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.350> them<00:02:31.500> that's<00:02:32.070> a

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
slightly but many of them that's a

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.010 
slightly but many of them that's a
closer<00:02:32.430> look<00:02:32.790> at<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> wiring<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:33.930> you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
closer look at the wiring here for you

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.470 
closer look at the wiring here for you
John<00:02:34.820> hopefully<00:02:35.820> this<00:02:36.030> answers<00:02:36.210> some

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
John hopefully this answers some

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
John hopefully this answers some
questions<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:37.980> compare<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
questions for you you can compare to

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.500 
questions for you you can compare to
your<00:02:38.880> unit

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
your unit

it<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.610> because<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.090> was<00:03:06.210> leaking

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
it out because it was leaking

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.550 
it out because it was leaking

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.300 
the white wire goes it looks like it
ties<00:03:41.250> off<00:03:41.610> into<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> splitter<00:03:42.980> and<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.130> goes

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
ties off into a splitter and it goes

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.760 
ties off into a splitter and it goes
into<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.730> main<00:03:44.970> harness<00:03:45.330> there<00:03:45.780> but<00:03:46.050> no<00:03:46.560> I<00:03:46.590> do
