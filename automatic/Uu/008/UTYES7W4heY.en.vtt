in<00:00:09.260> this<00:00:09.860> class<00:00:10.130> we're<00:00:10.370> going<00:00:10.460> to<00:00:10.520> take<00:00:10.730> the

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
in this class we're going to take the

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.340 
in this class we're going to take the
top<00:00:11.060> of<00:00:11.090> the<00:00:11.300> newel<00:00:11.540> post<00:00:11.810> that<00:00:12.050> we<00:00:12.140> just

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:12.350 
top of the newel post that we just

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.650 
top of the newel post that we just
machined<00:00:12.800> and<00:00:13.040> we're<00:00:13.940> going<00:00:14.090> to<00:00:14.150> add<00:00:14.330> some

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
machined and we're going to add some

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.870 
machined and we're going to add some
carving<00:00:15.139> onto<00:00:15.350> three<00:00:15.590> of<00:00:15.680> the<00:00:15.740> faces<00:00:16.220> and<00:00:16.400> then

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
carving onto three of the faces and then

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.190 
carving onto three of the faces and then
we're<00:00:16.970> going<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.150> do<00:00:17.240> a<00:00:17.270> dry<00:00:17.570> fit<00:00:17.810> to<00:00:17.960> make<00:00:18.050> sure

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
we're going to do a dry fit to make sure

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.650 
we're going to do a dry fit to make sure
everything<00:00:18.470> goes<00:00:18.650> together<00:00:18.800> correctly

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.169 

the<00:00:25.199> first<00:00:25.439> step<00:00:25.679> is<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.009> remove<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.580> waste<00:00:26.880> as

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
the first step is to remove or waste as

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.439 
the first step is to remove or waste as
much<00:00:27.390> material<00:00:27.960> as<00:00:28.079> quickly<00:00:28.439> as<00:00:28.650> possible

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
much material as quickly as possible

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.790 
much material as quickly as possible
obviously<00:00:30.449> there's<00:00:31.169> a<00:00:31.259> trade-off<00:00:31.619> between

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
obviously there's a trade-off between

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.110 
obviously there's a trade-off between
machine<00:00:32.640> time<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> creating<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> details<00:00:34.470> a

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
machine time and creating the details a

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.210 
machine time and creating the details a
roughing<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.600> large<00:00:36.960> diameter<00:00:37.350> who

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
roughing bit with a large diameter who

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.670 
roughing bit with a large diameter who
wastes<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> material<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.120> quickly<00:00:39.680> however

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
wastes the material very quickly however

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
wastes the material very quickly however
the<00:00:41.010> large<00:00:41.220> radius<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.970> the<00:00:42.059> bit<00:00:42.269> will<00:00:42.570> not<00:00:42.809> be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the large radius of the bit will not be

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.649 
the large radius of the bit will not be
able<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.350> mill<00:00:43.530> into<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> tight<00:00:44.100> corners

leaving more material for the finish pad

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.119 
leaving more material for the finish pad
we<00:00:48.720> chose<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.170> use<00:00:49.199> a<00:00:49.320> quarter<00:00:49.739> inch<00:00:49.920> diameter

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
we chose to use a quarter inch diameter

diameter<00:03:42.480> round<00:03:42.780> mortise<00:03:43.349> so<00:03:43.980> we<00:03:44.129> can<00:03:44.280> take

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
diameter round mortise so we can take

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.979 
diameter round mortise so we can take
the<00:03:44.670> insert<00:03:45.060> piece<00:03:45.359> that<00:03:45.599> has<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.750> round

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
the insert piece that has the round

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.009 
the insert piece that has the round
tenon<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:47.209> insert<00:03:48.209> it<00:03:48.329> into<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.599> base<00:03:48.810> to

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
tenon and insert it into the base to

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.160 
tenon and insert it into the base to
begin<00:03:49.290> with<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.739> so<00:03:50.569> and<00:03:51.569> then<00:03:51.810> we'll<00:03:51.959> drop

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
begin with like so and then we'll drop

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.860 
begin with like so and then we'll drop
the<00:03:52.230> hollow<00:03:52.560> spiral<00:03:53.220> piece<00:03:53.849> over<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.420> top<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
the hollow spiral piece over the top and

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.110 
the hollow spiral piece over the top and
now<00:04:01.549> this<00:04:02.549> goes<00:04:02.849> on<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.150> top<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:05.120> looks

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
now this goes on the top like so looks

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.819 
now this goes on the top like so looks
like<00:04:06.269> everything<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.660> coming<00:04:07.290> together<00:04:07.410> quite

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
nicely we're ready to turn the round

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.130 
nicely we're ready to turn the round
finial<00:04:10.139> for<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.349> top<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.769> we'll<00:04:10.859> be<00:04:10.980> finished
