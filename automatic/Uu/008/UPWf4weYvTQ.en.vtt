00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
black and the tan use their high temp

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.910 
black and the tan use their high temp
silicone<00:00:43.360> coating<00:00:43.720> just<00:00:44.260> help<00:00:44.470> seal<00:00:44.740> it<00:00:44.890> and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
silicone coating just help seal it and

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.710 
silicone coating just help seal it and
protect<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.520> little<00:00:45.640> bit<00:00:45.850> more<00:00:46.060> it's<00:00:46.570> not

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
protect it a little bit more it's not

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.690 
protect it a little bit more it's not
required<00:00:47.110> with<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.440> titanium<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.160> titanium

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.700 
required with the titanium the titanium

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.030 
required with the titanium the titanium
is<00:00:48.880> like<00:00:49.540> I<00:00:49.630> said<00:00:49.840> good<00:00:50.110> up<00:00:50.260> to<00:00:50.380> 1800<00:00:50.920> degrees

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
is like I said good up to 1800 degrees

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.920 
is like I said good up to 1800 degrees
so<00:00:51.280> it's<00:00:51.430> a<00:00:51.460> little<00:00:51.640> stronger<00:00:52.120> as<00:00:52.270> far<00:00:52.660> as<00:00:52.780> heat

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
so it's a little stronger as far as heat

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.960 
so it's a little stronger as far as heat
resistance<00:00:53.440> it's<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.250> little<00:00:54.430> more<00:00:54.489> flexible

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
resistance it's a little more flexible

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.000 
resistance it's a little more flexible
easier<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.480> put<00:00:55.660> on<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.350> really<00:00:56.590> has<00:00:56.829> that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
easier to put on and really has that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.920 
easier to put on and really has that
really<00:00:57.160> cool<00:00:57.399> carbon<00:00:57.790> fiber<00:00:58.030> look<00:00:58.329> to<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.630> now

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
really cool carbon fiber look to it now

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.510 
really cool carbon fiber look to it now
when<00:00:59.110> finishing<00:00:59.440> off<00:00:59.620> any<00:00:59.829> head<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.070> wrap<00:01:00.340> but
