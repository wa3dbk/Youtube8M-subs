little thing NASA circle and this and

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.100 
little thing NASA circle and this and
then<00:03:21.010> let's<00:03:21.970> go<00:03:22.150> ahead<00:03:22.239> and<00:03:22.360> do<00:03:22.540> an<00:03:22.630> orange

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
then let's go ahead and do an orange

flower<00:03:23.410> um<00:03:23.860> I<00:03:24.700> have<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.239> orange<00:03:25.690> color<00:03:25.930> I

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
flower um I have this orange color I

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.380 
flower um I have this orange color I
find<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.560> don't<00:03:26.799> really<00:03:27.040> use<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:27.880> as<00:03:28.209> much

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
find that I don't really use it as much

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.229 
find that I don't really use it as much
as<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.660> probably<00:03:29.049> should<00:03:29.670> but<00:03:30.670> it<00:03:30.820> makes<00:03:31.060> a

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
as I probably should but it makes a

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.530 
as I probably should but it makes a
great<00:03:31.450> little<00:03:32.410> Center<00:03:32.980> for<00:03:33.220> these<00:03:33.340> guys<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:33.910> I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
great little Center for these guys and I

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.060 
great little Center for these guys and I
think<00:03:34.750> I'm<00:03:34.840> actually<00:03:35.019> going<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.500> add<00:03:35.709> just<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.460 
think I'm actually going to add just a
little<00:03:36.100> bit<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.910> tail<00:03:37.360> just<00:03:38.140> kind<00:03:38.410> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
little bit on this tail just kind of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.640 
little bit on this tail just kind of

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
key 27 will out for this stems of the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400 
key 27 will out for this stems of the
stems<00:03:48.100> are<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.370> same<00:03:48.549> idea<00:03:49.060> as<00:03:49.359> the<00:03:49.660> whiskers

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
stems are the same idea as the whiskers

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.960 
stems are the same idea as the whiskers
some<00:03:51.250> people<00:03:51.790> like<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.209> look<00:03:52.359> of<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.570> blank<00:03:53.019> um

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
putting the green out there I think it

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.680
