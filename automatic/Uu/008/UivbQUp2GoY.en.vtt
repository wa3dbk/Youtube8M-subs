00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
part you have to test it to make sure

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
part you have to test it to make sure

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
of testing it how do you whittle down

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.380 
of testing it how do you whittle down
your<00:01:41.250> ideas<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.670> recommend<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.150> writing

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
your ideas you recommend just writing

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.880 
your ideas you recommend just writing
them<00:01:42.540> down<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> piece<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> paper<00:01:43.380> yeah<00:01:43.710> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
them down on a piece of paper yeah it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.990 
them down on a piece of paper yeah it's
a<00:01:43.950> great<00:01:44.070> question<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.460> think<00:01:44.490> there's<00:01:44.850> three

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
a great question I think there's three

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520 
a great question I think there's three
parts<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.630> anybody<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.380> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
parts to it and anybody can do this in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
parts to it and anybody can do this in
15<00:01:47.040> minutes<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.430> not<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> huge<00:01:47.820> process<00:01:48.000> the

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
15 minutes it's not a huge process the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.420 
15 minutes it's not a huge process the
first<00:01:48.780> thing<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.350> ask<00:01:49.560> yourself<00:01:49.740> what<00:01:50.280> do

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
first thing is to ask yourself what do

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
you do this you take an idea let's say

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.640 
you do this you take an idea let's say

rooms okay now that's a nice idea it

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.750 
rooms okay now that's a nice idea it
seems<00:03:15.930> pretty<00:03:16.230> good<00:03:16.379> for<00:03:16.560> the<00:03:16.620> world<00:03:16.769> but<00:03:17.609> your

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
seems pretty good for the world but your

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.550 
seems pretty good for the world but your
goal<00:03:17.940> is<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.150> earn<00:03:18.419> money<00:03:18.629> on<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.900> side<00:03:19.139> now<00:03:19.500> do

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
goal is to earn money on the side now do

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.210 
goal is to earn money on the side now do
nonprofits<00:03:20.340> have<00:03:20.519> the<00:03:20.750> ability<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.959> pay<00:03:22.319> maybe

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
nonprofits have the ability to pay maybe

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
nonprofits have the ability to pay maybe
not<00:03:23.579> they<00:03:23.879> don't<00:03:24.030> necessarily<00:03:24.180> always<00:03:24.629> have<00:03:24.720> a

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
not they don't necessarily always have a

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.599 
not they don't necessarily always have a
ton<00:03:25.109> of<00:03:25.139> money<00:03:25.349> however<00:03:25.829> let's<00:03:26.220> think<00:03:26.400> about

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
ton of money however let's think about

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.479 
ton of money however let's think about
maybe<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.419> can<00:03:27.989> help<00:03:28.169> busy<00:03:28.829> executives

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
maybe you can help busy executives

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.759 
maybe you can help busy executives
assemble<00:03:29.970> their<00:03:30.090> their<00:03:30.419> furniture<00:03:30.900> do<00:03:31.650> they

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
assemble their their furniture do they

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.289 
assemble their their furniture do they
have<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.280> ability<00:03:32.609> and<00:03:32.699> willingness<00:03:32.879> to<00:03:33.060> pay

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
have the ability and willingness to pay

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.520 
have the ability and willingness to pay
certainly<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.109> what<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.349> is<00:03:34.410> you

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
certainly so what you do is you

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.530 
certainly so what you do is you
basically<00:03:34.919> eliminated<00:03:35.519> half<00:03:35.730> your<00:03:35.970> ideas<00:03:36.299> and

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
basically eliminated half your ideas and

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.180 
basically eliminated half your ideas and
now<00:03:37.049> you're<00:03:37.230> stuck<00:03:37.440> with<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.739> a<00:03:37.799> few<00:03:38.010> that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
now you're stuck with just a few that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.400 
now you're stuck with just a few that
are<00:03:38.220> pretty<00:03:38.400> good<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.690> too<00:03:39.870> bad<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.049> some

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
are pretty good it's too bad that some

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.629 
are pretty good it's too bad that some
of<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.590> ones<00:03:40.739> where<00:03:40.980> there's<00:03:41.190> willingness<00:03:41.519> to

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
of the ones where there's willingness to

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.309 
of the ones where there's willingness to
pay<00:03:41.879> are<00:03:42.000> not<00:03:42.150> necessarily<00:03:42.629> the<00:03:42.840> most<00:03:42.989> lofty

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
pay are not necessarily the most lofty

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.559 
pay are not necessarily the most lofty
idealistic<00:03:44.099> ones<00:03:44.519> but<00:03:44.760> that's<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.449> the

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
idealistic ones but that's that's the

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.460 
idealistic ones but that's that's the
way<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.750> world<00:03:45.900> goes<00:03:46.079> now

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
way the world goes now

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.500 
way the world goes now
now<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.919> say<00:03:47.129> also<00:03:47.459> then<00:03:47.699> once<00:03:47.879> you<00:03:48.000> determine

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
now you say also then once you determine

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.789 
now you say also then once you determine
that<00:03:48.720> you<00:03:48.930> still<00:03:49.169> need<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.379> do<00:03:49.500> a<00:03:49.530> little<00:03:49.620> bit

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
that you still need to do a little bit

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.020 
that you still need to do a little bit
of<00:03:49.889> digging<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.190> little<00:03:50.250> bit<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.489> testing<00:03:50.669> right

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
of digging a little bit of testing right

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.369 
of digging a little bit of testing right
you<00:03:51.180> do<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.510> can't<00:03:51.690> just<00:03:51.870> take<00:03:51.959> your<00:03:52.109> idea<00:03:52.319> and

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
you do you can't just take your idea and

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.289 
you do you can't just take your idea and
say<00:03:52.560> great<00:03:52.829> done<00:03:53.159> I<00:03:53.190> got<00:03:53.639> a<00:03:53.669> thousand<00:03:54.060> bucks<00:03:54.180> a

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
say great done I got a thousand bucks a

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.240 
say great done I got a thousand bucks a
month<00:03:54.329> so<00:03:55.019> what<00:03:55.500> I'd<00:03:55.590> recommend<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:56.099> by<00:03:56.190> this

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
month so what I'd recommend is by this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.979 
month so what I'd recommend is by this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
technique you whittled it down to two or

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.849 
technique you whittled it down to two or
three<00:03:59.519> ideas<00:03:59.909> pick<00:04:00.480> one<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.930> pick<00:04:01.319> one<00:04:01.500> and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
who's been waiting for that mythical

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.949 
who's been waiting for that mythical
idea<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.579> fall<00:04:05.760> down<00:04:05.940> from<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.180> sky<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.840> it's

not<00:04:07.229> about<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.709> it's<00:04:07.889> about<00:04:07.979> taking<00:04:08.459> an<00:04:08.549> idea

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
not about that it's about taking an idea

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.879 
not about that it's about taking an idea
and<00:04:08.989> systematically<00:04:09.989> testing<00:04:10.440> so<00:04:10.650> you'll<00:04:10.769> go

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
and systematically testing so you'll go

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:12.409 
and systematically testing so you'll go
out<00:04:10.919> there<00:04:11.190> let's<00:04:11.639> say<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:11.909> example<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.239> I

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
out there let's say for example that I

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.300 
out there let's say for example that I
want<00:04:12.599> to<00:04:12.659> help<00:04:12.750> elderly<00:04:13.290> people<00:04:13.650> with<00:04:14.159> their

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
want to help elderly people with their

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.399 
want to help elderly people with their
computer<00:04:14.669> problems<00:04:15.000> good<00:04:15.599> great<00:04:15.840> great<00:04:15.989> idea

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
computer problems good great great idea

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:18.319 
computer problems good great great idea
so<00:04:16.739> as<00:04:17.010> I've<00:04:17.159> been<00:04:17.280> taken

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
so as I've been taken

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.300 
so as I've been taken
so<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.720> might<00:04:18.989> go<00:04:19.109> out<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.409> say<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.949> know<00:04:20.039> is

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
so I might go out and say you know is

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.949 
so I might go out and say you know is
anyone<00:04:20.669> else<00:04:20.819> doing<00:04:21.000> this<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.359> actually

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
anyone else doing this and actually

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.960 
anyone else doing this and actually
counter-intuitively<00:04:22.740> competition<00:04:23.729> is<00:04:23.789> good

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
counter-intuitively competition is good

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.119 
counter-intuitively competition is good
that<00:04:24.180> means<00:04:24.330> there's<00:04:24.509> a<00:04:24.599> market<00:04:24.960> then<00:04:25.530> how<00:04:26.069> do

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:26.129 
that means there's a market then how do

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:28.279 
that means there's a market then how do
I<00:04:26.220> test<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.580> more<00:04:26.699> I'd<00:04:27.000> go<00:04:27.270> find<00:04:27.659> some<00:04:27.990> elderly

I test it more I'd go find some elderly

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:29.839 
I test it more I'd go find some elderly
people<00:04:28.409> and<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:28.979> would<00:04:29.069> say<00:04:29.190> hey<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.669> this
