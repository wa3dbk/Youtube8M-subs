00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.860
 hello welcome everyone to a new way 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.650
 cooperative this time we will dedicate 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.059
 to the last of us and we have invited 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.429
 marta sanchez our current sword 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.170
 hello marta to come talk to us about 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.740
 the sofas because she has had the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.050
 opportunity to play it and if you were 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.140
 a week and shipped two weeks to 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.529
 angels are not and pass a good demo 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.170
 of the game and the truth that I came out 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.900
 Happily delighted, but a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.699
 little overwhelmed because I liked it but I 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.820
 liked because sometimes suffer from 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:41.790
 games of these that you know that they are from 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.120
 scare tension so it's fun 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.670
 know that they get their goal that is 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.460
 that survival horror mix with game 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.920
 action of suffering because of the bullets 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.629
 They do not have that agony 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.079
 know that then they get that in the 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.440
 game when they have a hard time 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.829
 every time I am a little more 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.100
 tell us a little about the sensations 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.690
 generals of the demo that you could how much 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 time we owe more or less 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.160
 it was a pretty long demo 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 'We're going long, especially because it's so 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.940
 difficult if there were a few more moments 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.290
 complicated than others but they were 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.290
 enough minutes of 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.579
 where are people because they are 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.630
 it starts unlike what we have 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.189
 seen that he is on and the two exploded 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.469
 protagonists of the game us 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.119
 we try a part that is when they leave 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:39.100
 of the quarantine zone for the first time 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.939
 which is the first that the girl the girl 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.590
 comes out of there and there was the context that 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.240
 is a partner of joel no in your are 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.069
 three characters that have just come out of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.590
 the quarantine zone and then 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:54.009
 you start off you start in the open air 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.140
 but very little time then you get into 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.560
 a building that is in ruins and there it is 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.799
 where the problems begin they begin 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.759
 appear infected and start what 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.860
 good starts the good 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.929
 tell us a bit because here, as I would say 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.849
 just mojamuto are not zombies are 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.319
 infected tell us a little about 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.079
 infected with the ones that you found yes 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.720
 since we saw two classes supposed 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.670
 which is are human beings that have been 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.880
 infected by an outbreak of a 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.070
 weather 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.780
 and then there are several states of the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.420
 infection then we could see 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.630
 a first phase that are called the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.190
 runners that are aesthetically you see 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.950
 if it is still recognized that they are human 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.930
 then the eyes a little bright flames 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.210
 a little weird but they have human form 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.780
 not the face is human and are characterized 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.970
 because they are very fast runners too 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.800
 the diffuse and they like the group a lot 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.800
 But they are 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.410
 easy to kill with a gun or with 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.610
 stealth and that can be killed if not 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.870
 that there is a very large group and you have 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 I know I walk but I know what to kill 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.310
 ok and then we're seeing the clickers 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650
 it's called that those are already that have been 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.130
 seen such conceptual and arts and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.440
 images that have the face totally 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.330
 As mushrooms are full of mushrooms , 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.710
 they reproduced them in the face and they are already 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.540
 humans then you have you can not that you 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.720
 help because you can go to them 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.440
 attack them with the flashlight even 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.330
 lit not because there are more areas 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.760
 dark and such and you can help from the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.180
 light but be very careful with the sound 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.310
 can you for example can you help in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.690
 that in distracting them to create bricks or 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.580
 bottles that are on the floor are very 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.500
 sensitive to clear noise you can not 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.120
 distract and take advantage of you to go 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.540
 back and kill him because they are more 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.609
 resistant this is already a 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:44.079
 the most advanced phase and tell us a little 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.450
 during the demo I had a lot of ammo 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.340
 you had many weapons from which resources 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.099
 you had and what you had to do 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.290
 try not to spend those is one of the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.180
 things that makes you very nervous is the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.560
 little ammunition you have and the few 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.109
 resources that you have in the game do not 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.280
 then you have to know how to control yourself 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.040
 know half well and use them 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.799
 properly and do not fire the turn 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.269
 because it's very scarce you have to go in 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.670
 the enemies not always that some 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.709
 you leave ammunition and you have to go 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.989
 controlling you have knives too that 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.970
 also they wear when you kill behind 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.549
 with stealth behind you have to walk with 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.959
 a lot of eye with the ammunition because thing 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.639
 as a theory without ammunition and you come 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.620
 click is one of those that kills you with a touch 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.930
 as soon as he catches you he can come out very good 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.570
 what it is that one of the things is that 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.330
 there is crafting there is only one option that you 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.340
 you can create your objects not only what 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.660
 you find yourself on the stage but 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.120
 you can 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.000
 is collecting very ingredients for the 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.190
 stage and it tells you what things 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.840
 you can create cocktail baseball bats 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.940
 molotov that comes in handy for 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.970
 set fire to more than one and you can do 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.520
 first aid kits or certain things that you 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.070
 help then to that limited arsenal 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.580
 what do you have then at least grow 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.610
 a little and tell us a bit already 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.770
 determine a little what was that part 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.970
 of the demo with what part you have left 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.430
 part that will scare you or that you 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.170
 They surprised me very pleasantly. 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.540
 I stay with the area I knew an area that was 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.510
 the one that was there was so many run is like 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.100
 clickers that is and you had to think very 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.280
 well how to act did not also go to 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:22.260
 principle I will confess it total 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.680
 I went very kamikazes to them it was very wrong 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:29.200
 and is that sooner or later because I 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.970
 I was without bullets or because they grab you and you 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.820
 kill you do not have to go very calmly 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.650
 you have to go thinking and you can see there is a 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.350
 option that is a like a vision x-ray 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:40.560
 so you can press the button and see 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.479
 behind the walls where are the 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:49.620
 also help them and see their movements 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:56.189
 to make a suicidal strategy 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.189
 because it took me a while to spend 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.500
 has many options and has and has and 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.409
 you have to think a lot or it is not to go to what 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.750
 crazy not good then nothing because we are 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.220
 eager to try more of the 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.100
 leaves 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.720
 and sure when we have another demo 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.260
 or let's see something, we'll talk about 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:22.750
 this sonic game thank you very much for 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.340
 come and tell us what we see in another 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.250
 cooperative mode 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.200
 and you sure for sure it's coming to 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.560
 you then we wait for you in the next 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.560
 cooperative mode
