I've<00:01:14.410> taken<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.980> bottom<00:01:15.550> off<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.790> light<00:01:16.030> to

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
I've taken the bottom off the light to

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.900 
I've taken the bottom off the light to
give<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.510> a<00:01:16.570> bit<00:01:16.920> bit<00:01:17.920> better<00:01:18.130> size<00:01:18.520> so<00:01:18.790> it's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
give it a bit bit better size so it's

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.719 
give it a bit bit better size so it's
kind<00:01:19.060> of<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.300> it<00:01:19.360> can<00:01:19.510> fit<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:20.190> I'll<00:01:21.190> put<00:01:21.460> a<00:01:21.490> hole

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
kind of so it can fit in I'll put a hole

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.219 
kind of so it can fit in I'll put a hole
through<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.090> back<00:01:22.300> so<00:01:22.540> you<00:01:22.570> can<00:01:22.690> get<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
through the back so you can get to the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.580 
through the back so you can get to the
button<00:01:23.620> obviously<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:26.080> going<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.290> try<00:01:26.500> and

I'd<00:02:07.660> like<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.899> tasks<00:02:08.740> tax<00:02:09.160> disc<00:02:09.520> holder<00:02:09.820> I

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
I'd like the tasks tax disc holder I

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.780 
I'd like the tasks tax disc holder I
don't<00:02:10.330> say<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.690> word<00:02:11.190> that's<00:02:12.190> glued<00:02:12.640> in<00:02:12.910> now

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
don't say the word that's glued in now

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.630 
don't say the word that's glued in now
I'll<00:02:15.790> be<00:02:15.910> able<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> put<00:02:16.330> some<00:02:16.540> of<00:02:16.570> these<00:02:16.780> some

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
I'll be able to put some of these some

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.940 
I'll be able to put some of these some
magnetizing<00:02:18.640> stuff<00:02:18.910> behind<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.710> can

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
magnetizing stuff behind it so we can

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.200 
magnetizing stuff behind it so we can
put<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.000> graph<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:24.310> just<00:02:24.790> started<00:02:25.060> making

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
put the graph on I just started making

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.770 
put the graph on I just started making
holes<00:02:25.810> for<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.620> buttons<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:28.450> go<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:28.750> like

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
holes for the buttons will go in like

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.600 
holes for the buttons will go in like
that<00:02:31.080> okay<00:02:32.080> I've<00:02:32.230> got<00:02:32.440> most<00:02:32.830> of<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.160> bits<00:02:33.370> in

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that okay I've got most of the bits in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.090 
that okay I've got most of the bits in
now<00:02:33.970> I've<00:02:34.090> drilled<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.540> holes<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.620> can<00:02:35.830> set

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
now I've drilled the holes so I can set

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.700 
now I've drilled the holes so I can set
the<00:02:37.020> buttons<00:02:38.020> in<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.030> also<00:02:40.330> this<00:02:40.720> lens<00:02:41.350> which

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
the buttons in and also this lens which

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.780 
the buttons in and also this lens which
I'm<00:02:41.890> going<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.069> make<00:02:42.190> some<00:02:42.370> sort<00:02:42.520> of<00:02:42.640> digital

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
I'm going to make some sort of digital

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.990 
I'm going to make some sort of digital
readout<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.690> go<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.020> back<00:02:44.290> there<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.910> a

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
readout to go on the back there just a

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.570 
readout to go on the back there just a
bit<00:02:46.060> circuit<00:02:46.630> board<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:47.380> obviously<00:02:48.340> that

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
bit circuit board and obviously that

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.360 
bit circuit board and obviously that
disc<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.780> now<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.830> I'm<00:02:50.920> going<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.100> take<00:02:51.220> all

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
disc is now in so I'm going to take all

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.280 
disc is now in so I'm going to take all
those<00:02:51.520> bits<00:02:51.730> off<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.300> probably<00:02:52.959> do<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
those bits off and probably do the

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.340 
those bits off and probably do the
undercoat<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.750> main<00:02:56.470> plastic<00:02:57.010> here<00:02:57.270> okay

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
undercoat on the main plastic here okay

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.000 
undercoat on the main plastic here okay
it's<00:02:59.350> got<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:01.080> undercoat<00:03:02.080> on<00:03:02.260> now

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it's got the undercoat on now

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.119 
it's got the undercoat on now
but<00:03:03.220> a<00:03:03.250> little<00:03:03.700> test<00:03:04.030> of<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:05.379> silver<00:03:05.950> paint

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
but a little test of the silver paint

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.869 
but a little test of the silver paint
that<00:03:06.340> I'm<00:03:06.430> gonna<00:03:06.580> use<00:03:07.110> hopefully<00:03:08.110> it'll<00:03:08.260> be

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
that I'm gonna use hopefully it'll be

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:12.899 
that I'm gonna use hopefully it'll be
okay<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:11.230> is<00:03:11.379> it<00:03:11.530> now<00:03:11.709> if<00:03:11.950> they<00:03:12.250> couple<00:03:12.819> of

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
okay this is it now if they couple of

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.559 
okay this is it now if they couple of
coats<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.959> silver<00:03:14.590> paint<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:15.569> silver

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
coats of the silver paint a silver

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.470 
coats of the silver paint a silver
acrylic<00:03:16.780> paint<00:03:17.370> don't<00:03:18.370> look<00:03:18.579> too<00:03:18.700> bad

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
acrylic paint don't look too bad

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.089 
acrylic paint don't look too bad
hopefully<00:03:20.140> when<00:03:20.260> that's<00:03:20.409> dry<00:03:20.620> I'll<00:03:20.920> better

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
hopefully when that's dry I'll better

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.539 
hopefully when that's dry I'll better
take<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.579> cover<00:03:22.209> off<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.840> screen<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.799> the

there those have come out okay and I've
removed<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> cover<00:03:44.019> ahead<00:03:44.230> on<00:03:44.349> the<00:03:44.500> screen

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
removed the cover ahead on the screen

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:50.490 
removed the cover ahead on the screen
and<00:03:45.159> I've<00:03:45.579> also<00:03:45.730> put<00:03:45.909> on<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:47.670> graft<00:03:49.290> piece<00:03:50.290> of

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
and I've also put on the graft piece of

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.550 
and I've also put on the graft piece of
magnetizing<00:03:51.099> plastic<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.299> put<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.569> stuck

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
magnetizing plastic that I put on stuck

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.430 
magnetizing plastic that I put on stuck
that<00:03:53.709> into<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.099> back<00:03:54.280> there<00:03:54.670> so<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:56.019> get<00:03:56.260> the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
that into the back there so you get the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.349 
that into the back there so you get the
effect<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:58.709> being<00:03:59.709> a<00:03:59.940> oscilloscope<00:04:00.940> type

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
effect of it being a oscilloscope type

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.220 
effect of it being a oscilloscope type
screen<00:04:02.700> I'm<00:04:03.700> gonna<00:04:03.849> fit<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.299> the<00:04:04.420> other<00:04:04.540> pieces

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
screen I'm gonna fit in the other pieces

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:53.690 
screen I'm gonna fit in the other pieces
now<00:04:06.930> I've<00:04:07.930> got<00:04:08.109> the<00:04:08.230> lights<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.980> go<00:04:09.129> in

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:02.420 

in<00:04:56.190> okay<00:04:57.190> and<00:04:57.220> the<00:04:57.670> the<00:04:59.220> other<00:05:00.220> screen<00:05:00.790> that

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
in okay and the the other screen that

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.590 
in okay and the the other screen that
pop<00:05:03.430> up<00:05:03.670> on<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:05.490> glue<00:05:06.490> that<00:05:06.700> one<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:07.090> around<00:05:07.480> the

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
pop up on it glue that one in around the

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:58.080 
pop up on it glue that one in around the
back<00:05:07.630> I<00:05:07.840> think<00:05:08.790> keep<00:05:09.790> that<00:05:09.970> one<00:05:10.150> in<00:05:10.210> straight

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.879 

okay<00:05:58.630> here's<00:05:58.900> the<00:05:59.020> thing<00:05:59.139> pretty<00:05:59.680> much

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
okay here's the thing pretty much

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:02.490 
okay here's the thing pretty much
finished<00:06:00.430> I've<00:06:01.270> put<00:06:01.480> a<00:06:01.510> little<00:06:01.780> screen<00:06:02.230> behind

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
finished I've put a little screen behind

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.409 
finished I've put a little screen behind
the<00:06:02.830> graph<00:06:03.070> there<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:05.680> buttons<00:06:05.950> now<00:06:06.160> light<00:06:07.120> up

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:07.419 
the graph there the buttons now light up

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.830 
the graph there the buttons now light up
with<00:06:08.050> the<00:06:08.139> red<00:06:08.290> LED<00:06:08.770> the<00:06:09.160> screens<00:06:09.550> now<00:06:09.850> in<00:06:10.060> just

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
with the red LED the screens now in just

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.680 
with the red LED the screens now in just
show<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.260> back<00:06:11.910> put<00:06:12.910> these<00:06:13.120> plastic

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
show you the back put these plastic
