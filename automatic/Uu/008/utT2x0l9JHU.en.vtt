00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:05.630
 been in our television album only before and now for example that real 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.740
 The new Samsung P 8,000 television still runs before the technology 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.940
 viewer wants this device itself is really very nice with that one time 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.900
 said he is a bit too big 46 were a server in our country 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.630
 stand 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.800
 but the main thing that stands out is the victim of the edge around it 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.039
 screen have the cito larger screen from front to back is just about this small 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.910
 country 4 that is less than an inch and that is actually 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.320
 get them one more and close up cyrus limited structure took the thin threads 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.150
 to spend a little less 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.160
 that says mesh in the Ardennes state of affairs itself will also not reveal 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.850
 how exactly they have done to make a breakthrough seems to have gotten me well 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.940
 but they say so themselves 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.210
 but I think that our competition must imitate very quickly in itself 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.050
 you learned to buy d8000 from all that competitor at the moment through daily 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.210
 they admittedly each other bears his name even though planning to build but me 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.000
 have the goal of looking for the citizen green neatly finished two recent 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.560
 proposal the winner gets a very nice television it's like you make 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.519
 makes a stupid mistake 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.839
 the concert is very thin its further the hand it does not crack like young people 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.110
 and starters it was seen on earlier televisions that of a bit 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.310
 yes a bit usually this is really a very nice buildings screen 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.300
 and actually look for the new ajax there are also the 9000 series but there are 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.690
 no new models are coming in later this year 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.040
 year 9,000 models that are now there is actually a bit of a picture 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.810
 that they are not in the store so this is 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.790
 of the affordable models construction stand a bit firm but it is the high 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.619
 end rise and series of sometimes at the moment placed yes enough about design 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.730
 the interest had again for the film of the technique 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.840
 he performs well 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.450
 well that is just going to the back week also that i do 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.750
 likes and that is actually not entirely new but it is that failed 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.340
 all connection is a peak season that the television sit with flat tire that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 I also want to be able to put against a wall or even be able to hang it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.220
 connecting the connection directly behind it is of course not very useful 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.830
 here too everything aside 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.210
 he won four karimi after closing and what I find interesting for the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.460
 Finally the city around you can do modular stabbing that comes with a kind of piggyback 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.480
 connector so hope if it's not for the purpose 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.660
 that is a television just a little faster jett that is a bit of life 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.060
 everything is better than in the previous sometimes a series this leaves a good start 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.890
 extended 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.690
 yes then it would already be legendary american one so now neat 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.529
 eliminated at least right 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.639
 but of course to touch it on image quality, of course 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:22.449
 crystal test results can be found on the site what I noticed is that the 

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:25.929
 clarity he is good because that is a turbo problem when you see it 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.329
 it extends 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.409
 the screen is with LEDs on the side and the side radiant is very bad 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.019
 fascinating yet a bit wondering how did they manage that 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.650
 there is still a group of 20 percent and that sounds very bad but it falls 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.349
 choice in practice 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.580
 so the brightest point is 20 cents brighter than the clearest point 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.019
 and the image quality is a vlissinger fashion she also tested with our 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.540
 king meter yes then it almost corresponds to that there were some that were perfect 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.409
 are therefore really very good at that point in the coach on the greens 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.419
 but that can be corrected again 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.229
 in that respect we actually have little to say 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.869
 and what is of course very nice is this is actually the first model of one of the 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:07.049
 the first models with the new smart key interface from samsung are curious 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.400
 mention why the balloon is summarizing all forms of collectivity 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have known for a long time that they have been renewed but also 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.830
 a weird stuff when you music your photos and videos through the a12 by a bit too 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.399
 stabbing 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:22.189
 the hard disk recorder option that you have with your fingers at hard disk 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.449
 adheres 

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.069
 we are all funny all known 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.939
 in the children's vision 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.529
 de je joep de 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.620
 that is just not immediately nice that you do not look I have to say 

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.529
 that the range on offer there are quite the opposite know it is all sides 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.459
 seen television in germany it was the other option because by country 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.259
 differs considerably limited, it is actually rather disappointing 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.879
 now we ourselves are busy with a deer in real life, almost impossible 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.119
 because the failure to get approved so I can imagine this victory 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.189
 was difficult for the pole but sometimes a total of the plans but 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:53.569
 well that is very different story 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.819
 yes what is also nice is that his and meet full with blue black vest 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.059
 have streamlined it 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.799
 but a little bit deception because that stays with me is slow and with 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.509
 Text entry in particular is a disaster because it must not only spring 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:08.439
 descendant are eega but I have also done good things that are but it 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.289
 just doesn't work 

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:12.949
 but they are in fact entering text and that is yes that makes it 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.120
 just about half of the youth chamber orchestra is not that bad 

00:04:16.119 --> 00:04:20.209
 cheerful of expired yes so you will so without much more balanced 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.379
 to look at the skin that they have been able to make for a while 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.220
 yes it is unimaginable to look it up for not handy year unless you do that 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.509
 you were not looking at that time also border with Afghanistan 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:32.600
 pretty okay 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.710
 but also the browsing remains of course through the page with with the with 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.050
 course that is not really very handy to go with flash that means option 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.370
 greater berend mink from the maastricht horses how can you shoot there 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.570
 just good looking because I also have a moment to make sure you never go for it 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.999
 the right way I found that not quite as you are used to 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.439
 but in principle 10 everything just works 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.570
 Yes and then 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.100
 leave this theory on the table to play, of course, it provides modern high 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.690
 end it is paid this is a 3d model yes that will do is half the 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.580
 Super Class in Asia could draw it in this case too 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.689
 and and the year that the case around that whole has the new glasses but this one 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.400
 certainly not lost 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
 the site is about the companies that in the past were behind 18 young in the 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.820
 sleeves for the front of the burgt has 38 from looked like a normal 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.520
 sunglasses 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.570
 yes yes he can say but I never have a game of the promises 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.400
 Tuesday is again a normal life I can just get to the 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.889
 front is rotating 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.800
 In addition, some other models are not so rude yet, but I regret that 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.610
 they have these flowers and I am not like that 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.400
 there is much nicer yes so nice is third and fourth place must come yes 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.150
 but they can be purchased separately and they can work with these zutphen themes 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.280
 what also one after what I also noticed is that they go that the cost is really 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.270
 a whole lot better so it is actually much less than last year last year 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.730
 assistance from television really suffer from fever too 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.090
 the image for the left corner of the eye is the right eye and vice versa 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.110
 yes a bit of a double image before the 3d experience is largely destroyed 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.060
 helped it is not completely gone that is absolutely not the case but she says 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.099
 much better than the previous year was 9 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.110
 but our exclusive for the d8000 yes it is a kitchen with 46 is that perhaps 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.789
 is that is a super nice television but well I assume that you are about 900 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.240
 euros for paid so it is really a very expensive one 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.639
 However, it is her and television crying performance but also for their budget 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.419
 with that the end of this episode of hart could even be tw 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:20.990
 last Friday are right
