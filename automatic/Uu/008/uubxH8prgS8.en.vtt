of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.310> season<00:03:00.519> we<00:03:00.760> had<00:03:00.880> our<00:03:01.030> struggles<00:03:01.209> with

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
of the season we had our struggles with

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.850 
of the season we had our struggles with
closing<00:03:01.750> games<00:03:02.080> out<00:03:02.320> but<00:03:02.530> now<00:03:02.709> I<00:03:02.739> think

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
closing games out but now I think

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.400 
closing games out but now I think
everybody<00:03:03.580> in<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.790> room<00:03:03.850> has<00:03:04.660> confidence<00:03:05.110> in

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
everybody in this room has confidence in

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.320 
everybody in this room has confidence in
each<00:03:05.830> other<00:03:06.010> and<00:03:06.160> they<00:03:06.700> know<00:03:06.910> we're<00:03:07.120> going<00:03:07.239> to

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
each other and they know we're going to

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
each other and they know we're going to
get<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.450> shot<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.380> think<00:03:08.500> that's<00:03:08.739> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
get a shot so I think that's the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.350 
get a shot so I think that's the
difference<00:03:09.070> between<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.910> beginning<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.239> the

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
difference between the beginning of the

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.650 
difference between the beginning of the
season<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:10.870> now

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.880
