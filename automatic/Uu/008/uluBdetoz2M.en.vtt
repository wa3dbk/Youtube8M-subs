 about dogs that went to space 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.020
 I even remember their names you know what it is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.440
 of the total 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.610

 he gave me my first project péretz that was to build a game of chapín 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.680
 count on a tassel moving and score and and he told me he had a 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.210
 contract with general electric ge but that really was not true 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.230
 Once I made the game work 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.319
 Nolan said he should have sound and also told him that he wanted him to have 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.670
 the sound of an ovation crowd and someone else said he wanted to hear 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.569
 boos when I lost skiing I thought I had no identity 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.699
 the interesting thing is for space invaders is that it was a scenario where 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.849
 precocious scare 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.049
 when you play you realize that you are invalid well I am being 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.730
 invaded by these subjects 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.370
 I am the initial line of security for humanity the game investors 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.840
 good specials and that this policy 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.959
 after millions of bad guys like 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.959
 as inappropriate as 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:23.400
 observe the stars and hasbaya is very colorful jackman is the perfect example 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400

 japan nisa 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:33.669
 the characters in the video games are adorable 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.579
 although the western countries do not call them so he but to children 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:45.919
 It is a culture that tolerates more the love because cultures 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:50.140
 western and we've seen it throughout the second half of the 20th century 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.090
 to some extent reflects the consumer power of the Japanese girls who had 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.550
 another in which a young designer of the Japanese game company Namco 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.319
 before creating the first superstar video game in history 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:08.180
 cockpit 1980 was the year pacman appeared by then 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.810
 when we were developing pacman the Swedes had an atmosphere 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.739
 wild 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:17.769
 since only violent shooting games existed in the games and it was a 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.769
 totally masculine field 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.409
 but I wanted to bring the girls and the couples to that place so I jot down 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:29.479
 to the girls in a new game 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.339
 we had reviewed many topics from love to the children themselves 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.090
 but since the girls always with a post after the meal no matter what 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.199
 we take that word as a key 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.279
 then we were having lunch and ordered a round apex 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.180
 I took a piece and here they have it 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.570
 there I was dumbfounded right there so we decided to do it like that 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.120
 the most important thing about him 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.120
 pop pac-man hand as we know it is that 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.670
 was the 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.610
 reads first game in presenting a protagonist what was a great leap in 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.469
 the history of videogames 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.770
 With this a new world opens up for developers and designers 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:11.360
 will start to create characters 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.509
 with which people could relate and identify 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.179
 by 1983 the American people had disconnected the market from the 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:26.780
 home consoles but on the other side of the globe the communist latex regime 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.870
 and on his bike to success there he did not have the pieces of one of the games 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.870
 most charismatic in history 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 26 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.969
 the first times were very dark here 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.259
 then there was total is on the way 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:45.659
 or in politics 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:49.539
 the moral climate was very bleak we had no hope 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.879
 we did not have much entertainment 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:58.050
 we had some movies some theaters but basically life did not 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.050
 I was made to entertain 

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:07.909
 I spent 14 hours a day at work just playing with my computer like 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:10.909
 young pirates now 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.819
 in 1985 to success they know time as a computer scientist 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.009
 in the Russian academy of sciences 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:21.789
 they told me that it was not what interested me 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:26.570
 my heart was in this kind of queens riddles 

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.570
 investment puzzle 

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:35.379
 conceived this idea a purely mathematical idea of ​​taking all the 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:38.889
 possible configurations to join a set of blocks 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.599
 and make it not just join them together in a normal two-dimensional puzzle and 

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:46.289
 not make them fall 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.389
 imagine falling pieces 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.819
 of days to rotate them, that's how they found their shape and put them 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.819
 it was the main idea of ​​tetris 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.669
 for people it was a way of thinking different from other games 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:08.550
 used a part of the brain that people did not use in the 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.800
 video games was also such an amazing idea that they really were not required 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.569
 graphics to sell them and for 1986 and the game versions for the 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:20.419
 computer appeared 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:23.530
 but he continues to sign a 10-year incidence for his game 

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:25.629
 imitate later 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:26.900
 the sovietic Union 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.229
 in the last room 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.229
 world and its millions with its creation 

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:35.860
 it happened 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.000
 the people basically had no right but it is the product of the earthquake 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.550
 a chisel
