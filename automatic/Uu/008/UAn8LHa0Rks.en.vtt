 but now we are Finnish Karelia 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.439
 in the former territory of the Vyborg province 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.700
 this parish wig she entered 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.270
 Vyborg province generally obeyed 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.849
 vyborg 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.279
 these are truly borderline places we 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.400
 near the border and here parish 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.850
 wig halo all whether power rings once 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.620
 born in i rarely have it 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.040
 self-taught artist who did not receive 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.540
 no art education uah 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.390
 canin was born in the fourth year lived 66 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.690
 years a sudden attack of the disease in 2010 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 year downloaded and thought he was doing 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.120
 all for yourself 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.489
 no future for her until he 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.180
 preparing the contrary when he was asked a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.460
 what awaits his creation by his sculptures 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.890
 need to fall asleep with sand and let it be 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.390
 by group creed millennial silence 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 narrow eternity will leave 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.300
 he did it for himself that is for now 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.289
 self-expression and plant which 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.450
 pick up and planted not according to plan not by 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:19.410
 design decision as well as him 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.729
 saw 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.130
 and sculptures among these plants they 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 expressed his personal relationship to the world and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.709
 man he was a special reticent 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.130
 lonely and in these sculptures these are his children 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:37.020
 especially see a number of where children 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.420
 sculptures then after death by their mother 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.849
 generally focused on dates 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.580
 make concrete out of concrete 

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:47.940
 sculptures of children and the outsiders to and 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.369
 art is in 2010 observed 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.429
 some surge of interest in the site of all 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.319
 cama art it is the people around the world 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.229
 art education 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:01.080
 I use a mixed technique with your 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.650
 ananyev unusual materials because they 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.260
 video 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.680
 nekanonov sometimes it turns out very 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.649
 interesting results and rn n he went 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.200
 up working as a young guy and worked 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.080
 he starts a paper factory 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.080
 here the wig who worked came and 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.950
 planted trees and shrubs and flowers here 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.980
 and 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.040
 or saw the sculpture looking and started on 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.500
 when he was 17 years old with the first salary he 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.540
 Already bought a dozen apple seedlings 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 planted and then he suddenly decided 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.500
 try to mold from concrete 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:39.000
 sculptures and so his whole life in this and 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.680
 passed and plants he came here so 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.570
 a lot of that and count them hard because 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.580
 that most of it did not stick 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.030
 specifically did not make them 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.280
 survived he waited for the drive to drive 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.910
 let's make here a combination of the actions of nature 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.580
 and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.720
 of what a person is trying to make without 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.900
 special effort 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.630
 also an interesting approach but 1 to 500 species 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.270
 plants in this park which between 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.130
 by the way he placed according to his taste 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.100
 against the red walls of the house one buildings 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.430
 dyed red with another green these 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.600
 yellow and against red landed 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.970
 there are white anemones purple rhododendrons 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.550
 against green walls. it was so 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.860
 color vision he gained fame 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.959
 in fact shortly before his death he was 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.660
 awarded and should have been from the hands of the president 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.660
 Finland to get an award prize 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.970
 finland then he refused and and receive 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.310
 he did not go he closed 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.380
 but his friend is still a photographer went 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.890
 got this award but he didn't want 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.530
 nothing he just wanted to live he didn't 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.680
 did it for no purpose not on 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.620
 grants not for not for money he did not want 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.790
 nothing but self-expression and already one 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.450
 This suggests that this is a special personally and 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.450
 art 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.300
 on the territory of the swedish kingdom and in 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.600
 particular finland there was no serf 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.320
 right however after conquest by peter 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.020
 first vyborg and surrounding areas in 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.680
 particular wig cola it must have been 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.739
 conquered 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.810
 a little later in 700 thirteenth year 1703 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.000
 getting here Peter first became immediately 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 to favor the lands muffled 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.610
 who tried to sit down 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:30.100
 peasants it was alien 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.510
 They are great reserve Tugrik here completely 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.510
 there were peasants but they were not 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.480
 serfs and only Russian landlords about 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.010
 imitation in some 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.650
 landowners mouth were swedes 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.400
 or booze and swedes also tried too 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.250
 mistreat peasants 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.340
 enslaves and then here passwords for them 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.110
 for the fact that in time passed 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:57.280
 some harvest is not fulfilled 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.430
 peasant arrays peasants protested 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.310
 and you dressed peasant uprisings they 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.440
 here Vyborg province achieved 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.910
 creation of court court 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.460
 the court in which farmers could 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.139
 litigate with landowners landowners 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.770
 this is not actually in Russia 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:18.469
 precisely city both or Turk 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.430
 and then the second in the bard was created and 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:24.469
 court court you are soda on the graph energy 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.319
 grandfather's big cat chosen 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.270
 who here here judged so 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:31.580
 peasants could plead with landowners and 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.310
 already physical punishments were abolished 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:39.169
 so then these are memories of marriage 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.169
 past 50 years of creative life this 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.419
 gardener edge videoing she sculpted 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.969
 half a thousand sculptures and here 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.199
 about 200 sculptures of insults to the group 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.099
 who call the finns 

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:54.050
 yoga so here it is a garden of yoga he sat 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:57.889
 fond of yoga since childhood 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:02.509
 in all these poses apparently visited and here 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:05.990
 his fantasy turned into such all 

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:06.529
 possible asanas I would say the poet poses 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.259
 yogis 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.009
 but they are covered with moss it would be easy 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.409
 to clean 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:15.589
 while tint but then it would 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:18.410
 turned into an analogue of our gypsum 

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:22.050
 pioneer girls with a paddle 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:25.979
 here they were created his fantasies in 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.770
 some moment and left to nature so 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:31.919
 so they collapsed yes they collapse 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.100
 will be covered with flies scrap as well as collapses 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.550
 human life seems to me such a feeling 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.360
 that he knew that his yoga would end and 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:46.020
 life as his life is of course the same 

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:48.210
 sculptures collapse his children they too 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.630
 over time, even concrete will die 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.840
 structures they just give some 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:57.509
 moment of joy and surprise to the viewer 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:02.009
 to a person who passes and touches 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:04.440
 Ivan life can therefore not need them 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:08.639
 clean let them collapse let them 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.039
 break off the pieces it's over time 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:15.270
 that sense park and garden 

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:16.199
 this is a piece of time along with destruction with 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.979
 destruction 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:21.580
 but it requires a new perspective 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.069
 out of work 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:27.069
 but with each step in a new way therefore 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:29.710
 perception of this personal paradise party 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:33.069
 not on remains our own business 

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.810
 the park is held once a year carnival later 

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:38.080
 there will be an exhibition 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:41.259
 uah canon life and then there will be a concert 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.719
 some rock band so the park lives 

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:48.750
 although not commercial 

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:48.750
 structures free strange 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:52.059
 skil outsider
