make<00:03:57.450> an<00:03:57.570> imaginary<00:03:57.780> line<00:03:58.140> where<00:03:58.740> that<00:03:59.550> center

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
make an imaginary line where that center

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.370 
make an imaginary line where that center
part<00:04:00.120> is<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.660> you're<00:04:00.780> basically<00:04:01.050> just<00:04:01.170> gonna

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
part is and you're basically just gonna

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.220 
part is and you're basically just gonna
pleat<00:04:01.770> across<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:03.240> line<00:04:04.070> basically<00:04:05.070> plea

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
pleat across that line basically plea

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.530 
pleat across that line basically plea
accordion<00:04:07.230> fan<00:04:08.130> whatever<00:04:08.820> you<00:04:09.060> want<00:04:09.240> to<00:04:09.330> call

accordion fan whatever you want to call

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.910 
accordion fan whatever you want to call
it<00:04:09.720> that's<00:04:09.900> basically<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.530> pattern<00:04:10.710> that

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
it that's basically the pattern that

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.560 
it that's basically the pattern that
you're<00:04:11.040> gonna<00:04:11.190> make<00:04:11.430> because<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:12.180> want<00:04:12.390> it<00:04:12.480> to

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
you're gonna make because you want it to

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:32.040 
you're gonna make because you want it to
be<00:04:12.750> gathered<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.460> front

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.629 

it<00:04:33.050> should<00:04:33.259> look<00:04:33.379> something<00:04:33.650> like<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:34.220> and

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
it should look something like this and

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.149 
it should look something like this and
then<00:04:34.970> you're<00:04:35.150> going<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.449> flip<00:04:35.930> it<00:04:36.379> over<00:04:36.560> so<00:04:37.099> you

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
then you're going to flip it over so you

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.830 
then you're going to flip it over so you
have<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.460> reverse<00:04:37.610> side<00:04:37.970> facing<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.629> and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
have the reverse side facing you and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.140 
have the reverse side facing you and
then<00:04:38.919> you're<00:04:39.919> going<00:04:40.099> to<00:04:40.460> thread<00:04:40.939> your<00:04:41.120> needle

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
then you're going to thread your needle

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.909 
then you're going to thread your needle
if<00:04:41.629> it's<00:04:41.840> not<00:04:41.990> already<00:04:42.259> threaded<00:04:42.530> and

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
if it's not already threaded and

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.189 
if it's not already threaded and
basically<00:04:43.759> you're<00:04:44.060> going<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.599> take<00:04:45.020> your

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
basically you're going to take your

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.689 
basically you're going to take your
needle<00:04:45.409> and<00:04:45.680> go<00:04:45.770> through<00:04:45.979> each<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.610> every
