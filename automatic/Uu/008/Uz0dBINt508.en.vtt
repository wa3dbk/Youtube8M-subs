anymore<00:02:58.049> you<00:02:58.470> know<00:02:59.209> it<00:03:00.209> wasn't<00:03:00.390> decision<00:03:00.900> I

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
anymore you know it wasn't decision I

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.530 
anymore you know it wasn't decision I
made<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:02.010> overnight<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.910> think<00:03:03.269> some<00:03:03.450> people

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
made just overnight I think some people

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.630 
made just overnight I think some people
might<00:03:03.900> may<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.410> come<00:03:04.560> out<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.829> that<00:03:04.890> but

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.979 
might may have come out like that but
I'd<00:03:05.730> been<00:03:05.910> thinking<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.780> know<00:03:06.900> a<00:03:06.930> couple

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.040 
moments stand out that they were the win
against<00:04:07.769> Aberdeen<00:04:08.070> or<00:04:08.430> well<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:09.540> who

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
against Aberdeen or well the who

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.110 
against Aberdeen or well the who
actually<00:04:10.200> lost<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.950> second<00:04:11.730> leg<00:04:11.850> but<00:04:12.030> we

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
actually lost the the second leg but we

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.460 
actually lost the the second leg but we
went<00:04:12.300> through<00:04:12.510> against<00:04:12.750> everything<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.320> was

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
went through against everything that was

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.320 
went through against everything that was
that<00:04:14.340> was<00:04:14.489> probably<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.910> best<00:04:15.120> I've<00:04:15.239> ever

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
that was probably the best I've ever

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.710 
that was probably the best I've ever
felt<00:04:15.450> after<00:04:15.900> again<00:04:16.140> because<00:04:17.090> obviously<00:04:18.090> Irish

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
felt after again because obviously Irish

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.330 
felt after again because obviously Irish
clubs<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.500> Europe<00:04:19.709> hadn't<00:04:19.919> done<00:04:20.040> well<00:04:20.220> over

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
clubs in Europe hadn't done well over

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.099 
clubs in Europe hadn't done well over
the<00:04:20.489> years<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.910> we<00:04:21.450> we've<00:04:21.810> got<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:21.959> good

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
the years and we we've got a good

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.770 
the years and we we've got a good
without<00:04:22.230> a<00:04:22.560> result<00:04:22.890> out<00:04:23.010> in<00:04:23.160> Aberdeen<00:04:23.520> and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
without a result out in Aberdeen and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.180 
without a result out in Aberdeen and
people<00:04:24.780> were<00:04:24.990> probably<00:04:25.470> writing<00:04:25.680> us<00:04:25.830> off<00:04:25.979> and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
people were probably writing us off and

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.950 
people were probably writing us off and
not<00:04:26.460> a<00:04:26.490> no<00:04:26.850> expectedness<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.570> finish<00:04:27.870> a<00:04:27.930> job

not a no expectedness to finish a job

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.260 
not a no expectedness to finish a job
but<00:04:28.320> we<00:04:29.220> did<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.460> against<00:04:29.700> the<00:04:29.820> odds<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:30.090> man

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
but we did it against the odds a man

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.510 
but we did it against the odds a man
sent<00:04:30.510> off<00:04:30.660> scored<00:04:31.320> an<00:04:31.410> own<00:04:31.470> goal<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.400> know
