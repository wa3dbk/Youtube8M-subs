it's really good brush dragons early

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.020 
it's really good brush dragons early
game<00:05:21.140> because<00:05:21.350> you<00:05:21.440> want<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.680> color<00:05:22.550> lock<00:05:22.790> them

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
game because you want to color lock them

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.990 
game because you want to color lock them
and<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:23.950> you<00:05:24.950> only<00:05:25.040> limit<00:05:25.460> them<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.610> like<00:05:25.850> one

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
and so you only limit them to like one

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.890 
and so you only limit them to like one
color<00:05:26.150> if<00:05:26.450> it's<00:05:26.630> early<00:05:27.110> game<00:05:27.700> Baylor<00:05:28.700> I<00:05:29.090> put

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
color if it's early game Baylor I put

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.450 
color if it's early game Baylor I put
this<00:05:29.990> in<00:05:30.140> mare<00:05:30.380> matched<00:05:30.590> for<00:05:30.830> last<00:05:31.130> second

just<00:05:31.640> good<00:05:31.790> like<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:32.320> want<00:05:33.320> something<00:05:33.620> if<00:05:33.740> I

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
just good like I want something if I

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.340 
just good like I want something if I
take<00:05:34.010> out<00:05:34.130> skill<00:05:34.370> drain<00:05:34.520> but<00:05:35.200> probably<00:05:36.200> would

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
take out skill drain but probably would

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.480 
take out skill drain but probably would
take<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.590> out<00:05:37.660> 3<00:05:38.660> i'm<00:05:38.780> was<00:05:38.900> teased<00:05:39.110> before<00:05:40.100> used

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
take it out 3 i'm was teased before used

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.060 
take it out 3 i'm was teased before used

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
to be too Emma seen wingbeat I even made

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.070 
to be too Emma seen wingbeat I even made
that<00:05:43.250> blade<00:05:43.430> before<00:05:43.730> but<00:05:44.090> maybe<00:05:44.420> just<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:45.050> a

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
that blade before but maybe just to a

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.060 
that blade before but maybe just to a
supercar<00:05:46.510> debunk<00:05:47.510> this<00:05:48.020> was<00:05:48.230> a<00:05:48.260> second<00:05:48.950> call

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070

supercar debunk this was a second call
before<00:05:49.340> my<00:05:49.520> took<00:05:49.700> it<00:05:49.790> out<00:05:49.880> just<00:05:50.030> because<00:05:50.180> I

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:50.270 
before my took it out just because I

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.230 
before my took it out just because I
water<00:05:50.630> would<00:05:50.810> popular<00:05:51.700> the<00:05:52.700> double<00:05:53.120> my

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
water would popular the double my

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.140 
water would popular the double my
crushers<00:05:54.190> they<00:05:55.190> were<00:05:55.250> DNA<00:05:55.670> surgeries<00:05:56.030> before

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
crushers they were DNA surgeries before

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.910 
crushers they were DNA surgeries before
but<00:05:56.630> I<00:05:56.840> take<00:05:57.110> them<00:05:57.230> out<00:05:57.320> for<00:05:57.350> my<00:05:57.590> conscious

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
but I take them out for my conscious

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.190 
but I take them out for my conscious
just<00:05:58.100> is<00:05:58.280> like<00:05:58.400> water<00:05:59.180> was<00:05:59.420> popular<00:05:59.750> too<00:05:59.930> so<00:06:00.140> I

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
just is like water was popular too so I

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200
