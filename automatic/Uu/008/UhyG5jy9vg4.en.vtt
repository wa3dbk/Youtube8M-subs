00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.240
 hello everyone today we will spend 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.900
 unpacking a small review of new items from 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.070
 intel corporations 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.630
 called intel galileo in october 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.170
 2013 intel presented 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.330
 its first version of this microcomputer 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.119
 unfortunately today in 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.279
 official sales in the territory 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.779
 Russian Federation, he has not yet appeared 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.610
 but you can already order it by 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.860
 in a number of online stores of American 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.090
 priced at about 70 dollars but i think 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.590
 that the delivery will be a little more than a hundred 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.140
 so we are for our video review 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.980
 we use the developer version which 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.450
 may differ slightly from worse 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.530
 lies in the contents of this box about 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.379
 which we will tell you now I think 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.160
 that the main difference is the absence 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.109
 special promotional stickers with 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.670
 an image of harry maiden himself in honor 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.109
 which is actually named 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 microcomputer is also missing 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.570
 figures not astronaut who is now 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:12.180
 can be fun googling in various 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.619
 sources and so here you will in 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 mutual friends what are we going to do about it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.159
 we do not know yet but this is the topic of the next 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:25.159
 review 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.159
 actually waiting for us inside 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.740
 packed payment 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.740
 product itself 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.560
 he looks like 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.570
 enough and with anal 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.760
 the charger is bad and plenty 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.280
 charger adapter with 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.880
 based on the features of their use 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:02.850
 in different countries it seems to me 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.380
 much more fun than a country and drive 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.660
 on whether py led is 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.820
 highly integrated board size 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.250
 a little more credit card on your 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.550
 the board has an intel quark processor 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.440
 x1000 frequency of 400 megahertz maternal 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.190
 the board is equipped with flash memory 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.230
 of 8 megabytes and RAM 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.260
 256 megabytes is also equipped with 100 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.070
 megabit on the wan port micro sd connector 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 slot mini pisya express and rs-232 ports 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.709
 and of course 20 supporting 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.750
 Connect up to 128 Galileo devices 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.800
 can work under management 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.660
 lightweight version linux supports 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.209
 arduino development standard youtube 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.470
 compared to other arduino cards 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.690
 Galileo has several features 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.030
 approximately from dice the lot has its own 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.760
 controller data exchange is carried out 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.549
 without participation from PR lan port also 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 works without help from public relations for the first time 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.799
 implemented full write express 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.430
 slot allows you to install cards 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.170
 such as wi-fi bluetooth and 3g in general 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.769
 microprocessors such as belel can 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.489
 used in many areas 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.480
 starting from controlling robotics and 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.700
 finishing up 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.690
 different incoming systems 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.430
 suitable under 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.319
 concept of internet tanks for 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.659
 deploying your own solutions can 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:25.080
 will use different platforms a 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.940
 roughly what is the process control 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.980
 it will be easy enough through 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.920
 mobile application on your phone 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.569
 for example thanks to a voice platform 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.610
 which now goes quite a lot 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.560
 of talk 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.440
 I conclude we can say that such 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.670
 microprocessor such as 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.560
 ordered gives an excellent opportunity for 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.489
 creating your own products and when 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.489
 this is in our opinion quite budget 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.720
 This was a review of the product intel galileo 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.720
 all successful developments
