00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the Sherman's didn't really change all

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.819 
the Sherman's didn't really change all
that<00:03:07.170> much<00:03:07.230> except<00:03:08.150> sound<00:03:09.150> effects<00:03:09.689> and<00:03:10.230> that

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
that much except sound effects and that

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.940 
that much except sound effects and that
pretty<00:03:11.010> much<00:03:11.599> went<00:03:12.599> with<00:03:12.780> every<00:03:13.709> single

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
pretty much went with every single

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.099 
pretty much went with every single
vehicle<00:03:14.579> I<00:03:14.819> mean<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> same<00:03:15.389> vehicles<00:03:15.900> they

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
vehicle I mean the same vehicles they

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.990 
vehicle I mean the same vehicles they
just<00:03:16.319> underwent<00:03:17.129> sound<00:03:17.549> effect<00:03:17.999> changes<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.760 

yes<00:03:21.540> it<00:03:21.990> sounds<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.530> lot<00:03:22.740> better<00:03:23.060> on<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.450> mod

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
yes it sounds a lot better on this mod

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.000 
yes it sounds a lot better on this mod
but<00:03:26.600> overall<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.780> mean<00:03:28.170> some<00:03:28.410> parts<00:03:28.800> of<00:03:28.920> the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
but overall I mean some parts of the

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.310 
but overall I mean some parts of the
gameplay<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.610> still<00:03:29.850> about<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> same<00:03:30.450> but

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
gameplay is still about the same but

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.110 
gameplay is still about the same but
yeah<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.530> want<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.800> do<00:03:31.920> more<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.610> Forgotten

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
yeah I want to do more of the Forgotten

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.930 
yeah I want to do more of the Forgotten
hope<00:03:33.300> stuff<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.870> show<00:03:34.320> off<00:03:34.470> some<00:03:34.800> more<00:03:35.040> maps

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
hope stuff and show off some more maps

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.570 
hope stuff and show off some more maps
and<00:03:36.420> some<00:03:36.660> more<00:03:36.810> weapons<00:03:37.260> but<00:03:38.010> this<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.460> a

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
and some more weapons but this is just a

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.910 
and some more weapons but this is just a
basic<00:03:38.790> load<00:03:39.330> down<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.350> basic<00:03:40.680> run

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
basic load down and just a basic run

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.880 
basic load down and just a basic run
through

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
through

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.890 
through
and<00:03:42.040> this<00:03:42.460> is<00:03:42.580> another<00:03:42.940> addition<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.690> mod

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
and this is another addition to the mod

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.960 
and this is another addition to the mod
a<00:03:44.230> Panzer<00:03:45.220> 4-h

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.570 

panzer<00:03:49.300> for<00:03:49.510> house<00:03:49.660> h<00:03:49.990> version<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.400> of<00:03:51.430> the

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
panzer for house h version one of the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.680 
panzer for house h version one of the
later<00:03:51.820> versions

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
later versions

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.850 
later versions
I<00:03:53.750> think<00:03:54.470> this<00:03:54.740> is<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.070> last<00:03:55.340> version<00:03:55.730> of<00:03:56.090> the

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
I think this is the last version of the

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.250 
I think this is the last version of the
or<00:03:56.980> that<00:03:57.160> was<00:03:57.310> actually<00:03:57.730> massively<00:03:58.030> proved

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.920

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.180 
windmill on this bike in the windmill is
very<00:04:31.340> useful

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.190 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.360 

although<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.120> not<00:04:35.330> really<00:04:35.510> a<00:04:35.660> map<00:04:36.110> or<00:04:36.950> not

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
although it's not really a map or not

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.330 
although it's not really a map or not
really<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.850> flag<00:04:38.240> on<00:04:38.600> this<00:04:38.810> map<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:39.410> still<00:04:39.680> a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
really a flag on this map it's still a

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.140 
really a flag on this map it's still a
good<00:04:41.150> place<00:04:41.420> to<00:04:41.600> hold<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.640> my<00:04:43.640> tank<00:04:43.910> got

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
good place to hold and my tank got

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.220 
good place to hold and my tank got
zapped<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:44.720> now<00:04:44.840> that<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.110> just<00:04:45.140> got<00:04:45.350> killed

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:56.660 

this<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:50.010> the<00:04:51.080> m36<00:04:52.080> jackson<00:04:52.290> and

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:01.300

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
so we're not really winning anymore

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.760 
so we're not really winning anymore
we're<00:05:14.389> definitely<00:05:14.600> gonna<00:05:15.110> lose<00:05:15.560> this

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
we're definitely gonna lose this

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.310 
lose I might as well just talk a little
bit<00:05:54.520> about<00:05:54.640> the<00:05:55.030> map<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.510> do<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.080> bit<00:05:56.230> of

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
bit about the map and do a bit of

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.640 
bit about the map and do a bit of
strategy<00:05:56.530> stuff<00:05:57.100> again<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:58.470> like<00:05:59.470> the

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
strategy stuff again so like the

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.960 
strategy stuff again so like the
original<00:06:00.160> map<00:06:00.400> this<00:06:00.760> map<00:06:01.120> is<00:06:01.570> sort<00:06:02.530> of<00:06:02.650> like

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
original map this map is sort of like

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.200 
original map this map is sort of like
the<00:06:03.970> vanilla<00:06:04.330> version<00:06:05.700> except<00:06:06.700> you<00:06:07.030> know<00:06:07.150> you

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:07.210 
the vanilla version except you know you

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.750 
the vanilla version except you know you
get<00:06:07.420> new<00:06:07.720> weapons<00:06:08.200> you<00:06:08.440> have<00:06:08.470> new<00:06:08.890> ways<00:06:09.490> of

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
get new weapons you have new ways of

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.000 
get new weapons you have new ways of
using<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.450> weapons<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:12.060> I<00:06:13.060> think<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.860> know

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.010 
using the weapons and I think you know

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.700 
using the weapons and I think you know
if<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.820> get<00:06:15.970> if<00:06:16.240> you<00:06:16.510> know<00:06:16.780> how<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:16.960> you

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
if you get if you know how to you

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.040 
if you get if you know how to you
play<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.400> original<00:06:18.810> version<00:06:19.810> of<00:06:19.930> the

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
play the original version of the

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.410 
play the original version of the
battlefield<00:06:20.470> 1942<00:06:20.980> I<00:06:21.310> really<00:06:22.150> don't<00:06:22.330> think

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
battlefield 1942 I really don't think

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.020 
battlefield 1942 I really don't think
you're<00:06:22.660> gonna<00:06:22.810> have<00:06:23.020> any<00:06:23.530> problems<00:06:24.040> and<00:06:24.400> I

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:25.030 
you're gonna have any problems and I

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.400 
you're gonna have any problems and I
think<00:06:25.090> a<00:06:25.390> lot<00:06:25.540> of<00:06:25.630> things<00:06:25.810> are<00:06:25.960> even<00:06:26.170> more

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
think a lot of things are even more

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.580 
think a lot of things are even more
improved

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
improved

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.580 
improved
like<00:06:28.130> planes<00:06:28.760> I<00:06:29.060> think<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.840> planes<00:06:30.140> are<00:06:30.350> more

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:30.590 
like planes I think the planes are more

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.490 
like planes I think the planes are more
balanced<00:06:31.430> in<00:06:31.640> this<00:06:31.850> game<00:06:32.150> than<00:06:32.720> the<00:06:32.930> original

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
balanced in this game than the original

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.760 
balanced in this game than the original
battle<00:06:34.070> to<00:06:34.220> 1942<00:06:34.910> it's<00:06:35.690> more<00:06:35.990> balanced<00:06:36.530> and

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:36.770 
battle to 1942 it's more balanced and

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.040 
battle to 1942 it's more balanced and
yeah<00:06:37.340> there<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.760> almost<00:06:38.120> actually<00:06:38.720> managed<00:06:38.960> to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
yeah there I almost actually managed to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.000 
yeah there I almost actually managed to
take<00:06:39.260> out<00:06:39.410> that<00:06:39.680> enemy<00:06:40.400> Thunderbolt<00:06:41.150> but<00:06:42.080> as<00:06:42.320> I

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
take out that enemy Thunderbolt but as I

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.160 
take out that enemy Thunderbolt but as I
was<00:06:43.100> saying<00:06:43.160> you<00:06:43.670> know<00:06:43.790> it's<00:06:44.120> more<00:06:44.420> balanced

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:45.170 
was saying you know it's more balanced

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.100 
was saying you know it's more balanced
but<00:06:46.130> it's<00:06:46.340> still<00:06:46.610> hard<00:06:46.880> since<00:06:47.420> it's<00:06:47.600> balanced

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
but it's still hard since it's balanced

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.350 
but it's still hard since it's balanced
and<00:06:48.200> more<00:06:48.670> realistically<00:06:49.670> it's<00:06:49.970> harder<00:06:50.240> to

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
and more realistically it's harder to

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360 
and more realistically it's harder to
drive<00:06:50.660> now<00:06:50.930> and<00:06:51.620> I<00:06:51.710> want<00:06:51.860> to<00:06:51.920> take<00:06:52.040> this<00:06:52.160> guy

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
drive now and I want to take this guy

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.480 
drive now and I want to take this guy
out<00:06:53.080> we<00:06:54.080> go

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:55.490 
out we go

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.390 
out we go
it's<00:06:55.970> gone

00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.180 

I<00:06:58.460> think<00:06:59.210> yeah<00:06:59.360> he<00:06:59.540> crashed<00:06:59.870> onto<00:07:00.110> the<00:07:00.410> our

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
I think yeah he crashed onto the our

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:04.129 
I think yeah he crashed onto the our
flak<00:07:01.759> gun

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.460 

coming<00:07:04.469> around<00:07:04.620> for<00:07:05.069> a<00:07:05.129> strafing<00:07:05.580> run

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470 
coming around for a strafing run

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.900 
coming around for a strafing run
Comikaze

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.580 

yeah<00:07:12.480> I<00:07:12.510> think<00:07:12.630> I<00:07:12.840> actually<00:07:13.020> missed<00:07:13.500> that

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.590 
yeah I think I actually missed that

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.739 
yeah I think I actually missed that
kamikaze<00:07:14.310> attack<00:07:14.580> Oh<00:07:17.960> No

00:07:21.739 --> 00:07:21.749 

00:07:21.749 --> 00:07:23.779 

and<00:07:21.929> there<00:07:22.409> we<00:07:22.499> go<00:07:22.529> the<00:07:23.069> Rams<00:07:23.249> about<00:07:23.519> to<00:07:23.699> be

00:07:23.779 --> 00:07:23.789 
and there we go the Rams about to be

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:29.999 
and there we go the Rams about to be
over<00:07:24.619> so<00:07:25.619> we'll<00:07:25.769> see<00:07:25.949> you<00:07:25.979> next<00:07:26.159> time
