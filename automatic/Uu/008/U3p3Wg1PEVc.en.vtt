basically an insta ko or at least I

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.229 
basically an insta ko or at least I
think<00:00:47.289> it<00:00:47.559> is<00:00:47.590> I<00:00:48.160> think<00:00:48.610> this<00:00:48.730> is<00:00:48.850> really<00:00:49.120> cool

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
think it is I think this is really cool

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.729 
think it is I think this is really cool
because<00:00:49.390> I<00:00:49.600> mean<00:00:49.960> there's<00:00:50.170> not<00:00:50.289> much<00:00:50.440> else<00:00:50.590> I

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
because I mean there's not much else I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.869 
because I mean there's not much else I
could<00:00:50.890> have<00:00:50.950> seen<00:00:51.129> them<00:00:51.280> doing<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.640> could<00:00:51.789> as

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
could have seen them doing the could as

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.470 
could have seen them doing the could as
much<00:00:52.030> a<00:00:52.239> creep<00:00:52.600> on<00:00:52.780> screen<00:00:53.739> clear<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:55.449> could

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
much a creep on screen clear they could

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.880 
much a creep on screen clear they could
have<00:00:55.690> done<00:00:55.780> a<00:00:55.840> screen<00:00:56.199> clear<00:00:56.440> like<00:00:56.649> they<00:00:56.829> do

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
have done a screen clear like they do

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.010 
have done a screen clear like they do
with<00:00:57.160> a<00:00:57.460> Ganon<00:00:57.850> but<00:00:58.090> they<00:00:58.360> instead<00:00:58.629> took<00:00:58.870> it<00:00:58.989> a

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
with a Ganon but they instead took it a

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.660 
with a Ganon but they instead took it a
bit<00:00:59.320> further<00:00:59.710> and<00:00:59.890> just<00:01:00.129> give<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.399> cutscene

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
bit further and just give it a cutscene

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.330 
bit further and just give it a cutscene
because<00:01:01.449> I<00:01:01.539> mean<00:01:01.690> it's<00:01:02.320> more<00:01:02.710> war<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:03.070> giving

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
because I mean it's more war of giving

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.340 
because I mean it's more war of giving
into<00:01:03.460> cutscenes<00:01:03.879> or<00:01:04.030> work<00:01:04.270> with<00:01:04.449> time<00:01:04.660> in<00:01:05.110> fact

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
into cutscenes or work with time in fact

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.900 
into cutscenes or work with time in fact
I<00:01:05.530> don't<00:01:05.740> see<00:01:05.920> why<00:01:06.190> Ganon<00:01:06.580> didn't<00:01:06.789> have<00:01:06.880> a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
I don't see why Ganon didn't have a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.620 
I don't see why Ganon didn't have a
cutscene<00:01:07.119> like<00:01:07.539> a<00:01:07.930> screen<00:01:08.800> clear<00:01:09.070> should<00:01:09.610> be<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
cutscene like a screen clear should be a

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.540 
cutscene like a screen clear should be a
cutscene<00:01:10.960> because<00:01:11.530> otherwise<00:01:11.800> I<00:01:12.100> mean<00:01:12.369> it's

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
cutscene because otherwise I mean it's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.130 
cutscene because otherwise I mean it's
just<00:01:12.580> boring<00:01:13.090> you<00:01:13.240> know<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.360> mean<00:01:13.750> personally

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
just boring you know I mean personally

just boring you know I mean personally
personally<00:01:14.590> just<00:01:14.890> boring<00:01:15.280> but<00:01:16.179> yeah<00:01:16.390> and

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
personally just boring but yeah and

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:18.180 
personally just boring but yeah and
getting<00:01:17.140> should<00:01:17.380> work<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.619> same<00:01:17.649> way<00:01:17.830> not

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
getting should work the same way not

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.090 
getting should work the same way not
like<00:01:18.659> not<00:01:19.659> like<00:01:19.810> it<00:01:19.930> does<00:01:20.080> pretty<00:01:20.650> just<00:01:20.860> terms

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
like not like it does pretty just terms

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.590 
like not like it does pretty just terms
in<00:01:21.250> the<00:01:21.310> game<00:01:21.460> and<00:01:21.640> just<00:01:21.729> goes<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.299> should<00:01:22.509> be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
in the game and just goes it should be

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.330 
in the game and just goes it should be
you<00:01:23.110> have<00:01:23.229> to<00:01:23.259> be<00:01:23.380> close<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.680> an<00:01:23.920> enemy<00:01:24.009> to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
you have to be close to an enemy to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.190 
you have to be close to an enemy to
activate<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.420> people<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.869> area

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
activate it and the people in the area

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.020 
activate it and the people in the area
also<00:01:26.380> get<00:01:26.680> cognate<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.250> think<00:01:27.520> that'd<00:01:27.610> be<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.790> way

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
also get cognate I think that'd be a way

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.940 
also get cognate I think that'd be a way
to<00:01:28.090> do<00:01:28.270> it<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:29.049> proper<00:01:29.080> way<00:01:29.500> to<00:01:29.530> do<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:29.830> at

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
to do it the proper way to do it at

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.760 
to do it the proper way to do it at
least<00:01:30.130> but<00:01:30.400> that's<00:01:30.549> my<00:01:30.670> opinion

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.670 

number<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.370> our<00:01:35.640> favorite<00:01:36.240> inch<00:01:36.870> tall

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
number four is our favorite inch tall

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.130 
number four is our favorite inch tall
character<00:01:38.400> Oh<00:01:38.580> mark<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.690> course<00:01:39.900> he's<00:01:40.110> not

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
character Oh mark of course he's not

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
character Oh mark of course he's not
that<00:01:40.440> tall<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.040> game<00:01:41.220> he's<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.640> or<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that tall in the game he's not or it

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.160 
that tall in the game he's not or it
should<00:01:42.210> say<00:01:42.360> he's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.750> short<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
should say he's not that short in the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.710 
should say he's not that short in the
game<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.950> his<00:01:44.250> final<00:01:44.460> smash<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:45.120> brawl<00:01:45.420> was

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
game but his final smash in brawl was

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
game but his final smash in brawl was
the<00:01:45.870> haka<00:01:46.170> Tate<00:01:46.470> ship<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.340> really

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the haka Tate ship this is really

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.330 
the haka Tate ship this is really
interesting<00:01:47.910> that<00:01:48.420> he<00:01:48.979> doesn't<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> in

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
interesting that he doesn't have it in

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.370 
interesting that he doesn't have it in
the<00:01:50.460> new<00:01:50.610> game<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.910> think<00:01:51.119> that's<00:01:51.270> cool<00:01:51.570> that

the ship comes back down and explodes

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.540 
the ship comes back down and explodes
and<00:02:09.570> of<00:02:10.140> course<00:02:10.380> that<00:02:10.649> stays<00:02:10.950> true<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.370> Pikmin

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and of course that stays true the Pikmin

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.430 
and of course that stays true the Pikmin
game<00:02:11.850> because<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.570> your<00:02:12.840> goes<00:02:13.260> up

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
game because you know your goes up

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.199 
game because you know your goes up
of<00:02:13.920> course<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.280> wasn't<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.550> haka<00:02:14.730> Tate<00:02:14.970> ship

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
of course it wasn't the haka Tate ship

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.150 
of course it wasn't the haka Tate ship
in<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.480> game<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:15.959> in<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.500> original<00:02:16.800> Pikmin

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
in that game but in the original Pikmin

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.300 
in that game but in the original Pikmin
your<00:02:17.370> ship<00:02:17.610> crashes<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:19.080> blows<00:02:19.800> up<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
your ship crashes and blows up so I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.400 
your ship crashes and blows up so I
think<00:02:20.520> that's<00:02:20.670> really<00:02:20.910> cool<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.540> they<00:02:21.959> did

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
think that's really cool that they did

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.350 
think that's really cool that they did
that<00:02:22.560> with<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> but<00:02:23.310> with<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> final<00:02:24.030> smash

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that with a but with the final smash

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.479 
that with a but with the final smash

you can also shoot at them
I<00:02:53.220> really<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> landmaster<00:02:54.570> I<00:02:54.720> think

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
I really like the landmaster I think

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:55.540 
I really like the landmaster I think
it's<00:02:55.170> cool

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
it's cool

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.900 
it's cool
it<00:02:55.610> takes<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.910> basically<00:02:56.420> being<00:02:56.630> hyper<00:02:56.870> map<00:02:57.910> and

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
it takes a basically being hyper map and

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.210 
it takes a basically being hyper map and
yeah<00:02:59.480> that's<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.410> about<00:03:00.590> who<00:03:00.770> I<00:03:00.830> have<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.010> say

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
yeah that's it's about who I have to say

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.040 
yeah that's it's about who I have to say
about<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.580> I<00:03:01.670> think<00:03:01.910> it's<00:03:02.030> I<00:03:02.300> think<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.870> kind

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
about it I think it's I think it's kind

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.220 
about it I think it's I think it's kind
of<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.200> waste<00:03:03.380> of<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.910> they're<00:03:05.840> spread<00:03:06.080> across

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
of a waste of that they're spread across

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.530 
of a waste of that they're spread across
three<00:03:06.350> characters<00:03:07.010> though<00:03:07.640> with<00:03:07.850> fox<00:03:08.240> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
three characters though with fox and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.940 
three characters though with fox and
falco<00:03:08.690> there<00:03:09.140> wasn't<00:03:09.470> much<00:03:09.590> he<00:03:09.710> could<00:03:09.740> have

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
falco there wasn't much he could have

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.670 
falco there wasn't much he could have
done<00:03:10.100> won't<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.180> think<00:03:11.870> that<00:03:12.170> they<00:03:12.320> could<00:03:12.590> have

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
done won't I think that they could have

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.940 
done won't I think that they could have
changed<00:03:12.890> the<00:03:13.130> line<00:03:13.310> master<00:03:13.790> to<00:03:14.710> one<00:03:15.710> of<00:03:15.800> his

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
changed the line master to one of his

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.100 
changed the line master to one of his
one<00:03:16.250> of<00:03:16.280> his<00:03:16.400> likes<00:03:16.760> cruisers<00:03:17.540> like<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.930> light

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
one of his likes cruisers like the light

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.320 
one of his likes cruisers like the light
like<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.890> cruisers<00:03:19.280> that<00:03:19.310> box<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:20.000> power<00:03:20.150> I

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
like the cruisers that box of power I

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.550 
like the cruisers that box of power I
think<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.840> would<00:03:20.930> be<00:03:20.960> a<00:03:21.080> more<00:03:21.530> interesting

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
think that would be a more interesting

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.190 
think that would be a more interesting
way<00:03:22.010> to<00:03:22.040> do<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.370> but<00:03:23.330> the<00:03:23.450> landmaster<00:03:23.840> is<00:03:24.020> still

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
way to do it but the landmaster is still

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.180 
way to do it but the landmaster is still
cool<00:03:24.380> nonetheless

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.580 

my<00:03:29.030> number-two<00:03:29.330> pick<00:03:29.810> comes<00:03:30.140> in<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.350> form<00:03:30.530> of

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
my number-two pick comes in the form of
