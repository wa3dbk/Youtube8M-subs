00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.440
 This time to 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.320
 I would like to do b's opening and closing university review 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:30.180
 So let's see it right away The first is the body 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.150
 This is only the old one Here is the new wii u 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.720
 Interface etc 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.710
 This is good 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.880
 b was more compatible with the gamecube 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.579
 You'd turn the type of game cube is lucky 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:51.510
 As eu is only compatible with b 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.510
 And related terminal, such as a game cube does not have a 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.629
 And yeah yeah 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:04.059
 We only had a good child behind us 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.059
 I'd did not you do it only with two visible 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.790
 It is a good 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.100
 this 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.330
 Opened 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.500
 2 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 2 pieces 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.460
 On the back side 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.170
 Sermon meeting of a total of four there will ne trees there meat here 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.310
 As a bad impression 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.619
 Very aim for scratches , dust and dirt 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.619
 Nde member Polished specification 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.930
 Even after only a puff this lightly at Toka tissue 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:45.620
 You will get a slight abrasion 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:48.300
 I think I can not see Kanaya, but it is a small scratch that I can only see with the naked eye 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:52.909
 The mainland is nervous and he is already 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.320
 I think you had to have white mouth 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.440
 Sleep not when 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.850
 Dust and dirt 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.850
 It will be a parade true 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.319
 Blu-ray Disc and dvd play 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:16.129
 In relation to the patent 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.129
 It seems that it was abolished because the cost went up 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:25.060
 Well, I already have a Blu-ray recorder and a system already 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.440
 But people who do not probably fit in should see you have been spread to households I think that most 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.440
 It also has that meaning 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:40.720
 And it is wii u gamepad which is the biggest feature of the right hot water 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.540

 About 500 g 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:52.150
 The biggest thing is that you can play a game by placing Placetal's bed over you can not say with a container 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.780
 Is not the advantage of 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:01.780
 And also the size of the screen 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:05.160
 Copan this is almost the same as the body size of 3 dsll 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.160
 It is almost like this with such feeling 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.660
 Really 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.730
 The screen is big and easy to see 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 The touch sensitivity is also very good 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.050
 Speaking in terms of functionality 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.360

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:05.230
 You can also switch 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:05.230
 And you can see the show and so on 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:23.630
