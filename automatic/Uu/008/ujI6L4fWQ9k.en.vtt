I almost had the 200 plus i'd i'd like

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.170 
I almost had the 200 plus i'd i'd like
one<00:00:54.270> office<00:00:54.870> streak<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.440> i<00:00:56.370> got<00:00:56.760> three<00:00:57.000> sets

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
one office streak and i got three sets

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.729 
one office streak and i got three sets
of<00:00:57.270> streak<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.719> gate<00:00:57.899> three<00:00:58.320> sets<00:00:58.590> of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
of streak in this gate three sets of

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.680 
of streak in this gate three sets of
streaks<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.399> this<00:00:59.550> game<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.969> i<00:01:00.390> ended<00:01:00.539> with

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
streaks in this game and i ended with

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.720 
streaks in this game and i ended with
153<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.770> i<00:01:01.859> would<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.070> got<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.430> one<00:01:02.550> set

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
153 so if i would have got that one set

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.579 
153 so if i would have got that one set
of<00:01:02.820> streaks<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.019> off<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.470> when

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
of streaks I was like two off of it when

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010 
of streaks I was like two off of it when
the<00:01:04.680> guy<00:01:04.769> killed<00:01:05.040> me<00:01:05.129> from<00:01:05.280> behind<00:01:05.510> i'm<00:01:06.510> pretty

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the guy killed me from behind i'm pretty

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.300 
the guy killed me from behind i'm pretty
sure<00:01:07.229> i<00:01:07.260> would<00:01:07.409> i<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> 200<00:01:08.040> kill<00:01:08.159> game

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
sure i would i have the 200 kill game

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.340 
sure i would i have the 200 kill game
but<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.760> know<00:01:08.880> whatever<00:01:09.119> I<00:01:09.510> just<00:01:10.110> felt<00:01:10.290> like

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
but you know whatever I just felt like

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.719 
but you know whatever I just felt like
really<00:01:10.560> confident<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> got<00:01:11.460> into<00:01:11.610> this

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
really confident when I got into this

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.100 
really confident when I got into this
Lobby<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:12.659> how<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.960> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
Lobby and I think that's how you have to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.810 
Lobby and I think that's how you have to
fill<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> lobby

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
fill you know if you go into the lobby

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.859 
fill you know if you go into the lobby
thinking<00:01:15.210> you're<00:01:15.299> going<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> get<00:01:15.600> raped

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
thinking you're going to get raped

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.179 
thinking you're going to get raped
you're<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> do<00:01:16.680> much<00:01:16.860> but

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you're really not going to do much but

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.469 
you're really not going to do much but
if<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.400> go<00:01:17.520> in<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.210> knowing

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
if you go in there just like knowing

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
if you go in there just like knowing
you're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> rape<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.200> kids<00:01:19.580> that's

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
you're going to rape the kids that's

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.679 
you're going to rape the kids that's
pretty<00:01:20.729> much<00:01:20.880> what<00:01:21.060> happens<00:01:21.150> most<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
pretty much what happens most of the

something<00:01:38.040> stupid<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.670> really

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
something stupid like that I really

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.580
