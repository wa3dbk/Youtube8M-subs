00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.640
 Come with me, it was said that the earth 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 it's flat 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:17.100
 no no no no and it can not be the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 classic conference is and circumference 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 land is cheney it was sea because she 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.439
 was to put that name so scrotal in me 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.260
 you were sad because you did not put the name 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.260
 normal will be typical rafael procópio 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.960
 Hello everyone 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.360
 I am professor rafael himself, this is the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.579
 river math channel and in this video I 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.420
 I'll show you how more than two thousand years 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.989
 behind 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 a mathematician called eratostenes 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.539
 calculated the circumference of the planet 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:55.350
 earth eratethenes beyond mathematical 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.180
 geographer astronomer was also athlete and is 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.289
 one of the good athletes he practiced 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.449
 pentathlon 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.969
 but he was commonly called in his 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
 there are many theories to be 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.299
 respect for that name 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 Here I find it cooler than him. 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 despite being good at many things never 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.670
 It was the best 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.760
 one of these things being always the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.750
 I do not know and I remember a team of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.030
 football but apparently this beta name 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.159
 was given perhaps because he will occupy the room 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.460
 of number 2 in the alexandria library 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.979
 era after tennis was the chief librarian 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.799
 from alexandria's library 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.360
 thousands of years ago when 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.880
 was still sure that the earth was 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 erathostenes calculated its 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 circumference as he reasoned 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.759
 notice only after three realized that the medium 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.409
 day of the summer solstice in a city 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.040
 which lies further south from alexandria 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.869
 call your the sun the sun's rays do not 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.020
 no angle, ie there was no 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.479
 shadows in this city and at the same time 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.000
 alexandria that was where he lived the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.329
 the sun's rays were at a certain angle or 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.700
 whether there was any substantial shadow in the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.740
 city ​​of alexandria at the same time and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.459
 this would not be possible if the land were 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.500
 flat then it was after tennis paid to a 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.620
 man to walk this distance 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.270
 between alexandria and asuã and this man 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.270
 determined that the distance between the two 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.350
 cities was approximately 800 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.230
 kilometers 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.910
 and then in possession of such information and 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.980
 using a little geometry he 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.050
 was able to determine the extent of 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.870
 circumference of planet earth 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.820
 for this he used geometry 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.820
 that is, it did not use any 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.780
 device nothing just your brain pencils and 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.900
 paper 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.560
 no sophistication eratostenes thought 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.480
 the sun is far away from planet earth 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.000
 then the sun's rays arrive on the planet 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.230
 parallel land because of this great 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.850
 distance 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.310
 and then as they suppose the earth is 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.320
 and there was the distance between 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.180
 alexandria and asuã 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.970
 he realized the following how cities 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.120
 of alexandria and yours are not in the same 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.730
 latitude, they make a certain degree of 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.739
 the spoke of these two cities the 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.270
 connecting the center of the earth to 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.760
 these two cities 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.440
 and then as the solar rays are parallel 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.930
 this segment that joins the center of the earth 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.540
 to the city of alexandria if it were 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.540
 extended to turn it into a straight line 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.360
 would be a straight line across these rays 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.970
 and there by the properties of the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.980
 angles of two cut parallel lines 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.500
 by a transversal we know that the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.350
 angles to the internal terms have the same 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:40.890
 measure was calculated that this 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.850
 measure would be approximately 7.2 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.950
 degrees 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:47.610
 as we know that the angle relative to a 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.700
 round is 360 degrees to know 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:54.480
 which fraction corresponds to 7.2 degrees 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.920
 we just divide 360 degrees by 7.2 degrees 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.090
 and this will give 50 that is this piece 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:05.430
 between alexandria and asuã to 1 50 targets of 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.560
 all the circumference of the earth then 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.780
 to calculate the circumference of the earth 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.170
 It is enough that we multiply 800 kilometers 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.900
 by 50, which gives the measure almost exactly 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.030
 a minimum error in relation to the actual measurement 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.890
 of the Earth's circumference 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.729
 it is considered that the circumference of the 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.890
 land is 40,000 and 74 kilometers 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.510
 it is a very small mistake if we take 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.640
 consideration 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.140
 these calculations have been made more 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.870
 two thousand years ago 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.030
 It is an extraordinary feat for a man with 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.940
 just your brain a pencil and a paper 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.850
 have calculated so accurately the 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.240
 circumference of the whole planet earth 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.670
 even more so at a time when people 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.110
 They believed that the earth was flat to 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.020
 first demonstration that the planet 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.630
 earth was not spherical plain came with 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.120
 the circumnavigation of the planet earth made 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.280
 by fernando de maralhães navigator 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.340
 Portuguese funded by the crown 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.680
 Spanish that in the 16th century 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.970
 then made really grandiose to go 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.370
 the torch they used 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.410
 to calculate the 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.120
 circumference of the planet earth there is more 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.640
 2,000 years ago 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.710
 Good how in this video I dealt with 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.120
 mathematical applications to calculations 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:20.030
 astronomical 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.850
 I want to recommend here the blog astro pt 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.620
 who was voted the best science blog 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.750
 2012 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.240
 I also recommend the universe page 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.790
 rationalist on Facebook and the 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.620
 math river and general science
