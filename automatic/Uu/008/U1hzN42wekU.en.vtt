00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
first time I did this I had a very it's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.070 
first time I did this I had a very it's
a<00:00:28.140> much<00:00:28.560> cheaper<00:00:29.060> mini<00:00:30.060> DV<00:00:30.390> camcorder<00:00:30.599> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
a much cheaper mini DV camcorder that

a much cheaper mini DV camcorder that
didn't<00:00:31.830> have<00:00:31.980> any<00:00:32.430> internal<00:00:32.820> or<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:34.790> external

didn't have any internal or any external
audio<00:00:36.180> inputs<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> was<00:00:37.350> forced<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.680> use<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
audio inputs so I was forced to use the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.240 
audio inputs so I was forced to use the
onboard<00:00:38.550> microphone<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.620> went<00:00:40.770> bad<00:00:40.920> and

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
onboard microphone and it went bad and

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.869 
onboard microphone and it went bad and
went<00:00:41.520> badly

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
went badly

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.400 
went badly
um<00:00:42.800> yet<00:00:43.800> picked<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.850> room<00:00:45.030> noise

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
um yet picked up all the room noise

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.410 
um yet picked up all the room noise
anytime<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.590> air<00:00:46.680> creature<00:00:46.950> came<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.850> got

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
anytime the air creature came on it got

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.010 
anytime the air creature came on it got
loud<00:00:49.430> even<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.879> tape<00:00:51.270> drive<00:00:51.480> mechanism

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
loud even the the tape drive mechanism

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.779 
loud even the the tape drive mechanism
on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.620> camcorder<00:00:52.949> itself<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.610> hear

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
on the camcorder itself you could hear

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.900 
on the camcorder itself you could hear
it<00:00:53.879> very<00:00:54.059> very<00:00:54.239> plainly<00:00:55.610> don't<00:00:56.610> working<00:00:56.820> on

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
it very very plainly don't working on

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.560 
it very very plainly don't working on

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in it and it's a really good camcorder I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.289 
in it and it's a really good camcorder I
really<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> lot

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
really like it a lot

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
really like it a lot
I've<00:01:12.299> also<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.689> depth<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.560> field<00:01:13.710> adapter<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
I've also got depth of field adapter and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.520 
I've also got depth of field adapter and
and<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.689> makes<00:01:15.900> things<00:01:16.049> look<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.290> lot<00:01:16.409> more

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
and it makes things look a lot more

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.140 
and it makes things look a lot more
professional<00:01:16.640> but<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:17.850> thing<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
professional but the one thing that I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.999 
professional but the one thing that I
really<00:01:18.450> needed<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.659> improve<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.080> was<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
really needed to improve on was the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.940 
really needed to improve on was the
sound<00:01:20.280> how<00:01:20.670> things<00:01:20.909> sound<00:01:21.860> obviously<00:01:22.860> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
sound how things sound obviously I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.999 
sound how things sound obviously I
couldn't<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.790> using<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:25.320> onboard<00:01:25.439> microphone

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
couldn't be using the onboard microphone

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560 
couldn't be using the onboard microphone
for<00:01:26.520> doing<00:01:26.790> interview<00:01:27.060> work<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> wouldn't

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
for doing interview work and I wouldn't

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.719 
for doing interview work and I wouldn't
want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> anyway<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.829> when<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> add<00:01:29.610> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
want to anyway but when you add the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.640 
want to anyway but when you add the
depth<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> fill<00:01:30.119> adapter<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.869> produces<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
depth of fill adapter it produces a

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
depth of fill adapter it produces a
vibrating<00:01:32.310> noise<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> hear<00:01:32.850> through<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
vibrating noise you can hear through the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.160 
vibrating noise you can hear through the
internal<00:01:34.020> microphone<00:01:34.200> anyway<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.210> been

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
internal microphone anyway so so I been

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.149 
internal microphone anyway so so I been
experimenting<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:37.950> external

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

moost<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.989> rather<00:02:53.230> than<00:02:53.500> than<00:02:53.739> focusing<00:02:54.340> the

it<00:02:57.010> to<00:02:57.160> it's<00:02:57.640> just<00:02:57.910> makes<00:02:58.120> everything<00:02:58.330> louder

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
it to it's just makes everything louder

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.780 
it to it's just makes everything louder
so<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.860> doesn't<00:03:00.100> really<00:03:00.190> work<00:03:00.340> through<00:03:00.459> that

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
so it doesn't really work through that

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.610 
so it doesn't really work through that
well<00:03:00.910> but<00:03:01.180> for<00:03:01.660> outdoor<00:03:01.959> work<00:03:02.170> this<00:03:02.350> works

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
well but for outdoor work this works

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.020 
well but for outdoor work this works
really<00:03:02.920> well<00:03:03.130> because<00:03:03.489> this<00:03:03.670> windscreen

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
really well because this windscreen

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.530 
really well because this windscreen
really<00:03:05.019> cuts<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.350> wind<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.610> here's<00:03:07.300> the

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
um the quality is just a lot better but

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.180 
um the quality is just a lot better but
