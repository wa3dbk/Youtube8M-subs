a<00:02:14.140> little<00:02:14.349> bit<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:14.500> think<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:15.010> have<00:02:15.540> 275<00:02:16.540> up<00:02:16.900> on

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
a little bit I think I have 275 up on

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.399 
a little bit I think I have 275 up on
the<00:02:17.170> bar<00:02:17.349> now<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.830> this<00:02:18.370> was<00:02:18.819> before<00:02:19.720> I

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
the bar now and this was before I

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.309 
the bar now and this was before I
started<00:02:21.220> squatting<00:02:21.519> everyday<00:02:22.299> too<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.959> this

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
started squatting everyday too so this

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.800 
started squatting everyday too so this
still<00:02:23.860> feels<00:02:24.190> like<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.400> challenge<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.299> gotta

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
still feels like a challenge and I gotta

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.509 
still feels like a challenge and I gotta
say<00:02:26.019> guys<00:02:26.200> today<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> actually<00:02:26.830> came<00:02:27.190> back<00:02:27.250> from

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
say guys today I actually came back from

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.050 
say guys today I actually came back from
the<00:02:27.700> gym<00:02:27.940> and<00:02:28.209> I<00:02:29.049> squatted<00:02:30.420> 315<00:02:31.420> for<00:02:32.319> for<00:02:33.060> solid

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the gym and I squatted 315 for for solid

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.500 
the gym and I squatted 315 for for solid
reps<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.660> that's<00:02:35.019> unheard<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.220> for<00:02:36.489> me<00:02:36.640> before

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
reps and that's unheard of for me before

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.330 
reps and that's unheard of for me before
basically<00:02:38.170> my<00:02:38.319> max<00:02:38.530> was<00:02:38.709> 315<00:02:39.519> for<00:02:40.360> like<00:02:40.780> two

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
basically my max was 315 for like two

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.860 
basically my max was 315 for like two
and<00:02:42.340> today<00:02:42.579> I<00:02:42.610> banged<00:02:42.879> out<00:02:43.000> four<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.420> I<00:02:43.660> think

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
and today I banged out four and I think

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.170 
and today I banged out four and I think
I<00:02:43.930> could<00:02:43.989> have<00:02:44.230> gotten<00:02:44.379> another<00:02:44.739> one<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:46.060> is

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
I could have gotten another one which is

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.380 
I could have gotten another one which is
ridiculous<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.349> owe<00:02:47.379> all<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.519> Omari

since<00:04:19.870> I<00:04:19.989> started<00:04:20.229> really<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.680> power

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
since I started really this power

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.640 
since I started really this power
journey<00:04:22.550> that<00:04:23.550> works<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.810> also<00:04:25.200> started

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
journey that works but I also started

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.490 
journey that works but I also started
implementing<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.370> lot<00:04:26.639> more<00:04:26.970> high<00:04:27.900> intensity

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
implementing a lot more high intensity

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.320 
implementing a lot more high intensity
and<00:04:28.680> high<00:04:28.770> frequency<00:04:29.430> which<00:04:29.610> is<00:04:29.790> something

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
and high frequency which is something

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.540 
and high frequency which is something
that<00:04:30.450> they<00:04:30.690> really<00:04:30.900> stress<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.500> their<00:04:31.740> you

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
that they really stress in their you

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.450 
that they really stress in their you
know<00:04:32.610> in<00:04:32.700> their<00:04:32.990> methodology<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.169> this<00:04:35.010> manual

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
know in their methodology of this manual

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.080 
know in their methodology of this manual
and<00:04:35.600> I<00:04:36.600> found<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.380> be<00:04:37.410> extremely<00:04:38.090> helpful

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
and I found it to be extremely helpful

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.210 
and I found it to be extremely helpful
this<00:04:39.330> is<00:04:39.480> actually<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:40.380> way<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.740> used<00:04:41.100> to

this is actually the way that I used to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.270 
this is actually the way that I used to
train<00:04:41.520> all<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.970> time<00:04:42.440> where<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.470> would<00:04:43.710> go<00:04:43.889> hi
