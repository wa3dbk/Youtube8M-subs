00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.850
 I am always artyom and in this video 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.309
 let's go over the color marking 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.090
 hard drives western digital will tell 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.429
 what color for what is needed in d black 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 black color maximum 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.560
 performance as in operations 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.519
 write and read frequency operations 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 spindle rotation 7200 rpm 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.680
 This we have video economical 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.510
 energy consumption decision 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 just four and a half watts a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.020
 This hard disk is consumed by frequency. 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.129
 spindle rotation 5400 rpm 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 if the system needs low 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.730
 the power of the western digital 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.140
 green just for you next red series 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.710
 drives which is intended 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 especially for us servers like 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.719
 home such corporate sector 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.180
 Well, for us, of course, home is relevant 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.690
 sector so if you want to merge 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 multiple drives in a raid array 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.309
 use to store data 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.330
 then just a series of E red for you if 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 talk about the technical characteristics 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.510
 then it is 5400 rpm of rotation 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.760
 64 megabyte spindle cache not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 four and a half watts 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.040
 power consumption next series 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.130
 it was a hard drive for normal 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.000
 home use technical 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.400
 specifications 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.530
 spindle speed 7200 rpm 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.439
 this drive is 1 terabyte 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.759
 In this case, this video is 64 megabytes. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.210
 cache and consumption of 6 8 watts and 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.610
 special series 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 in the rest of the same top purple she 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.159
 designed for the system 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.810
 video streaming record 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.729
 high bitrate nova video and audio 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 but nothing bothers us 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.930
 use this hard drive and in 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.270
 ordinary desktop computers since 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.079
 it is very similar in its characteristics 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.549
 to the grid series what are the technical 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.340
 characteristics in deep purple 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.680
 it's 5400 rpm frequency 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.369
 spindle rotation 64 megabytes 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.709
 cache memory and consumption of 5.1 vata if 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.760
 you want to see more detail about 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.700
 each of these discs that is 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.829
 not on the channel review link will be here in 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.590
 description of the video and directly on 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:22.569
 the video itself is such a brief digression 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.010
 also subscribe to the channel put 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.239
 big thumbs up by this group 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.239
 vkontakte and bye bye
