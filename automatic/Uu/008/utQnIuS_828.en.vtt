but<00:00:36.030> we<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.269> hear<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> helicopter<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.199> both

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
but we can hear the helicopter for both

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.990 
but we can hear the helicopter for both
would<00:00:37.739> obviously<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.280> can't<00:00:38.519> hear<00:00:38.760> anything

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
would obviously we can't hear anything

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.910 
would obviously we can't hear anything
else<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.659> expect<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.170> see<00:00:40.290> machines

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
else but we expect to see machines

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.040

interview<00:00:41.519> shortly<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.180> certainly<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.839> do

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
interview shortly and certainly we do

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.649 
interview shortly and certainly we do
down<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.070> center<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> road<00:00:44.760> knee<00:00:45.149> out<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
down the center of the road knee out and

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.770 
down the center of the road knee out and
it<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.899> Michael<00:00:46.199> Rutter<00:00:46.530> number<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.570> these

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
it is Michael Rutter number one so these

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.360 
it is Michael Rutter number one so these
through<00:00:49.170> gravity<00:00:49.649> shall<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.070> interesting

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
through gravity shall be interesting

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.820 
through gravity shall be interesting
given<00:00:50.790> that<00:00:50.939> time<00:00:51.299> difference<00:00:51.780> now<00:00:51.989> get

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
given that time difference now get

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.259 
given that time difference now get
behind<00:00:53.009> the<00:00:53.369> screen<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:53.939> I<00:00:53.970> would<00:00:54.180> imagine

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
behind the screen so I would imagine

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.749 
behind the screen so I would imagine
with<00:00:55.110> resistance<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.949> optimum<00:00:56.339> here<00:00:56.489> very

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:56.759 
with resistance the optimum here very

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:58.850 
with resistance the optimum here very
very<00:00:57.030> fast<00:00:57.269> approach<00:00:57.720> by<00:00:57.989> John<00:00:58.229> McGinnis<00:00:58.589> but

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
very fast approach by John McGinnis but

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.370 
very fast approach by John McGinnis but
i<00:00:58.920> think<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.790> beyond<00:01:00.180> 10<00:01:00.509> second

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
i think it's beyond 10 second

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.100 
i think it's beyond 10 second
yes<00:01:02.950> it<00:01:03.160> says<00:01:03.370> it<00:01:03.610> five-second<00:01:04.450> lead<00:01:04.600> for<00:01:04.900> John

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
yes it says it five-second lead for John

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.860 
yes it says it five-second lead for John

wouldn't<00:01:47.770> have<00:01:47.860> thought<00:01:47.890> but<00:01:48.640> certainly<00:01:49.030> John

Miller on the Moto cyst machine that
will<00:02:32.020> be<00:02:32.170> disappointment<00:02:32.920> but<00:02:33.040> these<00:02:33.280> Airways

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
will be disappointment but these Airways

carry<00:02:34.240> all<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.630> color<00:02:34.930> commentary<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.800> to

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
carry all this color commentary a to

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.370 
carry all this color commentary a to
America<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:37.090> are<00:02:37.120> they<00:02:37.330> stopped<00:02:37.660> at<00:02:38.050> the

America that are they stopped at the
last<00:02:38.709> bridge<00:02:39.040> so<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.400> don't<00:02:39.670> think<00:02:39.970> there'll<00:02:40.209> be

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
last bridge so I don't think there'll be

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.480 
last bridge so I don't think there'll be
much<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.780> able<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.110> do<00:02:41.260> about<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:41.560> when

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
much to be able to do about that when

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.660 
much to be able to do about that when
one<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:42.970> nation<00:02:43.360> stops<00:02:43.690> well<00:02:43.990> and<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.200> can

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
one of the nation stops well and you can

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670 
one of the nation stops well and you can
Janet<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.150> sometimes<00:02:45.630> it's<00:02:45.870> only<00:02:46.230> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
Janet and sometimes it's only the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.260 
Janet and sometimes it's only the
slightest<00:02:47.250> little<00:02:47.400> thing<00:02:47.550> that's<00:02:47.910> happened

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
slightest little thing that's happened

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.570 
slightest little thing that's happened
like<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> wire<00:02:48.810> coming<00:02:49.170> loose<00:02:49.470> or<00:02:49.739> anything

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
like a wire coming loose or anything

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.760 
like a wire coming loose or anything
that<00:02:50.610> can<00:02:50.970> stop<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.720> things<00:02:51.959> I<00:02:52.200> ring<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.560> but

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
that can stop the things I ring up but

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
that can stop the things I ring up but
with<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:53.400> complications<00:02:54.150> i<00:02:54.270> would

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
with these the complications i would

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.990 
with these the complications i would
expect<00:02:54.690> off<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.739> electrical<00:02:56.250> system<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.849> them

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
expect off the electrical system in them

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.550 
expect off the electrical system in them
with<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.480> batteries<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.050> everything<00:02:58.440> it

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
with the batteries and everything it

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380 
with the batteries and everything it
probably<00:02:58.920> won't<00:02:59.130> be<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.340> flat<00:02:59.790> battery<00:03:00.060> or

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
probably won't be a flat battery or

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.729 
probably won't be a flat battery or
anything<00:03:00.690> like<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:01.080> will<00:03:01.290> probably<00:03:01.470> be

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
anything like that that will probably be

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.540 
anything like that that will probably be
just<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.489> connector<00:03:03.030> so
