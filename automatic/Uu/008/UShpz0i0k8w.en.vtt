00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
it is the emcee it's more about the

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.129 
it is the emcee it's more about the
repetitious<00:03:51.769> hook<00:03:52.010> than<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.790> is<00:03:52.910> about<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.480> real

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
repetitious hook than it is about a real

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.629
