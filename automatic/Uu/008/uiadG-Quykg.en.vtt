00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everybody, welcome, but the video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.600
 here on my channel today to talk about 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.519
 beta is a girl and I do not know if the greater 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 part are not familiar with the target 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.219
 leonine 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.380
 however, these documents ended the 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.240
 if it can be quite interesting but 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.010
 generated for the benefits that affect 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 can still bring to our training 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
 for our evolution 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.080
 Let's talk a little about the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 themes on the day of our body 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 our body produces running energy is 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 three systems 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.029
 the anaerobic system and the system is 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.529
 erotic 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.020
 depending on how fast it is a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 city ​​to finish the activity and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.420
 predominantly use one of these 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.430
 three power systems 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.489
 then during the production of energy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.190
 during the production of atp are generated 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 some by-products called resides a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 tablet and one of these metabolic wastes 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.989
 is well known is called acid 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.760
 and is assured that it appears 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.770
 often associated with that sensation 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.149
 of burning in the muscles that cause 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.350
 some discomfort and pain 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.979
 however the institution is not 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.869
 totally correct because it gives me the body 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.920
 can take advantage of lactic acid to 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.020
 produce energy 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.659
 what happens with instruments is that the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.790
 lactic acid is that the brazil is the touch and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.619
 millions of hydrogen and these are 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.229
 other geniuses are released within the 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.810
 muscle cells eventually decreasing 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 your catch the product words increase 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.520
 the ideas of muscle cells and is 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.280
 precisely this increase in acidity 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.659
 ends up generating muscle fatigue 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 ends up preventing the fibers 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.350
 muscles are against it until 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.240
 a point where everything has explored 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.900
 exercising because you can no longer 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.299
 more 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.220
 however our body is fabulous and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.009
 has some in the face of reassurance 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.229
 agents that will include this increase 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.720
 acidity that will neutralize the increase 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 the acidity of muscle cells 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.220
 allowed and raised for more 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.399
 time and one of these agents that time 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.670
 body is precisely is not it 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.649
 vitalina is one of close to the so-called 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.570
 plant and why pet because it is 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.489
 consisting of two amino acids is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.569
 style ina and now yes and veta the blade 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.999
 this several studies mon 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.159
 what supplementation with potato blade 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.349
 increases the concentration of 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.239
 teaches us in musicians or acts 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.889
 consumer is going to have the girl is swimming 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.810
 Your body's raw material could 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:25.109
 produce more by the plant 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.000
 by standard in split with express training 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.680
 has a higher capacity of 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.969
 concentration of bovine meat in the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.129
 muscles than sedentary individuals 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.719
 or beginner 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.879
 that's why you look at a person 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.590
 who have been training for 10 15 years and weigh 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.060
 to train every day and the pains 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.609
 muscles on the following days are 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.980
 and eyes by a beginner and I 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.709
 I do a more intense workout and Ana above 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.139
 the light increased budget because not 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.659
 has a capacity for concentration through 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:53.609
 such a large plant is one of the reasons 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.139
 from a km point of view 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.879
 looking now for public consultations 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.530
 on alumina 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.269
 let's look forward and one in here 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.709
 description of the video I'll leave everyone 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.290
 all in the video description 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.209
 This is a meta-analysis stayed while 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.919
 that in studies or some 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.840
 investigators have taken the view that the 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:12.209
 on the vitamin given contribution 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 such sporting performance and take 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.709
 some conclusions and secondly 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.109
 analysis will be there the girl seems to be 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.209
 plus one kilo in duration activities in 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.799
 Four minute dispute 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.689
 according to this same analysis, the actual 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.879
 goes installing in duration activities 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.099
 less than one minute are not so 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.560
 significant as that 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.359
 still talking about performance looking 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.220
 forward here two in the description of the 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.169
 video was a study carried out with 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.269
 practicing the team that consumed 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.099
 for seven weeks all have five 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.389
 grams of killing the girl and de facto 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.299
 have been able to increase their performance 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.659
 of the ruler machine were faster to 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.409
 complete your task however by looking 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.780
 forward 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.060
 3 now a study was made a 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.759
 protocol rather slow and 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.680
 and they would if they were not found 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.689
 benefit of the open it nor in the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.340
 performance 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.120
 continuing to look ahead and 4 and 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.439
 5 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.389
 are two studies that do not 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:09.120
 also found benefits size 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:11.699
 my performance of the French study and 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.189
 4 evaluated the contribution of the leonine target 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.190
 in a 400-meter sprint event not 

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.039
 found benefits and offers 5 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.060
 was done with swimming athletes as well 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.550
 there was no 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.050
 benefits associated with the cameras are 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.270
 complete the girl 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.740
 therefore the staff of the bodybuilding 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 avatar still seems to be enough 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.950
 interesting I'm going to talk about the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.960
 conference 6 7 and 8 are three studies that 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.419
 found that those people who 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.850
 consumed beta alanine achieved 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.560
 increase your muscle mass or 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.080
 open blade seems to contribute to 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.220
 increase muscle mass and do all 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.919
 sense 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.230
 consumption of vitamin products 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.820
 expensive plant and therefore your body will 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.600
 able to resuscitate if for more 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.540
 time 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.550
 both you will be able to cause more 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.320
 micro future muscle fibers 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.000
 it will also be heavier and we know 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.830
 that whenever the body recovers and it 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.419
 end up compensating 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.310
 therefore it makes all the sense that it vetoes 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.979
 still contributes to the increase in mass 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.600
 muscle could not finish was without 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.070
 speak in cultural effect rather 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.840
 associated with vitamin 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.460
 many people consume this mine the 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.100
 end up feeling a great deal of 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.800
 itching sensation with whole body 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.380
 it has no name is called before saying 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.330
 however this simply owes the fact 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.310
 If there is a quantity going to London 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.800
 in the bloodstream greater than the 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.870
 body is naturally accustomed and does not 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.550
 appears to be harmful to health 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.700
 But to make it easier, let's go. 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.680
 look forward and 9 was the study that 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.390
 both to this issue this effect 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.970
 collateral and all that the goalkeeper is 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.490
 a conclusion of the lake may be 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.680
 observed symptoms because it said that if 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.789
 be consumed an amount greater than 800 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.580
 milligrams 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.260
 however the symptoms are transient 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.630
 I'm excited about the moment of 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.610
 concentration of london metal in the blood 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.820
 they can be prevented through 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.470
 the bottom of the smaller ones was not 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.120
 found no effect against 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.820
 related to consumption 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.160
 of this amino acid concluding the 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.080
 supplementation, the child seems to be 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.810
 a safe and nutritional strategy 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.720
 capable of improving performance 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.539
 high intensity anaerobic 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.490
 ok everybody is everything in this video I still 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.480
 could talk about the question of when and 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.040
 how to take a shower on the girl but there is a lot 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.260
 thing to say about this theme for me 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.970
 I'll leave this for a later video 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.650
 I hope you have contributed to help 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.050
 to better understand what I do not 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.160
 I can sign what it is 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.890
 which can contribute to our 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.690
 Evolution I like doing what I like 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.910
 video if you have liked subscribing to a 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:47.010
 new channel more videos come and therefore 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.010
 do not miss any until the next
