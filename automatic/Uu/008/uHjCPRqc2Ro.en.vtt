00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and the time is rolling unfortunately so

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.760 
and the time is rolling unfortunately so
this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.189> problem<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.650> he<00:01:19.650> is

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
this is a this is a problem so he is

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
this is a this is a problem so he is
able<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.070> find<00:01:20.220> Kadri<00:01:20.700> you're<00:01:20.909> over<00:01:21.509> the

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
able to find Kadri you're over the

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.800 
able to find Kadri you're over the
middle<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.259> gets<00:01:22.920> 17<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.700> those<00:01:23.790> 19<00:01:24.240> back<00:01:24.540> is

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
middle and gets 17 of those 19 back is

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.050 
middle and gets 17 of those 19 back is
we<00:01:24.960> got<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> manageable<00:01:25.770> third<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.400> but

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
we got a manageable third and two but

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.160 
we got a manageable third and two but
once<00:01:27.570> again<00:01:27.710> clock<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.979> moving<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:30.000> 30<00:01:30.659> seconds

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
once again clock is moving so 30 seconds

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.530 
once again clock is moving so 30 seconds
and<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.770> under<00:01:32.520> now<00:01:32.729> when<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.329> ball

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and and under now when we get this ball

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
and and under now when we get this ball
off<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:34.049> we're<00:01:34.799> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.950> have<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> look<00:01:35.310> for

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
off and we're going to have to look for

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.859 
off and we're going to have to look for
something<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> sidelines<00:01:36.240> most<00:01:36.509> likely

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
something to the sidelines most likely

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.100 
something to the sidelines most likely
so<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.650> looking<00:01:37.770> very<00:01:38.130> quickly<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.060> Kadri<00:01:39.509> he

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
so I'm looking very quickly for Kadri he

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.319 
so I'm looking very quickly for Kadri he
makes<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.680> tough<00:01:41.009> catch<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.549> gets<00:01:41.970> first

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
makes that tough catch and gets first

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.090 
makes that tough catch and gets first
down<00:01:42.540> yardage<00:01:42.659> look<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> that's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
down yardage look at this that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.280 
down yardage look at this that's
impressive<00:01:44.640> making<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> catch<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> getting

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
impressive making the catch and getting

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.130 
impressive making the catch and getting
well<00:01:46.649> presumably<00:01:47.040> both<00:01:47.430> feet<00:01:47.700> down<00:01:47.729> as<00:01:48.149> one

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
well presumably both feet down as one

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.179 
well presumably both feet down as one
thing<00:01:49.290> you'll<00:01:49.409> notice<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.829> madden<00:01:50.070> light

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
thing you'll notice in the madden light

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.679 
thing you'll notice in the madden light
moments<00:01:50.549> I<00:01:50.700> don't<00:01:50.939> think<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.890> replays<00:01:53.689> booth

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
moments I don't think that replays booth

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.289 
moments I don't think that replays booth
replays<00:01:55.079> are<00:01:55.229> accessible<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.950> am<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.880> second

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
replays are accessible I am this second

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.560 
replays are accessible I am this second
in<00:01:57.540> this<00:01:57.899> mode<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.439> Sanchez<00:01:59.100> looking<00:01:59.700> over<00:02:00.270> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in this mode so Sanchez looking over the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.670 
in this mode so Sanchez looking over the
middle<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.320> he<00:02:01.469> finds<00:02:02.009> Keller<00:02:02.549> Dustin<00:02:03.210> Keller

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
middle and he finds Keller Dustin Keller

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.319 
middle and he finds Keller Dustin Keller
turns<00:02:04.680> himself<00:02:04.950> around<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.610> makes<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.969> top

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
turns himself around and makes a top

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.949 
turns himself around and makes a top
catch<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:07.259> traffic<00:02:07.759> had<00:02:08.759> people<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.450> but

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
catch in traffic had people on them but

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.960 
catch in traffic had people on them but
made<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.170> huge<00:02:10.560> catch<00:02:10.830> indeed<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.370> now

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
made a huge catch indeed and now

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.030 
made a huge catch indeed and now
we're<00:02:12.360> set<00:02:12.600> up<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.840> field<00:02:13.080> goal<00:02:13.230> position<00:02:13.470> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
we're set up in field goal position so

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
little attempt to where it actually

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.910
