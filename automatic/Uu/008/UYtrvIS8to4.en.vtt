yo<00:00:05.400> guys<00:00:05.609> spider<00:00:05.940> here<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.420> that<00:00:06.660> we're<00:00:06.779> down

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
yo guys spider here and that we're down

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.290 
yo guys spider here and that we're down
by<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.259> docks<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.069> we<00:00:08.189> found<00:00:08.490> another<00:00:08.849> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
by the docks and we found another a

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.799 
by the docks and we found another a
plane<00:00:10.019> component<00:00:10.740> looks<00:00:10.920> like<00:00:11.219> but<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.570> can't

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
plane component looks like but we can't

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.049 
plane component looks like but we can't
access<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:14.460> got<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> go<00:00:14.790> into<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
access it and we got to go into the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.680 
access it and we got to go into the
afterlife<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.630> access<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.109> there's<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.830> another

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
afterlife to access it there's a another

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.810 
afterlife to access it there's a another
power<00:00:18.690> meter<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.380> voltage<00:00:19.770> meter<00:00:19.949> here<00:00:20.279> that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
power meter or voltage meter here that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.130 
power meter or voltage meter here that
we<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.359> activate<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.810> I'm<00:00:21.900> going<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.050> go

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
we have to activate so I'm going to go

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
we have to activate so I'm going to go
into<00:00:22.289> afterlife<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:24.000> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.150> go<00:00:24.240> in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
into afterlife and I'm going to go in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.630 
into afterlife and I'm going to go in
here<00:00:24.420> i'm<00:00:24.750> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> activate<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.680> that

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
here i'm going to activate it and that

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.870 
here i'm going to activate it and that
shuts<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.480> original<00:00:27.990> door<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:29.220> opens<00:00:29.640> up

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
shuts that original door and it opens up

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
shuts that original door and it opens up
the<00:00:30.570> door<00:00:30.750> behind<00:00:31.050> me<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.679> we<00:00:31.800> go<00:00:31.920> under<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the door behind me so we go under the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.950 
the door behind me so we go under the
door<00:00:32.369> behind<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.640> can't<00:00:33.090> pick<00:00:33.300> stuff<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.750> in

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
door behind me can't pick stuff up in

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.060 
door behind me can't pick stuff up in
the<00:00:34.320> afterlife<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.090> i<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.570> hit

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
the afterlife and i think if you hit

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.770 
the afterlife and i think if you hit
doesn't<00:00:38.070> look<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.180> shut<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> door

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
doesn't look like it's it shut the door

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.990 
doesn't look like it's it shut the door
but<00:00:40.079> if<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.829> go<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> afterlife<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.790> hit

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
but if you go into the afterlife and hit

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.410 
but if you go into the afterlife and hit
that<00:00:42.180> voltage<00:00:42.809> meter<00:00:43.140> again<00:00:43.590> then<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.030> will

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
that voltage meter again then it will

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.779 
that voltage meter again then it will
shut<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.469> inside<00:00:46.950> door<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.460> open<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shut that inside door and open the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
shut that inside door and open the
outside<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.600> revive<00:00:49.170> myself<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.520> so

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
outside one so I revive myself and I so

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.660 
outside one so I revive myself and I so
I<00:00:51.300> can't<00:00:51.690> grab<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.469> part<00:00:52.739> it's<00:00:53.070> actually<00:00:53.370> one

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
I can't grab the part it's actually one

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.580 
I can't grab the part it's actually one
of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> plane<00:00:54.059> parts<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.629> again<00:00:54.840> only<00:00:55.110> one

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
of the plane parts and again only one

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.220 
of the plane parts and again only one
character<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.699> carry<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.360> plane<00:00:57.690> part<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.170> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
character can carry one plane part at a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.869 
character can carry one plane part at a
time<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.680> Axl<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> grab<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.730> it's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
time so Axl is going to grab it and it's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.209 
time so Axl is going to grab it and it's
the<00:01:00.030> tanks<00:01:00.420> it's<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> second<00:01:01.050> item<00:01:01.219> here

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the tanks it's the second item here

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
the tanks it's the second item here
under<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> plane<00:01:02.910> parts<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:04.140> how<00:01:04.350> we're

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
under the plane parts that's how we're

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
under the plane parts that's how we're
presumably<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> bring<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.510> roof

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
presumably going to bring to the roof

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.399 
presumably going to bring to the roof
and<00:01:06.990> assemble<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.220> workbench<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.840> Axl<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
and assemble at the workbench so Axl is

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
and assemble at the workbench so Axl is
going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> grab<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.130> plane<00:01:11.340> parts<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.880> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
going to grab the plane parts because I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
going to grab the plane parts because I
mean<00:01:12.299> me<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.960> man<00:01:13.830> kill<00:01:14.040> are<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.280> only<00:01:14.369> ones

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
mean me and man kill are the only ones

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.770 
mean me and man kill are the only ones
that<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> we're<00:01:15.479> going<00:01:15.600> too<00:01:15.659> fast

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
that have them and we're going too fast

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.969 
that have them and we're going too fast
for<00:01:15.900> cuz<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:16.200> don't<00:01:16.259> know<00:01:16.439> what's<00:01:16.650> taking<00:01:16.799> them

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
for cuz I don't know what's taking them

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.520 
for cuz I don't know what's taking them
so<00:01:17.070> long<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> grab<00:01:17.580> these<00:01:17.759> grab<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
so long to grab these grab the part so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.499 
so long to grab these grab the part so
he<00:01:19.799> finally<00:01:19.979> grot<00:01:20.549> grabs<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.330> we're

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
he finally grot grabs it and we're

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.630 
he finally grot grabs it and we're
trapped<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:21.960> because<00:01:22.350> both<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.710> us<00:01:23.009> both

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
trapped in here because both of us both

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.969 
trapped in here because both of us both
of<00:01:23.850> us<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.180> used<00:01:24.540> our<00:01:24.750> afterlife<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:25.740> this

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
of us have used our afterlife in this

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
of us have used our afterlife in this
round<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:27.990> trapped<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
round so we're both trapped in here I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
round so we're both trapped in here I
mean<00:01:29.490> unless<00:01:29.729> one<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.060> us<00:01:30.210> gets<00:01:30.570> down<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> mean

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
mean unless one of us gets down I mean

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800 
mean unless one of us gets down I mean
presumably<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.950> could<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.340> myself<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
presumably I could down myself and I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.990 
presumably I could down myself and I
mean<00:01:34.229> we<00:01:34.320> haven't<00:01:34.530> tried<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.979> yet<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.939> I

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
mean we haven't tried that yet but I

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
mean we haven't tried that yet but I
should<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.360> able<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.600> down<00:01:36.810> myself<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.770> go

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
should be able to down myself and go

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.370 
should be able to down myself and go
into<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.220> afterlife<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> zap<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.869> voltage

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
into the afterlife and zap the voltage

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.200 
into the afterlife and zap the voltage
meter<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.920> order<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.340> open<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.820> front<00:01:42.090> door

and close the middle one but we didn't

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910
