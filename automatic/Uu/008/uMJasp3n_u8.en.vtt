here's where the a blower box will be
pressurized<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.479> that<00:00:42.570> region<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.430> some

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
as to the nozzle before it gets there

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
as to the nozzle before it gets there
we're<00:00:49.650> gonna<00:00:49.799> run<00:00:50.479> the<00:00:51.479> air<00:00:51.690> flow<00:00:53.930> through

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
we're gonna run the air flow through

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.079 
we're gonna run the air flow through
this<00:00:55.019> channel<00:00:55.290> ducting<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.000> we're<00:00:57.000> gonna

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
this channel ducting and we're gonna

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.469 
this channel ducting and we're gonna
pick<00:00:57.360> up<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.720> 3035<00:00:58.199> degrees<00:00:58.680> of

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
pick up about 3035 degrees of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.990 
pick up about 3035 degrees of

temperature on the air temp right here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.050 
temperature on the air temp right here
before<00:01:03.720> we<00:01:03.809> at<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.989> blower<00:01:04.229> box<00:01:04.500> thus<00:01:05.489> again

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
before we at the blower box thus again

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600 
before we at the blower box thus again
optimizing

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.270 

put<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.760> on

changing over the supplier turn lights
hundred<00:01:16.439> ten<00:01:16.619> volts<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:17.640> big<00:01:17.880> difference<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
hundred ten volts the big difference is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.969 
hundred ten volts the big difference is
just<00:01:18.420> charging<00:01:18.929> you<00:01:19.020> end<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.200> about<00:01:19.469> 12<00:01:19.770> psi

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
just charging you end up about 12 psi

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.930 
just charging you end up about 12 psi
situation<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:25.310> noticed<00:01:26.310> there's<00:01:26.520> somebody's

IR value on it to the size and thickness
the<00:02:22.260> durability<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> all<00:02:23.750> right<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:25.260> what

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
the durability of it all right so what

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.559 
the durability of it all right so what
is<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> difference<00:02:25.980> between<00:02:26.040> what<00:02:26.730> would

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
is the difference between what would

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.720 
is the difference between what would
normally<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:28.080> used<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.650> in<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.280> product

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
normally be used and in this product

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.690 
normally be used and in this product
well<00:02:30.330> some<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:31.130> if<00:02:32.130> your<00:02:32.280> boiler<00:02:32.520> gets

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
well some of it if your boiler gets

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.130 
well some of it if your boiler gets
where<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.940> condensates<00:02:33.480> or<00:02:33.599> whatever<00:02:33.810> someone

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
where it condensates or whatever someone

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.040 
where it condensates or whatever someone
that<00:02:34.260> can<00:02:34.380> crumble<00:02:34.650> this<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.430> pretty<00:02:35.610> durable

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
that can crumble this is pretty durable

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.960 
that can crumble this is pretty durable
if<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.200> see<00:02:37.470> will<00:02:37.770> show<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:38.010> another<00:02:38.400> part<00:02:38.670> we

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
if you see will show you another part we

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.880 
if you see will show you another part we
actually<00:02:39.390> tape<00:02:39.959> all<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.290> joints<00:02:40.530> where<00:02:40.769> we

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
actually tape all the joints where we

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.630 
actually tape all the joints where we
seam<00:02:41.099> it<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.849> I've<00:02:42.300> seen<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.660> last

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.420 

guy<00:02:47.640> brings<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.420> boiler<00:02:48.690> back<00:02:49.220> to<00:02:50.220> get<00:02:50.400> it

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
guy brings a boiler back to get it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.240 
guy brings a boiler back to get it
rebuilt<00:02:50.670> or<00:02:51.269> something<00:02:51.930> he<00:02:52.560> wants<00:02:52.830> done<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.130> it

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
rebuilt or something he wants done to it

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.309 
rebuilt or something he wants done to it
and<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.880> cut<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.299> insulation<00:02:54.870> off<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.260> it

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
and we cut the insulation off and it

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.570 
and we cut the insulation off and it
looks<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.739> day<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:55.890> put<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.280> out<00:02:56.370> there

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
looks like the day we put it out there

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.270 
looks like the day we put it out there
other<00:02:56.910> than<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.269> does<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.160> not

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
other than that does so it's not

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.789 
other than that does so it's not
fiberglass<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.630> looks<00:03:00.810> different<00:03:01.260> what<00:03:01.650> is

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
fiberglass it looks different what is

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.400 
fiberglass it looks different what is
this<00:03:02.209> mineral

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.500 

so<00:03:06.950> you<00:03:07.010> think<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.790> mineral<00:03:08.120> wall<00:03:08.300> is<00:03:08.480> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
so you think the mineral wall is a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.010 
so you think the mineral wall is a
better<00:03:09.110> product<00:03:09.500> yeah<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.600> because<00:03:11.600> it's

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
better product yeah I do because it's

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.600 
better product yeah I do because it's
more<00:03:12.230> durable<00:03:12.440> and<00:03:12.710> it<00:03:12.860> doesn't<00:03:13.190> absorb<00:03:13.460> the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
more durable and it doesn't absorb the

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
more durable and it doesn't absorb the
moisture<00:03:13.730> that's<00:03:14.180> correct

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
moisture that's correct

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.930 
moisture that's correct
all<00:03:14.750> right<00:03:14.990> that's<00:03:15.620> great<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.610> boiler

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
all right that's great and the boiler

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.600 
all right that's great and the boiler
vessel<00:03:17.330> itself<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:18.020> what's<00:03:18.290> wraps<00:03:18.650> with<00:03:19.430> us

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
vessel itself is what's wraps with us

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.900 
vessel itself is what's wraps with us
not<00:03:20.450> glued<00:03:20.870> on<00:03:21.080> to<00:03:21.350> jet<00:03:21.620> panels<00:03:22.280> or<00:03:22.550> something

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
not glued on to jet panels or something

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.240 
not glued on to jet panels or something
like<00:03:23.030> that

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
like that

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.310 
like that
minimal<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.180> this<00:03:25.690> essentially<00:03:25.990> wrapped

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
minimal about this essentially wrapped

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.590 
minimal about this essentially wrapped
and<00:03:27.100> taped<00:03:27.640> onto<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.180> vessel<00:03:28.330> itself<00:03:28.770> Wow

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
and taped onto the vessel itself Wow

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.040 
and taped onto the vessel itself Wow
thank<00:03:31.600> you

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.110
