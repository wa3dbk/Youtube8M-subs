draw<00:00:44.629> now<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.289> Razor<00:00:47.160> Ramon<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.059> could

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
draw now I I think Razor Ramon I could

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
draw now I I think Razor Ramon I could
be<00:00:48.360> wrong<00:00:48.510> about<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.110> think<00:00:49.170> razor<00:00:49.559> was

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
be wrong about this I think razor was

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
be wrong about this I think razor was
supposed<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> tournament<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.329> he

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
supposed to be in the tournament but he

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
supposed to be in the tournament but he
wasn't<00:00:51.719> maybe<00:00:52.050> he<00:00:52.230> got<00:00:52.350> hurt<00:00:52.680> Savio<00:00:53.520> Vega<00:00:53.699> was

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
wasn't maybe he got hurt Savio Vega was

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.580 
wasn't maybe he got hurt Savio Vega was
in<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.420> Savio<00:00:54.750> Vega<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> Iron

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in there Savio Vega was like the Iron

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
in there Savio Vega was like the Iron
Man<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.160> tournament<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.449> matches

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
Man in this tournament like for matches

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.930 
Man in this tournament like for matches
that<00:00:57.989> night<00:00:58.230> because<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.219> he<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.730> had

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that night because I think he first had

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
that night because I think he first had
to<00:00:59.969> wrestle<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.390> qualifier<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.289> night

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
to wrestle a qualifier that night

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.229 
to wrestle a qualifier that night
because<00:01:01.590> razor<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.219> injured<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.120> he

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
because razor was injured so he

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.390 
because razor was injured so he
qualified<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> then<00:01:04.650> he<00:01:04.830> had<00:01:04.920> three<00:01:05.220> more

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
qualified and then he had three more

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
qualified and then he had three more
matches<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.420> Savio<00:01:06.810> took<00:01:07.049> his<00:01:07.200> place<00:01:07.320> but<00:01:07.560> have

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
matches so Savio took his place but have

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
matches so Savio took his place but have
razor<00:01:08.010> been<00:01:08.310> able<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> built

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
razor been able to go I would have built

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.539 
razor been able to go I would have built
up<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.260> finals<00:01:10.740> match<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.189> night<00:01:11.369> between

but<00:02:02.549> he<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.030> wasn't<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.450> guy<00:02:05.119> but

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
but he just wasn't the right guy but

built<00:03:32.850> -<00:03:32.970> Shawn<00:03:33.180> diesel<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:34.680> know<00:03:34.769> it's<00:03:34.890> kind

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
built - Shawn diesel you know it's kind

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.190 
built - Shawn diesel you know it's kind
of<00:03:35.130> odd<00:03:35.280> there's<00:03:35.610> no<00:03:35.730> heal<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.269> but<00:03:36.540> like<00:03:37.110> I

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
of odd there's no heal there but like I

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.600 
of odd there's no heal there but like I
said<00:03:37.260> they<00:03:37.500> did<00:03:37.650> such<00:03:37.799> a<00:03:37.829> piss-poor<00:03:38.130> job<00:03:38.310> of

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
said they did such a piss-poor job of

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.640 
said they did such a piss-poor job of
building<00:03:38.940> heal<00:03:39.299> challengers<00:03:39.840> up<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.200> year<00:03:40.470> I

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
building heal challengers up that year I

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.319 
building heal challengers up that year I
think<00:03:41.130> that<00:03:41.400> would<00:03:41.700> have<00:03:41.760> been<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.000> way<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.150> go

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
think that would have been the way to go

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.890 
think that would have been the way to go
because<00:03:42.540> Shawn<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.799> razor<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.400> diesel<00:03:44.900> were

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
because Shawn and razor and diesel were

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.930 
because Shawn and razor and diesel were
three<00:03:46.350> of<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:47.010> top<00:03:47.190> guys<00:03:47.459> on<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.820> roster

three of the the top guys on the roster
at<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.510> time<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.170> maybe<00:03:49.320> diesel<00:03:49.739> wasn't<00:03:49.920> as

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
at that time and maybe diesel wasn't as

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.890 
at that time and maybe diesel wasn't as
over<00:03:50.430> as<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.640> other<00:03:50.790> two<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.299> razor<00:03:51.660> was
