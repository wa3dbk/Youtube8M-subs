Saturday now to get into the fight
Saturday<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:03.090> this<00:02:03.299> is<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> game<00:02:03.960> changer

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
Saturday I think this is a game changer

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.029 
Saturday I think this is a game changer
because<00:02:04.649> sometimes<00:02:05.509> when<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.630> feel

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
because sometimes when you feel

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.730 
because sometimes when you feel
disrespected<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
disrespected that you just

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.010 
disrespected that you just
you<00:02:09.890> have<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.130> lot<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.550> prove<00:02:10.760> so<00:02:11.150> zap<00:02:11.660> already

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
you have a lot to prove so zap already

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.630 
you have a lot to prove so zap already
had<00:02:12.200> a<00:02:12.230> lot<00:02:12.500> to<00:02:12.530> prove<00:02:12.920> coming<00:02:13.310> into<00:02:13.460> this

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
had a lot to prove coming into this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.300 
had a lot to prove coming into this
fight<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.900> think<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.530> you<00:02:15.770> know<00:02:15.890> he<00:02:16.100> knows

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
fight and I think that you know he knows

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.240 
fight and I think that you know he knows
that<00:02:16.670> he<00:02:16.970> can't<00:02:17.270> lose<00:02:17.620> these<00:02:18.620> fights<00:02:18.920> anymore

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
that he can't lose these fights anymore

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.280 
that he can't lose these fights anymore
because<00:02:19.550> he<00:02:19.730> keeps<00:02:19.940> giving<00:02:20.210> them<00:02:20.480> he<00:02:20.900> has<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
because he keeps giving them he has to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.710 
because he keeps giving them he has to
win<00:02:21.440> two<00:02:21.680> or<00:02:21.800> three<00:02:22.100> other<00:02:22.400> smaller<00:02:23.330> fights

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
win two or three other smaller fights

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840 
win two or three other smaller fights
against<00:02:24.140> lesser<00:02:24.500> opposition<00:02:25.130> to<00:02:25.400> climb<00:02:25.640> all

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
against lesser opposition to climb all

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.400 
against lesser opposition to climb all
the<00:02:25.940> way<00:02:26.030> back<00:02:26.240> up<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.630> I<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.870> I<00:02:26.960> don't<00:02:27.020> feel

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
the way back up and I and I don't feel

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.950 
the way back up and I and I don't feel
that<00:02:27.680> his<00:02:28.160> legacy<00:02:28.490> he<00:02:29.030> wants<00:02:29.240> his<00:02:29.330> legacy<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960
