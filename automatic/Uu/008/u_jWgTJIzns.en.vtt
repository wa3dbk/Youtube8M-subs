00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.040
 how to install the krona giro account 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.680
 sea 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.189
 I'm rodrigo and you're in the class. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.189
 draws 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.180
 can be installed in 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 any kind of engine so many of four 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
 which is the case of the most 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.060
 popular as those of six and eight 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.529
 cylinders to start the installation is 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.179
 necessary that you find the wire 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.219
 your car key locations 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.230
 if you prefer you can pull straight from the 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 battery and insert a power switch to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 off but the problem is that you will 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 have to stay on and off all 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 time you get in and out of the car 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.750
 the wiring is as follows red 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.030
 positive post negative black post 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.059
 direct from the battery or any 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 ground and got blue from the coil is it 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.110
 Who will send the signal to the account? 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.030
 spins and the other children are the 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.379
 lighting that I'm going to show from here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.960
 little as you call them 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.510
 now I'm going to pull a wire from the key post 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 and link here in the red river a wire 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.610
 black on the battery and call 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 negative pull the blue to the coil and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.479
 on the negative wire that in this case is 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.479
 this arranges with black 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.400
 ready is already installed 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.070
 now let's set up the contagios here 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.950
 behind it has a button and we will use it to 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.220
 make our 1st configuration link to 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.740
 without starting the engine safely and 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.600
 press the button for 15 seconds to 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.600
 that it enters the pulse mode 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.670
 following the table in the 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.310
 install as indicated. 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.319
 for your engine then wait for some 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.810
 seconds to touch the button 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.149
 now it will go into filter mode 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.509
 in this mode you can decrease the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.479
 Cop swings in the rev counter it 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.020
 ranges from 1 to 4 the higher the value 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.460
 the higher the filter but lower the 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.580
 response time 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.650
 in my case I will leave number 2 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.790
 good now that it's already installed and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.120
 configured 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.310
 we turn on the backlight are here 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.410
 four - wire a blue with white the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.860
 red with white the green with a 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.470
 and a white whole with these threads is 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.380
 possible to make up to seven colors blue 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.170
 connecting the blue wire together with black wire and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.170
 connecting the whole white on the positive wire 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.930
 green by changing the philosopher so the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.930
 green 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.500
 and exchanging red green wire by wire 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.500
 red 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.760
 you can make other colors like 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.790
 magenta binding blue and red wire 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:12.870
 together also if year calling green and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:15.900
 blue yellow linking green and red and 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.320
 also white connecting all things 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.320
 together 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 then choose the one that best matches 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.950
 the dashboard of your car and choose the 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.560
 best place to let your account run 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.100
 it can be placed on a column of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.500
 instruments docked in the panel and 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.170
 also used with a glass 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.460
 Thank you for watching this video and I 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.400
 I hope next time. 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.400
 here on the street channel draws until soon
