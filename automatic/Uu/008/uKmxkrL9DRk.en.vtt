00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
and a loss snapshot a new functionality

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.960 
and a loss snapshot a new functionality
has<00:00:07.649> been<00:00:07.859> added<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.220> game<00:00:08.490> room<00:00:08.700> apparently

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
has been added to game room apparently

has been added to game room apparently
this<00:00:09.300> functionality<00:00:09.780> has<00:00:09.990> been<00:00:10.170> there<00:00:10.590> but

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
this functionality has been there but

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.549 
this functionality has been there but
Sarge<00:00:11.580> has<00:00:11.730> made<00:00:11.910> some<00:00:12.269> changes<00:00:12.780> so<00:00:13.410> that<00:00:13.440> we

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
would know what game rules says but game

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.269

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
output from command blocks etc so it was

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.709 
output from command blocks etc so it was
a<00:00:45.750> predetermined<00:00:46.940> game<00:00:47.940> rule<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.539> could

a predetermined game rule that you could

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.959 
a predetermined game rule that you could
run<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.820> now

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
run but now what we can do is we can now

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.330 
run but now what we can do is we can now
actually<00:00:51.210> use<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.590> actually<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
actually use that to actually have

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.880 
actually use that to actually have
global<00:00:54.090> variables<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.559> not

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
global variables now if you're not

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.760

we've<00:01:11.220> not<00:01:11.460> really<00:01:11.700> had<00:01:11.820> access<00:01:12.390> or<00:01:12.600> been<00:01:12.780> able

we've not really had access or been able
to<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.380> something<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> past

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
to use something like that in the past

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
to use something like that in the past
if<00:01:14.760> we<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.240> still<00:01:15.479> store<00:01:15.840> any<00:01:16.049> kind

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
if we want you to still store any kind

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
if we want you to still store any kind
of<00:01:16.350> variables<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:16.890> would<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> have<00:01:17.520> stored

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of variables we would had to have stored

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.780 
of variables we would had to have stored
it<00:01:18.180> in<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.600> fake<00:01:19.320> player<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.250> had<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.670> have

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it in a fake player or you had to have

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
it in a fake player or you had to have
to<00:01:20.970> store<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.299> on<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.869> an<00:01:22.080> entity<00:01:22.530> scoreboard

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to store it on in an entity scoreboard

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
to store it on in an entity scoreboard
or<00:01:23.220> player<00:01:23.490> scoreboard<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.360> now<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:24.570> can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
or player scoreboard but now we can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.899 
or player scoreboard but now we can
actually<00:01:24.869> scare<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.729> carrot

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
actually scare it a carrot

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.289 
actually scare it a carrot
we<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:27.810> actually<00:01:27.960> share<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> global<00:01:29.670> map

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
we can actually share it on a global map

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
we can actually share it on a global map
level<00:01:30.710> okay<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> way<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.460> works

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
level okay and the way that this works

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.999 
level okay and the way that this works
is<00:01:32.880> that<00:01:32.909> when<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.540> type<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.439> game<00:01:34.710> rule

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
is that when you now type in game rule

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.569 
is that when you now type in game rule
and<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> enter<00:01:36.060> any<00:01:36.530> word<00:01:37.530> after<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and you can enter any word after that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.270 
and you can enter any word after that
game<00:01:38.820> rule<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.360> then<00:01:39.840> enter<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.380> value<00:01:40.890> that

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
game rule and then enter a value that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
game rule and then enter a value that
value<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> will<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:43.020> saved

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
value will be will be saved

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.460 
value will be will be saved
against<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.520> query<00:01:45.090> game<00:01:45.509> rule<00:01:45.750> okay<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.439> I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
against that query game rule okay now I

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
against that query game rule okay now I
know<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.799> seems<00:01:46.979> very<00:01:47.130> confusing<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.970> let

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
know this seems very confusing but let

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
know this seems very confusing but let
me<00:01:48.390> let<00:01:48.540> me<00:01:48.600> explain<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.079> if<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> said<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.649> up

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
me let me explain so if I said that up

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.350 
me let me explain so if I said that up
is<00:01:49.979> 10<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.670> let<00:01:50.909> me<00:01:50.970> really<00:01:51.149> make<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
is 10 actually let me really make a

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
is 10 actually let me really make a
change<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:51.899> let<00:01:52.079> me<00:01:52.110> just<00:01:52.200> swapped<00:01:52.920> my

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
change here let me just swapped my

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.569 
change here let me just swapped my
scoreboard

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
scoreboard

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.219 
scoreboard
okay<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> side<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
okay so on the side you can see that I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.039 
okay so on the side you can see that I
have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> scoreboard<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.479> query<00:01:57.810> that

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
have a scoreboard and the the query that

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
have a scoreboard and the the query that
I've<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.799> 10<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.700> if<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.969> make<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I've got there is 10 so if I make it

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.060 
I've got there is 10 so if I make it
change<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.930> game<00:02:01.140> rule<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.770> make<00:02:02.040> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
change to this game rule so if I make it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.060 
change to this game rule so if I make it
101<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.390> example<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.350> will<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.860> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
101 for example you will see that that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.429 
101 for example you will see that that
will<00:02:05.250> change<00:02:05.610> my<00:02:05.820> school<00:02:06.149> board<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.570> 101<00:02:07.049> if<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
will change my school board to 101 if I

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.999 
will change my school board to 101 if I
make<00:02:07.649> it<00:02:07.759> 3<00:02:08.759> 3<00:02:08.789> 3<00:02:09.030> or<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.440> will<00:02:10.560> see<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.860> it'll

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
make it 3 3 3 or you will see that it'll

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.979 
make it 3 3 3 or you will see that it'll
now<00:02:11.099> change<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.610> scoreboard<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> 0<00:02:12.750> because

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
now change my scoreboard to 0 because

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.640 
now change my scoreboard to 0 because
that<00:02:13.110> value

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that value

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.039 
that value
is<00:02:13.709> too<00:02:13.980> big<00:02:14.239> okay<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.569> still<00:02:15.750> limited

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
is too big okay so you still limited

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.479 
is too big okay so you still limited
amount<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.470> venues<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:16.829> can<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.250> there

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
amount of venues you can have so there

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.660 
amount of venues you can have so there
we<00:02:17.549> go<00:02:17.720> okay<00:02:18.750> now<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.260> cool<00:02:20.069> thing<00:02:20.099> about<00:02:20.310> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
we go okay now the cool thing about this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.380 
we go okay now the cool thing about this
is<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:22.470> can't<00:02:22.739> store<00:02:23.010> words<00:02:23.430> as<00:02:23.790> well<00:02:24.000> but<00:02:24.209> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
is you can't store words as well but you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.970 
is you can't store words as well but you
can't<00:02:24.629> actually<00:02:24.780> pull<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> into<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.620> scoreboard

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
can't actually pull it into a scoreboard

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.640 
can't actually pull it into a scoreboard
so<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.430> words<00:02:26.640> will<00:02:26.879> exist<00:02:27.299> but<00:02:28.049> they<00:02:28.379> can't

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
so the words will exist but they can't

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.170 
so the words will exist but they can't
really<00:02:28.799> get<00:02:28.950> added<00:02:29.250> so<00:02:29.400> let's<00:02:29.579> just<00:02:29.790> say<00:02:29.909> hi

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
really get added so let's just say hi

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.270 
really get added so let's just say hi
hello<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.640> hello<00:02:33.120> this<00:02:33.689> is<00:02:33.720> do<00:02:33.989> Sarge<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.650> don't

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
hello the hello this is do Sarge I don't

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.920 
hello the hello this is do Sarge I don't
know<00:02:35.340> why<00:02:35.489> but<00:02:35.730> let's<00:02:35.909> do<00:02:36.060> Sarge<00:02:36.269> hello<00:02:36.659> Sarge

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
know why but let's do Sarge hello Sarge

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.410 
know why but let's do Sarge hello Sarge
if<00:02:37.409> I<00:02:37.530> then<00:02:37.739> save<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:38.819> see<00:02:38.939> merely<00:02:39.180> my

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
if I then save it you will see merely my

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.899 
if I then save it you will see merely my

pulled it can only pull out a numeric

pulled it can only pull out a numeric
values<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.980> for<00:02:47.190> example<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:47.879> a<00:02:47.970> run<00:02:48.329> if<00:02:48.629> I

go game rule query in a command block

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.390 
go game rule query in a command block
you<00:02:51.870> will<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.230> that<00:02:52.349> it'll<00:02:52.500> actually<00:02:52.739> give<00:02:53.250> me

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
you will see that it'll actually give me

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.670 
you will see that it'll actually give me
that<00:02:53.519> value<00:02:53.849> back<00:02:54.090> okay<00:02:55.049> but<00:02:55.200> because<00:02:55.500> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
that value back okay but because it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.129 
that value back okay but because it's
not<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:55.889> numeric<00:02:56.250> value<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.549> can't<00:02:56.970> pull<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.720> into

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
not a numeric value I can't pull it into

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.619 
not a numeric value I can't pull it into
a<00:02:58.170> scoreboard<00:02:58.500> but<00:02:59.489> if<00:02:59.609> I<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.970> set<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:00.599> a

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
a scoreboard but if I just set this to a

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.470 
a scoreboard but if I just set this to a
number<00:03:01.230> again<00:03:01.730> Bella<00:03:02.730> Bella<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.269> is<00:03:03.329> not<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
number again Bella Bella this is not a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.690 
number again Bella Bella this is not a
number<00:03:03.659> so<00:03:03.989> I'll<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.379> any<00:03:05.370> number<00:03:05.459> over

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
number so I'll just go any number over

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.179 
number so I'll just go any number over
there<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.599> put<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.260> in<00:03:07.349> there<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.859> you'll<00:03:08.010> see

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189 
there and put it in there and you'll see

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.800 
there and put it in there and you'll see
it<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> side<00:03:08.609> bar<00:03:08.849> and<00:03:09.090> if<00:03:09.150> I<00:03:09.269> run<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> test

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
it on the side bar and if I run a test

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.170 
it on the side bar and if I run a test
here<00:03:10.079> you'll<00:03:10.200> see<00:03:10.439> it's<00:03:10.590> over<00:03:10.889> here<00:03:11.040> okay<00:03:11.819> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
here you'll see it's over here okay so

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.569 
here you'll see it's over here okay so
to<00:03:12.269> access<00:03:12.540> this<00:03:13.109> you<00:03:13.680> then<00:03:13.829> just<00:03:14.099> type<00:03:14.310> in

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
to access this you then just type in

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.940 
to access this you then just type in
game<00:03:15.030> rule<00:03:15.329> query<00:03:15.930> so<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.290> knight<00:03:16.439> name<00:03:16.769> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
game rule query so the knight name you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.059 
game rule query so the knight name you
have<00:03:17.069> created<00:03:17.430> no<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:17.760> was<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.389> say<00:03:18.599> that

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.670 
actually useful to pull it into a
scoreboard<00:03:23.940> once<00:03:24.510> again<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.169> need<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.530> use

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
scoreboard once again you need to use

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.180 
scoreboard once again you need to use
the<00:03:25.889> stat<00:03:26.310> come<00:03:26.849> on<00:03:27.030> now<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.419> new<00:03:27.780> option<00:03:28.650> has

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
the stat come on now a new option has

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.309 
the stat come on now a new option has
been<00:03:29.489> added<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.389> stat<00:03:30.629> come<00:03:30.810> on<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.109> if<00:03:31.199> we

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
been added to the stat come on so if we

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.000 
been added to the stat come on so if we
go

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
go

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.349

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
the query results does it'll actually

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:02.300 
the query results does it'll actually
query<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.609> result<00:03:59.609> of<00:03:59.790> a<00:04:00.479> particular<00:04:01.310> command

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310

that<00:04:02.609> you<00:04:02.790> have<00:04:02.970> run<00:04:03.209> okay<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.169> to<00:04:04.530> set<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:04.919> up

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
that you have run okay so to set that up

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.680 
that you have run okay so to set that up
if<00:04:05.220> you've<00:04:05.340> watched<00:04:05.579> my<00:04:05.819> stats<00:04:06.239> come<00:04:06.419> on<00:04:06.540> is

if you've watched my stats come on is

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.210 
if you've watched my stats come on is
exactly<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.260> same<00:04:07.440> first<00:04:07.709> of<00:04:07.799> all<00:04:07.889> we<00:04:08.010> need<00:04:08.129> to

exactly the same first of all we need to

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.000 
exactly the same first of all we need to
create<00:04:08.519> a<00:04:08.729> scoreboard<00:04:09.349> scoreboard<00:04:10.349> with<00:04:10.979> a

create a scoreboard scoreboard with a
dummy<00:04:11.310> object<00:04:11.489> objective<00:04:12.479> now<00:04:12.629> I'm<00:04:12.750> calling

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
dummy object objective now I'm calling

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.170 
dummy object objective now I'm calling
it<00:04:13.139> query<00:04:13.440> so<00:04:13.739> let's<00:04:13.889> just<00:04:14.040> create<00:04:14.220> them<00:04:14.579> then

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
it query so let's just create them then

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.920 
it query so let's just create them then
we<00:04:15.329> going<00:04:15.479> to<00:04:15.629> set<00:04:15.900> all<00:04:16.139> players<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:18.239> zero<00:04:18.539> for

we going to set all players to zero for

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.920 
we going to set all players to zero for
that<00:04:19.109> objective<00:04:19.669> okay<00:04:20.699> and<00:04:21.030> now<00:04:21.719> you'll<00:04:21.870> see

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that objective okay and now you'll see

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.120 
that objective okay and now you'll see
nothing<00:04:22.139> happened<00:04:22.529> on<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> sidebar<00:04:23.010> because

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
nothing happened on the sidebar because

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.409 
nothing happened on the sidebar because
I've<00:04:23.370> already<00:04:23.550> got<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.000> that's<00:04:24.150> something

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
I've already got and that's something

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.300 
I've already got and that's something
else<00:04:24.510> running<00:04:24.750> in<00:04:24.930> the<00:04:24.990> background<00:04:25.200> they<00:04:25.500> then

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
else running in the background they then

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.450 
else running in the background they then
we<00:04:26.520> have<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.729> set<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> side

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
we have to set the side

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.370 
we have to set the side
for<00:04:27.669> query<00:04:27.910> to<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> side<00:04:28.449> as<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.930> saw<00:04:29.080> it<00:04:29.139> in

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
for query to the side as you saw it in

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.010 
for query to the side as you saw it in
the<00:04:29.440> beginning<00:04:29.590> and<00:04:29.970> then<00:04:30.970> we<00:04:31.270> need<00:04:31.419> to<00:04:31.539> set<00:04:31.840> up

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
the beginning and then we need to set up

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.350 
the beginning and then we need to set up
the<00:04:32.289> stats<00:04:32.650> entity<00:04:33.310> okay<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:33.910> this<00:04:34.150> is<00:04:34.300> the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the stats entity okay so this is the

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.760 
the stats entity okay so this is the
stats<00:04:34.630> entity<00:04:35.110> at<00:04:35.229> all

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
stats entity at all

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.219 
stats entity at all
set<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.729> query<00:04:37.180> result<00:04:37.720> at<00:04:38.139> P<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:39.190> query<00:04:40.229> okay

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
set the query result at P to query okay

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.290 
set the query result at P to query okay
so<00:04:41.289> this<00:04:42.039> is<00:04:42.190> exactly<00:04:42.580> what<00:04:42.759> happens<00:04:43.060> so<00:04:43.150> when

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
so this is exactly what happens so when

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.990 
so this is exactly what happens so when
I<00:04:43.419> run<00:04:43.840> any<00:04:44.139> code<00:04:44.380> when<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.710> now<00:04:44.949> run<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.460> c'mon<00:04:45.849> so

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
I run any code when I now run a c'mon so

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.950 
I run any code when I now run a c'mon so
if<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.180> now<00:04:46.330> go<00:04:46.389> game<00:04:46.990> rule<00:04:47.880> game<00:04:48.880> rule<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.810> it

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
if I now go game rule game rule and it

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.020 
if I now go game rule game rule and it
takes<00:04:50.169> to<00:04:50.319> query<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:51.400> will<00:04:51.610> give<00:04:51.759> me<00:04:51.910> the

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
takes to query it will give me the

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.180 
takes to query it will give me the
sidebar<00:04:52.449> there<00:04:52.660> now<00:04:52.840> let<00:04:53.020> me<00:04:53.110> just<00:04:53.229> cool<00:04:53.919> so

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
sidebar there now let me just cool so

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.089 
sidebar there now let me just cool so
yeah<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.389> is<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:56.199> now<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.410> know<00:04:56.560> this<00:04:56.860> might

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
yeah that is it now I know this might

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.710 
yeah that is it now I know this might
not<00:04:57.130> seem<00:04:58.020> like<00:04:59.020> it's<00:04:59.710> use<00:05:00.430> really<00:05:01.419> really

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
not seem like it's use really really

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.290 
not seem like it's use really really
kind<00:05:01.780> of<00:05:01.900> useful<00:05:02.139> much<00:05:02.470> but<00:05:02.849> once<00:05:03.849> again<00:05:04.090> like

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
kind of useful much but once again like

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.810 
kind of useful much but once again like
the<00:05:04.479> stats<00:05:04.720> come<00:05:04.930> on<00:05:05.190> once<00:05:06.190> people<00:05:06.490> start

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
the stats come on once people start

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.879 
the stats come on once people start
playing<00:05:06.940> with<00:05:07.210> us<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.539> as<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:08.020> go<00:05:08.259> forward<00:05:08.560> with

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
playing with us and as I go forward with

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.499 
playing with us and as I go forward with
the<00:05:08.949> concepts<00:05:09.340> I'm<00:05:09.669> holding<00:05:10.030> back<00:05:10.150> with<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.389> bit

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
the concepts I'm holding back with a bit

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.700 
the concepts I'm holding back with a bit
of<00:05:10.539> concepts<00:05:10.960> until<00:05:11.199> I<00:05:11.259> get<00:05:11.380> all<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:11.650> done

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
of concepts until I get all of this done

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.520 
of concepts until I get all of this done
you<00:05:12.580> will<00:05:12.759> start<00:05:13.000> seeing<00:05:13.360> me<00:05:13.570> using<00:05:13.930> it<00:05:14.080> but

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
you will start seeing me using it but

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.560 
you will start seeing me using it but
just<00:05:15.310> so<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.729> can<00:05:15.849> see<00:05:16.060> one<00:05:16.419> of<00:05:16.449> the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
just so that you can see one of the

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.089 
just so that you can see one of the
things<00:05:16.810> that<00:05:16.990> I<00:05:17.020> am<00:05:17.229> using<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.680> at<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.830> moment

00:05:18.089 --> 00:05:18.099 
things that I am using it at the moment

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.330 
things that I am using it at the moment
is<00:05:18.340> something<00:05:18.610> called<00:05:18.940> random<00:05:20.130> I've<00:05:21.130> actually

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
is something called random I've actually

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.560 
is something called random I've actually
I've<00:05:21.550> blocked<00:05:21.729> the<00:05:21.880> random<00:05:22.150> over<00:05:22.300> yet<00:05:22.449> there

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
I've blocked the random over yet there

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.990 
I've blocked the random over yet there
we<00:05:22.659> go<00:05:22.860> so<00:05:23.860> you'll<00:05:24.009> see<00:05:24.250> it's<00:05:24.460> actually<00:05:24.639> giving

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
we go so you'll see it's actually giving

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.999 
we go so you'll see it's actually giving
me<00:05:25.060> a<00:05:25.120> global<00:05:25.870> random<00:05:26.470> number<00:05:26.770> which<00:05:26.889> is

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
me a global random number which is

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.120 
me a global random number which is
causing<00:05:27.280> this<00:05:27.720> this<00:05:28.720> little<00:05:29.530> villager<00:05:29.919> here

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
causing this this little villager here

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.950 
causing this this little villager here
to<00:05:30.280> just<00:05:30.580> choose<00:05:30.849> a<00:05:30.880> random<00:05:31.210> path<00:05:31.690> when<00:05:31.930> it

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
to just choose a random path when it

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.960 
to just choose a random path when it
gets<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.380> an<00:05:32.440> intersection<00:05:32.770> so<00:05:33.490> this<00:05:33.639> is<00:05:33.759> all

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
gets to an intersection so this is all

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:35.670 
gets to an intersection so this is all
kind<00:05:34.479> of<00:05:34.539> completely<00:05:34.840> random<00:05:35.320> when<00:05:35.470> it<00:05:35.530> gets

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
kind of completely random when it gets

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.670 
kind of completely random when it gets
to<00:05:35.800> an<00:05:35.860> intersection<00:05:36.479> okay<00:05:37.479> but<00:05:38.409> I'll<00:05:38.500> get

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
to an intersection okay but I'll get

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.290 
to an intersection okay but I'll get
into<00:05:38.830> much<00:05:39.099> more<00:05:39.460> detail<00:05:39.639> about<00:05:39.849> that<00:05:40.120> later

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
into much more detail about that later

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.909 
into much more detail about that later
on<00:05:40.599> but<00:05:40.810> for<00:05:41.139> now<00:05:41.199> it's<00:05:41.409> important<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:41.830> you

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
on but for now it's important that you

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.439 
on but for now it's important that you
know<00:05:42.099> that<00:05:42.310> there<00:05:42.520> isn't<00:05:42.669> game<00:05:43.030> rule<00:05:43.270> you

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:43.449 
know that there isn't game rule you

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.879 
know that there isn't game rule you
can't<00:05:43.719> actually<00:05:43.900> inject<00:05:44.320> into<00:05:44.469> it<00:05:44.650> and<00:05:44.800> you

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
can't actually inject into it and you

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:47.909 
can't actually inject into it and you
can<00:05:45.009> access<00:05:45.490> it<00:05:45.699> at<00:05:46.240> any<00:05:46.810> time<00:05:47.110> by<00:05:47.349> pulling<00:05:47.800> it

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
can access it at any time by pulling it

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.189 
can access it at any time by pulling it
into<00:05:48.099> your<00:05:48.310> scoreboard<00:05:48.699> cool<00:05:49.389> guys<00:05:49.630> thank<00:05:50.110> you

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:50.199 
into your scoreboard cool guys thank you

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:51.749
