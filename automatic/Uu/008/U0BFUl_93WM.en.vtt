 say is here in black ops 2 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.700
 and let's just rhyme 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.500
 old people like dead again now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.500
 this is the way in 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.100
 I burn the tap is today if 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.320
 The aria cactus farmer on the fork 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:49.980

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.079
 as I said I's here so need 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.320
 now somehow have to have weapons or 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.129
 yes there is a weapon in the back 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 it's a weapon 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.609

 successful title you sweety here so 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.310
 Well, I think so, or better than 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.450
 without 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 rather with as elementary exact and me 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.970
 would never recommend this here 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.670
 Flaming it is only conditional 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.380
 is only conditionally for the well-being of the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.170
 human human beings contribute 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.770
 presence of tine wittler 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.479
 look here yes you want it to luck 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 Not 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.119
 where are you the lame zombie has the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:58.610
 sprout again from the colorful concrete 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.229
 but split their matter but how 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:09.399
 that's exactly what I know, of course 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:12.319
 not their matter my matter 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.140
 I have one more shot now we take 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.519
 Let's go to the right place here 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.400
 now I believe in high is her job 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:31.269
 you have to be lost 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:37.160

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:56.560

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:56.560
 I am now working on the 2100 people 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.430
 somehow that's me 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.510
 although here lives where in panda 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:16.790
 somewhere they have to be right where is that 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:19.880
 my own plays his role quite well 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.579
 hope that he never was that among others 25 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:27.290
 there you need because the crisis again 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.840
 out of the concrete like unrealistic 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.840
 that was going off here 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:47.860
 so I have you in 1906 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:50.440
 1084 so therefore people out there you can 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.020
 in how long we survive it writes 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:01.390
 in the write times in the comments 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:07.030
 before you spit to the end yes and 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:16.709
 yet one video center and then another 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:16.709
 if we were right and that 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:26.680
 although actually I had ever 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.090
 I never had with zombies though 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.160
 has a whole new one 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 3 comments made and then at the end 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.990
 I asked yes how many would have 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:42.430
 already done and watch all the numbers 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:47.640

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:09.910
