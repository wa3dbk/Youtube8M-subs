and<00:00:30.150> some<00:00:30.570> select<00:00:30.869> changes<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> thorn<00:00:31.679> so

what's<00:00:32.759> going<00:00:32.969> on<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.270> hand<00:00:33.510> cannons<00:00:33.840> in

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
what's going on with hand cannons in

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.240 
what's going on with hand cannons in
general<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> they're<00:00:34.710> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> start<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
general is they're going to start the

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.889 
general is they're going to start the
fall-off<00:00:35.489> damage<00:00:36.030> closer<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> character

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
fall-off damage closer to the character

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
fall-off damage closer to the character
so<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.620> little<00:00:38.250> bit<00:00:38.700> less

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so you're going to see a little bit less

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.569 
so you're going to see a little bit less
effective<00:00:39.809> range<00:00:40.079> actually<00:00:40.770> quite<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> bit

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
effective range actually quite a bit

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.630 
effective range actually quite a bit
less<00:00:42.300> effective<00:00:42.840> range<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.980> hand<00:00:44.280> cannons

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
less effective range from hand cannons

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.950 
less effective range from hand cannons
in<00:00:44.730> general<00:00:45.090> they<00:00:45.450> don't<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.899> be

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
in general they don't want you to be

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.540 
in general they don't want you to be
able<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> snipe<00:00:46.350> clear<00:00:46.680> across<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.160> map<00:00:47.340> with

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
able to snipe clear across the map with

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.639 
able to snipe clear across the map with
it<00:00:47.700> they<00:00:47.879> want<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.270> jobs<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.809> be<00:00:48.960> left<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it they want those jobs to be left to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.540 
it they want those jobs to be left to
things<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> Scout<00:00:50.430> rifles<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> sniper

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
things like Scout rifles and and sniper

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.860 
things like Scout rifles and and sniper
rifles<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.180> currently<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:54.660> Scout

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
rifles because currently with Scout

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.660 
rifles because currently with Scout
rifles<00:00:55.050> there<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> feeling<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.219> why<00:00:56.430> use<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
rifles there is a feeling of why use a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.260 
rifles there is a feeling of why use a
scout<00:00:57.000> if<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.870> have<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.170> hand<00:00:58.620> cannon<00:00:59.059> also<00:01:00.059> they

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
scout if I have a hand cannon also they

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.299 
scout if I have a hand cannon also they
want<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> small<00:01:00.870> reduction<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.530> aim<00:01:01.920> down

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
want to do a small reduction in aim down

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.539 
want to do a small reduction in aim down
sight<00:01:02.670> accuracy<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.229> they<00:01:04.739> want<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.189> too<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
sight accuracy and they want that too so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.520 
sight accuracy and they want that too so
you<00:01:05.610> cannot<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.330> snap<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.900> aim<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.320> something

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
you cannot just snap an aim at something

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
you cannot just snap an aim at something
really<00:01:08.100> quick<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.610> actually<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> hip

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
firing but I do find myself doing a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
firing but I do find myself doing a
little<00:01:13.799> bit<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> aiming<00:01:14.580> down<00:01:14.820> side<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> lot<00:01:15.509> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
little bit of aiming down side a lot a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
little bit of aiming down side a lot a
bit<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.080> um<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.650> don't<00:01:17.070> really<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> lot<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
bit but um I don't really do a lot of

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.670 
bit but um I don't really do a lot of
the<00:01:17.880> snap<00:01:18.210> aiming<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.810> sights<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.530> I'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the snap aiming down sights because I'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.670 
the snap aiming down sights because I'm
terrible<00:01:20.299> also<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> reducing<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> magazine

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
terrible also the reducing the magazine

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.950 
terrible also the reducing the magazine
size<00:01:23.009> for<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.610> base<00:01:23.850> inventory<00:01:24.450> stats<00:01:24.780> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
size for all base inventory stats so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.850 
size for all base inventory stats so
you're<00:01:25.080> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.380> little<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.650> less

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
you're going to see a little bit less

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
you're going to see a little bit less
ammo<00:01:26.640> inside<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.570> base<00:01:28.229> stats<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:28.890> most<00:01:30.200> hand

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
ammo inside of base stats for most hand

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.560 
ammo inside of base stats for most hand
cannons<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> they're<00:01:32.759> reducing<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.390> base

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
cannons and they're reducing the base

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.260 
cannons and they're reducing the base
optics<00:01:34.049> zooms<00:01:34.380> for<00:01:35.220> hand<00:01:35.400> cannons<00:01:35.850> aiming

down<00:01:36.360> sights<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.810> grants<00:01:37.650> more<00:01:37.860> width<00:01:38.189> in

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
down sights now grants more width in

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.270 
down sights now grants more width in
favor<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.450> death<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.439> those<00:01:40.860> are<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.070> changes

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
favor of death so those are the changes

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.639 
favor of death so those are the changes
coming<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.030> hand<00:01:42.450> cannons<00:01:42.869> Hankins<00:01:43.320> getting

coming to hand cannons Hankins getting

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039 
coming to hand cannons Hankins getting
some<00:01:43.829> sweeping<00:01:44.130> changes<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:45.030> make<00:01:45.180> them<00:01:45.420> less

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
some sweeping changes to make them less

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.950 
some sweeping changes to make them less
lethal<00:01:46.439> at<00:01:46.740> range<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.369> more<00:01:47.670> mid<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.689> close

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
lethal at range and more mid to close

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
lethal at range and more mid to close
range<00:01:49.259> type<00:01:49.530> weapons<00:01:49.950> hugging<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> mid<00:01:51.360> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
range type weapons hugging on the mid to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.840 
range type weapons hugging on the mid to
mid<00:01:51.780> far<00:01:51.990> range<00:01:52.229> actually<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.399> what's<00:01:53.610> going

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
mid far range actually so what's going

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
mid far range actually so what's going
on<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.390> thorn<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:55.020> they've<00:01:55.619> decided

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
on with the thorn is they've decided

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.709 
on with the thorn is they've decided
that<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> damage<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> thorn<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.450> just

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that the damage with the thorn is just

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.660 
that the damage with the thorn is just
right<00:01:57.930> um<00:01:58.290> yeah<00:01:59.270> every<00:02:00.270> fucking<00:02:00.689> video<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.670> just

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
right um yeah every fucking video I just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
wanting to keep the base damage where it

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.490 
wanting to keep the base damage where it
is<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.690> thorn<00:02:12.900> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
is with the thorn so

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.740 
is with the thorn so
at<00:02:13.620> mid<00:02:13.890> mid<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.550> mid<00:02:14.910> far<00:02:15.120> range<00:02:15.360> you're<00:02:15.570> still

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
at mid mid to mid far range you're still

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.150 
at mid mid to mid far range you're still
going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.900> get<00:02:16.080> some<00:02:16.590> really<00:02:16.800> strong

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
going to get some really strong

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.130 
going to get some really strong
precision<00:02:17.700> hints<00:02:17.910> with<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> thing<00:02:18.300> but<00:02:18.900> they

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
precision hints with a thing but they

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.500 
precision hints with a thing but they
want<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.530> make<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.460> d-o-t<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.360> as

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
want to make it so the d-o-t is it as

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.980 
want to make it so the d-o-t is it as
strong<00:02:21.840> as<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.860> pvp<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.840> they're

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
strong as it is in pvp so they're

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.590 
strong as it is in pvp so they're
reducing<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.710> thorn<00:02:26.040> do<00:02:26.400> t<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.000> about<00:02:27.240> one

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
reducing the thorn do t to about one

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.620 
reducing the thorn do t to about one
third<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.200> what<00:02:28.440> it<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.650> now<00:02:28.860> tix<00:02:29.850> for<00:02:30.090> 7<00:02:30.480> in

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
third of what it is now tix for 7 in

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.600 
third of what it is now tix for 7 in
crucible<00:02:31.230> now<00:02:31.380> so<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.740> should<00:02:31.920> take<00:02:32.130> for<00:02:32.400> about

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
crucible now so it should take for about

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.000 
crucible now so it should take for about
two<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:32.880> some<00:02:33.240> change<00:02:33.570> but<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.740> thing<00:02:34.980> they

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
two and some change but one thing they

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.650 
two and some change but one thing they
are<00:02:35.280> doing<00:02:35.490> with<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.820> d-o-t<00:02:36.240> is<00:02:36.480> they're

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
are doing with the d-o-t is they're

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.600 
are doing with the d-o-t is they're
making<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.380> stack<00:02:37.860> up<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> five

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
making it so it can stack up to five

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.300 
making it so it can stack up to five
times<00:02:39.360> this<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.530> makes<00:02:40.770> it<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.100> can

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
times this is this makes it so you can

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.490 
times this is this makes it so you can
no<00:02:41.430> longer<00:02:41.670> simply<00:02:42.000> double<00:02:42.600> tap<00:02:42.810> an<00:02:43.020> enemy<00:02:43.350> and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
no longer simply double tap an enemy and

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.800 
no longer simply double tap an enemy and
they<00:02:43.620> will<00:02:43.770> die<00:02:44.010> but<00:02:44.700> if<00:02:44.850> you<00:02:44.970> get<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> body<00:02:45.450> shot

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
they will die but if you get a body shot

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.229 
they will die but if you get a body shot
and<00:02:46.080> a<00:02:46.560> couple<00:02:46.980> more<00:02:47.100> body<00:02:47.370> shots<00:02:47.489> then<00:02:48.060> you

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
and a couple more body shots then you

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.090 
and a couple more body shots then you
might<00:02:48.390> stack<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.930> dot<00:02:49.110> high<00:02:49.320> enough<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:50.070> where

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
might stack the dot high enough to where

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.890 
might stack the dot high enough to where
it<00:02:50.370> will<00:02:50.489> do<00:02:50.640> enough<00:02:50.910> damage<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.510> finish<00:02:51.750> off

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
it will do enough damage to finish off

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.310 
it will do enough damage to finish off
an<00:02:52.050> enemy<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.680> intention<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.420> d-o-t<00:02:55.050> on

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
an enemy the intention of the d-o-t on

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.580 
an enemy the intention of the d-o-t on
the<00:02:56.100> thorn<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.850> not<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.570> slayer<00:02:58.020> at<00:02:58.320> first

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the thorn is not to be a slayer at first

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.400 
the thorn is not to be a slayer at first
but<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.160> stop<00:02:59.670> the<00:02:59.880> enemy<00:03:00.060> from<00:03:00.420> RE<00:03:00.840> Jenning

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
but to stop the enemy from RE Jenning

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.990 
but to stop the enemy from RE Jenning
their<00:03:01.590> shield<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.130> they<00:03:02.640> didn't<00:03:02.880> say<00:03:02.970> anything

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
their shield so they didn't say anything

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.300 
their shield so they didn't say anything
about<00:03:03.360> changing<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.140> duration<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.890> d-o-t

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
about changing the duration of the d-o-t

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.699 
about changing the duration of the d-o-t
just<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.940> upfront<00:03:06.120> damage<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:06.989> d-o-t<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
just the upfront damage of the d-o-t and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.740 
just the upfront damage of the d-o-t and
i<00:03:08.130> think<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:08.880> about<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.630> will

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
i think that's just about right it will

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.900 
i think that's just about right it will
prevent<00:03:10.080> players<00:03:10.380> from<00:03:10.560> straight<00:03:11.489> up<00:03:11.670> to

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
prevent players from straight up to

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.720 
prevent players from straight up to
shotting<00:03:12.770> combatants<00:03:13.770> inside<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.310> crucible

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
shotting combatants inside the crucible

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.100 
shotting combatants inside the crucible
which<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> change<00:03:15.390> that<00:03:15.780> a<00:03:15.810> lot<00:03:15.989> of<00:03:16.020> people

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
which is the change that a lot of people

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.320 
which is the change that a lot of people
asked<00:03:16.650> for<00:03:16.800> I<00:03:17.010> use<00:03:17.370> it<00:03:17.549> and<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:17.760> agree<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.060> it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
asked for I use it and I agree with it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.890 
asked for I use it and I agree with it
what<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> do<00:03:19.350> like<00:03:19.590> about<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.850> stacking<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.720> to

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
what I do like about the stacking up to

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.650 
what I do like about the stacking up to
five<00:03:22.140> times<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.130> thorn<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.640> t<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:24.540> you

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
five times of the thorn do t as if you

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.660 
five times of the thorn do t as if you
do<00:03:24.870> get<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.140> successful<00:03:25.739> five<00:03:25.950> stacks<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.549> will

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
do get to successful five stacks it will

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.520 
do get to successful five stacks it will
be<00:03:26.790> significantly<00:03:27.600> more<00:03:27.780> powerful<00:03:27.840> than<00:03:28.410> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
be significantly more powerful than the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.640 
be significantly more powerful than the
thorn<00:03:28.769> do<00:03:28.950> t<00:03:29.220> was<00:03:29.820> previously<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.440> makes

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
thorn do t was previously and this makes

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.699 
thorn do t was previously and this makes
it<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.950> viable<00:03:32.519> and<00:03:32.970> fun<00:03:33.269> choice<00:03:33.510> inside<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.230> PvE

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
it a viable and fun choice inside of PvE

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.500 
it a viable and fun choice inside of PvE
environments<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.580> thorn<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.060> kind<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.360> getting

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
environments so thorn is kind of getting

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.130 
environments so thorn is kind of getting
a<00:03:36.720> nerf<00:03:36.989> buff<00:03:37.850> so<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.299> think<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.690> cool<00:03:39.900> i

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
a nerf buff so I think that's cool i

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.900 
a nerf buff so I think that's cool i
like<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.680> thorn<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.070> it<00:03:41.220> gets<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.400> fun<00:03:41.549> weapon

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
like the thorn and it gets a fun weapon

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.270 
like the thorn and it gets a fun weapon
i<00:03:42.030> would<00:03:42.239> like<00:03:42.360> to<00:03:42.600> be<00:03:42.690> able<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.989> use<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.470> inside

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
i would like to be able to use it inside

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.190 
i would like to be able to use it inside
of<00:03:44.519> say<00:03:44.700> strikes<00:03:45.090> or<00:03:45.420> raids<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:45.959> who<00:03:46.049> knows

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
of say strikes or raids and who knows

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.650 
of say strikes or raids and who knows
maybe<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.250> designated<00:03:47.660> thorner

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
maybe if you have a designated thorner

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.680 
maybe if you have a designated thorner
then<00:03:49.230> you<00:03:50.160> know<00:03:50.280> that'd<00:03:50.459> be<00:03:50.610> a<00:03:50.640> neat<00:03:51.150> position

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
then you know that'd be a neat position

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.860 
then you know that'd be a neat position
inside<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.930> right<00:03:52.140> my<00:03:52.290> only<00:03:52.560> question<00:03:53.040> is

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
inside the right my only question is

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.569 
inside the right my only question is
with<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:55.200> change<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.100> way<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.459> the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
with this change to the way that the

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.020 
with this change to the way that the
thorn<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:57.600> t<00:03:58.019> stacks<00:03:58.470> is<00:03:58.829> can<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.760> get

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
thorn do t stacks is can you get

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.910 
thorn do t stacks is can you get
multiple<00:04:00.510> stacks<00:04:00.810> from<00:04:01.019> multiple<00:04:01.500> players

multiple stacks from multiple players

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.789 
multiple stacks from multiple players
and<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:03.000> first<00:04:03.510> see<00:04:03.720> this<00:04:03.989> being<00:04:04.200> an<00:04:04.350> issue<00:04:04.410> if

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
and I first see this being an issue if

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.400 
and I first see this being an issue if
you<00:04:04.980> can<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.450> don't<00:04:06.660> think<00:04:06.959> you're<00:04:07.230> going

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
you can but I don't think you're going

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.259
