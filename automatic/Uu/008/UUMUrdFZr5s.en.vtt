00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.770
 which I did for a sorcerer called 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:21.080
 he is a fetishist let's consider the main ones 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.080
 and the passive skill of this gold 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 left mouse button we have a spell 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.800
 invasions of toads with rune rain and toads 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.870
 which cause periodic damage to those 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.860
 most contributes 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.910
 call our fetishes that relate 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.489
 passive ability to lead you their fetishes they 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.180
 created periodically and 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:51.059
 their number is 15 pieces they 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.039
 cause very good damage and it will 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.379
 our main skill second is right 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.300
 mouse button 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.210
 spells piranha fucking piranha up 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.189
 which creates a whirl in this 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 swirl fall our monsters 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.850
 elite ordinary and thereby created 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.130
 very good control 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.049
 you are at a distance at that time 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.619
 because both our oshri copes very 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.070
 fast with our monsters 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 now let's look at the keyboard and 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.250
 1 4 keyboard buttons first army 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.799
 fetish string pyro edema 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.229
 it stumbled which allows us 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:43.140
 cause 4 more fetishes causing damage from 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.759
 fire on the enemy and damage 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:52.290
 is somewhere around two thousand 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.329
 percent from arrow same next this 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.170
 call of the words zombie sorona flaming dogs 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.110
 who hold back 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.190
 damage done by our wizard 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.410
 most increases our survival rate 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.319
 the third is the poster of the spirit with is equal 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.349
 astral journey 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.569
 which allows us to move 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.970
 long time avoiding different 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.250
 type traps 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:30.000
 association teach 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:32.069
 walls and so on 4 this is a big scary 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.400
 input from ron ritual dance 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.900
 which helps us creating small 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.050
 region 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.090
 we fall in it and our abilities 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:49.790
 double the intelligence damage 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.920
 recovery of lives 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:58.340
 resistance all parameters 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.310
 increase somewhere around 30 40 percent 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.019
 now move on to passive skill 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.489
 passive skill first I already 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.000
 said it 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.860
 and steve and feed, and which are created by 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.390
 dealing damage with basic skills 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:21.530
 invasions of toads and piranhas the second is 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:25.170
 perfume container that allows us 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:29.040
 get rid of the lethal order 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:33.660
 most we admire go to the world 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.880
 spirits and can be saved from death by running away 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.760
 then some distance and having drunk a bottle 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:46.319
 potion restore your life third 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.069
 it is an unjust death which 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:54.180
 allows us to delegate our 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:57.480
 passive basic skills this ability 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:01.290
 very useful because let's say when 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.920
 you meet a very big tutu 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.489
 monsters where ordinary monsters and elite 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.950
 monsters 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.700
 you need with them very quickly 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:16.019
 deal down so you first 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:19.200
 use the piranha spell to 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:24.460
 do control then pour on them on 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:28.120
 6 lie and thus when you shine and 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:32.770
 all monsters come to your rescue 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.389
 die and our spell that we 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:40.990
 used the first time she returns 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:45.599
 again we can repeat it again 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.849
 just not spending a lot of time 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:51.880
 4 is a step that allows us to 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:59.050
 increase our damage by 20 percent and 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:01.440
 mana is 30 percent now let me 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.440
 I will show you 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.550

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.050
 this is not what you wanted to see i am you 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.289
 just showing what this character is 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.250
 can create very quickly for him 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:26.199
 equipment is selected instantly I 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.440

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.440

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.419
 set agents which reduces damage by 7 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:40.509

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.270
 plus reduces stains by 15 percent off 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:48.000
 special opponents and increases damage by 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:52.259
 15 percent by main opponent 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.740

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:26.380
 around your sorcerer thus it will 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.870
