00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.519 
you what we have here is a small battery
powered<00:00:17.400> fan<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.240> this<00:00:18.810> fan<00:00:19.019> is<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.410> to

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
powered fan and this fan is going to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
powered fan and this fan is going to
blow<00:00:19.740> against<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.519> deflector<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.689> we'd

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
blow against this deflector what we'd

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.929 
blow against this deflector what we'd
like<00:00:22.019> to<00:00:22.080> do<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.650> modulate<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> power<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
like to do is modulate the power to the

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.599 
like to do is modulate the power to the
fan<00:00:24.179> to<00:00:24.900> control<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:25.890> air<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.369> hitting

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
fan to control how much air is hitting

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.700 
fan to control how much air is hitting
the<00:00:26.640> deflector<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.779> we'd<00:00:27.929> like<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.259> control

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the deflector then we'd like to control

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.040 
the deflector then we'd like to control
the<00:00:29.279> actual<00:00:29.609> position<00:00:30.119> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.599> deflector

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the actual position of the deflector

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.290 
the actual position of the deflector
itself<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> get<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.430> done<00:00:32.700> we'll<00:00:33.059> need<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
itself so to get this done we'll need to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
itself so to get this done we'll need to
do<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.420> couple<00:00:33.780> things<00:00:33.809> one<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> first<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.250> have

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
do a couple things one is first we have

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.130 
do a couple things one is first we have
to<00:00:35.430> be<00:00:35.610> able<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.030> change<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.539> power<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
to be able to change the power of the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
to be able to change the power of the
fan<00:00:37.440> itself<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:38.489> way<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.789> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> do

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
fan itself the way we're going to do

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.240 
fan itself the way we're going to do
this<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.690> we've<00:00:39.870> taken<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.230> power<00:00:40.440> transistor

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
this is we've taken a power transistor

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.189 
this is we've taken a power transistor
and<00:00:41.460> we've<00:00:41.910> inserted<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.750> between<00:00:42.930> the

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
and we've inserted it in between the

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:45.049 
and we've inserted it in between the
batteries<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.460> able<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> control

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
batteries we have to be able to control

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
batteries we have to be able to control
the<00:00:45.510> power<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:46.109> those<00:00:46.230> batteries<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.890> fan

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the power of those batteries to the fan

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.010 
the power of those batteries to the fan
through<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.579> transistor<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.809> we've<00:00:48.989> taken

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
through that transistor so we've taken

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.709 
through that transistor so we've taken
an<00:00:49.469> analog<00:00:49.920> output<00:00:50.280> channel<00:00:50.609> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.120> CSeries

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
an analog output channel on the CSeries

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.880 
an analog output channel on the CSeries
92<00:00:52.350> 63<00:00:53.100> analog<00:00:53.760> output<00:00:54.149> module<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
92 63 analog output module and this is a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.700 
92 63 analog output module and this is a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
four channel analog output module we're

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.229 
four channel analog output module we're
just<00:00:58.890> using<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.399> those<00:00:59.579> channels<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just using one of those channels and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.779 
just using one of those channels and
we're<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> use<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.350> then<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.789> control

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
we're going to use that then to control

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.160 
we're going to use that then to control
the<00:01:02.879> power<00:01:03.090> transistor<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:03.809> will<00:01:03.989> modulate

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the power transistor which will modulate

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.859 
the power transistor which will modulate
the<00:01:04.890> fan<00:01:05.129> itself<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.420> need<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.720> actually

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the fan itself then we need to actually

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.620 
the fan itself then we need to actually
go<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.470> monitor<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.490> deflector<00:01:09.030> position<00:01:09.479> as

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
go and monitor the deflector position as

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.600 
go and monitor the deflector position as
well<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.500> way<00:01:10.619> we're<00:01:10.770> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:11.070> do<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.369> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
well the way we're going to do this is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
well the way we're going to do this is

first<00:01:46.020> thing<00:01:46.200> we'll<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> front

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
first thing we'll do is on the front

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.410 
first thing we'll do is on the front
panel<00:01:47.939> will<00:01:48.360> put<00:01:48.540> down<00:01:48.719> a<00:01:49.020> waveform<00:01:49.500> chart<00:01:50.420> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
panel will put down a waveform chart so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.999 
panel will put down a waveform chart so
we'll<00:01:51.509> drop<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> waveform<00:01:52.350> chart<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.860> we're

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
we'll drop the waveform chart and we're

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.560 
we'll drop the waveform chart and we're
going<00:01:53.219> to<00:01:53.280> go<00:01:53.490> ahead<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.939> scale<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.509> thing

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
going to go ahead and scale this thing

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.639 
going to go ahead and scale this thing
to<00:01:55.439> go<00:01:55.590> from<00:01:55.799> 2.5<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.210> 2.8<00:01:57.750> we've<00:01:58.409> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
to go from 2.5 to 2.8 we've just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.640 
to go from 2.5 to 2.8 we've just
determined<00:01:59.159> those<00:01:59.280> values<00:01:59.729> experimentally

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
determined those values experimentally

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.650 
determined those values experimentally
another<00:02:02.460> thing<00:02:02.640> we'd<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.940> to<00:02:03.060> do<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.330> not

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
another thing we'd like to do is not

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.720 
another thing we'd like to do is not
Auto<00:02:03.990> scale<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:04.680> we'll<00:02:04.830> turn<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.250> off<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
Auto scale so we'll turn that off and

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.760 
Auto scale so we'll turn that off and
then<00:02:06.180> we'll<00:02:06.330> go<00:02:06.480> and<00:02:06.660> expand<00:02:07.110> our<00:02:07.290> legend<00:02:07.710> a

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
then we'll go and expand our legend a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
then we'll go and expand our legend a
little<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.550> we<00:02:08.670> can<00:02:08.820> have<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> couple

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
little bit so we can have a couple

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.450 
little bit so we can have a couple
traces<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.960> we're<00:02:10.680> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.950> set<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.250> line

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
traces and we're going to set the line

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.240 
traces and we're going to set the line
width<00:02:11.700> on<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.150> as<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.770> so<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.070> can

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
width on this as well so that you can

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.390 
width on this as well so that you can
see<00:02:14.430> them<00:02:14.610> better<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.810> video<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:17.280> we'll

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
see them better in the video so we'll

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.420 
see them better in the video so we'll
just<00:02:17.580> set<00:02:17.730> those<00:02:17.910> up<00:02:19.130> next<00:02:20.130> thing<00:02:20.250> we'd<00:02:20.400> like

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
just set those up next thing we'd like

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.600 
just set those up next thing we'd like
to<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.150> put<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.630> slider<00:02:22.350> on<00:02:22.650> our<00:02:23.010> front<00:02:23.190> panel

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to do is put a slider on our front panel

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.640 
to do is put a slider on our front panel
this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.240> going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.570> allow<00:02:24.840> us<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:25.110> set<00:02:25.500> the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
this is going to allow us to set the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.130 
this is going to allow us to set the
requested<00:02:26.310> angle<00:02:26.760> or<00:02:26.940> set<00:02:27.300> point<00:02:27.570> for<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
requested angle or set point for the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.020 
requested angle or set point for the
deflector<00:02:28.590> itself<00:02:28.980> we're<00:02:29.550> going<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.790> go<00:02:29.940> ahead

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
deflector itself we're going to go ahead

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.300 
deflector itself we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:30.210> scale<00:02:30.600> this<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.500> same<00:02:31.710> levels<00:02:32.070> that

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and scale this to the same levels that

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.140 
and scale this to the same levels that
we<00:02:32.460> put<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.880> our<00:02:33.000> waveform<00:02:33.210> chart<00:02:35.030> so<00:02:36.030> when

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
we put on our waveform chart so when

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.670 
we put on our waveform chart so when
we're<00:02:36.270> done<00:02:36.300> with<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.780> we'll<00:02:36.959> go<00:02:37.140> now<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> our

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
we're done with that we'll go now to our

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.460 
we're done with that we'll go now to our
diagram<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.760> will<00:02:39.270> begin<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.690> program<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
diagram and will begin to program the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.410 
diagram and will begin to program the
application<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.760> first<00:02:41.970> thing<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.300> would

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
application the first thing we would

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.449 
application the first thing we would
like<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.050> monitor<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.770> position<00:02:43.950> of

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
like to do is monitor the position of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.100 
like to do is monitor the position of
our<00:02:44.730> deflector<00:02:45.180> so<00:02:45.330> we're<00:02:45.450> going<00:02:45.630> to<00:02:45.780> get<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
our deflector so we're going to get the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.080 
our deflector so we're going to get the
dap<00:02:46.290> assistant<00:02:46.890> we're<00:02:47.610> going<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.850> drop<00:02:48.030> it

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
dap assistant we're going to drop it

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.420 
dap assistant we're going to drop it
down<00:02:48.390> and<00:02:48.750> we're<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> set<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> up<00:02:50.250> to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
down and we're going to set this up to

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.420 
down and we're going to set this up to
do<00:02:50.580> an<00:02:50.790> analog<00:02:51.330> input<00:02:52.050> task<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.920> will<00:02:53.100> acquire

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
do an analog input task so will acquire

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.199 
do an analog input task so will acquire
signals<00:02:53.970> analog<00:02:54.959> input<00:02:55.440> voltage<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:57.000> take

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
signals analog input voltage will take

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.930 
signals analog input voltage will take
it<00:02:57.390> from<00:02:57.420> our<00:02:57.930> 9215<00:02:58.860> module<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.459> that's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
it from our 9215 module and that's

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.640 
it from our 9215 module and that's
analog<00:03:00.240> input<00:03:00.570> channel<00:03:00.900> 0<00:03:01.140> which<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> this

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
analog input channel 0 which is this

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.150 
analog input channel 0 which is this
channel<00:03:02.010> right<00:03:02.250> here<00:03:03.530> now<00:03:04.530> we<00:03:04.590> just<00:03:04.920> need<00:03:04.950> to

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
channel right here now we just need to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.400 
channel right here now we just need to
tell<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.580> acquire<00:03:05.880> one<00:03:06.180> sample<00:03:06.810> on<00:03:07.019> demand

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
tell it to acquire one sample on demand

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.500 
tell it to acquire one sample on demand
everything<00:03:08.040> else<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.400> fine<00:03:08.580> by<00:03:08.820> default<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
everything else is fine by default and

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.300 
everything else is fine by default and
what<00:03:09.959> we'd<00:03:10.080> like<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.440> is<00:03:10.560> test<00:03:10.769> this<00:03:10.980> out<00:03:11.130> so

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
what we'd like to do is test this out so

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.800 
what we'd like to do is test this out so
let's<00:03:11.489> actually<00:03:11.700> go<00:03:12.000> and<00:03:12.150> run<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.510> will<00:03:12.690> click

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
let's actually go and run it will click

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.660 
let's actually go and run it will click
the<00:03:12.989> Run<00:03:13.170> button<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.980> see<00:03:14.130> that<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> get<00:03:14.519> 1

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
the Run button we see that we get 1

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.610 
the Run button we see that we get 1
point<00:03:14.880> 6<00:03:15.209> volts<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.080> resting<00:03:16.440> position

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
point 6 volts in the resting position

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.130 
point 6 volts in the resting position
and<00:03:16.950> if<00:03:17.040> I<00:03:17.160> move<00:03:17.370> this<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.610> little<00:03:17.850> bit<00:03:18.120> you<00:03:18.959> can

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
and if I move this a little bit you can

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.630 
and if I move this a little bit you can
see<00:03:19.200> we're<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.530> to<00:03:19.680> 2.6<00:03:20.390> 2.7<00:03:21.390> there's<00:03:22.260> 2.4<00:03:22.920> 2.3

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
see we're up to 2.6 2.7 there's 2.4 2.3

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.520 
see we're up to 2.6 2.7 there's 2.4 2.3
so<00:03:24.120> now<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.390> verified<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.019> we<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.410> actually

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so now we verified that we can actually

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.979 
so now we verified that we can actually
read<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.130> position<00:03:26.610> of<00:03:26.790> our<00:03:27.150> deflector<00:03:27.600> so

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
read the position of our deflector so

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.570 
read the position of our deflector so
let's<00:03:28.200> say<00:03:28.350> ok<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.709> accept<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.459> we'll

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
let's say ok and accept this and we'll

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.810 
let's say ok and accept this and we'll
put<00:03:29.790> it<00:03:29.880> in<00:03:29.970> our<00:03:30.060> diagram<00:03:31.280> now<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.459> we've<00:03:32.610> got

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
put it in our diagram now that we've got

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.360 
put it in our diagram now that we've got
both<00:03:33.060> our<00:03:33.239> slider<00:03:33.570> input<00:03:34.019> coming<00:03:34.320> in<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.800> also

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
both our slider input coming in and also

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.860 
both our slider input coming in and also
our<00:03:35.400> analog<00:03:35.880> input<00:03:36.239> coming<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.600> let's<00:03:36.750> go

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
our analog input coming in let's go

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.509 
our analog input coming in let's go
ahead<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.050> wire<00:03:37.350> those<00:03:37.620> up<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.160> our<00:03:38.280> waveform

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
ahead and wire those up to our waveform

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.580 
ahead and wire those up to our waveform
chart<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.300> those<00:03:39.780> are<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.959> two<00:03:40.230> things<00:03:40.260> that

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
chart and those are the two things that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.680 
chart and those are the two things that
we're<00:03:40.800> going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:42.180> chart<00:03:42.510> when

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
we're going to see on that chart when

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.170 
we're going to see on that chart when
the<00:03:42.780> program<00:03:43.110> runs<00:03:43.400> so<00:03:44.400> clean<00:03:44.670> that<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.880> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the program runs so clean that up and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.060 
the program runs so clean that up and
that's<00:03:45.480> pretty<00:03:45.750> straightforward<00:03:46.380> next<00:03:46.950> thing

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
that's pretty straightforward next thing

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.670 
that's pretty straightforward next thing
we'd<00:03:47.280> like<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.580> do<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:48.000> analog<00:03:48.630> output<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.290> our

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
we'd like to do is analog output and our

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.590 
we'd like to do is analog output and our
analog<00:03:50.070> output<00:03:50.580> is<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.030> allow<00:03:51.269> us<00:03:51.450> to

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
analog output is going to allow us to

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.140 
analog output is going to allow us to
control<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.650> fan<00:03:52.890> motor<00:03:53.100> through<00:03:53.730> that<00:03:53.910> power

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
control the fan motor through that power

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.509 
control the fan motor through that power
transistor<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.500> we'll<00:03:55.620> drop<00:03:55.799> this<00:03:56.040> down<00:03:56.100> and

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
transistor so we'll drop this down and

let's go ahead and output 2 volts and
see<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.730> if<00:04:22.820> our<00:04:22.970> fan<00:04:23.240> turns<00:04:23.600> on<00:04:24.790> so<00:04:25.790> sure

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
see that if our fan turns on so sure

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.880 
see that if our fan turns on so sure
enough<00:04:26.000> our<00:04:26.330> fan<00:04:26.540> turns<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.990> and<00:04:27.260> the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
enough our fan turns on and the

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.710 
enough our fan turns on and the
deflector<00:04:28.340> moves<00:04:28.580> let's<00:04:28.850> output<00:04:29.180> three<00:04:29.420> bolts

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720

deflector moves let's output three bolts
and<00:04:29.840> see<00:04:29.930> if<00:04:29.990> we<00:04:30.110> can<00:04:30.260> increase<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:31.010> power<00:04:31.160> and

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
and see if we can increase the power and

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.540 
and see if we can increase the power and
sure<00:04:32.630> enough<00:04:32.660> we<00:04:32.960> can<00:04:33.200> let's<00:04:33.740> output<00:04:34.100> one<00:04:34.340> bolt

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
sure enough we can let's output one bolt

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.310 
sure enough we can let's output one bolt
this<00:04:34.730> saw<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:34.970> bring<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.420> almost<00:04:35.930> stopped

this saw to bring it to almost stopped

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.470 
this saw to bring it to almost stopped
so<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.250> lets<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.610> off<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.030> see<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:38.270> fan

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
so it lets it off and you see the fan

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.480 
so it lets it off and you see the fan
slowed<00:04:38.720> way<00:04:38.930> down<00:04:38.960> let's<00:04:39.530> output<00:04:39.860> zero<00:04:40.190> and

slowed way down let's output zero and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.750 
slowed way down let's output zero and
that<00:04:40.610> should<00:04:40.850> stop<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.180> and<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:42.800> does<00:04:42.980> let's

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
that should stop it and it does let's

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.480 
that should stop it and it does let's

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
is take that slider and wire it into the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.710 
is take that slider and wire it into the
setpoint<00:05:15.470> terminal<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.910> we'll<00:05:17.060> wire<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.480> up

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
setpoint terminal so we'll wire that up

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.110 
setpoint terminal so we'll wire that up
and<00:05:17.960> we're<00:05:18.500> good<00:05:18.680> there<00:05:18.890> next<00:05:19.880> thing<00:05:20.000> I'd<00:05:20.090> like

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 
and we're good there next thing I'd like

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.120 
and we're good there next thing I'd like
to<00:05:20.270> do<00:05:20.480> is<00:05:20.600> take<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.960> analog<00:05:21.380> input<00:05:21.800> which<00:05:21.980> is

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
to do is take the analog input which is

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.890 
to do is take the analog input which is
telling<00:05:22.460> me<00:05:22.580> where<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.060> deflector<00:05:23.480> is<00:05:23.660> and

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
telling me where the deflector is and

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.960 
telling me where the deflector is and
wire<00:05:24.320> that<00:05:24.530> into<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.950> process<00:05:25.430> variable

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
wire that into the process variable

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.140 
wire that into the process variable
input<00:05:26.450> of<00:05:26.570> the<00:05:26.660> PID<00:05:27.440> function<00:05:28.010> so<00:05:28.850> let's<00:05:29.000> go

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
input of the PID function so let's go

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.700 
input of the PID function so let's go
ahead<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:29.390> wire<00:05:29.690> that<00:05:29.870> into<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.260> process

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
ahead and wire that into the process

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.560 
ahead and wire that into the process
variable<00:05:31.070> input<00:05:31.370> we're<00:05:31.550> good<00:05:31.700> there<00:05:31.910> there's

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
variable input we're good there there's

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.030 
variable input we're good there there's
a<00:05:32.660> couple<00:05:32.810> other<00:05:32.990> things<00:05:33.080> we<00:05:33.440> need<00:05:33.620> to<00:05:33.710> set<00:05:33.919> up

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:34.040 
a couple other things we need to set up

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.130 
a couple other things we need to set up
for<00:05:34.250> PID<00:05:34.430> which<00:05:35.210> is<00:05:35.419> the<00:05:35.540> men<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.900> max

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
for PID which is the men and the max

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.140 
for PID which is the men and the max
value<00:05:36.380> and<00:05:36.770> I<00:05:36.980> know<00:05:37.040> that<00:05:37.340> the<00:05:37.460> maximum<00:05:37.669> output

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
value and I know that the maximum output

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.380 
value and I know that the maximum output
that<00:05:38.419> I<00:05:38.480> one<00:05:38.690> output<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.260> the<00:05:39.290> power<00:05:39.740> is<00:05:40.390> 55

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
that I one output to the power is 55

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.850 
that I one output to the power is 55
volts<00:05:41.630> who<00:05:41.870> will<00:05:41.990> put<00:05:42.140> five<00:05:42.410> there<00:05:42.650> is<00:05:42.740> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
volts who will put five there is the

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.250 
volts who will put five there is the
constant<00:05:43.340> then<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:43.940> want<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.270> create<00:05:44.570> a<00:05:44.840> zero

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
constant then I want to create a zero

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.590 
constant then I want to create a zero
constant<00:05:45.860> for<00:05:46.130> the<00:05:46.400> minimum<00:05:46.730> that'll<00:05:47.240> be<00:05:47.360> zero

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
constant for the minimum that'll be zero

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.659 
constant for the minimum that'll be zero
we're<00:05:48.020> good<00:05:48.200> there<00:05:48.410> and<00:05:48.680> then<00:05:49.370> what<00:05:49.520> I<00:05:49.550> would

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
we're good there and then what I would

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.970 
we're good there and then what I would
like<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.060> do<00:05:50.240> is<00:05:50.450> allow<00:05:50.930> us<00:05:51.200> to<00:05:51.380> control<00:05:51.710> the

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:51.980 
like to do is allow us to control the

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.890 
like to do is allow us to control the
pind<00:05:52.460> as<00:05:52.669> variables<00:05:53.180> from<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.450> front<00:05:53.690> panel

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
pind as variables from the front panel

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.960 
pind as variables from the front panel
so<00:05:54.410> we're<00:05:54.560> going<00:05:54.650> to<00:05:54.740> create<00:05:54.950> controls<00:05:55.610> and

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
so we're going to create controls and

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.850 
so we're going to create controls and
they'll<00:05:56.360> all<00:05:56.570> show<00:05:56.780> up<00:05:56.960> on<00:05:57.110> the<00:05:57.380> front<00:05:57.650> panel

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
they'll all show up on the front panel

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.190 
they'll all show up on the front panel
that<00:05:58.520> we<00:05:58.669> can<00:05:58.850> change<00:05:59.090> while<00:05:59.690> the<00:05:59.810> program<00:05:59.990> is

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
that we can change while the program is

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.750 
that we can change while the program is
running

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
running

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.210 
running
and<00:06:01.930> then<00:06:02.930> we<00:06:03.140> want<00:06:03.380> to<00:06:03.470> take<00:06:03.620> the<00:06:03.800> output<00:06:03.950> of

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
and then we want to take the output of

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.070 
and then we want to take the output of
PID<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.850> we<00:06:04.970> want<00:06:05.150> to<00:06:05.210> wire<00:06:05.360> that<00:06:05.570> over<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:05.990> the

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
PID and we want to wire that over to the

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.190 
PID and we want to wire that over to the
analog<00:06:06.410> output<00:06:06.800> and<00:06:07.690> that<00:06:08.690> will<00:06:08.810> control<00:06:09.140> it

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
analog output and that will control it

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.050 
analog output and that will control it
so<00:06:09.800> if<00:06:09.920> we<00:06:10.010> do<00:06:10.100> a<00:06:10.130> control<00:06:10.520> you<00:06:10.700> this<00:06:10.910> will

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
so if we do a control you this will

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.060 
so if we do a control you this will
clean<00:06:11.240> up<00:06:11.270> nicely<00:06:11.630> and<00:06:12.110> what<00:06:12.560> I'd<00:06:12.650> like<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.860> do

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
clean up nicely and what I'd like to do

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.590 
clean up nicely and what I'd like to do
is<00:06:13.250> put<00:06:13.400> a<00:06:13.430> loop<00:06:13.610> around<00:06:13.760> this<00:06:14.060> so<00:06:14.240> that<00:06:14.360> it<00:06:14.450> can

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
is put a loop around this so that it can

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.280 
is put a loop around this so that it can
run<00:06:14.720> over<00:06:14.780> and<00:06:15.050> over<00:06:15.230> again<00:06:16.990> so<00:06:17.990> we<00:06:18.050> drop<00:06:18.260> down

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
run over and over again so we drop down

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.770 
run over and over again so we drop down
this<00:06:18.620> while<00:06:18.860> loop<00:06:19.030> will<00:06:20.030> create<00:06:20.330> a<00:06:20.360> control

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
this while loop will create a control

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.270 
this while loop will create a control
for<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.080> front<00:06:21.260> panel<00:06:21.470> so<00:06:21.740> that<00:06:21.800> when<00:06:22.010> we<00:06:22.070> hit

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
for the front panel so that when we hit

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:25.330 
for the front panel so that when we hit
the<00:06:22.370> stop<00:06:22.610> button<00:06:22.990> everything<00:06:23.990> can<00:06:24.170> stop<00:06:24.440> but

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
the stop button everything can stop but

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.590 
the stop button everything can stop but
the<00:06:25.520> last<00:06:25.730> thing<00:06:25.940> I<00:06:26.030> would<00:06:26.150> like<00:06:26.180> to<00:06:26.390> do<00:06:26.480> is

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:26.600 
the last thing I would like to do is

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.900 
the last thing I would like to do is
copy<00:06:26.870> this<00:06:27.200> analog<00:06:27.710> output<00:06:28.220> task<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.790> I'd

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
copy this analog output task and I'd

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.240 
copy this analog output task and I'd
like<00:06:29.000> to<00:06:29.060> put<00:06:29.360> it<00:06:29.450> outside<00:06:29.660> of<00:06:30.350> the<00:06:30.830> loop<00:06:31.010> and

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
like to put it outside of the loop and

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.670 
like to put it outside of the loop and
then<00:06:32.000> when<00:06:32.300> I<00:06:32.330> hit<00:06:32.570> the<00:06:32.720> stop<00:06:32.960> button<00:06:32.990> I<00:06:33.410> want

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 
then when I hit the stop button I want

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.640 
then when I hit the stop button I want
this<00:06:33.830> to<00:06:33.890> output<00:06:34.460> a<00:06:34.640> 0<00:06:35.030> to<00:06:35.870> the<00:06:35.900> power<00:06:35.990> of<00:06:36.590> the

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
this to output a 0 to the power of the

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.520 
this to output a 0 to the power of the
fan<00:06:37.100> that<00:06:37.400> will<00:06:37.550> shut<00:06:37.700> the<00:06:37.850> fan<00:06:38.030> off<00:06:38.060> in<00:06:38.530> order

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
fan that will shut the fan off in order

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.750 
fan that will shut the fan off in order
to<00:06:39.620> make<00:06:39.710> sure<00:06:39.890> this<00:06:40.010> happens<00:06:40.250> after<00:06:40.670> the

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:40.760 
to make sure this happens after the

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.520 
to make sure this happens after the
program<00:06:41.000> runs<00:06:41.450> I'm<00:06:41.660> going<00:06:41.840> to<00:06:41.900> wire<00:06:42.110> the<00:06:42.320> error

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:42.530 
program runs I'm going to wire the error

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.400 
program runs I'm going to wire the error
out<00:06:43.250> through<00:06:43.970> the<00:06:44.090> loop<00:06:44.300> into<00:06:45.110> the<00:06:45.200> error

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
out through the loop into the error

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.150 
out through the loop into the error
input<00:06:46.130> of<00:06:46.280> the<00:06:47.050> analog<00:06:48.050> output<00:06:48.440> task<00:06:48.680> and

that's going to make sure the order of
execution<00:06:50.360> happens<00:06:51.200> such<00:06:51.590> that<00:06:51.770> we<00:06:51.890> shut<00:06:52.130> it

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:52.250 
execution happens such that we shut it

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.460 
execution happens such that we shut it
off<00:06:52.400> once<00:06:52.940> the<00:06:53.030> loop<00:06:53.240> finishes<00:06:53.750> let's<00:06:54.260> go<00:06:54.410> to

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
off once the loop finishes let's go to

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.380 
off once the loop finishes let's go to
the<00:06:54.620> front<00:06:54.800> panel<00:06:55.100> now<00:06:55.340> and<00:06:55.760> lets<00:06:55.970> up<00:06:56.150> some

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
the front panel now and lets up some

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.600 
the front panel now and lets up some
values<00:06:56.720> for<00:06:56.930> the<00:06:56.990> P<00:06:57.200> the<00:06:57.470> eye<00:06:57.500> and<00:06:57.740> the<00:06:57.800> D<00:06:57.980> so

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
values for the P the eye and the D so

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:59.980 
values for the P the eye and the D so
the<00:06:58.700> P<00:06:58.880> showed<00:06:59.150> up<00:06:59.330> at<00:06:59.450> the<00:06:59.510> top<00:06:59.690> of<00:06:59.750> our

in for that value down below the I
showed<00:07:04.850> up<00:07:05.060> and<00:07:05.240> that's<00:07:05.450> going<00:07:05.660> to<00:07:05.780> be<00:07:05.840> 0<00:07:05.870> point

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:06.140 
showed up and that's going to be 0 point

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.310 
showed up and that's going to be 0 point
five<00:07:06.380> and<00:07:06.710> then<00:07:06.980> let's<00:07:07.160> set<00:07:07.340> D<00:07:07.970> 2.01<00:07:08.690> some

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
five and then let's set D 2.01 some

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.160 
five and then let's set D 2.01 some
small<00:07:09.710> value<00:07:10.390> we're<00:07:11.390> ready<00:07:11.600> to<00:07:11.660> go<00:07:11.840> ahead<00:07:11.870> and

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:12.170 
small value we're ready to go ahead and

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.690 
small value we're ready to go ahead and
run<00:07:12.290> this<00:07:12.410> let's<00:07:12.680> move<00:07:12.920> our<00:07:13.070> slider<00:07:13.370> to<00:07:13.580> an

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:13.700 
run this let's move our slider to an

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.030 
run this let's move our slider to an
initial<00:07:14.120> position<00:07:14.510> of<00:07:14.600> about<00:07:14.780> 2.5<00:07:15.620> or<00:07:15.650> so

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
initial position of about 2.5 or so

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.060 
initial position of about 2.5 or so
we'll<00:07:16.910> hit<00:07:17.090> the<00:07:17.240> Run<00:07:17.420> button<00:07:17.450> and<00:07:18.010> this<00:07:19.010> will

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
we'll hit the Run button and this will

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.130 
we'll hit the Run button and this will
take<00:07:19.430> off<00:07:19.640> and<00:07:19.850> our<00:07:19.940> fan<00:07:20.390> goes<00:07:20.600> and<00:07:20.810> it<00:07:20.900> turns

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
take off and our fan goes and it turns

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.800 
take off and our fan goes and it turns
and<00:07:21.440> it<00:07:22.250> begins<00:07:22.490> to<00:07:22.610> drop<00:07:22.910> power<00:07:23.240> and<00:07:23.540> we<00:07:23.630> can

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:23.810 
and it begins to drop power and we can

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:25.780 
and it begins to drop power and we can
see<00:07:23.990> that<00:07:24.020> it<00:07:24.230> comes<00:07:24.470> in<00:07:24.740> and<00:07:24.950> it's<00:07:25.520> going<00:07:25.730> to

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:25.790 
see that it comes in and it's going to

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.000 
see that it comes in and it's going to
oscillate<00:07:26.000> until<00:07:26.930> it<00:07:27.050> can<00:07:27.170> find<00:07:27.500> that<00:07:27.740> set

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
oscillate until it can find that set

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.410 
oscillate until it can find that set
point<00:07:28.280> but<00:07:28.820> it<00:07:28.940> zeroes<00:07:29.300> in<00:07:29.480> on<00:07:29.600> the<00:07:29.870> control

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:31.420 
point but it zeroes in on the control

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.610 
point but it zeroes in on the control
next<00:07:32.420> thing<00:07:32.570> that<00:07:32.600> we'll<00:07:32.840> do<00:07:32.960> is<00:07:33.110> we'll<00:07:33.260> up<00:07:33.440> to

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
next thing that we'll do is we'll up to

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.140 
next thing that we'll do is we'll up to
2.6<00:07:34.490> setpoint<00:07:35.360> and<00:07:35.510> we'll<00:07:35.990> see<00:07:36.230> the<00:07:36.590> control

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
2.6 setpoint and we'll see the control

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.390 
2.6 setpoint and we'll see the control
respond<00:07:38.150> and<00:07:38.450> it<00:07:38.660> brings<00:07:38.930> our<00:07:39.290> deflector<00:07:40.220> up

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
respond and it brings our deflector up

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.100 
respond and it brings our deflector up
to<00:07:40.550> that<00:07:40.670> position<00:07:40.850> you<00:07:41.540> can<00:07:41.660> see<00:07:41.840> that<00:07:41.990> our

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
to that position you can see that our

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.710 
to that position you can see that our
deflector<00:07:42.560> here<00:07:42.890> is<00:07:43.040> moving<00:07:43.940> nicely<00:07:44.150> to<00:07:44.690> the

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:44.720 
deflector here is moving nicely to the

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.510 
deflector here is moving nicely to the
position<00:07:45.230> that<00:07:45.350> we<00:07:45.470> described<00:07:45.920> on<00:07:46.160> our<00:07:46.280> slider

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 
position that we described on our slider

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.010 
position that we described on our slider
let's<00:07:46.970> go<00:07:47.090> to<00:07:47.150> 2.65<00:07:48.080> now

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:49.020 
let's go to 2.65 now

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.189 
let's go to 2.65 now
and<00:07:49.830> we'll<00:07:50.669> see<00:07:50.879> that<00:07:51.060> the<00:07:51.150> power<00:07:51.360> increases

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 
and we'll see that the power increases

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:54.890 
and we'll see that the power increases
to<00:07:52.800> match<00:07:52.979> that<00:07:53.009> next<00:07:53.550> value<00:07:53.729> and<00:07:54.090> it<00:07:54.539> holds<00:07:54.720> it

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:54.900 
to match that next value and it holds it

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.900 
to match that next value and it holds it
pretty<00:07:55.169> nicely<00:07:55.379> there<00:07:55.800> now<00:07:56.370> if<00:07:56.490> we<00:07:56.610> hit<00:07:56.729> the

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:56.910 
pretty nicely there now if we hit the

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.270 
pretty nicely there now if we hit the
stop<00:07:57.150> button<00:07:57.180> in<00:07:57.690> this<00:07:57.930> case<00:07:58.229> it<00:07:58.530> will<00:07:58.830> go<00:07:59.039> and

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 
stop button in this case it will go and

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.159 
stop button in this case it will go and
shut<00:07:59.879> off<00:07:59.970> the<00:08:00.120> fan<00:08:00.330> and<00:08:00.599> our<00:08:00.720> deflector

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:01.169 
shut off the fan and our deflector

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:04.129 
shut off the fan and our deflector
returns<00:08:01.710> back<00:08:02.310> to<00:08:02.340> zero<00:08:02.789> so<00:08:03.000> this<00:08:03.810> is<00:08:04.020> an

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 
returns back to zero so this is an

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:05.960 
returns back to zero so this is an
application<00:08:04.289> that<00:08:04.740> shows<00:08:04.889> how<00:08:05.310> to<00:08:05.370> use<00:08:05.610> lab

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:05.970 
application that shows how to use lab

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.029 
application that shows how to use lab
you<00:08:06.180> to<00:08:06.270> do<00:08:06.389> closed-loop<00:08:06.810> control<00:08:07.110> and<00:08:07.620> this

00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:08.039 
you to do closed-loop control and this

00:08:08.039 --> 00:08:09.499 
you to do closed-loop control and this
is<00:08:08.190> how<00:08:08.280> you<00:08:08.310> would<00:08:08.550> do<00:08:08.699> control<00:08:09.180> with

00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:09.509 
is how you would do control with

00:08:09.509 --> 00:08:11.360 
is how you would do control with
national<00:08:09.930> instruments<00:08:10.020> compact<00:08:10.860> deck<00:08:11.099> and
