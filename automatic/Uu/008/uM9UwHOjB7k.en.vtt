00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080 

all<00:00:00.900> right<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.650> gonna<00:00:01.949> give<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.879> little

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
all right so I'm gonna give a little

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.230 
all right so I'm gonna give a little
video<00:00:03.629> of<00:00:03.929> how<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.259> open<00:00:04.529> these<00:00:05.310> tail<00:00:05.730> lights

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
video of how to open these tail lights

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.610 
video of how to open these tail lights
cause<00:00:06.990> it's<00:00:07.290> really<00:00:07.470> not<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.830> difficult<00:00:08.300> I

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
cause it's really not that difficult I

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.930 
cause it's really not that difficult I
think<00:00:10.620> most<00:00:10.769> people<00:00:11.040> go<00:00:11.160> with<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> dremel<00:00:11.790> way

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
think most people go with the dremel way

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.910 
think most people go with the dremel way
or<00:00:12.210> send<00:00:12.780> them<00:00:12.900> away<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> have<00:00:13.410> them<00:00:13.559> done<00:00:13.710> by

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
or send them away to have them done by

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
or send them away to have them done by
somebody<00:00:14.250> else<00:00:14.370> but<00:00:15.500> it<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.859> done<00:00:17.039> with

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
somebody else but it can be done with

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.130 
somebody else but it can be done with
just<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:19.199> razor<00:00:19.410> blade<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.270> I<00:00:21.270> guess<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.080> could

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
just a razor blade and I guess you could

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.120 
just a razor blade and I guess you could
use<00:00:22.289> an<00:00:22.410> oven<00:00:22.740> but<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.949> use<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.250> heat<00:00:23.460> gun<00:00:24.019> so

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
use an oven but I use the heat gun so

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.679 
use an oven but I use the heat gun so
it's<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.340> maybe<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.670> 10-minute<00:00:27.210> job<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
it's really maybe a 10-minute job if you

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.720 
it's really maybe a 10-minute job if you
know<00:00:27.810> you're<00:00:28.019> doing<00:00:28.970> um<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.810> technique<00:00:31.260> that

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
know you're doing um the technique that

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.549 
know you're doing um the technique that
you're<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.480> open<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:33.960> which

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
you're going to use to open these which

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.889 
you're going to use to open these which
took<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> while<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.670> figure<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:36.180> but<00:00:36.540> once<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
took me a while to figure out but once I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.740 
took me a while to figure out but once I
figured<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.410> out<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.739> really<00:00:38.040> simple<00:00:38.750> at

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
figured it out it's really simple at

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.360 
figured it out it's really simple at
first<00:00:39.780> I<00:00:40.110> wasn't<00:00:40.290> sure<00:00:40.559> how<00:00:40.590> you're<00:00:41.129> supposed

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
first I wasn't sure how you're supposed

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.869 
first I wasn't sure how you're supposed
to<00:00:41.460> cut<00:00:41.640> into<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.379> you<00:00:43.379> could<00:00:43.530> see<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.129> it's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
to cut into this you could see that it's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.880 
to cut into this you could see that it's
kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.320> clear<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.860> black

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
kind of just the clear and the black

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.279 
kind of just the clear and the black
kind<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> meat<00:00:47.670> together<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> wasn't<00:00:48.989> sure

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
kind of meat together but I wasn't sure

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of meat together but I wasn't sure
how<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.620> was<00:00:49.739> supposed<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.010> cut<00:00:50.219> into<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.640> was

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
how I was supposed to cut into and I was

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.939 
how I was supposed to cut into and I was
kind<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.000> cutting<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:52.020> angle<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
kind of cutting at an angle this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.650 
kind of cutting at an angle this
direction<00:00:53.579> that's<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.300> want<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> do

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
direction that's not what you want to do

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
direction that's not what you want to do
because<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:56.730> going<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because if you do that you're going to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
because if you do that you're going to
cut<00:00:57.180> into<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.600> plastic<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> will<00:00:58.739> show

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
cut into the plastic and it will show

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.389 
cut into the plastic and it will show
through<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> other<00:00:59.550> side<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:01.530> did<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.219> in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
through on the other side I did that in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.000 
through on the other side I did that in
one<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:02.879> places<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.229> left<00:01:04.739> taillight

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
one or two places on the left taillight

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.910 
one or two places on the left taillight
that<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> did<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.390> mean<00:01:06.750> it's<00:01:07.140> noticeable

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that I did and I mean it's noticeable

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.340 
that I did and I mean it's noticeable
but<00:01:08.189> it's<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.900> worried<00:01:10.260> about

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
but it's not something I'm worried about

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
but it's not something I'm worried about
but<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.580> know<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.689> make<00:01:12.810> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
but on this one I know not to make that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
but on this one I know not to make that
mistake<00:01:13.080> what<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.890> do<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.280> cut<00:01:14.520> straight

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
mistake what you do is you cut straight

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.690 
mistake what you do is you cut straight
down<00:01:15.409> with<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> blade<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> then<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.520> go

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
down with the blade and then just go

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.510 
down with the blade and then just go
along<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.020> way<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.710> some<00:01:19.950> areas<00:01:19.979> you

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
along all the way and in some areas you

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
along all the way and in some areas you
might<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.909> change<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.360> angle<00:01:21.390> such<00:01:22.259> as

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
might have to change the angle such as

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.670 
might have to change the angle such as
down<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> mean<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.909> kind<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> go<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:25.110> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
down here I mean you kind of go in but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.090 
down here I mean you kind of go in but
it's<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> same<00:01:26.310> idea<00:01:27.350> I'm<00:01:28.350> about<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> start

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
it's the same idea I'm about to start

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
it's the same idea I'm about to start
cutting<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.520> open<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.320> basically

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
cutting this open and this is basically

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
cutting this open and this is basically
how<00:01:31.860> we're<00:01:32.100> going<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.759> just<00:01:33.570> use

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
how we're going to do this I just use

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.240 
how we're going to do this I just use
one<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.049> these<00:01:34.170> blades<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.070> call

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
one of these blades on what you call

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.730 
one of these blades on what you call
them<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.460> um<00:01:36.229> we're<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.409> heat<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> up

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
them but um we're going to heat it up

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.789 
them but um we're going to heat it up
with<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.009> gun<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.560> your

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
with the gun and you can see on your

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.850 
with the gun and you can see on your
light<00:01:41.070> there's<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.360> black<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.320> looks<00:01:43.680> like<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
light there's a black it looks like a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.200 
light there's a black it looks like a
plastic<00:01:44.369> but<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> glue<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> we're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
plastic but that's the glue that we're

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.639 
plastic but that's the glue that we're
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.479> cutting<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> want<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.500> cut

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
going to be cutting and you want to cut

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.859 
going to be cutting and you want to cut
as<00:01:46.770> close<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.909> clear<00:01:48.240> plastic<00:01:48.479> as

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
as close to the clear plastic as

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.430 
as close to the clear plastic as
possible

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.050 

you're<00:01:52.830> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.010> cut<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> away<00:01:53.490> from<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you're going to cut it away from the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
you're going to cut it away from the
clear<00:01:54.270> plastic<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> when<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.980> heat<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.160> up

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
clear plastic so when you heat it up

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.310 
clear plastic so when you heat it up
with<00:01:56.400> the<00:01:56.490> gun<00:01:56.730> you<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.720> want<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> hot

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
with the gun you just want to get it hot

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.250 
with the gun you just want to get it hot
enough<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.620> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.510> cut<00:02:00.510> through<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.050> and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
enough that you can cut through it and

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.960 
enough that you can cut through it and
you'll<00:02:01.380> actually<00:02:01.530> you'll<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.310> blade<00:02:02.520> go

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
you'll actually you'll see the blade go

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.790 
you'll actually you'll see the blade go
onto<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.660> inside<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.230> lens<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.560> how

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
onto the inside of the lens that's how

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.340 
onto the inside of the lens that's how
you<00:02:04.860> know<00:02:04.980> you're<00:02:05.130> through<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.170> then<00:02:07.170> you'll

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
you know you're through and then you'll

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
you know you're through and then you'll
basically<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.100> should<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.550> move<00:02:08.759> pretty

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
basically it should just move pretty

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.830 
basically it should just move pretty
easily<00:02:10.220> along<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.700> edge<00:02:11.820> as<00:02:12.390> long<00:02:12.660> as<00:02:12.780> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
easily along the edge as long as you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.340 
easily along the edge as long as you
keep<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.140> hot<00:02:13.320> enough<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:15.690> is<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.170> heat

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
keep it hot enough and this is the heat

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.870 
keep it hot enough and this is the heat
gun<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.770> bought<00:02:17.490> it

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
gun I bought it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.920 
gun I bought it
basically<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.900> this<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:21.330> now<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:21.780> going

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
basically just for this so now I'm going

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.680 
basically just for this so now I'm going
to<00:02:21.990> take<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> heat<00:02:22.470> gun<00:02:23.210> I'm<00:02:24.210> using<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.600> on

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
to take the heat gun I'm using it on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.990 
to take the heat gun I'm using it on
high<00:02:24.959> it<00:02:25.410> has<00:02:25.560> some<00:02:25.740> low<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.370> high<00:02:26.550> but<00:02:26.850> now

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
high it has some low and high but now

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.449 
high it has some low and high but now
I'm<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:28.050> going<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.200> heat<00:02:28.410> up<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.620> few<00:02:28.890> passes

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
I'm just going to heat up a few passes

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:51.580 
I'm just going to heat up a few passes
maybe<00:02:29.880> about<00:02:30.060> six<00:02:30.750> or<00:02:30.959> eight<00:02:31.080> inches<00:02:31.110> or<00:02:31.590> so

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.560 

no<00:02:52.590> I'm<00:02:52.800> occasionally<00:02:53.400> fight<00:02:53.880> two<00:02:54.120> hands<00:02:54.330> I'd

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
no I'm occasionally fight two hands I'd

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.390 
no I'm occasionally fight two hands I'd
check<00:02:54.990> with<00:02:55.140> one<00:02:55.320> hand<00:02:55.650> in<00:02:55.890> front<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.220> lens

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
check with one hand in front of the lens

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.910 
check with one hand in front of the lens
to<00:02:56.640> make<00:02:56.760> sure<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.120> getting<00:02:57.270> too<00:02:57.600> hot

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
to make sure it's not getting too hot

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.820 
to make sure it's not getting too hot
but<00:02:58.920> um<00:02:59.240> yeah<00:03:00.240> you<00:03:00.300> can<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:03.530> get<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> with<00:03:04.710> the

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
but um yeah you can just get it with the

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.160 
but um yeah you can just get it with the
heat<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.370> back<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.480> if<00:03:06.600> anything<00:03:06.870> you're

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
heat on the back so if anything you're

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.780 
heat on the back so if anything you're
melting<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.650> back<00:03:07.860> before<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.490> melt<00:03:08.640> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
melting the back before you melt the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.020 
melting the back before you melt the
front

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.960 

I'm<00:03:13.600> gonna<00:03:13.870> check<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:14.110> see<00:03:14.320> if<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:14.890> any<00:03:15.100> any

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
I'm gonna check and see if it's any any

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:22.430 
I'm gonna check and see if it's any any
bit<00:03:16.240> near<00:03:16.450> Hana<00:03:17.700> no<00:03:18.700> not<00:03:19.090> yet

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.110 

city<00:03:23.440> can<00:03:23.680> also<00:03:23.830> takes<00:03:24.190> time<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.700> heal<00:03:24.730> itself

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
city can also takes time to heal itself

00:03:25.120 --> 00:04:08.460 
city can also takes time to heal itself
up

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:20.400 

I<00:04:18.060> took<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.239> break<00:04:19.450> filming<00:04:19.989> because<00:04:20.200> it's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
I took a break filming because it's

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.650 
I took a break filming because it's
easier<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:21.489> takes<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.790> lot<00:04:21.970> of<00:04:22.000> heat<00:04:22.240> at<00:04:22.390> first

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
easier it takes a lot of heat at first

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.840 
easier it takes a lot of heat at first
then<00:04:22.900> I<00:04:22.960> wasn't<00:04:23.140> sure<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:24.400> was<00:04:24.550> getting

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
then I wasn't sure if I was getting

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.280 
then I wasn't sure if I was getting
anywhere<00:04:24.940> with<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.360> blade<00:04:25.660> so<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.930> stopped

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
anywhere with the blade so I stopped

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.400 
anywhere with the blade so I stopped
filming<00:04:26.560> but<00:04:27.190> um<00:04:27.550> I<00:04:28.540> have<00:04:28.870> started<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.260> get

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
filming but um I have started to get

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.520 
filming but um I have started to get
somewhere<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:29.950> you<00:04:30.010> can<00:04:30.190> maybe<00:04:30.460> see<00:04:30.610> that

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
somewhere and you can maybe see that

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.500 
somewhere and you can maybe see that
yeah<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:33.100> kind<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.550> starts<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.820> get<00:04:33.970> clear

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
yeah it kind of starts to get clear

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.690 
yeah it kind of starts to get clear
instead<00:04:35.170> of<00:04:35.320> what<00:04:35.560> used<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.860> be<00:04:35.920> black<00:04:36.250> you<00:04:36.580> can

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
instead of what used to be black you can

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.370 
instead of what used to be black you can
see<00:04:36.820> there's<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.000> black<00:04:37.300> edge

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
see there's a black edge

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.410 
see there's a black edge
well<00:04:38.950> when<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.280> know<00:04:39.310> you're<00:04:39.640> breaking<00:04:40.090> it

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
well when you know you're breaking it

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.690 
well when you know you're breaking it
away<00:04:40.600> from<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.930> glue<00:04:41.290> it'll<00:04:41.890> get<00:04:42.010> like<00:04:42.400> that

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
away from the glue it'll get like that

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.990 
away from the glue it'll get like that
if<00:04:42.940> you<00:04:43.120> can<00:04:43.270> see<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:44.280> my<00:04:45.280> glue<00:04:45.490> is<00:04:45.610> kind<00:04:45.850> of

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
if you can see and my glue is kind of

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.720 
if you can see and my glue is kind of
hardened<00:04:46.600> by<00:04:46.750> now<00:04:46.990> but<00:04:47.650> I've<00:04:48.220> worked<00:04:48.550> the

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:48.730 
hardened by now but I've worked the

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.150 
hardened by now but I've worked the
blade<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.240> somewhat<00:04:49.900> as<00:04:50.140> you<00:04:50.530> can<00:04:50.680> see<00:04:50.860> it<00:04:50.980> goes

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
blade in somewhat as you can see it goes

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.370 
blade in somewhat as you can see it goes
in<00:04:51.370> about<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.790> far<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.480> glue<00:04:52.690> really<00:04:52.990> isn't

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
in about that far the glue really isn't

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.070 
in about that far the glue really isn't
that<00:04:53.530> thick<00:04:53.950> that's<00:04:54.690> more<00:04:55.690> than<00:04:55.870> halfway

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
that thick that's more than halfway

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.690 
that thick that's more than halfway
through<00:04:56.350> so<00:04:56.980> pretty<00:04:57.220> soon

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
through so pretty soon

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.909 
through so pretty soon
it<00:04:57.790> should<00:04:58.420> puncture<00:04:59.320> through<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> other

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
it should puncture through to the other

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.710 
it should puncture through to the other
side<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.550> then<00:05:00.880> really<00:05:01.210> all<00:05:01.300> you<00:05:01.390> have<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.570> do

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
side and then really all you have to do

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.810 
side and then really all you have to do
is<00:05:01.870> keep<00:05:02.080> heating<00:05:02.440> the<00:05:02.530> glue<00:05:02.800> and<00:05:03.010> pull<00:05:03.520> along

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
is keep heating the glue and pull along

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.200 
is keep heating the glue and pull along
the<00:05:04.000> edge<00:05:04.620> okay<00:05:05.620> right<00:05:06.130> now<00:05:06.280> I<00:05:06.580> have<00:05:06.910> gotten

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
the edge okay right now I have gotten

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.240 
the edge okay right now I have gotten
the<00:05:07.690> blade<00:05:07.990> the<00:05:08.230> tip<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.590> blade<00:05:08.680> onto<00:05:09.160> the

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
the blade the tip of the blade onto the

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.060 
the blade the tip of the blade onto the
inside<00:05:09.640> if<00:05:09.910> you<00:05:09.940> can<00:05:10.060> see<00:05:10.419> right<00:05:10.450> there<00:05:10.890> it's<00:05:11.890> a

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
inside if you can see right there it's a

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.970 
inside if you can see right there it's a
little<00:05:12.340> hard<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.640> tell<00:05:12.940> but<00:05:13.690> it's<00:05:14.230> inside<00:05:14.650> and

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
little hard to tell but it's inside and

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.460 
little hard to tell but it's inside and
my<00:05:15.850> glue<00:05:16.000> is<00:05:16.060> hardening<00:05:16.450> now<00:05:16.600> so<00:05:16.840> I'm<00:05:17.260> going<00:05:17.410> to

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
my glue is hardening now so I'm going to

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.290 
my glue is hardening now so I'm going to
pull<00:05:17.650> it<00:05:17.770> out<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.040> go<00:05:18.190> ahead<00:05:18.340> and<00:05:18.490> eat<00:05:18.640> up<00:05:18.820> but

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
pull it out and go ahead and eat up but

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.030 
pull it out and go ahead and eat up but
that's<00:05:19.540> the<00:05:19.900> first<00:05:20.050> step<00:05:20.410> is<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:20.830> breaking

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
that's the first step is just breaking

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.560 
that's the first step is just breaking
through<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:21.669> then<00:05:22.060> you're<00:05:22.180> just<00:05:22.300> going<00:05:22.450> to

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
through and then you're just going to

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.340 
through and then you're just going to
pull<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.810> along<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.560> side<00:05:23.800> oh<00:05:24.600> and<00:05:25.600> I<00:05:26.020> advise

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
pull it along the side oh and I advise

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.230 
pull it along the side oh and I advise
starting<00:05:26.919> on<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.160> top<00:05:27.400> that's<00:05:27.729> really

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
starting on the top that's really

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.409 
starting on the top that's really
probably<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:28.720> best<00:05:29.050> area<00:05:29.320> because<00:05:30.419> these

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
probably the best area because these

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.170 
probably the best area because these
areas<00:05:31.780> just<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.800> sort<00:05:33.220> of<00:05:33.280> an<00:05:33.400> angle<00:05:33.850> I<00:05:34.000> don't

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
areas just it's sort of an angle I don't

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.490 
areas just it's sort of an angle I don't
know<00:05:34.240> this<00:05:34.419> just<00:05:34.479> seemed<00:05:34.810> to<00:05:34.960> be<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.080> easiest

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
know this just seemed to be the easiest

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.909 
know this just seemed to be the easiest
to<00:05:35.650> me<00:05:35.830> and<00:05:36.810> you're<00:05:37.810> not<00:05:37.990> really<00:05:38.260> in<00:05:38.440> danger<00:05:38.620> of

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
to me and you're not really in danger of

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:40.920 
to me and you're not really in danger of
hitting<00:05:39.190> any<00:05:39.490> of<00:05:39.550> the<00:05:39.729> chrome<00:05:40.120> too<00:05:40.510> bad<00:05:40.720> as

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
hitting any of the chrome too bad as

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.850 
hitting any of the chrome too bad as
you're<00:05:41.110> over<00:05:41.470> here<00:05:41.710> I<00:05:41.950> have<00:05:42.820> heated<00:05:43.000> up<00:05:43.240> a

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you're over here I have heated up a

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.440 
you're over here I have heated up a
fairly<00:05:44.860> decent<00:05:45.040> amount<00:05:45.490> as<00:05:45.640> you<00:05:46.090> can<00:05:46.210> see

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
fairly decent amount as you can see

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.840 
fairly decent amount as you can see
there's<00:05:46.840> that<00:05:47.620> white<00:05:47.830> border<00:05:48.280> that's<00:05:48.460> working

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
there's that white border that's working

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.840 
there's that white border that's working
its<00:05:48.970> way<00:05:49.150> across<00:05:49.470> so<00:05:50.470> now<00:05:51.340> this<00:05:51.520> is<00:05:51.669> just<00:05:51.760> the

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
its way across so now this is just the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.070 
its way across so now this is just the
technique<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.360> I'm<00:05:52.419> using<00:05:52.479> you<00:05:52.810> could<00:05:52.930> see

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
technique that I'm using you could see

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.659 
technique that I'm using you could see
the<00:05:53.200> blades<00:05:53.410> on<00:05:53.590> the<00:05:53.680> inside<00:05:54.010> and<00:05:54.340> you<00:05:54.640> just

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
the blades on the inside and you just

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.940 
the blades on the inside and you just
work<00:05:55.030> your<00:05:55.210> way<00:05:55.270> it's<00:05:56.140> getting<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.470> little<00:05:56.590> hard

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
work your way it's getting a little hard

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.990 
work your way it's getting a little hard
so<00:05:57.310> I'm<00:05:57.370> kind<00:05:57.610> of<00:05:57.669> wiggling<00:05:58.090> but<00:05:59.250> it<00:06:00.250> was<00:06:00.520> as

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
so I'm kind of wiggling but it was as

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.880 
so I'm kind of wiggling but it was as
you<00:06:01.060> can<00:06:01.330> see<00:06:01.570> it's<00:06:01.720> it's<00:06:01.960> slowly<00:06:02.350> working<00:06:02.650> its

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
you can see it's it's slowly working its

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.010 
you can see it's it's slowly working its
way<00:06:03.040> across<00:06:03.370> and<00:06:03.640> it's<00:06:04.030> pushing<00:06:04.390> that<00:06:04.570> white

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
way across and it's pushing that white

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.310 
way across and it's pushing that white
edge<00:06:05.740> out<00:06:06.520> in<00:06:06.729> front<00:06:06.940> of<00:06:07.060> itself<00:06:07.419> which<00:06:07.990> is

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
edge out in front of itself which is

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.500 
edge out in front of itself which is
what's<00:06:08.979> breaking<00:06:09.460> the<00:06:09.550> glue<00:06:09.880> away<00:06:10.150> from<00:06:10.450> the

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
what's breaking the glue away from the

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.390 
what's breaking the glue away from the
plastic<00:06:10.750> now<00:06:11.560> I<00:06:11.590> gotta<00:06:11.830> add<00:06:11.979> more<00:06:12.190> heat

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
plastic now I gotta add more heat

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:22.230 
plastic now I gotta add more heat
because<00:06:12.669> it's<00:06:12.820> not<00:06:12.970> going<00:06:13.150> anywhere

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.450 

you

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.320 

and<00:06:27.460> then<00:06:27.730> chef

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.029 

I<00:06:33.330> just<00:06:33.629> left<00:06:33.870> the<00:06:34.020> blade<00:06:34.229> in<00:06:34.379> there<00:06:34.500> what<00:06:34.919> the

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
I just left the blade in there what the

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:40.150 
I just left the blade in there what the
hell

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.510 

should<00:06:41.160> be<00:06:41.280> somebody's<00:06:41.910> alright<00:06:43.310> now<00:06:44.310> let's

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
should be somebody's alright now let's

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:54.350 
should be somebody's alright now let's
continue<00:06:44.759> to<00:06:45.240> work<00:06:45.449> this<00:06:45.660> blade<00:06:46.050> across<00:06:53.360> and

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
continue to work this blade across and

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.890 
continue to work this blade across and
it<00:06:54.479> is<00:06:54.630> working<00:06:55.139> I<00:06:56.060> mean<00:06:57.060> I'm<00:06:57.270> still<00:06:57.539> applying

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
it is working I mean I'm still applying

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.469 
it is working I mean I'm still applying
a<00:06:58.229> fairly<00:06:58.770> decent<00:06:58.979> amount<00:06:59.370> of<00:06:59.430> pressure<00:06:59.729> which

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 
a fairly decent amount of pressure which

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:02.689 
a fairly decent amount of pressure which
may<00:07:00.870> not<00:07:01.139> be<00:07:01.259> that<00:07:01.410> good<00:07:01.620> because<00:07:02.370> on<00:07:02.610> the

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:02.699 
may not be that good because on the

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.870 
may not be that good because on the
first<00:07:02.940> lens<00:07:03.270> I<00:07:04.250> didn't<00:07:05.250> really<00:07:05.460> heat<00:07:05.639> it<00:07:05.759> up

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
first lens I didn't really heat it up

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.790 
first lens I didn't really heat it up
all<00:07:06.090> that<00:07:06.240> well<00:07:06.479> and<00:07:06.870> I<00:07:06.990> was<00:07:07.169> using<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.590> lot<00:07:07.620> of

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
all that well and I was using a lot of

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.029 
all that well and I was using a lot of
force<00:07:08.160> and<00:07:08.520> it<00:07:09.330> did<00:07:09.660> crack<00:07:10.259> the<00:07:10.289> plastic<00:07:10.919> in

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 
force and it did crack the plastic in

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:13.219 
force and it did crack the plastic in
one<00:07:11.250> area<00:07:11.520> but<00:07:12.060> a<00:07:12.090> very<00:07:12.720> small<00:07:13.020> about<00:07:13.110> a

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:13.229 
one area but a very small about a

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:15.830 
one area but a very small about a
quarter<00:07:13.560> of<00:07:13.590> an<00:07:13.740> inch<00:07:13.830> but<00:07:14.759> that's<00:07:15.630> just

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 
quarter of an inch but that's just

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
quarter of an inch but that's just
something<00:07:16.020> you<00:07:16.169> want<00:07:16.470> to<00:07:16.530> be<00:07:16.590> cautious<00:07:16.800> about

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
something you want to be cautious about

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:30.060 
something you want to be cautious about
to<00:07:19.860> make<00:07:20.039> it<00:07:20.280> up<00:07:20.370> someone

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:30.070 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:38.420 

you

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.120 

you

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.130 

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.210 

by<00:07:42.790> the<00:07:42.850> way<00:07:43.000> else's<00:07:43.420> I<00:07:43.750> use<00:07:44.470> this<00:07:44.680> blade<00:07:44.950> a

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
by the way else's I use this blade a

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.750 
by the way else's I use this blade a
little<00:07:45.550> bit<00:07:46.560> it's<00:07:47.560> kind<00:07:47.800> of<00:07:47.890> harder<00:07:48.250> to

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:48.760 
little bit it's kind of harder to

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.810 
little bit it's kind of harder to
puncture<00:07:49.720> through<00:07:50.050> and<00:07:50.370> cut<00:07:51.370> along<00:07:51.460> the<00:07:51.700> edge

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:51.820 
puncture through and cut along the edge

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.550 
puncture through and cut along the edge
because<00:07:52.330> the<00:07:52.480> blades<00:07:52.720> a<00:07:52.810> little<00:07:52.990> thicker<00:07:53.290> and

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 
because the blades a little thicker and

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.080 
because the blades a little thicker and
in<00:07:54.400> some<00:07:54.790> areas<00:07:55.410> it<00:07:56.410> might<00:07:56.800> it<00:07:57.430> might<00:07:57.490> like

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.090 
in some areas it might it might like

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:03.840 
in some areas it might it might like
right<00:07:59.340> we<00:08:00.340> sit<00:08:00.550> it<00:08:00.700> right<00:08:02.400> there

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:03.850 
right we sit it right there

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.940 
right we sit it right there
I<00:08:03.880> put<00:08:04.720> a<00:08:04.750> little<00:08:04.960> bit<00:08:05.050> too<00:08:05.200> much<00:08:05.350> pressure<00:08:05.770> on

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:05.950 
I put a little bit too much pressure on

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.550 
I put a little bit too much pressure on
the<00:08:06.070> plastic<00:08:06.700> and<00:08:06.910> kind<00:08:07.390> of<00:08:07.480> start<00:08:07.720> to<00:08:07.810> crack

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 
the plastic and kind of start to crack

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.890 
the plastic and kind of start to crack
it<00:08:09.000> that's<00:08:10.000> what<00:08:10.150> I<00:08:10.180> was<00:08:10.270> talking<00:08:10.450> about<00:08:10.630> on

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:10.900 
it that's what I was talking about on

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.840 
it that's what I was talking about on
you<00:08:11.020> you<00:08:11.290> want<00:08:11.470> to<00:08:11.530> watch<00:08:11.680> out<00:08:11.890> for<00:08:11.920> that<00:08:12.190> so

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:12.850 
you you want to watch out for that so

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.150 
you you want to watch out for that so
don't<00:08:13.210> apply<00:08:13.630> too<00:08:13.690> much<00:08:13.900> pressure<00:08:14.440> like<00:08:14.800> I<00:08:14.950> did

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.160 
don't apply too much pressure like I did

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.650 
don't apply too much pressure like I did
you<00:08:15.280> want<00:08:15.430> to<00:08:15.490> make<00:08:15.580> sure<00:08:15.610> it's<00:08:15.910> hot<00:08:16.360> enough

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:16.660 
you want to make sure it's hot enough

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.600 
you want to make sure it's hot enough
and<00:08:16.900> then<00:08:16.990> you<00:08:17.050> can<00:08:17.230> just<00:08:17.470> cut<00:08:18.010> slice<00:08:18.400> right

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:18.610 
and then you can just cut slice right

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.940 
and then you can just cut slice right
through<00:08:18.670> it
