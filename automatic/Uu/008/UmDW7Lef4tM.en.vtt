00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.639
 please come this to the summary of the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.639
 first 45 minutes 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 there is a lot of desire, we have the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.690
 images of the stadium the boys 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.309
 playing the tribune let's review the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 First time images please 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.700
 thank you very much there is the Santa Cruz hymn 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.250
 and the presence of the two great 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.860
 they joke 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.290
 and east I like the shirt of the 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.720
 two what do you want me to tell you I like the 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:33.020
 T - shirt of the two presentation 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.140
 official of eduardo villegas and mauricio 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.980
 soria of entrance would have to have 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.870
 been and there it was was sanctioned with 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.110
 yellow 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.790
 I think it has to have 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.470
 I think I should have the most 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.920
 flojita for yellow cards for 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.920
 avoid 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.810
 from abraham and now here we are going to see 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.570
 what you have said you did not handle 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.910
 ball against effectiveness 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 there are real mistakes 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 and the goal comes clear I can not get hooked 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.440
 that ball to clear them and he came 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.229
 against impossible foot second arrival 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.390
 to goal there I go with what I tell you 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.610
 second arrival and goal effective touch 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.010
 fast and arrival deep pitch 2 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.930
 flush ball but blood and fine 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.280
 light or moving the ball and that's why 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.880
 I have already overflowed by the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.580
 side stand 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.530
 good center no type of marks and the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.840
 left side that also goes 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 marking a trend of how it stops or 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.790
 what is the defensive system that has not 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.399
 worked wonderfully by part of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.820
 good tanned oil tanker puts the 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.289
 shoulder there is no good lack the reaction of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.930
 oil oil that comes rodrigo 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.119
 Vargas now here if we agree 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.280
 in something east is very messy and 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.869
 has a fundamental and good give them 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.149
 things that I could use but that in the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.700
 clutter lose vargas for example 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.070
 the matí garcías mate mate is 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.259
 playing with two half tips in the case 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.450
 of well of Spain for example and the other 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.190
 the other playmaker who also play 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.020
 jazz madrid and the only forward is the 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.000
 black rock that we have not seen 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.530
 problems politically here is a 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.599
 well discussed argument well yes 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.230
 politically where it does not mean 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.640
 soccer 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.440
 surprising you at some point 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.069
 then seen on the screen but I have not 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.890
 seen politically will play was 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:30.180
 misplaced where what doing a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.120
 program like this on the screen you see it on the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.950
 alignment but with play that now you 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.620
 grip 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:44.579
 and this in a single one exists this is a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:50.489
 Pink rose party I do not know where he's going 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:52.799
 put colors I invented a word that 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.560
 negotiated neologisms there's the end 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.560
 look is the criminal and for me the other 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.750
 I had a touch too 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.090
 now what I want to see if it touches your 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.860
 fellow 8 caracas I think what 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.110
 shakes more to his partner but the 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:11.480
 intention was to go strong with the leg 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.670
 raised if there is novelty gives you criminal 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.370
 clear penalty won and that's why 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.440
 he discusses it to medium more discusses it more 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.110
 or less now watch how he advances to 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.670
 me you should repeat this criminal 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.040
 as it should be repeated the criminal has 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.230
 reason alexis carrasco and the senate 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 daily that is still ahead and has 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.800
 reason they knew the taste 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.860
 Not if I enjoy it, look at 3 steps 3 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.860
 palmira 1-2-3 seen overtaking and ximo
