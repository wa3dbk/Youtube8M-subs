99 Marshawn Lynch um these are all his
milestones<00:00:26.910> i<00:00:27.090> guess<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.680> look

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
milestones i guess and if you look

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.040 
milestones i guess and if you look
closely<00:00:29.130> there<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:29.880> his<00:00:30.060> I'm<00:00:30.449> just<00:00:30.869> here

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050

know there are already a few of them on
the<00:00:41.850> live<00:00:42.270> auctions<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.190> basically<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.370> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just go and you could look at them and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.130 
just go and you could look at them and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
already a few of the one the market and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
already a few of the one the market and
they're<00:01:16.439> going<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> lot<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.520> me<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.850> actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
they're going for a lot of me I actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
they're going for a lot of me I actually
did<00:01:18.960> look<00:01:19.110> at<00:01:19.229> these<00:01:19.320> steps<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.830> honestly<00:01:20.250> I

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
did look at these steps and I honestly I

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.850 
did look at these steps and I honestly I
am<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.850> sure<00:01:21.180> if<00:01:21.210> he's<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.840> worth<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
am not sure if he's actually worth the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.340 
am not sure if he's actually worth the
99<00:01:23.369> rating<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.890> he<00:01:25.979> has<00:01:26.100> 96<00:01:26.700> speed<00:01:27.350> 94

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
99 rating so you see he has 96 speed 94

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
99 rating so you see he has 96 speed 94
strength<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.040> isn't<00:01:29.369> too<00:01:29.460> bad<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.880> better

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
strength which isn't too bad it's better

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.249 
strength which isn't too bad it's better
than<00:01:30.240> legarrette<00:01:30.720> blount<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.110> that's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
than legarrette blount so that's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
than legarrette blount so that's
actually<00:01:31.439> pretty<00:01:31.829> good<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.670> 93<00:01:33.240> agility<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
actually pretty good the 93 agility is

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
actually pretty good the 93 agility is
just<00:01:33.960> okay<00:01:34.380> but<00:01:34.890> he<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.250> 97

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
just okay but he does have 97

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.539 
just okay but he does have 97
acceleration<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.869> me<00:01:37.079> awareness<00:01:37.619> but<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
acceleration and I me awareness but I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.399 
acceleration and I me awareness but I
mean<00:01:39.180> awareness<00:01:39.900> doesn't<00:01:40.140> really<00:01:40.259> do

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
mean awareness doesn't really do

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.690 
mean awareness doesn't really do
anything<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:41.100> unless<00:01:41.220> you're<00:01:41.460> doing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
anything for you unless you're doing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.990 
anything for you unless you're doing
automatic<00:01:42.210> run<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> 76<00:01:44.340> catch<00:01:44.610> which

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
automatic run you have a 76 catch which

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
automatic run you have a 76 catch which
shane<00:01:45.420> vereen<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.869> better<00:01:46.110> in<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.829> he

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
shane vereen is better in that but he

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
shane vereen is better in that but he
should<00:01:47.430> be<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.579> wide<00:01:47.820> receiver<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> way<00:01:48.659> he

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
should be a wide receiver in a way he

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.950 
should be a wide receiver in a way he
