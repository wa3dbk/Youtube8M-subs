00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.580 
that thing is you guys know what that is
so<00:03:24.160> i'm<00:03:24.600> i'm<00:03:25.600> gonna<00:03:25.750> switch<00:03:25.900> in<00:03:26.110> my<00:03:26.140> nine<00:03:26.350> tails

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
so i'm i'm gonna switch in my nine tails

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.979 
so i'm i'm gonna switch in my nine tails
predicting<00:03:27.310> at<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.030> substitute<00:03:28.540> or<00:03:28.780> on

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
predicting at the substitute or on

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.020 
predicting at the substitute or on
course<00:03:29.350> i<00:03:29.560> could<00:03:29.800> just<00:03:29.890> probably<00:03:30.400> get<00:03:30.610> a<00:03:30.640> fire

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
course i could just probably get a fire

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.430 
course i could just probably get a fire
blast<00:03:31.270> on<00:03:31.420> this<00:03:31.540> thing<00:03:31.720> predicting<00:03:32.320> the

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
blast on this thing predicting the

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.080 
blast on this thing predicting the
switch<00:03:32.709> thinking<00:03:33.340> well<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:33.670> I<00:03:33.850> didn't

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
switch thinking well actually I didn't

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.250 
switch thinking well actually I didn't
predicted<00:03:34.450> switch<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.959> went<00:03:35.140> straight

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
predicted switch I just went straight

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.229 
predicted switch I just went straight
out<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.739> do<00:03:35.860> a<00:03:35.890> far<00:03:36.310> blass<00:03:36.489> just<00:03:36.760> for<00:03:37.180> the

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
out to do a far blass just for the

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.940 
out to do a far blass just for the
options<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:37.660> he<00:03:37.840> might<00:03:38.080> predict<00:03:38.470> me<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.830> do<00:03:38.920> a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
options that he might predict me to do a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.770 
options that he might predict me to do a
support<00:03:39.370> move<00:03:39.520> like<00:03:39.700> toxic<00:03:39.970> or<00:03:40.239> whatever<00:03:40.510> and

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
support move like toxic or whatever and

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.320 
support move like toxic or whatever and
arm<00:03:41.500> go<00:03:42.130> for<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.370> substitute<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.000> then<00:03:43.090> I'll

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
arm go for the substitute and then I'll

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.420 
arm go for the substitute and then I'll
call<00:03:43.600> me<00:03:43.750> on<00:03:43.870> my<00:03:43.989> support<00:03:44.230> move<00:03:44.680> so<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.010> would

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
call me on my support move so that would

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.770 
call me on my support move so that would
have<00:03:45.520> been<00:03:45.610> bad<00:03:45.670> so<00:03:46.239> I<00:03:46.270> would<00:03:46.540> have<00:03:46.630> definitely

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
have been bad so I would have definitely

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.060 
have been bad so I would have definitely
have<00:03:47.020> to<00:03:47.110> switch<00:03:47.290> out<00:03:47.440> any<00:03:47.620> switch<00:03:47.830> design

have to switch out any switch design

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.680 
have to switch out any switch design
cells<00:03:48.310> back<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.209> when<00:03:49.330> shifter

obvious just to be safe I'm just gonna

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250

obviously<00:04:06.820> something<00:04:07.269> more<00:04:07.480> damage<00:04:07.840> than<00:04:07.959> he

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
obviously something more damage than he

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.500 
obviously something more damage than he

like stays in of course he was this the
bug<00:04:23.020> type<00:04:23.229> move<00:04:23.500> in<00:04:23.770> uh<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.430> just<00:04:24.520> like<00:04:24.820> risk<00:04:25.240> my

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
bug type move in uh I just like risk my

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.730 
bug type move in uh I just like risk my
city<00:04:26.110> getting<00:04:26.410> hit

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
city getting hit

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.219 
city getting hit
yeah<00:04:26.860> with<00:04:27.819> the<00:04:27.940> bird<00:04:28.150> saddest<00:04:28.660> is<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
yeah with the bird saddest is the

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.540 
yeah with the bird saddest is the
secondary<00:04:29.590> effect<00:04:29.979> of<00:04:30.099> the<00:04:30.190> boiling<00:04:30.490> water

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
secondary effect of the boiling water

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.339 
secondary effect of the boiling water
but<00:04:31.389> I'm<00:04:31.569> just<00:04:31.900> going<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.050> take<00:04:32.169> this<00:04:32.289> thing

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
but I'm just going to take this thing

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.140 
but I'm just going to take this thing
out<00:04:32.560> definitely<00:04:32.860> right<00:04:33.280> now<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.580> solar<00:04:33.970> beam

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
out definitely right now the solar beam

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.180 
out definitely right now the solar beam
when<00:04:35.080> I<00:04:35.169> kinda<00:04:35.440> have<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.620> slim<00:04:35.800> chance<00:04:35.860> of

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
when I kinda have a slim chance of

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.499 
when I kinda have a slim chance of
winning<00:04:36.520> at<00:04:36.639> this<00:04:36.789> moment<00:04:36.970> because<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.389> would

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
winning at this moment because I would

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.180 
winning at this moment because I would
just<00:04:37.660> realized<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.110> this<00:04:38.229> dude<00:04:38.500> has<00:04:38.830> that

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
just realized that this dude has that

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.969 
just realized that this dude has that
thing<00:04:39.460> left<00:04:39.880> oh<00:04:40.300> my<00:04:40.990> gosh<00:04:41.199> and<00:04:41.440> my<00:04:41.500> Venus<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.889> was
