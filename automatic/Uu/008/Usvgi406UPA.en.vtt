00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
that's like a cactus mix if you have it

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.180 
that's like a cactus mix if you have it
in<00:00:35.210> a<00:00:35.630> container<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:36.110> cactus<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:36.710> succulent

mix or something that drains very

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.990 
mix or something that drains very
readily<00:00:39.800> in<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.040> ground<00:00:40.280> that<00:00:40.460> has<00:00:40.700> a<00:00:40.730> lot<00:00:40.970> of

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
readily in the ground that has a lot of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.890 
readily in the ground that has a lot of
loam<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.100> be<00:00:43.760> sure<00:00:43.790> to<00:00:44.120> not<00:00:44.240> overwater

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
loam in it and be sure to not overwater

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.990 
loam in it and be sure to not overwater
them<00:00:44.990> because<00:00:45.860> they<00:00:46.040> store<00:00:46.310> a<00:00:46.370> lot<00:00:46.820> of<00:00:46.850> water

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
them because they store a lot of water

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.130 
them because they store a lot of water
in<00:00:47.510> these<00:00:47.660> fleshy<00:00:48.350> leaves<00:00:49.130> and<00:00:49.550> stems<00:00:49.910> so<00:00:50.780> if

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
in these fleshy leaves and stems so if

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.720 
in these fleshy leaves and stems so if
you<00:00:51.290> overwater<00:00:51.890> them<00:00:52.130> it's<00:00:52.310> really<00:00:52.430> going<00:00:52.670> to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
you overwater them it's really going to

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.280 
you overwater them it's really going to
slow<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.060> growing<00:00:53.390> down<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.750> could<00:00:53.870> even

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
slow the growing down it could even

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.860 
slow the growing down it could even
cause<00:00:54.620> them<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.310> damp<00:00:55.550> off<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.150> make<00:00:56.600> sure<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
cause them to damp off and make sure the

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.710 
cause them to damp off and make sure the
water<00:00:57.080> goes<00:00:57.320> all<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.650> way<00:00:58.250> through<00:00:58.730> as<00:00:59.480> far<00:00:59.660> as

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
water goes all the way through as far as

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.330 
water goes all the way through as far as
fertilizing<00:01:00.560> you<00:01:00.650> don't<00:01:00.830> have<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.130> fertilize

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
fertilizing you don't have to fertilize

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.460 
fertilizing you don't have to fertilize
your<00:01:01.760> Jade's<00:01:02.030> I<00:01:02.300> don't<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.780> just<00:01:03.140> put<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.320> little

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
your Jade's I don't I just put a little

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.849 
your Jade's I don't I just put a little
compost<00:01:03.980> in<00:01:04.159> when<00:01:04.369> I<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:04.670> plant<00:01:05.390> with<00:01:05.600> them<00:01:05.859> but

00:01:06.849 --> 00:01:06.859 
compost in when I I plant with them but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:08.410 
compost in when I I plant with them but
the<00:01:06.979> thing<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:07.340> I<00:01:07.369> found<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:07.969> makes<00:01:08.210> them

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
the thing that I found that makes them

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.440 
the thing that I found that makes them
grow<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.229> most<00:01:09.469> is<00:01:09.799> the<00:01:10.219> warm<00:01:10.520> weather<00:01:11.119> and

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
grow the most is the warm weather and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.899 
grow the most is the warm weather and
we're<00:01:12.170> actually<00:01:13.130> it's<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.460> really<00:01:13.729> warm

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
we're actually it's a really warm

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.149 
we're actually it's a really warm
October<00:01:14.479> day<00:01:14.659> now<00:01:14.899> and<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.320> they<00:01:15.439> grow<00:01:15.590> a<00:01:15.920> lot

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
October day now and so they grow a lot

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.260 
October day now and so they grow a lot
better<00:01:16.520> in<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:18.009> when<00:01:19.009> it<00:01:19.100> is<00:01:19.219> warm<00:01:19.549> so<00:01:19.789> if<00:01:20.149> your

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
better in the when it is warm so if your

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.569 
better in the when it is warm so if your
house<00:01:20.450> is<00:01:20.689> cool<00:01:20.960> your<00:01:21.649> Jade's<00:01:21.979> aren't<00:01:22.429> going

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:22.579 
house is cool your Jade's aren't going

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.789 
house is cool your Jade's aren't going
to<00:01:22.670> grow<00:01:22.820> as<00:01:23.179> fast<00:01:23.259> and<00:01:24.259> you<00:01:24.409> want<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.679> make

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
to grow as fast and you want to make

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.620 
to grow as fast and you want to make
sure<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.039> them<00:01:25.310> in<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.520> nice<00:01:25.820> bright<00:01:26.359> light
