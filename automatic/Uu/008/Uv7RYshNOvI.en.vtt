something<00:02:02.430> completely<00:02:03.090> different<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.479> my

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
something completely different in my

now<00:02:11.939> ghost<00:02:12.329> I<00:02:12.599> think<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> time<00:02:13.170> frame<00:02:13.439> should

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.000 
now ghost I think the time frame should
be<00:02:13.950> around<00:02:14.340> between<00:02:14.870> holiday<00:02:15.870> decor<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.530> call

gun<00:03:00.209> out<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:00.389> fire<00:03:00.720> at<00:03:00.930> your<00:03:01.079> enemy<00:03:01.349> they

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
gun out and fire at your enemy they

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.080 
gun out and fire at your enemy they
should<00:03:02.040> do<00:03:02.159> something<00:03:02.489> like<00:03:02.549> that<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.909> call

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
should do something like that and call

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.030 
should do something like that and call
of<00:03:03.209> duty<00:03:03.480> while<00:03:03.810> in<00:03:04.079> a<00:03:04.139> 3rd<00:03:04.349> person<00:03:04.590> view<00:03:04.829> I

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
of duty while in a 3rd person view I

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.250 
of duty while in a 3rd person view I
think<00:03:05.220> they<00:03:05.459> would<00:03:05.549> be<00:03:05.639> sick<00:03:05.939> number<00:03:06.930> three

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
think they would be sick number three

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.559 
think they would be sick number three
your<00:03:07.920> actual<00:03:08.370> characters<00:03:08.909> should<00:03:09.060> talk<00:03:09.359> in

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
your actual characters should talk in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.970 
your actual characters should talk in
multiplayer<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.799> would<00:03:10.859> be<00:03:10.920> a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
multiplayer I think that would be a

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.890 
multiplayer I think that would be a
really<00:03:11.220> cool<00:03:11.489> feature<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:12.060> when<00:03:12.629> you<00:03:12.720> get<00:03:12.870> a

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
really cool feature like when you get a

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.420 
really cool feature like when you get a
kill<00:03:13.200> your<00:03:13.409> character<00:03:13.769> says<00:03:14.010> something<00:03:14.400> like

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
kill your character says something like

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.520 
kill your character says something like
you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.730> tango<00:03:15.239> down<00:03:15.480> something<00:03:16.349> like<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you know tango down something like that

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.589 
you know tango down something like that
all<00:03:16.949> these<00:03:17.099> little<00:03:17.310> things<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.879> know<00:03:17.910> can

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
all these little things you know can

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.599 
all these little things you know can
make<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.810> game<00:03:19.049> much<00:03:19.230> more<00:03:19.260> better<00:03:19.620> I<00:03:19.919> really<00:03:20.459> do

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
make a game much more better I really do

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.369 
make a game much more better I really do
feel<00:03:20.639> that<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.180> overall<00:03:21.480> gameplay<00:03:21.810> for<00:03:22.230> call

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:22.379 
feel that the overall gameplay for call

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.629 
feel that the overall gameplay for call
of<00:03:22.410> duty<00:03:22.650> ghosts<00:03:22.919> should<00:03:23.040> be<00:03:23.129> one<00:03:23.459> hundred

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
of duty ghosts should be one hundred

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:26.180 
of duty ghosts should be one hundred
percent<00:03:23.849> original<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.870> fact<00:03:25.230> let's<00:03:25.829> make<00:03:25.919> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
percent original in fact let's make it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
percent original in fact let's make it
very<00:03:26.400> very<00:03:26.639> stealthy<00:03:27.180> here<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.569> I<00:03:27.690> mean<00:03:27.930> very

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
very very stealthy here and I mean very

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.680 
very very stealthy here and I mean very
stealthy<00:03:29.069> kind<00:03:29.699> of<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:29.940> Tom<00:03:30.209> Clancy's

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
stealthy kind of like Tom Clancy's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.300 
stealthy kind of like Tom Clancy's
Splinter<00:03:30.720> Cell<00:03:31.199> you<00:03:31.319> know<00:03:31.470> when<00:03:32.040> your<00:03:32.159> wife

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
Splinter Cell you know when your wife

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.159 
Splinter Cell you know when your wife
actually<00:03:32.609> depends<00:03:33.239> on<00:03:33.329> hiding<00:03:33.629> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> dark

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
actually depends on hiding in the dark

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.349 
actually depends on hiding in the dark
and<00:03:34.379> using<00:03:35.040> silenced<00:03:35.579> weapons<00:03:35.909> I<00:03:36.060> mean<00:03:36.209> could

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
and using silenced weapons I mean could

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.759 
and using silenced weapons I mean could
you<00:03:36.419> imagine<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.139> call<00:03:37.349> of<00:03:37.409> duty<00:03:37.470> game

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
you imagine that in a call of duty game

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.250 
you imagine that in a call of duty game
using<00:03:38.549> all<00:03:38.730> silenced<00:03:39.299> weapons<00:03:39.659> and<00:03:39.870> hiding<00:03:40.169> in

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
using all silenced weapons and hiding in

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.229 
using all silenced weapons and hiding in
the<00:03:40.349> dark<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:40.739> stuff<00:03:40.979> like<00:03:41.099> that<00:03:41.159> being<00:03:41.909> very

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
the dark and stuff like that being very

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.909 
the dark and stuff like that being very
silent<00:03:42.780> I<00:03:42.900> think<00:03:43.349> that<00:03:43.379> would<00:03:43.530> be<00:03:43.620> an<00:03:43.709> amazing

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
silent I think that would be an amazing

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.770 
silent I think that would be an amazing
touch<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.579> i<00:03:44.609> called<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:45.000> again<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.359> be<00:03:45.449> honest

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
touch and i called it again to be honest

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.930 
touch and i called it again to be honest
because<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.440> would<00:03:46.829> be<00:03:46.949> original<00:03:47.459> and<00:03:47.579> it

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
because it would be original and it

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.430 
because it would be original and it
would<00:03:48.090> be<00:03:48.180> interesting<00:03:48.690> at<00:03:48.930> least<00:03:48.989> in<00:03:49.290> my

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
would be interesting at least in my

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.259 
would be interesting at least in my
opinion<00:03:49.560> if<00:03:50.340> there's<00:03:50.669> even<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.120> be<00:03:51.180> a

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
opinion if there's even going to be a

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.000 
opinion if there's even going to be a
call<00:03:51.540> of<00:03:51.659> duty<00:03:51.690> ghosts<00:03:52.079> spinoff<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:52.620> gotta<00:03:52.799> say

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010

this<00:03:53.159> right<00:03:53.340> now<00:03:53.549> i<00:03:53.819> would<00:03:54.359> actually<00:03:54.479> really

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
this right now i would actually really

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.780 
this right now i would actually really
love<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.169> see<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.379> much<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:55.889> longer<00:03:56.099> campaign

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
love to see a much more longer campaign

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.280 
love to see a much more longer campaign
than<00:03:57.000> any<00:03:57.150> other<00:03:57.419> call<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.720> duty<00:03:57.900> game<00:03:58.079> in<00:03:58.199> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
than any other call of duty game in the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.500 
than any other call of duty game in the
past<00:03:58.530> because<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:59.519> me<00:03:59.639> in<00:03:59.760> my<00:03:59.879> opinion<00:04:00.000> the

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
past because to me in my opinion the

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.479 
past because to me in my opinion the
longer<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.199> campaign<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.859> more<00:04:02.010> interesting

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
longer the campaign the more interesting

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.550 
longer the campaign the more interesting
the<00:04:02.579> story<00:04:02.819> gets<00:04:03.030> now<00:04:03.419> in<00:04:03.780> terms<00:04:04.349> of<00:04:04.470> the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
the story gets now in terms of the

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.990 
the story gets now in terms of the
characters<00:04:04.979> i<00:04:05.129> would<00:04:05.340> actually<00:04:05.489> really<00:04:05.849> like

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
characters i would actually really like

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.149 
characters i would actually really like
to<00:04:06.090> see<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> first<00:04:06.569> look<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.049> Makarov<00:04:07.829> and

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
to see a first look and Makarov and

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.159 
to see a first look and Makarov and
general<00:04:08.489> Shepherd<00:04:09.000> because<00:04:09.629> I<00:04:09.659> think<00:04:09.810> if<00:04:10.049> they

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
general Shepherd because I think if they

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.199 
general Shepherd because I think if they
introduce<00:04:10.709> those<00:04:10.889> two<00:04:11.099> characters<00:04:11.370> before

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
introduce those two characters before

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.330 
introduce those two characters before
the<00:04:12.569> events<00:04:12.840> of<00:04:12.930> modern<00:04:13.229> warfare<00:04:13.409> 2<00:04:13.709> that

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
the events of modern warfare 2 that

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.740 
the events of modern warfare 2 that
would<00:04:14.459> be<00:04:14.579> very<00:04:14.729> interesting<00:04:15.269> in<00:04:15.359> my<00:04:15.479> opinion

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
would be very interesting in my opinion

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.360 
would be very interesting in my opinion
and<00:04:16.049> tell<00:04:16.199> a<00:04:16.229> lot<00:04:16.409> more<00:04:16.650> on<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.799> story<00:04:17.099> for

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and tell a lot more on a story for

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.000 
and tell a lot more on a story for
modern<00:04:17.609> warfare<00:04:17.760> 2<00:04:18.150> now<00:04:19.019> I<00:04:19.500> actually<00:04:19.769> think

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
modern warfare 2 now I actually think

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.769 
modern warfare 2 now I actually think
this<00:04:20.190> would<00:04:20.340> be<00:04:20.370> hilarious<00:04:20.609> if<00:04:21.150> there<00:04:21.539> was<00:04:21.659> the

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:21.779 
this would be hilarious if there was the

this would be hilarious if there was the

the<00:05:26.449> design<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.080> everything<00:05:27.169> what<00:05:27.680> it<00:05:27.770> looks

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
the design and everything what it looks

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.980 
the design and everything what it looks
like<00:05:28.130> the<00:05:28.310> controller<00:05:28.759> that<00:05:29.330> release<00:05:29.719> date

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
like the controller that release date

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.629 
like the controller that release date
maybe<00:05:30.229> they're<00:05:30.469> going<00:05:30.590> to<00:05:30.650> go<00:05:30.800> ad<00:05:30.979> at<00:05:31.130> all<00:05:31.310> so

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
maybe they're going to go ad at all so

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:33.459 
maybe they're going to go ad at all so
who<00:05:32.240> knows<00:05:32.419> what<00:05:32.630> they're<00:05:32.750> going<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.900> do<00:05:33.050> in<00:05:33.169> e3

00:05:33.459 --> 00:05:33.469 
who knows what they're going to do in e3

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.430 
who knows what they're going to do in e3
2012<00:05:34.069> but<00:05:34.669> myself<00:05:34.849> personally<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.840> think<00:05:36.050> it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
2012 but myself personally I think it

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.719 
2012 but myself personally I think it
would<00:05:36.530> be<00:05:36.620> a<00:05:36.650> really<00:05:36.949> cool<00:05:37.280> year<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.610> actually

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
would be a really cool year to actually

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.730 
would be a really cool year to actually
show<00:05:38.120> off<00:05:38.270> their<00:05:38.419> next<00:05:38.690> Xbox<00:05:39.080> console<00:05:39.590> because

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
show off their next Xbox console because

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.270 
show off their next Xbox console because
if<00:05:40.340> you<00:05:40.580> look<00:05:40.759> at<00:05:40.880> that<00:05:41.029> date
