00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.700
 Hi, I'm Carlos MorÃ¡n, we're going to start you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.310
 to the third video of explanations of the 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.779
 geometric dimensions on the measures 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.640
 geometric that define the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.669
 behavior of the cycle part in 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.280
 circuit and as it is with addition also 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 on the road if you want to see the videos 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.740
 previous you can click and you can see 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 the previous notions that we have given 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.340
 in that sense we will see in this video 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.500
 let's explain what the center of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.210
 severity and then the suspension 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.730
 front and rear as regards 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.460
 geometric concept because the set-up 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.500
 and the changes we can make to 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 change behavior on track that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.700
 will be given in successive videos more 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.700
 ahead 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:20.100
 center of gravity the center of mass is 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.920
 let's say the point or the area where the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.930
 motorcycle has all concentrated 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.880
 the synergies in deceleration 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.940
 Acceleration or right tilt 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.759
 left is to say very important to 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.399
 the behavior of what we call in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.240
 the load transfer is to say then 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.920
 the dynamic movement that the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.619
 motorcycle in a deceleration or 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.679
 braking or in an acceleration the center 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.350
 of gravity of the motorcycle 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:53.039
 logically it is fixed dynamically it is not going 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.590
 to change the site engine or the axes 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.740
 of positions although if there is a slight 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.259
 movement in terms of the functions of 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.729
 suspensions as we will see later 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.520
 but there is one thing that it does in the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.770
 motorcycle the really variable center 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.649
 dynamically speaking and it's the posture 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.319
 of the pilot the pilot's position is what 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.900
 that modifies the center of mass 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.579
 Moto bike set for better 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.549
 behavior or behavior more 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:21.480
 suitable for each type of driving as 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.510
 we will see 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
 I repeat again later in videos 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.319
 successive the center of gravity usually 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.180
 be approximately very close to 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.730
 engine because since it is the center of 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.700
 dough 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.960
 more influential then it is usually 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.220
 around the engine normally on motorcycles 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.590
 r comes to be about 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:54.270
 700 millimeters in height with respect to 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.250
 ground and especially in distance of 3 is 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.760
 approximately 1,400 millimeters is 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.250
 say it's almost half the height with 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.970
 with respect to the wheelbase 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.770
 that we have spoken before a quality that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.620
 we will also talk about later is that 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.180
 the more distance between axles the 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.190
 center behaves as if it were 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.440
 lower and the shorter wheelbase 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.540
 of the center of gravity behaves like more 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.440
 high in terms of the dynamic effect of 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.440
 load transfer 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.499
 okay now let's explain 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.060
 within the components of a part 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:39.239
 auto cycle Cycle 'is what the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.439
 front suspension in this case let's 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.209
 to explain what is the suspension 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.280
 front because the adjustments of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.530
 front suspension will be explained in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.109
 successive videos now the suspension 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.409
 lead 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:54.239
 it can usually be or normally 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:57.079
 is usually what we call a telescopic 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.879
 telescopic is how we see a fork 

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:02.400
 that the shaft goes up and down through a 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.400
 telescopic that is modified in its 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.620
 length there may also be systems of 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.629
 front suspension in green 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.109
 telescopic with front swingarm or 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.219
 with front trapeze like it can be 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:16.229
 retreat now pushed but that what 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:18.150
 we will explain later we are going to 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.000
 focus what is a telescopic that 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.690
 it is 95% of the suspensions that 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.789
 exist on conventional motorcycles not the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.789
 front suspension as the system 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:32.070
 Telescopic makes the front axle 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.020
 have a tour of approximately 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.080
 120 millimeters in most of the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.420
 motorcycle mostly of 600 and 1000 the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.840
 tours 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:45.330
 is what marks the behavior of the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.820
 part cycle is to say the route of 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.770
 front suspension has to go very 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.020
 matched with the travel of 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.020
 rear suspension that we will now see 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.680
 another important part in the components 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.530
 of the cycle part of a motorcycle is 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.480
 logically the rear suspension the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.780
 or rear suspension system 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:15.440
 back suppression in an immense majority 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.730
 is the compound by a swingarm 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.820
 rear the rear swingarm has the 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.500
 suspension action with basically 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.870
 also two systems one called 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.570
 progressive monoshock that is what 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.610
 what we have here is to say with a system 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.240
 of a single shock absorber and with a system 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:38.150
 of variable progressivity that already 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.400
 we will explain how to say later on 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.280
 is the system more carefully and what 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.639
 adjustments we can make and this is done 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.960
 so that the rear axle 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:52.849
 have a tour also in unison or 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.249
 as coordinated as possible with the axis 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.740
 forward as we said before the 

00:05:55.249 --> 00:06:00.860
 travel of the rear axle normally 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.569
 about will also be about a hundred 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.330
 they have a route about 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:08.499
 120 millimeters in a thousand as it is usually 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.320
 130 also even up to 140 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:14.770
 depending on 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.919
 the type or brand of motorcycles 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.389
 So far we have explained the different 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:21.970
 components of the part of the cycle 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.310
 motorcycle in the next video we are going to 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.800
 explain the dynamic effects of all 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.490
 those running components that is what 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.590
 it is the circuit I remind you that I am 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.840
 your disposition in default before racing 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.419
 motorcycles a technical service so that 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.800
 do maintenance or adjustments in 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.599
 any need you have of the 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.599
 part of the cycle of agreement chao 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.849
 ah
