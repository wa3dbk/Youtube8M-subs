00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180 
hello I've got on my special heat proof

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.850 
hello I've got on my special heat proof
glove<00:00:07.450> well<00:00:07.840> it's<00:00:07.960> not<00:00:08.019> really<00:00:08.320> heat<00:00:08.620> proof

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
glove well it's not really heat proof

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.740 
glove well it's not really heat proof
but<00:00:09.219> it<00:00:09.730> does<00:00:09.969> give<00:00:10.240> a<00:00:10.270> little<00:00:10.480> bit<00:00:10.660> of

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
but it does give a little bit of

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.540 
but it does give a little bit of
protection<00:00:10.870> and<00:00:11.379> because<00:00:12.219> I've<00:00:12.370> been<00:00:12.490> using

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.550 
protection and because I've been using

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.390 
protection and because I've been using
my<00:00:12.969> fabulous<00:00:13.259> styling<00:00:14.259> wand<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.740> I've

my fabulous styling wand and I've

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.600 
my fabulous styling wand and I've
created<00:00:15.670> this<00:00:15.969> kind<00:00:16.209> of<00:00:16.920> rock<00:00:17.920> and<00:00:18.160> varnish

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
created this kind of rock and varnish

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.939 
created this kind of rock and varnish
bit<00:00:18.880> of<00:00:18.970> texture<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:19.630> my<00:00:19.810> hair<00:00:20.020> didn't<00:00:20.740> want<00:00:20.890> to

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:20.949 
bit of texture in my hair didn't want to

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.429 
bit of texture in my hair didn't want to
go<00:00:21.070> super<00:00:21.400> curly<00:00:21.750> as<00:00:22.750> you<00:00:22.930> can<00:00:23.050> probably<00:00:23.170> tell

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
go super curly as you can probably tell

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.080 
go super curly as you can probably tell
I'm<00:00:23.710> off<00:00:23.890> out<00:00:24.039> that's<00:00:24.490> why<00:00:24.640> I'm<00:00:24.699> looking<00:00:24.820> very

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.090 
I'm off out that's why I'm looking very

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.460 
I'm off out that's why I'm looking very
spangly<00:00:25.720> and<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:27.779> thought<00:00:28.779> it'd<00:00:28.930> be<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:29.170> good

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
spangly and I thought it'd be a good

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.620 
spangly and I thought it'd be a good
time<00:00:29.529> to<00:00:29.710> show<00:00:30.039> you<00:00:30.099> how<00:00:30.220> I<00:00:30.400> used<00:00:30.789> it<00:00:30.970> I've<00:00:31.359> only

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 
time to show you how I used it I've only

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.950 
time to show you how I used it I've only
used<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:32.169> once<00:00:32.230> before<00:00:32.680> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:34.210> think<00:00:34.570> this<00:00:34.840> is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
used it once before so I think this is

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.660 
used it once before so I think this is
pretty<00:00:35.199> good<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.680> for<00:00:35.830> my<00:00:35.949> second<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.549> the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
pretty good just for my second is the

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.840 
pretty good just for my second is the
practice<00:00:37.239> and<00:00:38.080> it's<00:00:38.769> really<00:00:39.070> really<00:00:39.460> easy<00:00:39.610> to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
practice and it's really really easy to

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.750 
practice and it's really really easy to
use<00:00:40.150> it's<00:00:40.720> got<00:00:40.900> an<00:00:40.960> on-off<00:00:41.140> button<00:00:41.760> variable

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
use it's got an on-off button variable

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.759 
use it's got an on-off button variable
setting<00:00:43.449> things<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:43.930> start<00:00:44.140> at<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.470> lowest

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
setting things you start at the lowest

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:47.369 
setting things you start at the lowest
setting<00:00:44.949> always<00:00:45.659> and<00:00:46.659> just<00:00:46.839> seeing<00:00:47.049> how<00:00:47.140> your

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
setting always and just seeing how your

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.280 
setting always and just seeing how your
hair<00:00:47.620> reacts<00:00:48.010> it's<00:00:48.670> so<00:00:48.909> easy<00:00:49.089> to<00:00:49.330> use<00:00:49.510> as<00:00:50.110> you

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
hair reacts it's so easy to use as you

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.910 
hair reacts it's so easy to use as you
can<00:00:50.379> see<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.799> can<00:00:50.890> create<00:00:51.360> thicker<00:00:52.920> wider

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
can see you can create thicker wider

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.039 
can see you can create thicker wider
looser<00:00:54.519> curls<00:00:54.760> sorry<00:00:55.119> if<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.690> use<00:00:55.900> the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.049 
looser curls sorry if you use the

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:58.439 
looser curls sorry if you use the
thicker<00:00:56.260> end<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.769> then<00:00:57.220> really<00:00:57.699> tight<00:00:58.059> spiral

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
thicker end and then really tight spiral

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.259 
thicker end and then really tight spiral
curls<00:00:58.900> if<00:00:59.140> you're<00:00:59.260> using<00:00:59.440> this<00:00:59.680> end<00:00:59.920> and

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
curls if you're using this end and

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.490 
curls if you're using this end and
depending<00:01:01.269> on<00:01:01.330> how<00:01:01.600> much<00:01:01.780> hair<00:01:02.049> you<00:01:02.080> wind

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
depending on how much hair you wind

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.649 
depending on how much hair you wind
around<00:01:02.769> it<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.040> also<00:01:03.610> affects<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.210> results

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
around it that also affects the results

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.080 
around it that also affects the results
so<00:01:04.839> it's<00:01:05.350> just<00:01:05.500> so<00:01:05.830> so<00:01:06.100> easy<00:01:06.250> as<00:01:06.549> you'll<00:01:06.880> see

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

so it's just so so easy as you'll see
and<00:01:07.720> now<00:01:07.840> I'm<00:01:07.930> going<00:01:08.049> to<00:01:08.110> get<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.320> with<00:01:08.470> it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
and now I'm going to get on with it

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.050 
and now I'm going to get on with it
because<00:01:08.740> otherwise<00:01:08.980> this<00:01:09.340> video<00:01:09.670> really<00:01:09.850> is

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
because otherwise this video really is

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.350 
because otherwise this video really is
going<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.540> about<00:01:10.750> 40<00:01:11.620> hours<00:01:11.770> long<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.150> let's

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
going to be about 40 hours long so let's

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.000 
going to be about 40 hours long so let's
go<00:01:13.480> back<00:01:13.510> to<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.900> start<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.470> there's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
go back to the start and there's

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.140 
go back to the start and there's
probably<00:01:15.250> going<00:01:15.370> to<00:01:15.430> be<00:01:15.490> quite<00:01:15.730> a<00:01:15.760> lot<00:01:15.940> of

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
probably going to be quite a lot of

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.030 
probably going to be quite a lot of
comic<00:01:16.750> fast-forwarding<00:01:17.650> in<00:01:17.770> this<00:01:17.950> so<00:01:18.880> enjoy

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
comic fast-forwarding in this so enjoy

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.000 
comic fast-forwarding in this so enjoy
here<00:01:21.760> we<00:01:21.850> are<00:01:21.880> with<00:01:22.180> straighter<00:01:22.780> hair<00:01:23.020> first

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
here we are with straighter hair first

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.650 
here we are with straighter hair first
of<00:01:24.160> all<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.310> do<00:01:24.430> think<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:24.940> easier<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.480> you<00:01:25.570> can

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
of all I do think it's easier if you can

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.360 
of all I do think it's easier if you can
section<00:01:26.080> off<00:01:26.170> your<00:01:26.230> hair<00:01:26.410> so<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.160> work

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
section off your hair so you just work

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.400 
section off your hair so you just work
on<00:01:27.610> one<00:01:27.670> little<00:01:28.120> bit<00:01:28.240> at<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.570> time<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:29.380> you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
on one little bit at a time then you

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.930 
on one little bit at a time then you
know<00:01:29.650> which<00:01:29.830> but<00:01:30.010> you've<00:01:30.130> done<00:01:30.370> you<00:01:30.580> can<00:01:30.730> move

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
know which but you've done you can move

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.670 
know which but you've done you can move
on<00:01:31.150> round<00:01:31.390> because<00:01:31.660> I<00:01:31.750> do<00:01:31.810> tend<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.350> get<00:01:32.530> mixed

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
on round because I do tend to get mixed

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.960 
on round because I do tend to get mixed
up<00:01:32.920> if<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.250> just<00:01:33.460> do<00:01:33.580> random<00:01:34.330> pieces<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.110> hair<00:01:35.970> so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
up if I just do random pieces of hair so

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.640 
up if I just do random pieces of hair so
I've<00:01:37.060> just<00:01:37.090> taken<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.630> whole<00:01:37.810> top<00:01:38.230> section<00:01:38.560> of

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
I've just taken the whole top section of

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.820 
I've just taken the whole top section of
my<00:01:38.740> hair<00:01:38.980> and<00:01:39.610> I'm<00:01:39.730> twisting<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.240> round<00:01:40.510> in<00:01:41.470> to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
my hair and I'm twisting it round in to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.210 
my hair and I'm twisting it round in to
release<00:01:42.040> all<00:01:42.220> burn<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.470> that's<00:01:44.680> out<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:44.920> the

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
release all burn so that's out of the

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.740 
release all burn so that's out of the
way<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.520> I<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.760> just<00:01:45.880> work<00:01:46.090> on<00:01:46.390> this<00:01:47.350> bit<00:01:47.590> here

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
way and I can just work on this bit here

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.000 
way and I can just work on this bit here
now<00:01:49.750> obviously<00:01:49.960> you<00:01:50.290> put<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.560> glove<00:01:50.740> on<00:01:50.770> the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
now obviously you put the glove on the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.350 
now obviously you put the glove on the
hand<00:01:51.070> that<00:01:51.430> you're<00:01:51.520> going<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.670> be<00:01:51.820> holding

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
hand that you're going to be holding

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.930 
hand that you're going to be holding
your<00:01:52.720> hair<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.200> not<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.680> ones<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.190> but<00:01:54.820> it's

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
your hair in not the ones and but it's

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.370 
your hair in not the ones and but it's
just<00:01:55.180> down<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.390> preference<00:01:55.900> really<00:01:56.050> whether

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
just down to preference really whether

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.410 
just down to preference really whether
you<00:01:56.560> use<00:01:56.800> your<00:01:57.040> left<00:01:57.520> or<00:01:57.670> right<00:01:57.880> hand<00:01:58.150> to<00:01:58.270> do

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
you use your left or right hand to do

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.760 
you use your left or right hand to do
that<00:01:58.600> I'm<00:01:58.990> right-handed

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
that I'm right-handed

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.680 
that I'm right-handed
and<00:02:00.010> so<00:02:00.729> you'd<00:02:00.880> think<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.180> you'd<00:02:01.390> want<00:02:01.600> to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
and so you'd think that you'd want to

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.120 
and so you'd think that you'd want to
use<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.960> right<00:02:02.140> hand<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.560> wind<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:02.950> hair

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
use the right hand to wind the hair

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.340 
use the right hand to wind the hair
around<00:02:03.430> but<00:02:03.940> actually<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.330> find<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:04.720> easier<00:02:05.080> to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
around but actually I find it easier to

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.469 
around but actually I find it easier to
use<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.590> left<00:02:06.040> hand<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.970> I'm<00:02:07.120> popping<00:02:07.420> the

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
use the left hand so I'm popping the

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.109 
use the left hand so I'm popping the
glove<00:02:07.659> onto<00:02:07.930> my<00:02:08.019> left<00:02:08.200> hand<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.849> if<00:02:09.909> you<00:02:10.000> see

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
glove onto my left hand so if you see

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.490 
glove onto my left hand so if you see
how<00:02:10.269> much<00:02:10.360> I'm<00:02:10.569> taking<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:10.959> X<00:02:11.049> I<00:02:11.170> want<00:02:11.349> to<00:02:11.409> do

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
how much I'm taking the X I want to do

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.520 
how much I'm taking the X I want to do
quite<00:02:12.000> loose<00:02:13.000> curls<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.050> don't<00:02:14.290> want<00:02:14.470> it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
quite loose curls really I don't want it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.190 
quite loose curls really I don't want it
to<00:02:14.620> be<00:02:14.740> tight<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:16.450> is

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
to be tight it is

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:29.920 
to be tight it is
style

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.789 

and<00:02:30.349> I'm<00:02:31.329> waiting<00:02:32.329> for<00:02:32.480> about<00:02:32.569> eight<00:02:33.140> seconds

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
and I'm waiting for about eight seconds

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.530 
and I'm waiting for about eight seconds
ten<00:02:34.069> seconds<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.760> don't<00:02:35.060> know<00:02:35.360> actually

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
ten seconds I don't know actually

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.449 
ten seconds I don't know actually
because<00:02:35.959> I'm<00:02:36.019> not<00:02:36.110> counting<00:02:36.590> completely<00:02:37.280> made

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
because I'm not counting completely made

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.929 
because I'm not counting completely made
that<00:02:37.640> up<00:02:38.019> I'd<00:02:39.019> say<00:02:39.260> it's<00:02:39.349> about<00:02:39.439> ten<00:02:39.950> seconds

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.670 

there<00:02:46.939> we<00:02:47.120> go

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
there we go

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.910 
there we go
lovely<00:02:48.680> shiny<00:02:48.980> Co<00:02:50.500> don't<00:02:51.500> worry<00:02:51.650> if<00:02:51.799> it<00:02:51.890> looks

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
lovely shiny Co don't worry if it looks

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.949 
lovely shiny Co don't worry if it looks
a<00:02:52.189> little<00:02:52.310> bit<00:02:52.579> too<00:02:52.609> curly<00:02:53.390> at<00:02:53.510> first<00:02:53.780> because

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
a little bit too curly at first because

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.710 
a little bit too curly at first because
it<00:02:54.109> won't<00:02:54.319> drop<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:55.670> wanted<00:02:56.329> to<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.510> quite

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
it won't drop and I wanted to be quite

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.800 
it won't drop and I wanted to be quite
loose<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.739> it's<00:02:57.890> better<00:02:58.099> to<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.810> curlier

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
loose but it's better to have curlier

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.910 
loose but it's better to have curlier
and<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:00.260> pull<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.620> out<00:03:00.709> with<00:03:00.859> your

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
and then pull it out with your

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.059 
and then pull it out with your
fingertips<00:03:01.430> then<00:03:02.060> have<00:03:02.510> no<00:03:03.349> car<00:03:03.650> at<00:03:03.769> all<00:03:03.950> and

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
fingertips then have no car at all and

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.319 
fingertips then have no car at all and
have<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.250> go<00:03:04.370> round<00:03:04.519> to<00:03:04.639> do<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.849> all<00:03:04.940> again

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
have to go round to do it all again

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.390 
have to go round to do it all again
cannot<00:03:05.750> tell<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.590> a<00:03:06.620> good<00:03:06.829> idea<00:03:06.889> this

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
cannot tell you what a good idea this

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.530 
cannot tell you what a good idea this
glove<00:03:07.639> is<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:10.310> just<00:03:10.489> makes<00:03:10.670> everything<00:03:11.090> so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
glove is it just makes everything so

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.869 
glove is it just makes everything so
much<00:03:11.569> easier<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:13.370> only<00:03:13.639> thing<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
much easier and the only thing you

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.699 
much easier and the only thing you
really<00:03:14.000> have<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.299> worry<00:03:14.510> about<00:03:14.659> is<00:03:15.049> burning

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
really have to worry about is burning

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.270 
really have to worry about is burning
your<00:03:15.829> ear<00:03:16.069> with<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.870> wand<00:03:17.889> so<00:03:18.889> far<00:03:19.129> that

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
your ear with the wand so far that

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.149 
your ear with the wand so far that
hasn't<00:03:19.459> happened<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.680> then<00:03:22.010> I've<00:03:22.129> just

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
hasn't happened and then I've just

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.399 
hasn't happened and then I've just
unleashed<00:03:22.939> some<00:03:23.359> of<00:03:23.480> my<00:03:23.599> hair<00:03:23.840> from<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.200> top

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
unleashed some of my hair from the top

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.410 
unleashed some of my hair from the top
bit<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:24.859> think<00:03:25.220> it's<00:03:25.489> still<00:03:25.700> best<00:03:25.939> just<00:03:26.180> to<00:03:26.269> do

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
bit I think it's still best just to do

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.490 
bit I think it's still best just to do
it<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.569> little<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:27.019> at<00:03:27.139> a<00:03:27.200> time

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
it a little bit at a time

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.729 
it a little bit at a time
just<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.459> can<00:03:28.639> keep<00:03:28.970> control<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.650> you

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
just so you can keep control and you

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.890 
just so you can keep control and you
don't<00:03:30.980> get<00:03:31.159> mixed<00:03:31.760> up<00:03:31.879> with<00:03:31.939> which<00:03:32.299> haze<00:03:32.540> then

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
don't get mixed up with which haze then

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.369 
don't get mixed up with which haze then
which<00:03:33.139> how<00:03:33.319> you<00:03:33.379> haven't<00:03:34.510> fringe<00:03:35.510> or<00:03:35.870> shorter

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:36.379 
which how you haven't fringe or shorter

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.110 
which how you haven't fringe or shorter
sections<00:03:36.739> are<00:03:36.889> a<00:03:36.919> little<00:03:37.040> bit<00:03:37.190> harder<00:03:37.609> so<00:03:37.760> they

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
sections are a little bit harder so they

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.099 
sections are a little bit harder so they
probably<00:03:38.629> don't<00:03:38.870> need<00:03:39.109> quite<00:03:39.470> as<00:03:39.709> much<00:03:39.739> time

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
probably don't need quite as much time

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.689 
probably don't need quite as much time
around<00:03:42.109> the<00:03:42.470> wand<00:03:42.680> from<00:03:43.209> my<00:03:44.260> expert

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
around the wand from my expert

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:52.539 
around the wand from my expert
experience<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.959> two<00:03:48.500> goes<00:03:50.919> just<00:03:51.919> lose<00:03:52.310> a<00:03:52.340> bit

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
experience of two goes just lose a bit

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.699 
experience of two goes just lose a bit
and<00:03:52.730> again<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.389> know<00:03:53.540> it<00:03:54.230> would<00:03:54.349> look<00:03:54.440> less

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
and again you know it would look less

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.979 
and again you know it would look less
scary<00:03:54.919> once<00:03:55.579> it's<00:03:55.819> all<00:03:56.030> brushed<00:03:56.629> out<00:03:56.810> with<00:03:56.930> the

scary once it's all brushed out with the

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.800 
scary once it's all brushed out with the
fingertips<00:03:57.819> and<00:03:58.819> if<00:03:59.030> there<00:03:59.180> any<00:03:59.359> bits<00:03:59.599> that

look<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.109> bit<00:04:00.260> tired<00:04:00.590> or<00:04:00.979> sad<00:04:01.280> compared<00:04:01.849> to<00:04:01.970> the

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
look a bit tired or sad compared to the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.819 
look a bit tired or sad compared to the
rest<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.840> beauty<00:04:03.169> of<00:04:03.229> it<00:04:03.409> is<00:04:03.530> it's<00:04:03.769> just

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
rest the beauty of it is it's just

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.219 
rest the beauty of it is it's just
really<00:04:04.159> quick<00:04:04.579> just<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:05.030> spot<00:04:05.750> those<00:04:05.930> bits

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
really quick just to spot those bits

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:08.259 
really quick just to spot those bits
pull<00:04:06.500> them<00:04:06.650> out<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:07.040> wind<00:04:07.699> them<00:04:07.879> around<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
pull them out and wind them around the

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.960 
pull them out and wind them around the
wand<00:04:08.449> again<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.049> you<00:04:09.109> can't<00:04:09.560> really<00:04:09.949> go<00:04:10.699> too

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
wand again so you can't really go too

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.809 
wand again so you can't really go too
far<00:04:11.180> wrong<00:04:11.239> and<00:04:12.280> another<00:04:13.280> great<00:04:13.489> thing<00:04:13.549> is

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
far wrong and another great thing is

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.529 
far wrong and another great thing is
that<00:04:14.319> because<00:04:15.319> it's<00:04:15.650> got<00:04:15.919> a<00:04:16.220> wide<00:04:16.849> end<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.510> a

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
that because it's got a wide end and a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.140 
that because it's got a wide end and a
narrow<00:04:17.780> end<00:04:18.159> all<00:04:19.159> of<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.459> curls<00:04:19.699> are<00:04:19.909> a<00:04:19.970> little

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
narrow end all of the curls are a little

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.140 
narrow end all of the curls are a little
bit<00:04:20.389> random<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.500> nothing<00:04:21.799> looks<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.250> me<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.030> if

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
bit random and nothing looks to me so if

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.320 
bit random and nothing looks to me so if
you're<00:04:23.270> after<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.720> slightly<00:04:24.229> shoveled<00:04:24.800> look

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
you're after that slightly shoveled look

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.909 
you're after that slightly shoveled look
or<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.870> know<00:04:26.990> something<00:04:27.260> that's<00:04:27.349> quite<00:04:27.620> cool

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
or you know something that's quite cool

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.390 
or you know something that's quite cool
and<00:04:28.099> edgy<00:04:28.250> then<00:04:29.199> it's<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.530> lot<00:04:30.860> easier<00:04:31.010> to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and edgy then it's a lot easier to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.129 
and edgy then it's a lot easier to
achieve<00:04:31.699> that<00:04:31.909> look<00:04:32.150> than<00:04:32.479> something<00:04:32.750> that's

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
achieve that look than something that's

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.820 
achieve that look than something that's
a<00:04:33.229> uniform<00:04:33.860> barrel<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> whole<00:04:34.699> way<00:04:34.820> along<00:04:35.830> so

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
a uniform barrel the whole way along so

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.200 
a uniform barrel the whole way along so
I<00:04:36.860> think<00:04:37.039> that's<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.310> last<00:04:37.460> one<00:04:37.669> and<00:04:37.940> now<00:04:38.060> all

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
I think that's the last one and now all

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.080 
I think that's the last one and now all
I<00:04:38.330> need<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.599> do<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.900> just<00:04:39.430> run<00:04:40.430> my<00:04:40.639> fingers

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
I need to do is just run my fingers

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.290 
I need to do is just run my fingers
through<00:04:41.120> it<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.630> it's<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.840> bit<00:04:42.020> break<00:04:42.590> up

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
through it and it's a bit break up

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.300 
through it and it's a bit break up
sorry<00:04:44.229> I<00:04:44.319> feel<00:04:44.500> like<00:04:44.620> I've<00:04:44.770> been<00:04:44.889> looking<00:04:45.190> in

these testing sessions so just to get a
little<00:05:09.300> bend<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> end<00:05:11.020> rather<00:05:11.409> than<00:05:11.590> them

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
little bend to the end rather than them

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.899 
little bend to the end rather than them

volumes and texture I didn't want
anything<00:05:21.879> too<00:05:22.440> formal<00:05:23.440> so<00:05:23.770> this<00:05:23.949> is<00:05:24.069> perfect

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580
