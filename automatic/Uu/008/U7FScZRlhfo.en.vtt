 in this tutorial we will learn how to do 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:09.320
 These bags or cotillions in fomy or rubber 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.330
 eva with the mini mouse character of 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.889
 disney 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:17.220
 ideal to present at your parties 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.369
 children's themes to start 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 subscribe to this channel download e 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.230
 print the molds that you can find 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.170
 in the description of this video 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.100
 since we have passed the molds one to 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.600
 one in its respective color in the background 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:37.890
 we will start by sticking the mold of the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.890
 nose to the face 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.750
 now we will stick the mold of the face to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.649
 one of the silhouettes that we already had 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.649
 trimmed 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.820
 we will also place and paste one of 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.820
 the two ties in this way 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.470
 and this other link on the second 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.340
 silhouette that will be the back of 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.340
 our bag 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.580
 now using a swab or swab 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.100
 of cotton we will apply glue 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 contact on the edges of these two 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.580
 ribbons 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.290
 the measurements of these two tapes are 2 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.410
 x 30 centimeters and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.410
 do not 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.970
 now while drying the glue of 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.860
 contact we will mark these lines as 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.860
 guide to then paint the face 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.710
 remember that all the measures here 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.640
 they are named are annotated in one of the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.640
 mold sheets 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.360
 Now using acrylic paint in 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.740
 white color we will begin to paint in 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.740
 this part of the eyes 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:43.030
 and in this part we will use paint 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.030
 acrylic in black 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.489
 we will also cover this part of the mouth 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.489
 in black 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.660
 and for the language we will use paint 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.660
 acrylic in red 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.090
 using an ink marker 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.090
 permanent address in this part 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.620
 we will also draw these lines that 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.620
 will give the curves and the folds of the loop 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.420
 Y 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.189
 now using a dotted dot or the 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.890
 back of a brush we will mark 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.890
 these little white dots on the area 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.410
 we will also mark the dots in the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.770
 silhouette tie that will go in the part 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.770
 later 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.030
 Now that the paint has dried 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:20.810
 acrylic face we can paint with 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.810
 a permanent ink marker mouth 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:29.099
 this line on the nose 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.099
 and the outline of the eyes 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.790
 and likewise the eyelashes 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:53.039
 now we will apply contact adhesive in 

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:53.039
 this part of each of the two molds 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:05.230
 If you do not want to use glue 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.390
 contact in the same way you can do it 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.390
 using hot silicone 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.080
 we will locate and hit the next 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:23.030
 way this is one of the tapes that 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.689
 we had already applied glue 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.689
 Contact 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.190
 for we will give this silhouette with the other 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.190
 tape that also had glue 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:52.709
 now we will place and stick a tape 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:55.180
 of foami of 4 centimeters and a half x 30 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.789
 centimeters and a half 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.000

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.180
 Crafts 

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.220
 we will join and stick these two parts of 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.640
 so that we were formed a 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.640
 small box 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:29.590
 with these two tapes one of two 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:33.070
 centimeters and a half by 31 centimeters and 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.470
 another one and a half centimeters by 31 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.920
 centimeters that we have cut with the 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:42.770
 scissors of peaks we will form the col gadera 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.310
 we apply silicone and stick it to 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.310
 center 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.349
 and in this way we will place and stick 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.710
 each of the ends of the hanging 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.710
 her 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:12.610
 finally we will form two ties for 

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:15.919
 we will use two pieces of shape 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.789
 one of two and a half by seven centimeters 

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:23.289
 and a half and another one centimeter 

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.289
 five and a half centimeters 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:44.759
 we place them and paste them in each one 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.759
 of these parts 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.900
 if you liked this publication and
