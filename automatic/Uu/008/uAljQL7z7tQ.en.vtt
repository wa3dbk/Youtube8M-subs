00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
garden here's a closer look at our
raspberries<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:28.350> didn't<00:01:28.500> pick<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.650> whole<00:01:28.829> lot

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
raspberries we didn't pick a whole lot

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.100 
raspberries we didn't pick a whole lot
of<00:01:29.009> them<00:01:29.130> last<00:01:29.369> year<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.700> just<00:01:29.970> picked<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.360> but

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
of them last year I just picked some but

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.620 
of them last year I just picked some but
they<00:01:31.500> grew<00:01:31.979> pretty<00:01:32.220> pretty<00:01:32.700> wildly<00:01:33.150> down<00:01:33.329> here

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.200 
they grew pretty pretty wildly down here
I<00:01:34.040> think<00:01:35.040> initially<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.549> were<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.880> inside

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
I think initially they were just inside

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
I think initially they were just inside
the<00:01:36.420> two<00:01:36.630> posts<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:37.799> now<00:01:37.950> they're<00:01:38.310> all

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
there the reason I was worried earlier I

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.970 
there the reason I was worried earlier I
was<00:03:21.330> thinking<00:03:21.390> that<00:03:21.660> maybe<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.140> these<00:03:22.380> canes

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
was thinking that maybe all these canes

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.710 
was thinking that maybe all these canes
took<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.430> few<00:03:23.820> years<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.180> grow<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.600> was

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
took a few years to grow and I was

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.260 
took a few years to grow and I was
thinking<00:03:25.020> maybe<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.100> shouldn't<00:03:26.520> be<00:03:26.640> cutting

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
thinking maybe I shouldn't be cutting

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.940 
thinking maybe I shouldn't be cutting
him<00:03:27.300> back<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.260> know<00:03:28.530> right<00:03:28.739> to<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
him back like that you know right to the

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.420 
him back like that you know right to the
ground

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
ground

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.560 
ground
it<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.910> one<00:03:30.030> thing<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.330> didn't

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:30.570

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.570 
it was the one thing that I didn't
research<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.260> fortunately<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.280> made<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
research and fortunately I made the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
research and fortunately I made the
right<00:03:32.670> decision<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.380> we'll<00:03:34.380> see<00:03:34.530> what<00:03:34.650> happens
