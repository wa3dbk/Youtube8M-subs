your<00:01:13.619> brush<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:15.270> does<00:01:15.659> one<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.380> two<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.830> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
your brush it does one of two things it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.690 
your brush it does one of two things it
one<00:01:17.700> warms<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.750> makeup<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:20.070> that<00:01:20.340> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
one warms up the makeup so that it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.080 
one warms up the makeup so that it's
easier<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.390> blend<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.369> two<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.670> makes<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
easier to blend in and two it makes it

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020 
easier to blend in and two it makes it
easier<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:25.439> clean<00:01:25.710> your<00:01:26.040> brush<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.759> if

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
easier to clean your brush because if

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
easier to clean your brush because if
you<00:01:27.150> applied<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.450> straight<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.869> your<00:01:27.990> blush<00:01:28.259> on

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you applied it straight on your blush on

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
you applied it straight on your blush on
your<00:01:29.009> brush<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.729> your<00:01:29.880> blush<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.840> brush

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
your brush on your blush on your brush

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.069 
your brush on your blush on your brush
then<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.729> harder<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.479> clean

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
then it would be a lot harder to clean

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.740 
then it would be a lot harder to clean
it<00:01:34.229> because<00:01:34.320> it's<00:01:34.650> it'd<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.329> deeper<00:01:36.329> into

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it because it's it'd be like deeper into

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
it because it's it'd be like deeper into
the<00:01:36.840> bristles<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> makes<00:01:38.070> sense

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:55.880 

I<00:01:52.520> really<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.970> tinted<00:01:54.450> moisturizer<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I really like this tinted moisturizer it

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.770 
I really like this tinted moisturizer it
doesn't<00:01:56.220> have<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> best<00:01:56.700> coverage<00:01:57.060> obviously

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
doesn't have the best coverage obviously

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
doesn't have the best coverage obviously
is<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.200> scented<00:01:58.500> moisturizer<00:01:59.060> but<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.299> does

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
is it scented moisturizer but it does

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.070 
is it scented moisturizer but it does
not<00:02:00.689> make<00:02:01.170> me<00:02:01.380> break<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:02.610> feels<00:02:03.570> very<00:02:03.690> nice

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
not make me break out it feels very nice

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.710 
not make me break out it feels very nice
on<00:02:04.409> your<00:02:04.860> skin<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.310> doesn't<00:02:05.580> feel<00:02:05.670> heavy<00:02:06.299> or
