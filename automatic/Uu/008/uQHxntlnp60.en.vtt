00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
today about our new cross leg and what i

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.259 
today about our new cross leg and what i
want<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.620> do<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.099> just<00:00:14.400> send<00:00:14.670> Stewart

want you to do is is just send Stewart
terms<00:00:15.509> kind<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.960> explain<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
terms kind of explain to them the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.650 
terms kind of explain to them the
difference<00:00:17.100> from<00:00:17.550> our<00:00:17.730> problem<00:00:18.210> from<00:00:18.390> some<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
difference from our problem from some of

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.240 
difference from our problem from some of
the<00:00:18.750> other<00:00:18.779> pre-workouts<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.770> there<00:00:19.980> that

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
the other pre-workouts out there that

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.730 
the other pre-workouts out there that
are<00:00:20.279> out<00:00:20.460> there<00:00:20.490> right<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:20.990> yeah<00:00:21.990> Thank<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
are out there right now yeah Thank that

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
are out there right now yeah Thank that
we<00:00:23.010> there<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.519> huge<00:00:23.850> difference<00:00:24.000> now<00:00:24.539> our

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
we there is a huge difference now our

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.929 
we there is a huge difference now our
product<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.350> works<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:26.279> does<00:00:26.490> work<00:00:26.730> not

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
product really works it does work not

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.540 
product really works it does work not
because<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.390> contains<00:00:28.199> too<00:00:28.529> many<00:00:28.680> stimulants

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
because it contains too many stimulants

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
because it contains too many stimulants
but<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.060> works<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.630> contains

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
but it works because it contains

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.560 
but it works because it contains
substances<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.550> promote<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.420> production

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
substances that promote the production

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.139 
substances that promote the production
of<00:00:33.960> energy<00:00:34.140> or<00:00:34.559> participate<00:00:35.520> in<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> energy

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
of energy or participate in the energy

explain to them how bad the drain
immoral<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> why<00:01:16.110> don't<00:01:16.350> we<00:01:16.500> use<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.920> we

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
immoral is and why don't we use it we

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.149 
immoral is and why don't we use it we
don't<00:01:18.030> use<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.390> as<00:01:19.020> far<00:01:19.619> as<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.130> am

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
don't use it because as far as I am

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.270 
don't use it because as far as I am
aware<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.939> geranium<00:01:21.390> oil<00:01:21.770> there<00:01:22.770> isn't

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
aware of the geranium oil there isn't

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.070 
aware of the geranium oil there isn't
enough<00:01:23.549> scientific<00:01:23.939> evidence<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> way

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
enough scientific evidence of the way

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.719 
enough scientific evidence of the way
that<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> works<00:01:25.530> its<00:01:25.890> mechanism<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.580> action

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that it works its mechanism of action

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.060 
that it works its mechanism of action
and<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:27.990> substances<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and we don't want to use substances that

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.149 
and we don't want to use substances that
are<00:01:29.100> not<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:30.119> well<00:01:30.450> studied<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> there

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
are not very well studied and there

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.440 
are not very well studied and there
isn't<00:01:32.430> enough<00:01:32.729> experience<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.810> them<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.970> we

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
isn't enough experience with them now we

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
isn't enough experience with them now we
really<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.470> using<00:01:37.979> substances<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.880> are

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really are using substances that are

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.060 
really are using substances that are
very<00:01:39.329> safe<00:01:39.659> such<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.079> creating<00:01:40.290> monohydrate

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
which gives plenty of energy for work

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.200 
which gives plenty of energy for work
out<00:01:57.649> in<00:01:58.649> addition<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> beta<00:01:59.759> alanine

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
out in addition to this the beta alanine

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
out in addition to this the beta alanine
which<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.600> precursor<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.170> carnosine<00:02:01.939> also

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
which is a precursor of carnosine also

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.819 
which is a precursor of carnosine also
buffers<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> lactate<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.259> gives<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
buffers the lactate so it gives a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.790 
buffers the lactate so it gives a
superior<00:02:05.399> recovery

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
superior recovery

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.910 
superior recovery
no<00:02:08.220> also<00:02:09.060> we're<00:02:09.420> using<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.720> carbon<00:02:10.140> obviously

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
no also we're using a carbon obviously

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.650 
no also we're using a carbon obviously
we<00:02:11.220> have<00:02:11.490> the<00:02:11.640> trademark<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.270> patent<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.600> a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
carbon were the inventors of it but you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040 
carbon were the inventors of it but you
know<00:02:14.580> explain<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> little<00:02:15.360> bit<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.720> difference

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
know explain a little bit the difference

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.360 
know explain a little bit the difference
of<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.200> car<00:02:16.440> plant<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.770> how<00:02:16.830> effective<00:02:17.280> it

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
of the car plant and how effective it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
of the car plant and how effective it
actually<00:02:17.700> works<00:02:17.940> carpooling<00:02:18.900> is<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> great<00:02:19.350> car

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
actually works carpooling is a great car

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.270 
actually works carpooling is a great car
