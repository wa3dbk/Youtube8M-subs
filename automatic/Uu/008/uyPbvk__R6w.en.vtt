00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
can see I've been losing every single

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.100 
can see I've been losing every single
time<00:00:45.989> even<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.370> minus<00:00:47.940> 11<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.690> you'll<00:00:48.899> see

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
even worse further down I think there's

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.400 
even worse further down I think there's
a<00:00:51.329> minus<00:00:51.539> 32<00:00:52.550> there<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.820> minus<00:00:54.360> 32<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.930> PSC

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
a minus 32 there you go minus 32 to PSC
