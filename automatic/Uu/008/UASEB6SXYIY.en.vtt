minecraft shaders they all have this I
don't<00:00:37.469> know<00:00:37.559> if<00:00:37.680> they're<00:00:37.829> keeping<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.610 
what so yeah I've been going through
this<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.730> couldn't<00:00:42.390> find<00:00:42.540> default<00:00:43.020> because

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
this I couldn't find default because

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
this I couldn't find default because
eventually<00:00:44.219> you'll<00:00:44.370> get<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.969> looks

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
eventually you'll get to one that looks

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.950 
eventually you'll get to one that looks
like<00:00:45.270> default<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.960> eventually

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
like default but it's not and eventually

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 
like default but it's not and eventually
I<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.559> looked<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.980> forums<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.670> that's

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
I just looked on the forums and that's

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.400 
I just looked on the forums and that's
where<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.289> go<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> step<00:00:53.190> 1<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.899> first<00:00:55.140> note

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
where we go to step 1 so the first note

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.990 
where we go to step 1 so the first note
in<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.770> little<00:00:56.489> episode<00:00:57.050> um<00:00:58.050> if<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> hit<00:00:59.430> f4

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.819 
in this little episode um if you hit f4
on<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.329> keyboard<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.899> switches<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.469> back<00:01:01.649> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
hit f4 bang I'm back to normal

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.810 
hit f4 bang I'm back to normal
um<00:01:15.590> too<00:01:16.729> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.939> notice<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.229> stand<00:01:19.560> right

fly<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:31.549> you'll<00:01:32.549> notice<00:01:32.790> trees<00:01:33.329> such<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.869> right

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
fly up you'll notice trees such it right

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.630 
fly up you'll notice trees such it right
over<00:01:34.680> here<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.130> area

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
over here in this area

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.910 
over here in this area
they<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.329> look<00:01:36.600> blurry<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.259> like<00:01:37.500> something's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
they all look blurry it like something's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
they all look blurry it like something's
wrong<00:01:38.189> or<00:01:38.460> there's<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.850> shader<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.540> still

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
wrong or there's like a shader on still

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.100 
wrong or there's like a shader on still
so<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.890> course<00:01:41.070> look<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:41.880> too<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.390> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
so of course look that up too and that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
so of course look that up too and that
has<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.439> do<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:43.860> new<00:01:44.130> video<00:01:44.670> setting

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
has to do with this new video setting

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.929 
has to do with this new video setting
called<00:01:45.210> mipmap<00:01:45.689> now<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.310> like<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> blur

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
called mipmap now I don't like this blur

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.569 
called mipmap now I don't like this blur
so<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.990> change<00:01:49.350> this<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.560> off<00:01:49.829> hit<00:01:50.310> done

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
so I just change this to off hit done

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
so I just change this to off hit done
done<00:01:51.149> back<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.899> game<00:01:52.200> new<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:53.070> freeze

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
done back to game new game will freeze

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.609 
done back to game new game will freeze
for<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.579> second<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.840> then<00:01:54.990> I'll<00:01:55.110> go<00:01:55.290> back<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
for a second but then I'll go back to

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
for a second but then I'll go back to
normal<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.659> now<00:01:57.659> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.140> look<00:01:58.430> we<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.610> no

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
normal and now if you look we get no

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
normal and now if you look we get no
blur<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.719> fancy

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
blur it's all fancy

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.550 
blur it's all fancy
I<00:02:01.469> guess<00:02:02.430> mipmap<00:02:02.939> could<00:02:03.210> also<00:02:03.390> help<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.960> lag<00:02:04.200> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I guess mipmap could also help for lag I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.130 
I guess mipmap could also help for lag I

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
you can notice the like black selector

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.300 
you can notice the like black selector
bar<00:04:39.880> if<00:04:40.030> I<00:04:40.150> hit<00:04:40.360> T<00:04:40.840> right<00:04:41.410> around<00:04:41.740> this<00:04:41.949> block

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
bar if I hit T right around this block

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.850
