probably going to be coming out
September<00:01:13.340> why<00:01:14.340> because<00:01:15.470> if<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> look<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
September why because if you look at the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.530 
September why because if you look at the
previous<00:01:17.820> dates<00:01:18.210> for<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.140> ipod<00:01:19.799> touch<00:01:20.540> 2nd

previous dates for the ipod touch 2nd

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.780 
previous dates for the ipod touch 2nd
gen<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> first<00:01:22.200> gen<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.560> both<00:01:22.920> came<00:01:23.400> out<00:01:23.610> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
gen the first gen they both came out in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
gen the first gen they both came out in
September<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.299> think<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.750> cannot<00:01:24.990> September

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
September I think one cannot September

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.310 
September I think one cannot September
fourth<00:01:25.770> other<00:01:25.979> came<00:01:26.250> out<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.490> September<00:01:27.320> 6th

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
fourth other came out like September 6th

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
or 16th I don't remember and this most

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.649 
or 16th I don't remember and this most
likely<00:01:33.869> means<00:01:34.110> ipod<00:01:34.619> touch<00:01:35.119> 3g<00:01:36.119> will<00:01:36.810> come<00:01:37.049> out
