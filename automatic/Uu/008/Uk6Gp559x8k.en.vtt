00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080 
bit straighter than the other trees but
I'm<00:02:37.959> not<00:02:38.110> seeing<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.560> a<00:02:38.709> fake<00:02:39.610> patter<00:02:39.849> on

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
I'm not seeing that a fake patter on

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.580 
I'm not seeing that a fake patter on
these<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.540> she<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.840> are<00:02:41.050> kind<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.380> similar

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
these that she is are kind of similar

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.770 
these that she is are kind of similar
they're<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.130> like<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:43.300> don't<00:02:43.390> really<00:02:43.630> have

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
they're just like you don't really have

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.600 
they're just like you don't really have
any<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:47.160> currently<00:02:48.160> length<00:02:48.370> you<00:02:48.519> like

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
any you know currently length you like

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.809 
any you know currently length you like
these<00:02:49.030> other<00:02:49.239> ones<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.750> they<00:02:49.900> have<00:02:50.519> these<00:02:51.519> sort

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
these other ones so they have these sort

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.110 
these other ones so they have these sort
of<00:02:52.769> indentations<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:53.980> side<00:02:54.280> like<00:02:54.640> cuts

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
of indentations on the side like cuts

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.259 
of indentations on the side like cuts
and<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:55.599> know<00:02:56.349> just<00:02:56.530> a<00:02:56.910> three-three<00:02:57.910> pad<00:02:58.120> at

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
and you know just a three-three pad at

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.420 
and you know just a three-three pad at
three<00:02:58.480> leaf<00:02:58.630> pattern

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
three leaf pattern

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.210 
three leaf pattern
she<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> I've<00:03:00.849> noticing<00:03:01.329> here<00:03:01.950> from<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.069> two

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
she is I've noticing here from the two

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.210 
she is I've noticing here from the two
that<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.430> bought<00:03:03.640> they're<00:03:03.970> just<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.269> single<00:03:04.870> leaf

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that I bought they're just a single leaf

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.870 
that I bought they're just a single leaf
it's<00:03:06.220> kind<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.519> hard<00:03:06.700> to<00:03:08.069> look<00:03:09.069> look<00:03:09.370> at<00:03:09.549> it<00:03:09.730> and

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
it's kind of hard to look look at it and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.729 
it's kind of hard to look look at it and
tell<00:03:10.150> if<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.510> fake<00:03:10.720> because<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:11.380> leaf<00:03:11.530> is

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
tell if it's a fake because the leaf is

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.170 
tell if it's a fake because the leaf is
so<00:03:11.890> different<00:03:12.099> than<00:03:12.340> most<00:03:12.519> things<00:03:13.769> but<00:03:14.769> anyway

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
so different than most things but anyway

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.789 
so different than most things but anyway
I<00:03:16.799> recommend<00:03:17.940> maybe<00:03:18.940> getting<00:03:19.360> the<00:03:19.799> expedited

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
I recommend maybe getting the expedited

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.599 
I recommend maybe getting the expedited
shipping<00:03:21.420> because<00:03:22.420> uh<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.920> took<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.459> little

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
shipping because uh you took a little

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.530 
shipping because uh you took a little
bit<00:03:24.730> more<00:03:24.910> than<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.359> week<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:26.620> get<00:03:26.769> here<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:28.450> in

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
bit more than a week to get here one in

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.990 
bit more than a week to get here one in
a<00:03:28.600> couple<00:03:28.900> days

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
a couple days
