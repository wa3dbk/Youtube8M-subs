really<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.650> body<00:00:19.920> that's<00:00:20.250> this

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
really that the body that's this

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.759 
really that the body that's this
different<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.480> outset<00:00:21.930> really

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
different on that on the outset really

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
different on that on the outset really
there's<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.279> lot<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.460> changes<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.269> car<00:00:24.449> so

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
there's a lot of changes to the car so

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.689 
there's a lot of changes to the car so
we're<00:00:24.990> trying<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.160> balance<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
we're trying to to get a balance on it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.250 
we're trying to to get a balance on it
but<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.029> were<00:00:27.150> we<00:00:27.420> were<00:00:27.510> positive<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:28.080> what

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
but we were we were positive about what

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
but we were we were positive about what
we<00:00:28.320> learned<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.650> test<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.160> think<00:00:29.340> we'll

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we learned to the test and I think we'll

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
we learned to the test and I think we'll
be<00:00:29.519> strong<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.150> certainly<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.929> able<00:00:31.199> to

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
be strong and certainly be able to

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
be strong and certainly be able to
challenge<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.250> another<00:00:32.520> win<00:00:32.669> for<00:00:32.730> three

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090

years<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.450> row<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:34.110> really<00:00:34.350> looking

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
years in a row I'm really looking

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.770 
years in a row I'm really looking
forward<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.280> back<00:00:35.430> there<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.329> great

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
forward to going back there it's a great

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.040 
forward to going back there it's a great
facility<00:00:36.989> beautiful<00:00:37.829> track<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.719> last<00:00:39.719> year

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
facility beautiful track and last year

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.130 
facility beautiful track and last year
we<00:00:40.460> came<00:00:41.460> so<00:00:41.670> close<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.910> winning<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.300> race<00:00:42.660> so

we came so close to winning that race so

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.290 
we came so close to winning that race so
I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:44.190> everyone<00:00:44.670> from<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> team<00:00:45.149> is

I think everyone from the team is
looking<00:00:45.390> forward<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.739> into<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.920> race

and with Brian on board this year I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
and with Brian on board this year I
think<00:00:50.340> we've<00:00:50.610> got<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> great<00:00:51.210> driver<00:00:51.600> line-up

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
think we've got a great driver line-up

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.540 
think we've got a great driver line-up
and<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> good<00:00:53.070> chance<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.430> doing

pretty special was two years in the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
pretty special was two years in the
workings<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.390> good<00:01:42.540> place

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
workings and it's a it's a good place

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
workings and it's a it's a good place
for<00:01:42.990> our<00:01:43.049> car<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.560> got<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> straightaways

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
for our car just got the straightaways

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.100 
for our car just got the straightaways
that<00:01:44.790> don't<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.119> suit<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.659> our<00:01:45.750> cars<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
that don't really suit what our cars to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
that don't really suit what our cars to
best<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.310> got<00:01:47.460> some<00:01:47.640> great<00:01:47.880> high-speed

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
best but it's got some great high-speed

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
best but it's got some great high-speed
s<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> hills<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.920> got<00:01:50.369> some

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
s is going up the hills and got some

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.950 
s is going up the hills and got some
really<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.820> break<00:01:51.090> zones<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:51.869> we

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
really good break zones and I think we

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.389 
really good break zones and I think we
can<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.229> take<00:01:52.500> advantage<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
can really take advantage of with the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.450 
can really take advantage of with the

yes<00:02:01.160> just<00:02:02.120> couldn't<00:02:02.840> quite<00:02:03.590> bring<00:02:03.830> it<00:02:03.980> to

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
yes just couldn't quite bring it to

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.700 
yes just couldn't quite bring it to
victory<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:04.690> yeah<00:02:05.690> we're<00:02:06.260> looking<00:02:06.500> forward

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
victory but yeah we're looking forward

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.280 
victory but yeah we're looking forward
to<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.190> new<00:02:07.310> car<00:02:07.550> is<00:02:07.820> a<00:02:07.900> little<00:02:08.900> bit<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.170> a

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
to it the new car is a little bit of a

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.810 
to it the new car is a little bit of a
challenge<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:09.979> think<00:02:10.460> we're<00:02:10.580> getting<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
challenge but I think we're getting to

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.550 
challenge but I think we're getting to
sort<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.120> out<00:02:11.210> and<00:02:11.540> we're<00:02:11.930> looking<00:02:12.200> forward<00:02:12.410> to

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
sort it out and we're looking forward to

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.650 
sort it out and we're looking forward to
it<00:02:12.680> can't<00:02:12.890> wait<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.820> year's<00:02:14.060> range<00:02:14.330> is<00:02:14.480> going

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
it can't wait this year's range is going

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.420 
it can't wait this year's range is going
to<00:02:14.720> be<00:02:14.810> in<00:02:14.930> April<00:02:15.290> I've<00:02:15.500> never<00:02:15.770> raced<00:02:16.010> there<00:02:16.340> in

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
to be in April I've never raced there in

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.420 
to be in April I've never raced there in
april<00:02:16.580> but<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:17.000> know<00:02:17.090> Tom<00:02:17.450> long<00:02:17.720> has<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.430> he's

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
april but I know Tom long has and he's

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.010 
april but I know Tom long has and he's
about<00:02:19.580> as<00:02:19.760> good<00:02:19.850> as<00:02:20.000> anybody<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:20.660> get<00:02:20.900> in

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
about as good as anybody you can get in

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.230 
about as good as anybody you can get in
any<00:02:21.170> car<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.410> any<00:02:21.620> track<00:02:21.950> especially<00:02:22.550> at<00:02:22.910> vir

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
any car in any track especially at vir

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.090 
any car in any track especially at vir
so<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.990> don't<00:02:24.350> think<00:02:24.440> it's<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.800> make<00:02:24.890> much

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
so I don't think it's going to make much

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.620 
so I don't think it's going to make much
difference<00:02:25.370> but<00:02:25.700> whatever<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.060> was<00:02:26.120> will<00:02:26.510> make

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
difference but whatever it was will make

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.860 
difference but whatever it was will make
sure<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.930> Tom<00:02:27.080> makes<00:02:27.380> up<00:02:27.560> for<00:02:27.770> it
