okay viewers in a couple previous videos

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.679 
okay viewers in a couple previous videos
I<00:00:02.310> showed<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:02.909> take<00:00:03.090> apart<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
I showed you how to take apart the

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.070 
I showed you how to take apart the
inside<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.500> baby<00:00:04.859> freewheel<00:00:05.370> take<00:00:06.089> apart<00:00:06.509> take

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
inside a baby freewheel take apart take

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.750 
inside a baby freewheel take apart take
the<00:00:07.200> bearings<00:00:07.500> out<00:00:07.710> clean<00:00:08.220> it<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> little<00:00:08.610> bit

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
the bearings out clean it a little bit

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.700 
the bearings out clean it a little bit
put<00:00:08.940> it<00:00:09.000> all<00:00:09.059> back<00:00:09.210> together<00:00:09.410> but<00:00:10.410> I've<00:00:10.530> had<00:00:10.679> a

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
put it all back together but I've had a

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.169 
put it all back together but I've had a
few<00:00:10.920> viewers<00:00:11.250> ask<00:00:11.490> about<00:00:11.759> how<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> take<00:00:12.059> apart

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
few viewers ask about how to take apart

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.390 
few viewers ask about how to take apart
at<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> outside<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> freewheel<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.830> take

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
at the outside of a freewheel to take

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.519 
at the outside of a freewheel to take
the<00:00:14.580> cogs<00:00:14.880> off<00:00:15.210> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.750> freewheel<00:00:16.049> body<00:00:16.289> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
the cogs off of the freewheel body and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.950 
the cogs off of the freewheel body and
so<00:00:16.710> let<00:00:16.830> me<00:00:16.920> show<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.130> how<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.250> do<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.550> today

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
so let me show you how to do that today

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.240 
so let me show you how to do that today
before<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.199> let<00:00:19.980> me<00:00:20.010> talk<00:00:20.189> about

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
before I do that let me talk about

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.580 
before I do that let me talk about
there's<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.760> lot<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.210> variation<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.199> free

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
there's a lot of variation in free

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.310 
there's a lot of variation in free
wheels<00:00:22.890> from<00:00:23.609> brand<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.210> model<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.779> so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
wheels from brand and model and so

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.390 
wheels from brand and model and so
they're<00:00:25.470> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> come<00:00:25.769> apart<00:00:26.099> like

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
they're going to come apart like

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.269 
they're going to come apart like
slightly<00:00:27.000> differently<00:00:27.359> from<00:00:28.039> freewheel<00:00:29.039> free

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
slightly differently from freewheel free

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.730 
slightly differently from freewheel free
will<00:00:29.460> for<00:00:30.359> example<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.990> one<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.500> has<00:00:31.710> a

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
will for example this one here has a

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.010 
will for example this one here has a
lock<00:00:32.099> ring<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.149> there's<00:00:33.780> little

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
lock ring on here and there's little

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
lock ring on here and there's little
notches<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.219> would<00:00:35.450> need<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
notches in here and so you would need a

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.590 
notches in here and so you would need a
special<00:00:37.200> tool<00:00:37.370> that<00:00:38.370> fits<00:00:38.610> hiss<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.390> take

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
special tool that fits hiss here to take

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
special tool that fits hiss here to take
that<00:00:39.980> lock<00:00:40.980> ring<00:00:41.219> off<00:00:42.020> now<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> one<00:00:43.530> here

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that lock ring off now on this one here

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.889 
that lock ring off now on this one here
this<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.340> else<00:00:44.700> has<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> lock<00:00:45.180> ring<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.690> it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
this one else has a lock ring and it's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:46.970 
this one else has a lock ring and it's
kind<00:00:46.020> notches<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.350> there<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.680> would<00:00:46.800> need

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
kind notches in there but you would need

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.000 
kind notches in there but you would need
a<00:00:47.190> completely<00:00:47.700> different<00:00:48.140> tool<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.829> remove

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a completely different tool to remove

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.299 
a completely different tool to remove
this<00:00:50.610> lock<00:00:50.910> ring<00:00:51.180> here<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.530> next<00:00:52.800> two

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
this lock ring here then the next two

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.510 
this lock ring here then the next two
are<00:00:54.320> differently<00:00:55.320> different<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.370> if

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
are differently different here that if

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.400 
are differently different here that if
they<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.030> lock<00:00:57.210> rings<00:00:57.480> exactly

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
they don't have the lock rings exactly

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.130 
they don't have the lock rings exactly
they<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.640> this<00:00:59.640> cog<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> smallest<00:01:00.840> cog

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
they have this cog here the smallest cog

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.960 
they have this cog here the smallest cog
on<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> one<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:02.960> threaded<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.610> rest

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
on this one is threaded on and the rest

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
on this one is threaded on and the rest
these<00:01:06.150> here<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:07.710> splined<00:01:09.170> cog<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.470> they're

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
these here are a splined cog so they're

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
these here are a splined cog so they're
sitting<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> freewheel<00:01:11.820> there<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.420> just

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
sitting on the freewheel there they just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.480 
sitting on the freewheel there they just
slide<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.799> this<00:01:13.950> smallest<00:01:14.400> cog<00:01:14.880> here

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
slide on and then this smallest cog here

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.620 
slide on and then this smallest cog here
screws<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> hold<00:01:18.090> everything<00:01:18.390> together

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
screws on to hold everything together

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
screws on to hold everything together
sometimes<00:01:19.290> it'll<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.770> smallest<00:01:20.100> cog

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
sometimes it'll be the smallest cog

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.140 
sometimes it'll be the smallest cog
sometimes<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.750> two<00:01:22.619> smallest<00:01:23.040> cogs<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.880> be

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
sometimes the two smallest cogs will be

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.560 
sometimes the two smallest cogs will be
one<00:01:24.600> unit<00:01:24.900> together<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.920> thread<00:01:26.369> off

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
one unit together that will thread off

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.359 
one unit together that will thread off
now<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> one<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.650> believe<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> also

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
now this one here I believe is also

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.580 
now this one here I believe is also
threaded<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.930> remove<00:01:31.049> this<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.470> like

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
threaded I can remove this there's like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.230 
threaded I can remove this there's like
a<00:01:31.650> little<00:01:31.799> uh<00:01:32.210> dust<00:01:33.210> cap<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> goes<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.680> and

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
a little uh dust cap here it goes on and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.210 
a little uh dust cap here it goes on and
and<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.360> believe<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.920> probably

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and I believe on this one it's probably

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.539 
and I believe on this one it's probably
these<00:01:38.820> two<00:01:39.329> smallest<00:01:39.930> cogs<00:01:40.409> need<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.400> be

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
these two smallest cogs need to be

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.590 
these two smallest cogs need to be
removed<00:01:41.970> together<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:43.259> would<00:01:44.149> do<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
removed together they would do that and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.569 
removed together they would do that and
then<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> rest<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:47.100> probably<00:01:47.430> come

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
then the rest of it would probably come

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.149 
then the rest of it would probably come
off<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.500> anyway<00:01:49.710> I'm<00:01:49.829> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.009> show<00:01:50.130> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
off so but anyway I'm going to show you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.780 
off so but anyway I'm going to show you
how<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.490> take<00:01:50.970> apart<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.170> here

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
how to take apart this one right here

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.999 
how to take apart this one right here
I'm<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> use<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.840> chain<00:01:55.140> whip<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.710> hold

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
I'm going to use one chain whip to hold

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.420 
I'm going to use one chain whip to hold
the<00:01:56.790> cogs<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:58.110> keep<00:01:58.530> them<00:01:58.710> from<00:01:58.860> turning<00:01:59.280> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the cogs here keep them from turning and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.889 
the cogs here keep them from turning and
I'm<00:01:59.549> gonna<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.790> another<00:01:59.939> chain<00:02:00.240> whip<00:02:00.390> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I'm gonna use another chain whip to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm gonna use another chain whip to
unscrew<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.130> smallest<00:02:02.399> cog<00:02:02.700> here<00:02:03.110> like<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
unscrew the smallest cog here like I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.800 
unscrew the smallest cog here like I
said<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.860> possible<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.240> smallest<00:02:06.600> cog

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
said it's possible that the smallest cog

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.219 
said it's possible that the smallest cog
and<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> next<00:02:07.380> most<00:02:07.500> cog<00:02:07.799> may<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:09.060> one<00:02:09.690> unit<00:02:09.929> so

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
and the next most cog may be one unit so

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.210 
and the next most cog may be one unit so
you<00:02:10.259> don't<00:02:10.590> want<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.830> try<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.039> hold<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.700> next

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
you don't want to try to hold the next

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.550 
you don't want to try to hold the next
smiles<00:02:12.730> cog<00:02:13.000> there<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.900> I'm<00:02:14.230> going<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.410> hold

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
smiles cog there so I'm going to hold

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.480 
smiles cog there so I'm going to hold
one<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> larger<00:02:15.550> cogs<00:02:15.990> so<00:02:16.990> grab<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.740> and

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
one of the larger cogs so grab that and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.580 
one of the larger cogs so grab that and
then<00:02:19.300> let<00:02:19.420> me<00:02:19.510> use<00:02:19.630> another<00:02:19.660> chain<00:02:20.170> whip<00:02:20.350> here

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
then let me use another chain whip here

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.260 
then let me use another chain whip here
and<00:02:20.830> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.250> have<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> couple<00:02:21.760> heavy-duty

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
and if you have a couple heavy-duty

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.260 
and if you have a couple heavy-duty
chain<00:02:22.420> whips<00:02:22.990> that'd<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:24.010> good<00:02:24.220> because<00:02:24.400> this

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
chain whips that'd be good because this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.620 
chain whips that'd be good because this
can<00:02:26.110> take<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.250> lot<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:28.740> force<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> try<00:02:30.250> to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
can take a lot of force to try to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
can take a lot of force to try to
unscrew<00:02:31.630> these<00:02:31.960> because<00:02:32.260> they<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.530> be<00:02:32.620> very

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
unscrew these because they can be very

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.020 
unscrew these because they can be very
tight<00:02:32.980> they're<00:02:33.130> self<00:02:33.340> tightening<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.910> as

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
tight they're self tightening so as

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
tight they're self tightening so as
you're<00:02:34.180> writing<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.740> being<00:02:36.040> turned

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
you're writing this is being turned

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.960 
you're writing this is being turned
clockwise<00:02:38.050> which<00:02:38.770> is<00:02:39.010> basically<00:02:39.670> tightening

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
clockwise which is basically tightening

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
clockwise which is basically tightening
it<00:02:40.240> on<00:02:40.360> there<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.900> so<00:02:41.830> these<00:02:41.980> can<00:02:42.190> be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
it on there and so these can be

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.480 
it on there and so these can be
extremely<00:02:42.790> tight<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:43.800> I'm<00:02:44.800> use<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.190> here

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
extremely tight and so I'm use this here

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:52.850 
extremely tight and so I'm use this here
to<00:02:45.700> just<00:02:45.970> unscrew<00:02:46.270> the<00:02:46.420> smallest<00:02:46.860> cog<00:02:47.860> here

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.770 

there<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.400> got<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.670> turning<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.660> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
there so I got that turning and then I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:06.230 
there so I got that turning and then I
can<00:02:59.790> unscrew<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:03.090> little<00:03:04.090> tight<00:03:05.130> and

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
can unscrew this here little tight and

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.820 
can unscrew this here little tight and
just<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.390> smallest<00:03:07.690> cogs<00:03:07.990> turning<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.530> the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
just the smallest cogs turning this the

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.140 
just the smallest cogs turning this the
next<00:03:09.280> cog<00:03:09.780> second<00:03:10.780> cog<00:03:10.930> is<00:03:11.110> not<00:03:11.260> turning<00:03:12.150> so

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
next cog second cog is not turning so

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.170 
next cog second cog is not turning so
this<00:03:13.390> is<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:15.340> separate<00:03:15.820> unit<00:03:16.120> here<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:19.150> I

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
this is just one separate unit here so I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.820 
this is just one separate unit here so I
got<00:03:19.360> that<00:03:19.570> off<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:22.050> so<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.140> spacers<00:03:23.530> actually

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
got that off and so the spacers actually

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.300 
got that off and so the spacers actually
built<00:03:24.070> into<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.970> cog<00:03:25.300> here<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.190> then<00:03:27.190> it

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
built into this cog here and then it

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.490 
built into this cog here and then it
looks<00:03:27.490> like<00:03:27.700> these<00:03:28.180> will<00:03:28.420> just<00:03:28.570> come<00:03:28.810> off<00:03:29.020> here

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
looks like these will just come off here

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.590 
looks like these will just come off here
so<00:03:29.530> this<00:03:29.830> is<00:03:30.010> just<00:03:30.160> comes<00:03:30.310> on<00:03:30.490> there<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:30.970> I

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
so this is just comes on there and I

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.320 
so this is just comes on there and I
notice<00:03:31.840> there's<00:03:31.960> like<00:03:32.760> little<00:03:33.760> directional

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
notice there's like little directional

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.780 
notice there's like little directional
teeth<00:03:34.540> there<00:03:36.450> spacer<00:03:39.450> another<00:03:40.450> cog<00:03:41.790> another

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
teeth there spacer another cog another

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.170 
teeth there spacer another cog another
spacer<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.530> noticed<00:03:44.800> this<00:03:44.920> spacer<00:03:45.820> here<00:03:46.090> is

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
spacer and I noticed this spacer here is

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.580 
spacer and I noticed this spacer here is
just<00:03:46.420> a<00:03:46.480> little<00:03:46.690> bit<00:03:46.780> larger<00:03:47.080> diameter<00:03:47.560> than

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
just a little bit larger diameter than

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.680 
just a little bit larger diameter than
there<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:49.000> I'm<00:03:49.090> trying<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.390> keep<00:03:49.510> these<00:03:49.660> in

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
there so I'm trying to keep these in

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.290 
there so I'm trying to keep these in
order<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.530> can<00:03:50.650> put<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:50.860> back<00:03:50.950> together

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
order so that I can put it back together

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.620 
order so that I can put it back together
another<00:03:52.300> cog<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.790> another<00:03:54.790> spacer<00:03:55.270> again

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
another cog and another spacer again

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.070 
another cog and another spacer again
this<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:55.990> a<00:03:56.020> little<00:03:56.200> bit<00:03:56.320> a<00:03:57.510> thinner<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.930> it's

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
this is a little bit a thinner but it's

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.160 
this is a little bit a thinner but it's
a<00:03:59.110> larger<00:03:59.500> diameter<00:04:00.450> then<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.690> previous

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
a larger diameter then the previous

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.210 
a larger diameter then the previous
spacer<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:05.490> pull<00:04:06.490> this<00:04:06.640> off<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:08.220> another

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
spacer is a pull this off and another

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.760 
spacer is a pull this off and another
spacer<00:04:09.760> and<00:04:10.470> then<00:04:11.470> I<00:04:11.530> have<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:13.500> biggest<00:04:14.500> cog

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
spacer and then I have the biggest cog

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.039 
spacer and then I have the biggest cog
there<00:04:15.070> and<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:15.550> here<00:04:15.970> is<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.450> freewheel<00:04:16.810> body

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
there and so here is the freewheel body

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.140 
there and so here is the freewheel body
here<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:18.310> now<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.489> put<00:04:18.549> it<00:04:18.670> all<00:04:18.820> back<00:04:18.970> together

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
here so now to put it all back together

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.789 
here so now to put it all back together
I'm<00:04:19.570> just<00:04:19.630> going<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.900> go<00:04:20.020> ahead<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.470> put<00:04:20.710> it

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
I'm just going to go ahead and put it

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.040 
I'm just going to go ahead and put it
back<00:04:21.729> together<00:04:21.880> in<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.330> opposite<00:04:22.810> of<00:04:22.840> where<00:04:23.020> I

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
back together in the opposite of where I

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.600 
back together in the opposite of where I
take<00:04:23.200> apart

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
take apart

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.950 
take apart
if<00:04:24.969> you<00:04:25.150> have<00:04:25.710> multiple<00:04:27.749> freewheels<00:04:28.749> it's

flopping<00:05:20.589> around<00:05:21.210> so<00:05:27.479> it's<00:05:28.479> kind<00:05:28.629> of<00:05:28.689> nice<00:05:28.779> if

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
flopping around so it's kind of nice if

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.589 
flopping around so it's kind of nice if
you<00:05:29.050> can<00:05:29.110> get<00:05:29.259> the<00:05:29.409> chain<00:05:30.219> whips<00:05:30.460> kind<00:05:30.969> of<00:05:31.060> kind

you can get the chain whips kind of kind

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.269 
you can get the chain whips kind of kind
of<00:05:31.659> close<00:05:31.839> together<00:05:32.050> a<00:05:32.229> smaller<00:05:32.589> angle<00:05:32.949> here

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
of close together a smaller angle here

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.529 
of close together a smaller angle here
like<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.520> because<00:05:33.729> then<00:05:33.879> you<00:05:33.969> had<00:05:34.180> a<00:05:34.210> whole

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:34.539 
like that because then you had a whole

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.010 
like that because then you had a whole
them<00:05:35.349> tied<00:05:36.279> together<00:05:36.460> with<00:05:36.909> more<00:05:37.689> leverage

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
them tied together with more leverage

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.339 
them tied together with more leverage
like<00:05:38.319> this<00:05:39.569> and<00:05:40.569> get<00:05:40.719> that<00:05:40.839> on<00:05:41.020> there<00:05:41.169> nice<00:05:41.289> and

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349
