00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.760 

so<00:00:06.210> you<00:00:06.299> get<00:00:06.420> kind<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> bouncy<00:00:07.230> balls<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
so you get kind of the bouncy balls and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
so you get kind of the bouncy balls and
they<00:00:07.830> interact<00:00:08.130> with<00:00:08.160> each<00:00:08.340> other<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
they interact with each other and

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.040 
they interact with each other and
they're<00:00:08.910> gonna<00:00:09.030> squish<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:09.660> compressed

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
they're gonna squish and compressed

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.959 
they're gonna squish and compressed
typical<00:00:10.830> rigid<00:00:11.099> bodies<00:00:11.340> don't<00:00:11.580> tend<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.820> do

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
typical rigid bodies don't tend to do

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:12.499 
typical rigid bodies don't tend to do
that

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
that

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.209 
that
so<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.230> kind<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.590> bouncy<00:00:14.040> ball

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
so you this kind of you know bouncy ball

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.890 
so you this kind of you know bouncy ball
kind<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.670> effect<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.120> one<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.780> nice

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
kind of effect so one of the nice

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.540 
kind of effect so one of the nice
properties<00:00:16.590> about<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.250> can<00:00:17.369> build

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
properties about this is you can build

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.939 
properties about this is you can build
shapes<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> objects<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.470> classic<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
shapes and objects that the classic to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.050 
shapes and objects that the classic to
couldn't<00:00:20.250> build<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.640> some<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.910> other

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
couldn't build with some of the other

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.189 
couldn't build with some of the other
primitives<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:21.689> build<00:00:21.840> your<00:00:21.930> Flex

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
primitives so you can build your Flex

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.970 
primitives so you can build your Flex
very<00:00:22.500> squishy<00:00:23.130> things<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.439> mentioned<00:00:28.769> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
very squishy things so I mentioned that

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.400 
very squishy things so I mentioned that
we<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> ability<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.880> combine

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
we have the ability to combine

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.780 
we have the ability to combine
simulation<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.560> destruction<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.610> have

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
simulation and destruction and they have

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.190 
simulation and destruction and they have
a<00:00:32.820> big<00:00:33.149> coupling<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.690> what<00:00:33.840> we're<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.079> do

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
a big coupling so what we're going to do

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.410 
a big coupling so what we're going to do
now<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.800> combine<00:00:35.130> our<00:00:35.430> rigid<00:00:35.700> body<00:00:35.850> simulation

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
now is combine our rigid body simulation

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.930 
now is combine our rigid body simulation
with<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> fluid<00:00:37.530> simulation<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.820> see

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
with the fluid simulation so you can see

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.400 
with the fluid simulation so you can see
the<00:00:39.059> rigid<00:00:39.329> body<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.780> or<00:00:39.930> after<00:00:40.140> each<00:00:40.260> other

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the rigid body thing or after each other

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.410 
the rigid body thing or after each other
big<00:00:40.620> bouncing<00:00:40.980> huge<00:00:41.100> rather<00:00:41.280> inclined<00:00:41.730> now

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
big bouncing huge rather inclined now

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.970 
big bouncing huge rather inclined now
we're<00:00:42.600> throwing<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.020> water<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.469> fluids<00:00:43.829> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
we're throwing in water in fluids the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
we're throwing in water in fluids the
water<00:00:44.160> displaces<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.760> rigid<00:00:45.059> bodies<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
water displaces the rigid bodies the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970 
water displaces the rigid bodies the
rigid<00:00:45.750> bodies<00:00:45.989> will<00:00:46.140> run<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.440> flash<00:00:46.649> around

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
rigid bodies will run this flash around

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.290 
rigid bodies will run this flash around
they<00:00:47.129> continue<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.550> collide<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:47.969> each<00:00:48.090> other

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
they continue to collide into each other

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.029 
they continue to collide into each other
and<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> super<00:00:49.920> high

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
and you can see this is super high

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
and you can see this is super high
performance<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:51.059> runs<00:00:51.270> super<00:00:51.420> fast<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> water

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
performance it runs super fast the water

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
performance it runs super fast the water
spaz<00:00:52.620> where<00:00:52.949> their<00:00:53.039> bodies<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.489> fast<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> all

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
spaz where their bodies are fast and all

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.160 
spaz where their bodies are fast and all
the<00:00:54.090> rigid<00:00:54.329> body<00:00:54.480> is<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> right

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the rigid body is going to do the right

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
the rigid body is going to do the right
thing<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.190> they<00:00:56.340> collide<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:56.940> stack

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thing you know they collide they stack

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.240 
thing you know they collide they stack
they<00:00:57.780> move<00:00:57.960> around<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.469> float<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:58.800> splash

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
they move around they float they splash

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.700 
they move around they float they splash
so<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> showing<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.440> couple<00:01:01.559> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
so this is kind of showing a couple of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.070 
so this is kind of showing a couple of
those<00:01:01.859> effects<00:01:02.370> right<00:01:02.780> two<00:01:03.780> different

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
those effects right two different

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
those effects right two different
classes<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.589> classic<00:01:05.400> physical<00:01:05.760> simulation

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
classes of classic physical simulation

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
classes of classic physical simulation
rigid<00:01:06.479> bodies<00:01:06.689> influence<00:01:07.110> interact<00:01:07.740> with

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
rigid bodies influence interact with

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.219 
rigid bodies influence interact with
each<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.400> truly<00:01:08.790> seamless<00:01:09.180> way<00:01:09.479> these

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
each other in a truly seamless way these

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.500 
each other in a truly seamless way these
kinds<00:01:10.439> of<00:01:10.590> things<00:01:10.740> are<00:01:11.210> plastic<00:01:12.210> they're<00:01:12.330> hard

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
kinds of things are plastic they're hard

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.120 
kinds of things are plastic they're hard
to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> new<00:01:13.560> flight<00:01:13.799> system

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
to do but in the new flight system

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.830 
to do but in the new flight system
they're<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.850> kind<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.090> work<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
they're just it just all kind of work so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.030 
they're just it just all kind of work so
if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.170> rigid<00:01:16.409> bodies<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.890> can

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
if you can get rigid bodies and you can

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.830 
if you can get rigid bodies and you can
do<00:01:17.100> fluid<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.610> let's<00:01:17.970> see<00:01:18.119> maybe<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.750> do

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
do fluid well let's see maybe you can do

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.390 
do fluid well let's see maybe you can do
clots<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.439> course<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.740> can<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.920> cloth<00:01:20.130> and

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
clots of course you can you cloth and

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.050 
clots of course you can you cloth and
you<00:01:20.490> can<00:01:20.640> bike<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.479> fluid<00:01:22.310> again<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.520> taking

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you can bike and fluid again just taking

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.550 
you can bike and fluid again just taking
a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.299> of<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:24.450> classically<00:01:25.049> separate

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
a lot of these classically separate

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
a lot of these classically separate
simulation<00:01:26.100> methodologies<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:26.970> allowing

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
simulation methodologies and allowing

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.640 
simulation methodologies and allowing
them<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.720> interact<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.049> each<00:01:28.200> other<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
them to interact with each other and you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.340 
them to interact with each other and you
kind<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.310> get<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> right<00:01:29.790> effect<00:01:30.509> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
kind of do you get the right effect and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.109 
kind of do you get the right effect and
this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> works<00:01:32.340> one<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this is it just kind of works one of the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.370 
this is it just kind of works one of the
really<00:01:33.360> cool<00:01:33.479> things<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> lot<00:01:34.079> of<00:01:34.290> this

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
really cool things about a lot of this

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
really cool things about a lot of this
stuff<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.740> because<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.520> unified

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
stuff is because it's this unified

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
stuff is because it's this unified
system<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.869> were<00:01:36.960> able<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.229> build<00:01:37.439> all<00:01:37.590> these

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
system we were able to build all these

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.859 
system we were able to build all these
things<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.250> like<00:01:38.939> little<00:01:39.150> display<00:01:39.570> an

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
things in like little display an

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.140 
things in like little display an
experiment<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:41.460> try<00:01:41.670> things<00:01:41.939> out<00:01:42.090> and

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
experiment we just try things out and

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.899 
experiment we just try things out and
you<00:01:42.960> know<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.530> just<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.040> works<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.700> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you know it's just it just works the the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.940 
you know it's just it just works the the
interaction<00:01:45.290> works<00:01:46.290> out<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> way<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> think

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
interaction works out the way to think

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
interaction works out the way to think
of<00:01:47.070> well<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> visual<00:01:47.729> effects<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
of well in the visual effects and the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.149 
of well in the visual effects and the
interplay<00:01:48.930> between<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.380> simulations<00:01:49.950> all

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
interplay between the simulations all

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
interplay between the simulations all
plan<00:01:50.579> actually<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.360> play<00:01:51.570> great<00:01:51.750> on

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
plan actually and they all play great on

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.030 
plan actually and they all play great on
the<00:01:51.930> GPU<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> one's<00:01:54.060> kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> fun<00:01:55.040> this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
the GPU so this one's kind of fun this

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.340 
the GPU so this one's kind of fun this
is<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.939> just

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
is we just

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.640 
is we just
swishy<00:01:57.740> product<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.250> a<00:01:58.369> deformable

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
swishy product this is a deformable

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.460 
swishy product this is a deformable
classically<00:02:00.650> doing<00:02:00.979> rubber<00:02:01.580> or<00:02:02.470> deformable

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
classically doing rubber or deformable

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.870 
classically doing rubber or deformable
kinds<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:03.860> objects<00:02:04.130> in<00:02:04.250> geometry<00:02:04.460> has<00:02:04.790> been

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
kinds of objects in geometry has been

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.940 
kinds of objects in geometry has been
pretty<00:02:05.210> hard<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:06.140> this<00:02:06.290> is<00:02:06.440> a<00:02:06.470> deformable

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
pretty hard so this is a deformable

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.010 
pretty hard so this is a deformable
object<00:02:07.400> this<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> little<00:02:08.270> guy<00:02:08.810> you

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
object this is you know a little guy you

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.110 
object this is you know a little guy you
can<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.739> know<00:02:09.830> move<00:02:09.979> around<00:02:10.100> he<00:02:10.550> squishes<00:02:10.910> he

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
can you know move around he squishes he

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.090 
can you know move around he squishes he
deforms<00:02:11.600> he<00:02:11.690> bends<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.290> they<00:02:12.620> kind<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.830> all<00:02:13.010> of

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
deforms he bends and they kind of all of

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.380 
deforms he bends and they kind of all of
those<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:13.610> thing<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:18.550> yeah<00:02:19.550> that<00:02:20.150> first

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
those the right thing so yeah that first

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.660 
those the right thing so yeah that first
sphere<00:02:20.510> devlin<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.230> saw<00:02:21.440> we<00:02:22.069> first<00:02:22.520> did

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
sphere devlin that you saw we first did

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.790 
sphere devlin that you saw we first did
that<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.930> was<00:02:24.020> pretty<00:02:24.170> cool<00:02:24.410> let<00:02:24.739> me

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
that but that was pretty cool let me

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160 
that but that was pretty cool let me
start<00:02:24.980> putting<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.370> water<00:02:25.670> and<00:02:26.030> then<00:02:26.600> you

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
start putting out water and then you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.410 
start putting out water and then you
know<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.440> as<00:02:27.890> usual<00:02:28.250> what<00:02:28.610> happens<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.060> he<00:02:29.239> not

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
know as as usual what happens is he not

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.390 
know as as usual what happens is he not
will<00:02:30.260> show<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.530> around<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.010> at<00:02:31.130> this<00:02:31.220> time<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
will show it around and at this time I

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.890 
will show it around and at this time I
was<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:31.940> guy<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> blame<00:02:32.330> like<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.690> know<00:02:32.750> what

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
was the guy to blame like you know what

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.690 
was the guy to blame like you know what
that's<00:02:33.319> pretty<00:02:33.530> cool<00:02:33.739> but<00:02:34.069> you<00:02:34.519> know<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
that's pretty cool but you know the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.860 
that's pretty cool but you know the
first<00:02:34.850> thing<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.150> think<00:02:35.360> of<00:02:35.420> when<00:02:35.480> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:35.630> of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
first thing I think of when I think of

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.240 
first thing I think of when I think of
skiers<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.410> then<00:02:36.530> see<00:02:36.680> water<00:02:36.890> after<00:02:37.130> this

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
skiers and then see water after this

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.370 
skiers and then see water after this
they<00:02:37.459> believe<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> water<00:02:38.120> balloons<00:02:38.450> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
they believe in water balloons the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.690 
they believe in water balloons the
innovators<00:02:39.709> heater<00:02:39.860> real-time<00:02:40.370> water

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
innovators heater real-time water

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
innovators heater real-time water
balloon<00:02:41.030> simulation<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:44.350> let's<00:02:45.350> try<00:02:45.560> so

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
balloon simulation and let's try so

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.000 
balloon simulation and let's try so
literally<00:02:46.819> you<00:02:47.420> know<00:02:47.540> they<00:02:48.080> whip<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.620> up<00:02:48.709> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
literally you know they whip it up and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.650 
literally you know they whip it up and
it<00:02:49.250> turns<00:02:49.400> out<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.880> you<00:02:50.060> can<00:02:50.209> make<00:02:50.390> water

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
it turns out that you can make water

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.620 
it turns out that you can make water
looks<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:51.500> just<00:02:51.709> kind<00:02:51.890> of<00:02:51.980> works<00:02:52.390> right<00:02:53.390> so

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
looks it all just kind of works right so

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.630 
looks it all just kind of works right so
you've<00:02:53.989> got<00:02:54.170> blue<00:02:54.680> there's<00:02:55.160> no<00:02:55.250> loop<00:02:55.400> water

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
you've got blue there's no loop water

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.400 
you've got blue there's no loop water
there's<00:02:56.030> pressure<00:02:56.390> they<00:02:56.720> react<00:02:57.049> you<00:02:57.319> know

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
there's pressure they react you know

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.860 
there's pressure they react you know
they<00:02:57.560> pop<00:02:57.769> holes<00:02:58.040> they<00:02:58.370> leak<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.760> work<00:02:59.090> you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
they pop holes they leak this work you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.470 
they pop holes they leak this work you
can<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.290> have<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.040> simulations<00:03:01.610> work<00:03:02.180> how

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
can just have the simulations work how

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.180 
can just have the simulations work how
you<00:03:02.540> think<00:03:02.930> they<00:03:03.079> should<00:03:03.260> work<00:03:03.440> they<00:03:03.950> bounce

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
you think they should work they bounce

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.130 
you think they should work they bounce
around<00:03:04.370> each<00:03:04.640> other<00:03:04.850> depending<00:03:05.480> on<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.959> hole

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
around each other depending on the hole

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.449 
around each other depending on the hole
that<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:06.320> pop<00:03:06.560> sometimes<00:03:06.829> they<00:03:07.130> were<00:03:07.190> remote

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
that you pop sometimes they were remote

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.490 
that you pop sometimes they were remote
but<00:03:07.640> sometimes<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.209> for<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:08.420> leaks<00:03:08.630> it<00:03:09.260> just

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
but sometimes it's for the leaks it just

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.870 
but sometimes it's for the leaks it just
kind<00:03:09.680> of<00:03:09.709> all<00:03:09.829> works<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.700> like

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
kind of all works and this is just like

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.610 
kind of all works and this is just like
this<00:03:11.239> is<00:03:11.299> not<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.780> demo<00:03:12.079> we<00:03:12.290> set<00:03:12.470> out<00:03:12.590> to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
this is not like a demo we set out to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.069 
this is not like a demo we set out to
build<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.850> something<00:03:14.450> that's<00:03:14.540> enabled

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
build this is something that's enabled

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.780 
build this is something that's enabled
by<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.320> Flex<00:03:15.680> technology<00:03:16.250> that<00:03:16.489> allows

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
by the Flex technology that allows

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.670 
by the Flex technology that allows
people<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.329> be<00:03:17.420> creative<00:03:17.840> with<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.230> we<00:03:18.560> just

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
people to be creative with it we just

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.289 
people to be creative with it we just
tried<00:03:18.980> this<00:03:19.130> out<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.579> it<00:03:19.700> turns<00:03:19.910> out<00:03:20.060> and<00:03:20.239> you

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
tried this out and it turns out and you

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.970 
tried this out and it turns out and you
know<00:03:20.359> what<00:03:20.450> you<00:03:20.600> can<00:03:20.810> do<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.739> can

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
know what you can do that you can

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.069 
know what you can do that you can
actually<00:03:22.459> have<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.940> second<00:03:23.359> rigid<00:03:23.600> body<00:03:23.810> with

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
actually have a second rigid body with

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.539 
actually have a second rigid body with
clapping<00:03:24.560> with<00:03:24.680> tearing<00:03:25.100> and<00:03:25.250> with<00:03:25.370> food

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
clapping with tearing and with food

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.009 
clapping with tearing and with food
interaction<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.180> with<00:03:26.269> pressure<00:03:26.480> all<00:03:26.750> just

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
interaction and with pressure all just

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.470 
interaction and with pressure all just
work
