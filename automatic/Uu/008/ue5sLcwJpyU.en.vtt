however none of this really dawned on me
at<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.380> time<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.799> Redeemer<00:01:35.130> actually

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759

came out I felt that a lot of the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.480 
came out I felt that a lot of the
performances<00:01:38.670> were<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.630> too<00:01:39.920> sloppy<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

really<00:01:42.090> praise<00:01:42.479> on<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.229> record<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
really praise on this record and not the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.590 
really praise on this record and not the
Dean<00:01:44.310> has<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:44.670> cleaned<00:01:44.909> up<00:01:45.060> his<00:01:45.149> act<00:01:45.329> on

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
metal however I find this album to be so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.840 
metal however I find this album to be so
much<00:01:51.119> more<00:01:51.840> compelling<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> variety

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
much more compelling and for a variety

of reasons for one I think his

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.620 
of reasons for one I think his
songwriting<00:01:55.829> has<00:01:56.820> improved<00:01:57.240> even<00:01:57.479> though

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
songwriting has improved even though

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.660 
songwriting has improved even though
he's<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:57.899> able<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.140> keep<00:01:58.380> things<00:01:58.740> just<00:01:59.130> so

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
he's been able to keep things just so

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.359 
he's been able to keep things just so
incredibly<00:02:00.600> simple<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.680> track<00:02:02.070> after

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
incredibly simple on one track after

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.780 
incredibly simple on one track after
another<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.149> just<00:02:03.530> overall<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.979> harder<00:02:05.490> to

another and just overall it's harder to
deny<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.509> kind<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.530> amateurish<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.700> very

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
deny the kind of amateurish and very

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.540 
deny the kind of amateurish and very
eccentric<00:02:09.300> charm<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.619> record<00:02:10.830> has<00:02:11.160> as

lush<00:07:40.110> which<00:07:40.500> I<00:07:40.650> think<00:07:40.860> is<00:07:40.980> maybe<00:07:41.490> one<00:07:41.910> of<00:07:41.940> the

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:42.060 
lush which I think is maybe one of the

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.210 
lush which I think is maybe one of the
most<00:07:42.150> stellar<00:07:42.540> openings<00:07:43.200> of<00:07:43.410> any<00:07:43.740> record<00:07:43.980> this

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
most stellar openings of any record this

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.800 
most stellar openings of any record this
