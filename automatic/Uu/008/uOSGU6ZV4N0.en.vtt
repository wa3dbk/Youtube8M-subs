00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
relatively relaxed start i built two gun

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.120 
relatively relaxed start i built two gun
towers<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.570> middle<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.990> i<00:00:13.650> upgrade<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
towers in the middle and i upgrade the

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.010 
towers in the middle and i upgrade the
first<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.610> before<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.389> wave<00:00:15.540> starts

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
first one just before the wave starts

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.890 
first one just before the wave starts
like<00:00:16.440> so

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.370 

i<00:00:24.430> can<00:00:25.430> probably<00:00:25.670> take<00:00:25.910> these<00:00:26.570> first<00:00:26.840> two<00:00:27.140> webs

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
i can probably take these first two webs

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.410 
i can probably take these first two webs
with<00:00:27.680> just<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.130> gun<00:00:28.310> towers<00:00:28.520> i<00:00:28.849> popped<00:00:29.090> up<00:00:29.270> at

with just the gun towers i popped up at
the<00:00:29.539> beginning<00:00:29.930> but<00:00:30.080> the<00:00:30.500> extra<00:00:30.860> town<00:00:31.070> gives

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
the beginning but the extra town gives

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.040 
the beginning but the extra town gives

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
for waves three and four all we need to

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.220 
for waves three and four all we need to
do<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.670> upgrade<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:38.180> first<00:00:38.390> gun<00:00:38.660> tower<00:00:38.930> to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230

do is upgrade the first gun tower to
level<00:00:39.500> three<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:39.940> fast-forward<00:00:40.940> through

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
level three and fast-forward through

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.479 
level three and fast-forward through
because<00:00:42.080> wave<00:00:42.320> 3<00:00:42.590> comes<00:00:42.830> from<00:00:43.010> the<00:00:43.100> top<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.309> the

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:43.489 
because wave 3 comes from the top of the

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.460 
because wave 3 comes from the top of the
map<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.879> can<00:00:44.120> cut<00:00:44.360> it<00:00:44.390> relatively<00:00:44.930> close<00:00:45.260> to

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
map you can cut it relatively close to

map you can cut it relatively close to
the<00:00:45.589> beginning<00:00:45.680> of<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.100> way<00:00:46.250> when<00:00:46.519> upgrading

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.869 

you<00:00:53.960> can<00:00:54.140> see<00:00:54.320> wave<00:00:54.559> 5<00:00:54.800> contains<00:00:55.339> some<00:00:55.579> AOE

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
you can see wave 5 contains some AOE

well<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:13.410> don't<00:02:13.590> want<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.860> touch<00:02:13.980> its<00:02:14.220> room

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
well we don't want to touch its room
behind<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.000> because<00:02:15.150> it's<00:02:15.480> line<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.660> sight<00:02:15.960> is

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
behind it because it's line of sight is

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.470 
behind it because it's line of sight is
partially<00:02:16.590> blocked<00:02:16.890> so<00:02:17.460> hop<00:02:17.700> down<00:02:17.910> towers<00:02:18.240> of

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
partially blocked so hop down towers of

the other to be in places these Top Gun
towers<00:02:24.690> are<00:02:25.050> leak<00:02:25.410> protection<00:02:25.620> from<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
towers are leak protection from the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.640 
towers are leak protection from the
bottom<00:02:26.550> waves<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.720> upgrade<00:02:28.140> one<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.470> these

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
bottom waves so upgrade one of these

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.380 
bottom waves so upgrade one of these
then<00:02:29.040> spare<00:02:29.310> some<00:02:29.550> resources<00:02:30.030> for<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
then spare some resources for the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:54.750 
then spare some resources for the
command<00:02:30.720> town

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.100 

we're<00:02:55.760> about<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.180> leak<00:02:56.330> here<00:02:56.510> so<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:56.780> finish

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
we're about to leak here so I finish

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350 
we're about to leak here so I finish
upgraded<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.740> top<00:02:57.980> product<00:02:58.550> hours<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.090> listen

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
upgraded the top product hours to listen

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.880 
upgraded the top product hours to listen
to

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.650 

if<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.520> get<00:03:05.700> off<00:03:05.850> an<00:03:06.000> upgrade<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
if you can get off an upgrade to the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.690 
if you can get off an upgrade to the

temporal tower before web trail pets

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.430 
temporal tower before web trail pets
then<00:03:09.060> do<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.930> should<00:03:10.110> prevent<00:03:10.350> any

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
then do it this should prevent any

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:17.510 
then do it this should prevent any
significant<00:03:11.430> leakage<00:03:11.790> in<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.060> next<00:03:12.330> way

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:31.380 

let's<00:03:18.150> clean<00:03:18.570> this<00:03:18.870> place<00:03:19.140> up

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.170 

wave<00:03:31.990> 13<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.650> gravy<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.250> just<00:03:33.550> upgrade<00:03:34.030> the

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
wave 13 is gravy so I just upgrade the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:46.610 
wave 13 is gravy so I just upgrade the
c'mon<00:03:34.480> town<00:03:34.750> again

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.820 

wave<00:03:47.250> 14<00:03:47.849> however<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.720> rather<00:03:49.080> more<00:03:49.290> difficult

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
wave 14 however is rather more difficult

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.710 
wave 14 however is rather more difficult
so<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.190> pays<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.430> power<00:03:50.849> about<00:03:51.030> killing<00:03:51.510> zone

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
so it pays to power about killing zone

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.960 
so it pays to power about killing zone
around<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> cause<00:03:52.379> you'll<00:03:53.250> notice<00:03:53.459> I<00:03:53.730> also

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
around the cause you'll notice I also

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.570 
around the cause you'll notice I also

towers<00:04:43.240> up<00:04:43.510> high<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.500> swarmers<00:04:44.890> won't<00:04:45.130> bother

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
towers up high the swarmers won't bother

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.250 
towers up high the swarmers won't bother
us<00:04:45.490> so<00:04:46.150> let's<00:04:46.360> fast-forward<00:04:46.750> through<00:04:47.200> the

us so let's fast-forward through the
rest<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.740> way

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.350 

with<00:05:06.290> wave<00:05:06.500> at<00:05:06.680> 18<00:05:07.130> coming<00:05:07.550> I<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.940> some<00:05:08.120> spare

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
with wave at 18 coming I have some spare

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.600 
with wave at 18 coming I have some spare
resources<00:05:08.900> for<00:05:09.110> upgrades<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.920> finish<00:05:10.280> off<00:05:10.430> the

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
resources for upgrades I finish off the

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.120 
resources for upgrades I finish off the
temporal<00:05:11.000> towers<00:05:11.240> and<00:05:12.050> also<00:05:12.500> upgrade<00:05:12.950> the

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
temporal towers and also upgrade the

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:35.470 
temporal towers and also upgrade the
credit<00:05:13.580> a<00:05:13.820> little<00:05:14.270> too

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.590 

wave<00:05:36.080> 19<00:05:36.590> is<00:05:36.710> racist<00:05:37.190> so<00:05:37.760> it's<00:05:37.910> time<00:05:38.180> to<00:05:38.330> start

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
wave 19 is racist so it's time to start

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.180 
wave 19 is racist so it's time to start
thinking<00:05:38.690> about<00:05:39.080> upgrading<00:05:39.410> the<00:05:39.860> killing

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.190 
thinking about upgrading the killing

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.850 
thinking about upgrading the killing
area<00:05:40.460> by<00:05:40.640> the<00:05:40.670> power<00:05:41.000> face<00:05:41.300> again<00:05:41.630> I<00:05:41.960> upgrade

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
area by the power face again I upgrade

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:52.640 
area by the power face again I upgrade
one<00:05:43.070> tower<00:05:43.310> to<00:05:43.520> level<00:05:43.790> 3<00:05:44.030> for<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.360> way

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:52.650 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.409 

the<00:05:53.650> first<00:05:53.919> rounders<00:05:54.309> are<00:05:54.460> coming<00:05:54.729> in<00:05:54.819> web<00:05:54.999> 20

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
the first rounders are coming in web 20

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.959 
the first rounders are coming in web 20
so<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:55.990> upgrade<00:05:56.439> these<00:05:56.590> two<00:05:56.889> Top<00:05:57.159> Gun<00:05:57.400> towers<00:05:57.610> to

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
so I upgrade these two Top Gun towers to

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.059 
so I upgrade these two Top Gun towers to
level<00:05:58.240> three<00:05:58.479> you<00:05:59.139> can<00:05:59.169> see<00:05:59.499> how<00:05:59.590> they've<00:05:59.800> just

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.069 
level three you can see how they've just

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:07.180 
level three you can see how they've just
slightly<00:06:00.520> late<00:06:00.879> here

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:14.620 

I<00:06:08.190> think<00:06:09.090> my<00:06:09.690> god

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.560 

wave<00:06:15.230> 21<00:06:15.740> is<00:06:15.860> coming<00:06:16.220> so<00:06:16.820> I<00:06:16.850> upgrade<00:06:17.270> the<00:06:17.390> kill

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
wave 21 is coming so I upgrade the kill

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.660 
wave 21 is coming so I upgrade the kill
area<00:06:17.870> which<00:06:18.110> again<00:06:18.380> I<00:06:18.650> took<00:06:19.040> the<00:06:19.310> medial

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670
