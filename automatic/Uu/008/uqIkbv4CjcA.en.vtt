00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.069
 with such a catch must hurry home 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.710
 otherwise it will spoil but we don't want 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:13.420
 returning to the city we start salting on 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.870
 nature fish with giblets take a pot of 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.660
 tire 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.050
 we fill the bottom with salt 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.380
 fish 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.279
 again salt on her fish layers can be 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.740
 any number 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.310
 close the pan with a lid and set 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:32.110
 press 100 and if there is no nature 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:39.190
 lids no pans just dig a hole and 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:42.610
 cover the bottom of the pit with grass even wake up 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.000
 salt u as we did on the salt is laid 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.830
 sprinkle on top with another background 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 salt 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.490
 above also lay grass and put 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.490
 compress 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.280
 fish in salt can lie for a week to us 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.119
 I wanted to eat it as soon as possible therefore 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839
 we begin to smoke the most important thing 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.409
 message 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.649
 this wood is also like gourmet 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.780
 pick up seasonings for their dishes also 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.420
 we choose wood for smoking 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.210
 every wood gives its flavor we like 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.039
 Tim on the alder this tree will give the fish 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.619
 tart savory flavor 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.530
 the main thing to remove the bark it contains 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.509
 harmful tannins 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.020
 refined only shred wood chips 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.020
 hanging 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:38.090
 chips rolling in an iron vat breed 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.180
 the fire 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:45.479
 lay the fish on top of the net 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.289
 the vat is tightly covered with a lid already through 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.500
 20 minutes 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.500
 smoked flavored goldfish ready 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:01.920
 delicious bite today is cool 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.190
 smoked and barely caught a couple more guys 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.069
 this little thing is best five start 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.340
 Standard salt but not dry 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.350
 we drop fish very salty water to 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.989
 check concentration 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.150
 our salt water can be checked and we 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.140
 went to your potato channel must 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.630
 stay afloat from the salt pool 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.280
 to fresh air 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.310
 hang the fish by the tails in the dry 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.549
 on the room through it let hang 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.780
 for a week 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.840
 by the way meat stare 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.090
 salted and smoked just like fish 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.300
 and in the same way it can harm 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.070
 health 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.290
 Of course salted dried smoked product 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.950
 very tasty thing if you belong 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.780
 rules and do not trust it not dosolit 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.250
 at best you just lose 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.800
 products worst case you go 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.960
 or get sick from 3 do not climb and give 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.710
 some other various worms 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.580
 diseases 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.520
 as well as dangerous stunts and they set aside 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.300
 eggs on the flesh the result is teeming 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.240
 worms 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.180
 to prevent this from taking meat and 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.240
 the fish the first three days hiding in cheesecloth 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.780
 and then the dry product will fly 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.780
 not at all
