00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370 

so<00:00:00.269> the<00:00:00.390> first<00:00:00.599> thing<00:00:00.690> we<00:00:00.870> look<00:00:01.079> at<00:00:01.230> the

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
so the first thing we look at the

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.740 
so the first thing we look at the
composition<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.310> rule<00:00:02.520> of<00:00:02.550> thirds<00:00:02.750> this

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
composition is the rule of thirds this

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.960 
composition is the rule of thirds this
is<00:00:03.899> about<00:00:04.170> not<00:00:04.680> placing<00:00:05.069> your<00:00:05.190> subject<00:00:05.609> always

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
is about not placing your subject always

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.820 
is about not placing your subject always
in<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> center<00:00:06.420> of<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.720> frame<00:00:06.930> but<00:00:07.500> actually

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
in the center of the frame but actually

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.530 
in the center of the frame but actually
dividing<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.370> frame<00:00:08.670> into<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.090> imagined<00:00:09.480> you

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
dividing the frame into an imagined you

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.600 
dividing the frame into an imagined you
grid<00:00:09.750> of<00:00:09.960> nine<00:00:10.139> squares<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.099> placing<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
grid of nine squares and placing the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520 
grid of nine squares and placing the
subject<00:00:12.090> on<00:00:12.300> one<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.599> intersects<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.380> one

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
subject on one of the intersects of one

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.379 
subject on one of the intersects of one
of<00:00:13.620> those<00:00:13.710> squares<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.759> gives<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.089> much<00:00:15.240> more

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
of those squares this gives a much more

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.630 
of those squares this gives a much more
pleasing<00:00:15.660> image<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.410> eye<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.039> horizon

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
pleasing image to the eye the horizon

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.580 
pleasing image to the eye the horizon
line<00:00:17.670> plays<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> key<00:00:18.660> part<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> rule<00:00:19.560> of

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
line plays a key part in the rule of

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.200 
line plays a key part in the rule of
thirds<00:00:19.890> whether<00:00:20.609> we're<00:00:20.820> talking<00:00:20.970> about

horizontally<00:00:29.519> across<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.939> grid<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
horizontally across the grid so that you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.069 
horizontally across the grid so that you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
get either one third line to third sky

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
get either one third line to third sky

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
sky the subject in this image is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
sky the subject in this image is
standing<00:00:39.030> right<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> center<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
standing right in the center of the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.459 
standing right in the center of the
frame<00:00:40.410> with<00:00:41.540> basically<00:00:42.540> within<00:00:42.750> island<00:00:43.260> go

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
frame with basically within island go

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.619 
frame with basically within island go
now<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.829> top<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.219> their<00:00:44.340> head<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.360> really

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
now to the top of their head and really

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.650 
now to the top of their head and really
it's<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.170> snap<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.190> subject<00:00:47.820> whereas

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
it's just a snap of the subject whereas

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.660 
it's just a snap of the subject whereas
it<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.170> greatly<00:00:49.590> enhanced<00:00:49.860> by<00:00:50.370> actually

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
it can be greatly enhanced by actually

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.340 
it can be greatly enhanced by actually
incorporating<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.480> background<00:00:51.930> into<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
incorporating the background into the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.020 
incorporating the background into the
photograph<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.370> if<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> look<00:00:53.850> at<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
photograph so if we have a look at the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.470 
photograph so if we have a look at the
next<00:00:54.210> image<00:00:54.739> we<00:00:55.739> see<00:00:56.010> Lee<00:00:56.460> moved<00:00:57.149> slightly

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
next image we see Lee moved slightly

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
next image we see Lee moved slightly
over<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> left<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.829> island<00:00:59.609> now

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
over to the left and the island now

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.549 
over to the left and the island now
actually<00:01:00.270> being<00:01:00.510> part<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> photograph

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
actually being part of the photograph

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.439 
actually being part of the photograph
itself<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.090> where<00:01:03.239> Lee

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
itself and if you look where Lee

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.020 
itself and if you look where Lee
standing<00:01:04.080> it's<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
standing it's on one of the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.850 
standing it's on one of the
intersections<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.270> rule<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> thirds

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
intersections of the rule of thirds

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.080 
intersections of the rule of thirds
another<00:01:07.860> useful<00:01:08.130> tool<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.700> can<00:01:08.729> use<00:01:08.850> in

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
another useful tool we can use in

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.289 
another useful tool we can use in
composition<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.229> try<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> enhance<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> final

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
composition to try and enhance the final

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.840 
composition to try and enhance the final
image<00:01:12.570> it's<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.140> technique<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.680> framing<00:01:14.070> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
image it's a technique or framing so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.090 
image it's a technique or framing so
here<00:01:15.210> we've<00:01:15.360> got<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.540> really<00:01:15.810> lovely<00:01:16.380> glide<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
here we've got a really lovely glide the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
here we've got a really lovely glide the
mist<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:18.090> starting<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> clear<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.990> sun's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
mist is just starting to clear the sun's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.420 
mist is just starting to clear the sun's
coming<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.830> get<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> sunlight

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
coming through and get the sunlight

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.429 
coming through and get the sunlight
streaming<00:01:20.790> through<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> trees<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
streaming through the trees and in the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.260 
streaming through the trees and in the
middle<00:01:22.619> we've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.070> enormous<00:01:23.670> tree

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
middle we've got this enormous tree

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.480 
middle we've got this enormous tree
stump<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> use<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
stump and I'm going to use that as a

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.880 
stump and I'm going to use that as a
centerpiece<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.090> my<00:01:27.299> photograph<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
centerpiece of my photograph but to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
centerpiece of my photograph but to
actually<00:01:29.130> really<00:01:29.820> enhance<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.420> i'm<00:01:30.750> using

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
actually really enhance that i'm using

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
actually really enhance that i'm using
the<00:01:31.200> trees<00:01:31.500> around<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.070> in<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> canopy<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the trees around it in the canopy to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
the trees around it in the canopy to
create<00:01:34.439> a<00:01:34.590> frame<00:01:35.040> around<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.820> tree<00:01:36.299> stump

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
create a frame around that tree stump

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.980 
create a frame around that tree stump
and<00:01:36.810> actually<00:01:37.380> really<00:01:37.979> set<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:39.210> its

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and actually really set that off on its

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.140 
and actually really set that off on its
own<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.380> stand<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.009> picture<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.909> let's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
own to stand out in the picture so let's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.870

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
image is framed by the two trees to the
