from the unwound strings being the

you'll<00:00:43.860> be<00:00:43.950> able<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.219> see<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.660> camera

you'll be able to see this on the camera
but<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.579> nut<00:00:47.940> has<00:00:48.180> been<00:00:48.390> filled<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.140> time

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
but this nut has been filled at one time

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.639 
but this nut has been filled at one time
you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.039> see<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.250> old<00:00:50.489> string<00:00:50.820> slots<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
you can see the old string slots and a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
you can see the old string slots and a
couple<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.039> spots<00:00:53.690> so<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.809> assuming<00:00:55.050> that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
couple of spots so I'm assuming that

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.600 
couple of spots so I'm assuming that
when<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.530> was<00:00:55.620> flipped<00:00:55.920> around

when it was flipped around

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
when it was flipped around
they<00:00:56.730> probably<00:00:56.910> Reese<00:00:57.210> lauded<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.780> when<00:00:58.199> they

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
they probably Reese lauded it when they

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.529 
they probably Reese lauded it when they
put<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> being<00:00:59.100> right-handed<00:01:02.539> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
put it back to being right-handed the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.230 
put it back to being right-handed the
