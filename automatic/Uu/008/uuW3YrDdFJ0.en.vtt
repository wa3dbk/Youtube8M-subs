transitions and i will make video

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.420 
transitions and i will make video
comparisons<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> show<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:14.220> it'll

the<00:02:46.139> glidecam<00:02:46.709> so<00:02:47.489> I'm<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.359> panning<00:02:48.659> around

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
the glidecam so I'm just panning around

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.899 
the glidecam so I'm just panning around
with<00:02:49.109> the<00:02:49.319> camera<00:02:49.469> trying<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.400> hold<00:02:50.519> still<00:02:50.760> as

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
with the camera trying to hold still as

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:55.490 
with the camera trying to hold still as
much<00:02:51.239> as<00:02:51.389> possible<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:54.200> i<00:02:55.200> don't<00:02:55.379> i<00:02:55.470> don't

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
much as possible and i don't i don't

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.080 
much as possible and i don't i don't
know<00:02:55.709> if<00:02:55.799> you<00:02:55.889> can<00:02:56.010> tell<00:02:56.189> this<00:02:56.400> any<00:02:56.670> subtle

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
know if you can tell this any subtle

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.110 
know if you can tell this any subtle
shakes<00:02:57.720> but<00:02:58.079> when<00:02:58.889> actually<00:02:59.220> put<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.760> up<00:02:59.909> on<00:03:00.030> my

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
shakes but when actually put it up on my

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.030 
shakes but when actually put it up on my
computer<00:03:00.299> you'll<00:03:00.659> be<00:03:00.810> able<00:03:00.870> to<00:03:00.989> tell<00:03:01.319> so<00:03:01.620> I'm

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
computer you'll be able to tell so I'm

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.530 
computer you'll be able to tell so I'm
just<00:03:02.669> quick<00:03:03.150> movement<00:03:04.790> it's<00:03:05.790> very<00:03:05.909> shaky<00:03:06.329> when

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
just quick movement it's very shaky when

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.759 
just quick movement it's very shaky when
I'm<00:03:06.659> wood<00:03:06.840> around<00:03:07.019> and<00:03:07.290> especially<00:03:07.500> when<00:03:07.709> you

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
I'm wood around and especially when you

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.190 
I'm wood around and especially when you
hold<00:03:07.889> it<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.310> just<00:03:08.549> one<00:03:08.760> hand<00:03:09.049> want<00:03:10.049> to<00:03:10.109> hold

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
hold it with just one hand want to hold

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.479 
hold it with just one hand want to hold
it<00:03:10.290> with<00:03:10.379> two<00:03:10.439> it's<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.040> little<00:03:11.129> bit<00:03:11.280> more

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
it with two it's a little bit more

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.949 
it with two it's a little bit more
better<00:03:12.329> more<00:03:12.599> stable<00:03:17.090> okay<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.750> that's

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
better more stable okay so that's

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.879 
better more stable okay so that's
without<00:03:19.169> the<00:03:19.609> glidecam<00:03:21.079> okay<00:03:22.079> so<00:03:22.139> this<00:03:22.620> is

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:22.889 
without the glidecam okay so this is

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.890 
without the glidecam okay so this is
with<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.609> glidecam<00:03:24.030> HD<00:03:24.389> two<00:03:24.510> thousand<00:03:24.840> and

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
with the glidecam HD two thousand and

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.080 
with the glidecam HD two thousand and
I'm<00:03:25.019> going<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.319> attach<00:03:25.560> right<00:03:26.400> onto<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.909> top

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I'm going to attach right onto the top

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:51.270 
I'm going to attach right onto the top
right<00:03:27.359> there<00:03:39.650> okay<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.250> here<00:03:41.729> we<00:03:41.819> go

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.910 

okay<00:03:52.280> so<00:03:52.340> that's<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.060> whole<00:03:54.050> assembly<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.890> the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
okay so that's the whole assembly of the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.390 
okay so that's the whole assembly of the
glidecam<00:03:55.849> HT<00:03:56.209> 2000<00:03:56.750> as<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.800> can<00:03:57.950> see<00:03:58.130> i'm

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
glidecam HT 2000 as you can see i'm

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.390 
glidecam HT 2000 as you can see i'm
moving<00:03:58.730> around<00:03:58.910> very<00:04:00.280> smooth<00:04:01.280> very<00:04:01.310> fluid

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
moving around very smooth very fluid

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.770 
moving around very smooth very fluid
only<00:04:04.400> when<00:04:04.550> i<00:04:04.580> touch<00:04:04.880> right<00:04:05.090> here<00:04:05.120> you<00:04:05.630> can

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
only when i touch right here you can

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.740 
only when i touch right here you can
tell<00:04:06.310> that's<00:04:07.310> shaky<00:04:07.880> but<00:04:08.030> when<00:04:08.239> i<00:04:08.269> hold<00:04:08.510> this

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
tell that's shaky but when i hold this

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.259 
tell that's shaky but when i hold this
handle<00:04:09.080> here<00:04:09.110> it'll<00:04:09.950> help<00:04:10.430> stabilize<00:04:11.000> the

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
handle here it'll help stabilize the

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:18.069 
handle here it'll help stabilize the
movement<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.880> there<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:13.940> go<00:04:16.630> now<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:17.660> don't

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 
movement and there you go now I don't

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.960 
movement and there you go now I don't
have<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:18.320> completely<00:04:18.799> balanced<00:04:19.400> yet<00:04:19.519> otherwise

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
have a completely balanced yet otherwise

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.480 
have a completely balanced yet otherwise
it<00:04:20.239> won't<00:04:20.660> be<00:04:20.780> wobbling<00:04:21.350> around<00:04:21.440> too<00:04:21.739> much<00:04:21.859> as

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
it won't be wobbling around too much as

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.830 
it won't be wobbling around too much as
you<00:04:22.639> can<00:04:22.730> until<00:04:22.820> it's<00:04:23.090> leaning<00:04:23.479> a<00:04:23.540> little<00:04:23.570> bit

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
you can until it's leaning a little bit

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.050 
you can until it's leaning a little bit
towards<00:04:24.139> one<00:04:24.320> side<00:04:24.350> but<00:04:25.250> when<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.460> hold<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.030> in

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
towards one side but when I hold it in

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.060 
towards one side but when I hold it in
the<00:04:26.810> middle<00:04:27.110> which<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.620> supposed<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:27.979> do<00:04:28.040> just

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
the middle which is supposed to do just

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.480 
the middle which is supposed to do just
a<00:04:28.460> very<00:04:28.639> light<00:04:28.820> touch<00:04:28.970> ELPS<00:04:30.070> for<00:04:31.070> smooth

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
a very light touch ELPS for smooth

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.000 
a very light touch ELPS for smooth
panning
