these freewheeling hubs that that
everybody<00:00:08.400> knows<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.940> okay<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:10.019> all<00:00:10.170> know

you're<00:00:15.900> saving<00:00:16.350> yourself<00:00:16.710> quite<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> lot<00:00:17.580> of

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.560 
money in fuel and a lot of wear and tear
there's<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:20.130> thing<00:00:20.789> going<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.300> that

probably people need to know about I've
seen<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.760> drivers<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.480> using

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
seen a lot of drivers out there using

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.859 
seen a lot of drivers out there using
sticks<00:00:25.560> screwdrivers<00:00:26.310> pliers<00:00:26.490> even<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.689> get

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
sticks screwdrivers pliers even to get

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.960 
sticks screwdrivers pliers even to get
their<00:00:28.140> hubs<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.130> means<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
their hubs in what that means is that

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.810 
their hubs in what that means is that
the<00:00:30.539> hubs<00:00:30.750> are<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.740> possibly<00:00:32.399> reached<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
the hubs are and it's possibly reached a

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.280 
the hubs are and it's possibly reached a
stage<00:00:33.059> where<00:00:33.090> it's<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.570> even<00:00:33.899> engaging

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
stage where it's not even engaging

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
stage where it's not even engaging
properly<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> will<00:00:35.219> reach<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> state<00:00:35.850> won't

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
properly it will reach that state won't

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
properly it will reach that state won't
it<00:00:36.239> absolutely<00:00:37.140> becomes<00:00:37.829> angry<00:00:38.129> then<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it absolutely becomes angry then it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.270 
it absolutely becomes angry then it
becomes<00:00:38.910> dangerous<00:00:39.120> they<00:00:39.840> really<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.800> need<00:00:41.100> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
becomes dangerous they really do need to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.459 
becomes dangerous they really do need to
operate<00:00:41.760> properly<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.450> you've<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:42.989> them<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
operate properly if you've got them and

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.410 
operate properly if you've got them and
of<00:00:44.070> course<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> sort<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> vehicles<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.270> have

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
of course the sort of vehicles that have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.209 
of course the sort of vehicles that have
got<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.809> are<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> be<00:00:46.590> between<00:00:46.920> 10<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
got these are going to be between 10 and

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.760 
got these are going to be between 10 and
30<00:00:47.579> years<00:00:47.879> old<00:00:48.090> unless<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.719> course<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.590> one

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
30 years old unless of course you're one

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
30 years old unless of course you're one
of<00:00:49.890> those<00:00:50.039> very<00:00:50.370> sensible<00:00:50.969> people<00:00:51.180> who's

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
of those very sensible people who's

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.209 
of those very sensible people who's
converted<00:00:52.170> their<00:00:52.350> constant<00:00:52.800> four-wheel

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
converted their constant four-wheel

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.680 
converted their constant four-wheel
drive<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.610> two-wheel<00:00:54.030> drive<00:00:54.210> that's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
drive to a two-wheel drive that's

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
drive to a two-wheel drive that's
another<00:00:54.930> story<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> did<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:56.039> do

another story if you did actually do
need<00:00:56.430> locking<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.000> but<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.870> been

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
need locking up but there's been

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.590 
need locking up but there's been
advances<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.680> locking<00:00:58.980> ups<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.399> this<00:01:00.210> sign<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
advances in locking ups to this sign you

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.889 
advances in locking ups to this sign you
a<00:01:00.809> vm<00:01:01.350> half<00:01:01.590> cruces<00:01:02.250> yeah<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> new

a vm half cruces yeah this is the new
high<00:01:04.739> performance<00:01:04.799> hub<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:06.299> out

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570

very<00:01:16.710> yeah<00:01:17.210> with<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.479> units<00:01:19.259> themselves<00:01:19.409> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
very yeah with the units themselves that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460 
very yeah with the units themselves that
drive<00:01:20.040> units<00:01:20.430> are<00:01:20.549> made<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.470> thicker

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
drive units are made of a thicker

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.130 
drive units are made of a thicker
material<00:01:22.799> yep<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.939> they<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.479> made<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
material yep and they also made out of

material yep and they also made out of
billet<00:01:25.290> steel<00:01:25.770> instead<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.369> being<00:01:26.970> cast<00:01:27.270> steel

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
billet steel instead of being cast steel

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.469 
billet steel instead of being cast steel

this<00:01:39.930> old<00:01:40.140> tracker<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:41.009> yours<00:01:41.070> Alan<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.880> then

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this old tracker of yours Alan on then

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.520 
this old tracker of yours Alan on then
you've<00:01:42.240> abused<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.409> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
you've abused it so much that it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
you've abused it so much that it
probably<00:01:43.710> needs<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.159> hand<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:45.329> see<00:01:45.540> whatever

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
probably needs a hand and see whatever

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
probably needs a hand and see whatever
IVM<00:01:46.560> hubs<00:01:46.770> are<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.220> reliable<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.970> this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
IVM hubs are really reliable and this

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.300 
IVM hubs are really reliable and this
upgrade<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> best<00:01:49.979> thing<00:01:50.189> that's

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
upgrade is the best thing that's

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.810 
upgrade is the best thing that's
happened

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
happened

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.060 
happened
they<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:52.020> tapered<00:01:52.290> washers<00:01:52.799> they

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
they don't have tapered washers they

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
they don't have tapered washers they
just<00:01:53.280> bulb<00:01:53.520> straight<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:53.970> these<00:01:54.149> hubs<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.899> it's

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
just bulb straight on these hubs so it's

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.170 
just bulb straight on these hubs so it's
dead<00:01:55.439> easy<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.219> sort<00:01:56.460> out<00:01:56.670> a<00:01:56.700> new<00:01:57.149> set

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
dead easy to sort out a new set

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.910 
dead easy to sort out a new set
this<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.780> fault<00:01:59.050> and<00:01:59.200> washer<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.710> they

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
this is the fault and washer that they

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.120 
this is the fault and washer that they
use<00:02:00.160> if<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.640> can<00:02:00.850> get<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.150> circlip<00:02:01.510> on<00:02:02.130> some

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
use if you can get the circlip on some

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.860 
use if you can get the circlip on some
people<00:02:03.400> just<00:02:03.550> use<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.760> bulb<00:02:04.150> washer<00:02:04.540> on<00:02:04.660> there

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
people just use a bulb washer on there

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.410 
people just use a bulb washer on there
but<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.040> case<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.580> can<00:02:06.820> get<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.120> circle

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
but in this case we can get the circle

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.480 
but in this case we can get the circle
upon<00:02:08.130> so<00:02:09.130> we'll<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.399> pull<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:09.670> axle<00:02:10.090> out

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
upon so we'll just pull that axle out

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.699 
upon so we'll just pull that axle out
you<00:02:12.490> can<00:02:12.670> use<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:13.030> bulb<00:02:13.270> as<00:02:13.600> Alan<00:02:13.930> did<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
you can use the bulb as Alan did just to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.170 
you can use the bulb as Alan did just to
pull<00:02:14.860> that<00:02:14.980> axle<00:02:15.340> out<00:02:15.430> enough<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.970> get<00:02:16.090> the

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
pull that axle out enough to get the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.250 
pull that axle out enough to get the
circle<00:02:16.510> upon<00:02:16.720> perfect

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
circle upon perfect

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.960 
circle upon perfect
make<00:02:20.260> sure<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.560> circle<00:02:20.890> exceeds<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.459> really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
make sure the circle exceeds it really

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.610 
make sure the circle exceeds it really
nicely<00:02:22.180> otherwise<00:02:22.959> it<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.230> be<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.350> bit<00:02:23.470> of<00:02:23.500> a

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
nicely otherwise it can be a bit of a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.490 
nicely otherwise it can be a bit of a
problem<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:28.270> have<00:02:28.390> tapered<00:02:28.660> washers<00:02:29.140> we

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
problem I don't have tapered washers we

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.020 
problem I don't have tapered washers we
just<00:02:29.650> got<00:02:29.800> a<00:02:29.830> straight<00:02:30.130> old<00:02:30.280> spring<00:02:30.640> washers

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
just got a straight old spring washers

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420 
just got a straight old spring washers
and<00:02:31.180> nuts<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.930> make<00:02:32.380> sure<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.130> them<00:02:33.340> up

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and nuts and make sure you do them up

you're bolting down from a wheel to a
cylinder<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:48.190> don't<00:02:48.370> really<00:02:48.790> need<00:02:49.180> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
cylinder you don't really need to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.360 
cylinder you don't really need to
address<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.170> gee<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.650> good<00:02:50.830> idea<00:02:51.250> because

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
address but gee it's a good idea because

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.070 
address but gee it's a good idea because
it<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> new<00:02:52.030> component<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:53.020> to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
it is a new component and it's going to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.810 
it is a new component and it's going to
take<00:02:53.230> a<00:02:53.260> while<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:54.010> lubricant<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.640> work

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
take a while for the lubricant to work

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.820 
take a while for the lubricant to work
its<00:02:55.000> way<00:02:55.150> through<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.200> know<00:02:56.320> whatever

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
its way through so you know whatever

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.229 
its way through so you know whatever
you're<00:02:57.040> fitting<00:02:57.310> something<00:02:57.640> new<00:02:57.820> a<00:02:57.970> little

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
you're fitting something new a little

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.199 
you're fitting something new a little
bit<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.450> lubricant<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:59.730> do<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.790> need<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> hammer

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
bit of lubricant I do you need a hammer

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.600 
bit of lubricant I do you need a hammer
yet<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:01.780> know<00:03:02.020> what<00:03:02.230> yeah<00:03:02.620> it's<00:03:03.310> a<00:03:03.370> rubber

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
yet I don't know what yeah it's a rubber

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.650 
yet I don't know what yeah it's a rubber
hammer<00:03:03.880> I<00:03:04.000> could<00:03:04.209> use<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.540> on<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.840> oh<00:03:06.480> yeah<00:03:07.480> I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
hammer I could use it on you oh yeah I

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.970 
hammer I could use it on you oh yeah I
noticed<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.080> got<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> big<00:03:08.470> brick<00:03:08.739> in<00:03:08.890> the

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
noticed you got a big brick in the

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.590 
noticed you got a big brick in the
cultures<00:03:09.459> all<00:03:09.640> there<00:03:09.790> in<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:10.000> tool<00:03:10.239> kit

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
cultures all there in the tool kit

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.880 
cultures all there in the tool kit
I<00:03:10.630> suppose<00:03:10.959> that's<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:11.290> a<00:03:11.470> timing

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
I suppose that's just a timing

I suppose that's just a timing
adjustment<00:03:12.459> tool<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.850> it<00:03:12.970> or<00:03:13.090> something<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.840> do

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
adjustment tool is it or something to do
