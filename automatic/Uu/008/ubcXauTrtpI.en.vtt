cabins<00:02:08.660> being<00:02:08.960> essentially<00:02:09.649> kits<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.310> that

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
cabins being essentially kits is that

cabins being essentially kits is that
all<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.210> Timbers<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.780> pre-cut<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.710> the<00:02:12.860> factory

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
all the Timbers a pre-cut at the factory

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.360 
all the Timbers a pre-cut at the factory
so<00:02:13.700> everything<00:02:14.360> fits<00:02:14.810> together<00:02:15.050> properly<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
so everything fits together properly and

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
so everything fits together properly and
as<00:02:16.550> a<00:02:16.580> result<00:02:16.820> there's<00:02:17.570> no<00:02:17.900> budging<00:02:18.440> it<00:02:18.860> goes

up<00:02:19.490> perfectly<00:02:21.010> I'd<00:02:22.010> imagine<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:22.670> a

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
up perfectly I'd imagine that a

up perfectly I'd imagine that a
structure<00:02:23.120> like<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.300> would<00:02:23.630> take<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:23.959> least

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
structure like this would take at least

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.320 
structure like this would take at least
a<00:02:24.260> week<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.470> put<00:02:24.800> up<00:02:24.920> but<00:02:25.220> these<00:02:25.430> boys<00:02:25.700> really

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
a week to put up but these boys really

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:27.850 
a week to put up but these boys really
know<00:02:26.480> what<00:02:26.690> they're<00:02:26.780> doing<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:27.770> the

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
which we will with a special

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.000 
which we will with a special
preservative<00:02:50.150> paint<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.500> once<00:02:51.680> everything

around it has grown and it kind of feels

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.840 
around it has grown and it kind of feels
a<00:02:54.320> little<00:02:54.440> bit<00:02:54.650> more<00:02:54.860> part<00:02:55.310> of<00:02:55.430> the<00:02:55.550> landscape

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
a little bit more part of the landscape

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.310 
a little bit more part of the landscape
I<00:02:56.300> think<00:02:56.840> it's<00:02:56.930> going<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.140> look<00:02:57.290> fantastic

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
I think it's going to look fantastic

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.780 
I think it's going to look fantastic
it's<00:03:00.320> difficult<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.920> get<00:03:01.040> across<00:03:01.340> just<00:03:01.640> how

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
it's difficult to get across just how

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.880 
it's difficult to get across just how
spacious<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.390> cannon<00:03:02.959> feels<00:03:03.290> on<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.709> east

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
spacious this cannon feels on the east

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.820 
spacious this cannon feels on the east
side<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:05.030> particular<00:03:05.360> one<00:03:05.570> is<00:03:05.810> 5<00:03:06.170> meters<00:03:06.410> by

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
side this particular one is 5 meters by

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.520 
side this particular one is 5 meters by
4<00:03:07.220> which<00:03:07.459> is<00:03:07.610> more<00:03:07.970> bigger<00:03:08.300> for<00:03:08.690> me<00:03:08.810> and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
4 which is more bigger for me and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.250 
4 which is more bigger for me and
whatever<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.250> now<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.700> furniture<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.720> think

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
whatever it is now the furniture I think

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.900 
whatever it is now the furniture I think
it's<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.530> make<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.890> great<00:03:13.130> office<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:16.580> there<00:03:16.790> it

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
it's to make a great office so there it

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.240 
it's to make a great office so there it
is<00:03:17.030> my<00:03:17.840> only<00:03:17.989> regret<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.650> we<00:03:18.769> didn't<00:03:19.130> do

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
is my only regret is that we didn't do

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.460 
is my only regret is that we didn't do
it<00:03:19.370> sooner<00:03:19.640> I've<00:03:20.209> now<00:03:20.450> got<00:03:20.720> my<00:03:20.900> very<00:03:21.260> own

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
it sooner I've now got my very own

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.289 
it sooner I've now got my very own
office<00:03:21.829> in<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.070> garden<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:23.150> whole

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
office in the garden and the whole

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.259 
office in the garden and the whole
process<00:03:23.510> couldn't<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.380> been<00:03:24.470> simpler<00:03:25.120> so<00:03:26.120> if

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
process couldn't have been simpler so if

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.759 
process couldn't have been simpler so if
you're<00:03:26.480> thinking<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:27.019> having<00:03:27.200> something<00:03:27.560> like

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
you're thinking of having something like

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.220 
you're thinking of having something like
this<00:03:27.950> put<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.370> your<00:03:28.640> garden<00:03:28.940> all<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.930> would<00:03:30.200> say

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
this put in your garden all I would say

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.610 
this put in your garden all I would say
is<00:03:30.470> what<00:03:31.430> are<00:03:31.489> you<00:03:31.549> waiting<00:03:31.850> for

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
is what are you waiting for

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.990 
is what are you waiting for
you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.110 

so<00:03:36.870> nine<00:03:37.560> months<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:38.070> it<00:03:38.640> looks<00:03:38.970> rather

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
so nine months on it looks rather

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.540 
so nine months on it looks rather
different<00:03:39.660> doesn't<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.050> just<00:03:40.980> as<00:03:41.190> I'd<00:03:41.340> hoped

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
different doesn't it just as I'd hoped

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.730 
different doesn't it just as I'd hoped
when<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.180> creative<00:03:42.630> living<00:03:42.870> team<00:03:43.260> first

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
when the creative living team first

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.070 
when the creative living team first
installed<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.490> it's<00:03:45.180> already<00:03:45.540> looking<00:03:45.780> like

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
installed it it's already looking like

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.960 
installed it it's already looking like
it's<00:03:46.260> been<00:03:46.440> here<00:03:46.650> for<00:03:46.890> years<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:48.920> inside<00:03:49.970> well

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
it's been here for years and inside well

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.090 
it's been here for years and inside well
it's<00:03:51.660> not<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.960> bad<00:03:52.170> place<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.470> work<00:03:52.770> every<00:03:53.070> day

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
it's not a bad place to work every day

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.610 
it's not a bad place to work every day
is<00:03:53.430> it
