way<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.220> approaching<00:00:02.490> life<00:00:02.939> training<00:00:03.600> and<00:00:03.899> how

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
way of approaching life training and how

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.630 
way of approaching life training and how
it<00:00:04.230> can<00:00:04.380> translate<00:00:04.770> very<00:00:05.040> well<00:00:05.190> into<00:00:05.370> your

it can translate very well into your

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.820 
it can translate very well into your
pressing<00:00:06.089> exercises<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:07.290> first<00:00:07.529> let's<00:00:07.799> start

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
pressing exercises so first let's start

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.560 
pressing exercises so first let's start
with<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.130> basics<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.790> pressing<00:00:09.179> itself

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
with the basics of pressing itself

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.660 
with the basics of pressing itself
whenever<00:00:10.500> you<00:00:10.679> want<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.010> press<00:00:11.280> you<00:00:11.460> always

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
whenever you want to press you always

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.549 
whenever you want to press you always
want<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:11.940> stay<00:00:12.120> tight<00:00:12.480> with<00:00:13.200> your<00:00:13.380> life

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
want to stay tight with your life

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.320 
want to stay tight with your life

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
unfortunately most people don't do this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.970 
unfortunately most people don't do this
the<00:00:15.540> most<00:00:15.690> common<00:00:16.109> thing<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.500> guys<00:00:16.680> doing

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
the most common thing is you guys doing

the most common thing is you guys doing
is<00:00:17.100> they'll<00:00:17.609> venture<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.119> arms<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
is they'll venture the arms up here and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.230 
is they'll venture the arms up here and
they'll<00:00:20.220> thing<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> do<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.730> they're<00:00:20.910> doing<00:00:21.000> it

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
they'll thing to do it they're doing it

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.609 
they'll thing to do it they're doing it
right<00:00:21.390> when<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.779> fact<00:00:21.960> they're<00:00:22.170> internally

right when in fact they're internally

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.200 
right when in fact they're internally
rotating<00:00:23.070> your<00:00:23.160> shoulder<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.730> they'll

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
rotating your shoulder and they'll

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.089 
rotating your shoulder and they'll
probably<00:00:24.359> have<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.689> get<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.840> surgery<00:00:25.590> within

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099

by rolling the bar to your chest okay

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.540 
by rolling the bar to your chest okay
and<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.530> rowing<00:00:40.770> walk<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> chest

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
and if you're rowing walk to the chest

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.770 
and if you're rowing walk to the chest
watch<00:00:41.760> which<00:00:41.969> muscles<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.480> engaging

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
watch which muscles are you engaging

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.319 
watch which muscles are you engaging
take<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.140> look<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.559> all<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.520> whenever<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
take a look you all that whenever you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.510 
take a look you all that whenever you
roll<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> shit<00:00:45.690> your<00:00:45.989> chest<00:00:46.289> them<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.950> in

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
roll that shit your chest them so in

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.670 
roll that shit your chest them so in
theory<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> stay<00:00:48.840> tight<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.410> want<00:00:49.620> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
theory we want to stay tight we want to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.680 
theory we want to stay tight we want to
stay<00:00:49.800> tight<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> entire<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.730> however<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
stay tight the entire time however the

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.660 
stay tight the entire time however the
problem<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> run<00:00:52.379> into<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
problem that we run into is that it can

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
problem that we run into is that it can
be<00:00:53.760> very<00:00:53.969> difficult<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.510> teach<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.840> person<00:00:55.050> how

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
be very difficult to teach a person how

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
be very difficult to teach a person how
to<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:55.739> this<00:00:55.890> type<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> tightness<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> way

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
to get this type of tightness if the way

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.240 
to get this type of tightness if the way
that<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:57.660> training<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:58.050> lats<00:00:58.250> doesn't

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that they're training your lats doesn't

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.830 
that they're training your lats doesn't
really<00:00:59.430> replicate<00:00:59.879> this<00:01:00.120> movement<00:01:00.539> pattern

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
really replicate this movement pattern

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.860 
really replicate this movement pattern
here<00:01:01.190> see<00:01:02.190> most<00:01:02.430> guys<00:01:02.640> don't<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.840> of

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
here see most guys don't do a lot of

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.250 
here see most guys don't do a lot of
pulldown<00:01:04.260> right<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.549> pulley<00:01:06.360> ball<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
pulldown right go to this pulley ball is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.490 
pulldown right go to this pulley ball is
it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.750 
it
does<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> look<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> same<00:01:08.430> movement

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
does this look like the same movement

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
does this look like the same movement
pattern<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.850> no<00:01:11.850> not<00:01:12.090> alone<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.659> those

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
pattern as this no not alone right those

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.499 
pattern as this no not alone right those
do<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.040> pull-ups<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.030> chin-ups<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
do a lot of pull-ups and chin-ups and

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.999 
do a lot of pull-ups and chin-ups and
stuff<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> amazing

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
stuff like that which is amazing

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.679 
stuff like that which is amazing
absolutely<00:01:17.400> love<00:01:17.850> those<00:01:17.970> exercises<00:01:18.390> but

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
absolutely love those exercises but

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.510 
absolutely love those exercises but
that's<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.439> gonna<00:01:19.650> develop<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.220> movement

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that's not gonna develop the movement

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.399 
that's not gonna develop the movement
pattern<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.390> we're<00:01:21.540> looking<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:22.049> we<00:01:22.200> want

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
pattern that we're looking for we want

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
pattern that we're looking for we want
to<00:01:22.530> build<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:23.040> movement<00:01:23.880> pattern<00:01:24.299> which<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
to build a movement pattern which is the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.390 
to build a movement pattern which is the
same<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.650> our<00:01:25.770> benchpress<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:27.360> pattern

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
same as our benchpress this pattern

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.050 
same as our benchpress this pattern
right<00:01:29.400> here<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.430> I'm<00:01:32.820> gonna

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
right here so the way that I'm gonna

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.359 
right here so the way that I'm gonna
recommend<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.200> train<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.590> lats<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:35.280> by

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
recommend that you train your lats is by

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.130 
recommend that you train your lats is by
doing<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.299> exact<00:01:36.630> movement<00:01:36.930> pattern

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
doing that that exact movement pattern
