turbine which is like you got the two

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.700 
turbine which is like you got the two
different<00:02:14.860> two<00:02:15.860> different<00:02:15.890> chambers<00:02:16.310> there

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
different two different chambers there

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.860 
different two different chambers there
this<00:02:18.710> one's<00:02:18.950> only<00:02:19.130> get<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.490> one<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.690> I'm<00:02:20.750> gonna
