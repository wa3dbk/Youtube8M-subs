flip<00:02:09.200> in<00:02:09.560> 2004<00:02:10.399> for<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.209> video<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.410> quality

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
flip in 2004 for this video the quality

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.740 
flip in 2004 for this video the quality
is<00:02:13.040> not<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.340> same<00:02:13.610> but<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.090> believe<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.630> the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
is not the same but I believe is the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.850 
is not the same but I believe is the
same<00:02:14.959> phenomenon<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:16.820> then<00:02:17.269> I<00:02:17.600> think<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.799> are

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
same phenomenon and then I think we are

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.009 
same phenomenon and then I think we are
gonna<00:02:19.010> still<00:02:19.310> have<00:02:19.450> we're<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.720> have

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
gonna still have we're going to have

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.699 
gonna still have we're going to have
more<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.680> more<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:22.040> these<00:02:22.190> kind<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.519> videos

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
more and more of these kind of videos

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.280 
more and more of these kind of videos
very<00:02:24.709> soon<00:02:24.860> because<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:26.180> learn<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.840> have<00:02:27.049> learned

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
very soon because I learn I have learned

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.710 
very soon because I learn I have learned
that<00:02:27.560> they<00:02:28.400> use<00:02:28.610> ago<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.090> have<00:02:29.239> some<00:02:29.480> fleets

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that they use ago we have some fleets

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.680 
that they use ago we have some fleets
and<00:02:30.170> now<00:02:30.590> it's<00:02:30.769> incredible<00:02:31.430> I<00:02:31.670> know<00:02:32.030> this<00:02:32.480> is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
and now it's incredible I know this is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.590 
and now it's incredible I know this is
the<00:02:32.959> beginning<00:02:33.590> for<00:02:33.620> this<00:02:34.040> kind<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.030> phenomena

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
the beginning for this kind of phenomena

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.890 
the beginning for this kind of phenomena
that<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.320> unexplainable

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that is unexplainable

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.960 
that is unexplainable
so<00:02:39.500> now<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:39.739> are<00:02:39.980> wondering<00:02:40.459> are<00:02:40.909> we

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
so now we are wondering are we

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.270 
so now we are wondering are we
confronting<00:02:41.659> a<00:02:41.780> new<00:02:41.930> phenomena<00:02:42.440> a<00:02:42.590> new<00:02:42.769> sign

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
confronting a new phenomena a new sign

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.970 
confronting a new phenomena a new sign
what<00:02:43.940> could<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:44.239> meaning<00:02:44.720> what<00:02:45.620> could<00:02:45.830> this

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
what could this meaning what could this

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.110 
what could this meaning what could this
group<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.930> strange<00:02:47.930> luminous<00:02:48.440> figures<00:02:49.190> with

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
group of strange luminous figures with

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.199 
group of strange luminous figures with
humanoid<00:02:50.629> shape<00:02:50.840> mean<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.190> these<00:02:52.310> weeks<00:02:52.610> and

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
humanoid shape mean to these weeks and

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.580 
humanoid shape mean to these weeks and
you<00:02:53.390> sang<00:02:53.830> so<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.930> have<00:02:57.140> several

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
you sang so we have several

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.009 
you sang so we have several
interpretations<00:02:58.040> you<00:02:58.549> know<00:02:58.760> could<00:02:59.690> this<00:02:59.810> be

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
interpretations you know could this be

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.489 
interpretations you know could this be
some<00:03:00.319> kind<00:03:00.349> of<00:03:00.739> beams<00:03:01.099> of<00:03:01.280> light
