Charlotte's<00:02:38.250> lowers<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.690> tiny<00:02:40.200> bit

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
Charlotte's lowers here is a tiny bit

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.610 
Charlotte's lowers here is a tiny bit
shorter<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:42.569> not<00:02:42.720> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.080> as<00:02:43.260> big

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
shorter so it's not going to be as big

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.930 
shorter so it's not going to be as big
of<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.890> little<00:02:44.819> bloop<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> top<00:02:46.349> part<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.910> you

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
of a little bloop in the top part so you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.900 
of a little bloop in the top part so you
can<00:02:48.569> just<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.470> same<00:02:49.680> thing<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:50.250> I
