five<00:04:57.259> ounces<00:04:57.800> each<00:04:57.949> so<00:04:59.050> that's<00:05:00.050> less<00:05:00.289> than<00:05:00.319> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
five ounces each so that's less than a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.800 
five ounces each so that's less than a
full<00:05:00.710> size<00:05:00.919> eye<00:05:01.159> shadow<00:05:01.430> for<00:05:01.789> each<00:05:02.030> one<00:05:02.330> but

of versatility with it it balances out

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:10.330 
of versatility with it it balances out
for<00:05:08.509> those<00:05:08.599> of<00:05:08.780> you<00:05:08.870> care<00:05:09.169> the<00:05:09.800> backup<00:05:10.099> pilot
