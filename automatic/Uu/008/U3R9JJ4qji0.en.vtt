00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
isn't exactly what a promises I know it
doesn't<00:01:51.780> look<00:01:52.020> like<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.560> thanks<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
doesn't look like it thanks to the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
doesn't look like it thanks to the

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
really get a sense that there's a

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.130 
really get a sense that there's a
surprising<00:02:26.550> amount<00:02:27.060> of<00:02:27.150> grunt<00:02:27.630> hidden<00:02:27.990> inside

surprising amount of grunt hidden inside

just<00:02:28.650> waiting<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.130> be<00:02:29.220> unleashed<00:02:29.520> and<00:02:29.970> even

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
just waiting to be unleashed and even

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.450 
just waiting to be unleashed and even
when<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.750> plunk<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.470> DES<00:02:31.860> game<00:02:32.100> with<00:02:32.310> that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
when you plunk in a DES game with that

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.120 
when you plunk in a DES game with that
3d<00:02:33.000> screen<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.690> does<00:02:33.930> just<00:02:34.350> fine<00:02:34.560> displaying

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
3d screen it does just fine displaying

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.730 
3d screen it does just fine displaying
the<00:02:35.310> 2d<00:02:35.670> content<00:02:36.210> again<00:02:36.810> crisp<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.410> clear

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
the 2d content again crisp and clear

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.250 
the 2d content again crisp and clear
although<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.490> thought<00:02:38.760> maybe<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.690> was<00:02:39.780> slightly

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
although I thought maybe it was slightly

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.510 
although I thought maybe it was slightly
less<00:02:40.680> saturated<00:02:41.220> than<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.670> my<00:02:41.880> DSi<00:02:42.570> XL<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.370> if

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
less saturated than on my DSi XL but if

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.210 
less saturated than on my DSi XL but if
I'm<00:02:44.730> right<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.150> was<00:02:45.330> subtle<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.710> circle

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
I'm right it was subtle and that circle

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.370 
I'm right it was subtle and that circle
pad<00:02:47.430> yeah<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.210> maps<00:02:48.540> directly<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
pad yeah that maps directly to the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.230 
pad yeah that maps directly to the
control<00:02:49.710> so<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.250> prefer<00:02:50.580> that<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:51.120> the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
control so if you prefer that to the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.090 
control so if you prefer that to the
old-style<00:02:51.600> cross<00:02:52.110> pad<00:02:52.410> you're<00:02:52.710> in<00:02:52.860> luck

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
old-style cross pad you're in luck

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.490 
old-style cross pad you're in luck
because<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.580> works<00:02:53.820> perfectly<00:02:54.750> well<00:02:55.080> with<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
because it works perfectly well with the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.460 
because it works perfectly well with the
