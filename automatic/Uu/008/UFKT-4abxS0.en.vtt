00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.570
 girl walks in the city barefoot girls 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.160
 road give way the traffic light everyone smiles 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
 air supplies 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 and the girl nods in response to him about 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.640
 blue ice goes out of town 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 girl stands up toward the girl's mouth 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 on Pushkin on Ligovskiy McFaul after 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 sailed through the canal 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.820
 steamer and outside the window they do not flash to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.230
 take off and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.739
 while some are noticeable others are not at all 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 she is a palace 70 from on she is at someone 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.370
 in love and this someone 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.230
 at 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.750
 he sits and see 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.900
 rear 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.570
 as a city girl walks barefoot on 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.159
 Scarron and on the streets flies modelku 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.690
 girl and a by law 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:26.030
 the sun is warming up in a girl singing the end 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.580
 we do not fly, they are not like birds 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:32.350
 they fly clouds 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.180
 others are not at all visible 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.760
 and in the yard blooms and son 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.920
 she is in love with someone 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.920
 and I here who 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 on that 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.360
 sits and see 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:52.220
 hello now let's break the guitar fight 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.530
 of this song for entry into verses and in 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.870
 choruses 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.120
 doing four quick moves on top 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:05.050
 down bottom up and top down bottom 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.050
 up then turn off and pause 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.760
 further before doing the same 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 make one quick upward movement 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.239
 and then we repeat everything that was played 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.140
 the very beginning 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:25.150
 that is, it turns out so 2 1 and all together 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:36.370
 so then the next chord also 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:39.519
 beat and on and on when the second lap 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.200
 We start to play, in principle, on the cord e 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:46.810
 you can already begin to play as a whole 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.049
 fight namely instead of pause 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.739
 add two fast moves below 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:57.989
 up and top down thus filling 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.989
 This pause is all together. 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.510
 that is, in principle here I lost two 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:12.160
 times this fight looks like it is so down 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.350
 up down up turn off top over 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.350
 and here are two of my played on the cord and 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.569
 and then we beat this fight twice 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.569
 on every chord 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:41.600
 and when we start the couplets we play normal 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.360
 four fight without jamming namely 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:49.300
 top down first motion then bottom 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.300
 up then again from top to bottom 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.269
 and bottom up conclusion and after which 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.269
 repeat the fight 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.540
 So we beat once on each 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.540
 chord 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:17.750
 when we got to the cord dm here 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.750
 play this fight 4 times 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.620
 and on b7 too four times 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.319
 on the refrain we play this fight four 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.110
 only already with jamming namely from above 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.449
 down and bottom up everything is also just 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.949
 instead of 3 moves from top to bottom, we do 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:44.620
 jamming and then also the last 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:46.960
 bottom up motion and repeat 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:05:03.550
 beat this fight four times on 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:05:06.039
 each chord when they beat once 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.430
 these chords can be left either the same 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.210
 the battle 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:13.530
 either like i change the guitar fight to that one 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.530
 that played on the entry 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.230
 Eva play two times on each chord 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.030
 Well, that's what I hope I help you with. 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.030
 good luck and success
