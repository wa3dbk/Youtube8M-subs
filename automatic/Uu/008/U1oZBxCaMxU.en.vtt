00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.589

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.299
 upload it and the truth is that I'm 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:17.180
 pretty happy the party at 41 is 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.010
 scorpion favorites evo and good 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.650
 tell you what is this game I played 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.270
 from the account 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.630
 when I played competitive 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.480
 and well I had to leave because I'm not going 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.370
 to leave time the vice served this 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 departure and good enough happy 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.190
 also thank rucci very much for his help 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.440
 in the channel because this game has 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.870
 recorded with your hd grabber if not already 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.720
 you know that I do not have a captor and I do not 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.180
 could have managed to do the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.760
 recording is also true that the 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.260
 sound has come out a bit bad because 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.340
 when I record him with his captor not 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 it picks up the sound and I have to 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.140
 do it manually but good enough 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.370
 happy now you will see that I start 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 thrill I start to kill for all 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.369
 sides 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.270
 thank you I'm a little bad so 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.850
 if you hear me the voice is why one 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.140
 I come here to comment a bit on the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.869
 channel information that I bring new 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.390
 what are we going to do in these in these 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.190
 next days not the truth as you know 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.270
 has started the baccalaureate is a course 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.340
 very difficult 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.479
 in which you have to dedicate a lot 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.740
 time to study and the truth is that not 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.939
 I have it for as long as I 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.219
 like to have to dedicate to the channel 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:35.409
 but yes, well, I want to make several 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:38.619
 it's the blogs that I still suffer 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.640
 They are there pending to mount and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.990
 well the truth is that I want 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.810
 tell them something and I want to ask you a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.750
 little advice I've seen several people 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.720
 for example I refer to trillo yo 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.900
 blogs 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.880
 teacher so to speak of the blogs I've 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.680
 seen that on blogs on Mondays a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 little to cheer people up according to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.220
 more than what we usually have and good 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.260
 As you know, the soil goes up 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.700
 Friday but I can think of the idea that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.790
 also maybe I could do what 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.290
 try to raise it or blogs 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.210
 games only that the video that this that 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.710
 on Mondays so to try to cheer up a 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.300
 little to people I would also come 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.950
 pretty good because that way I can record 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.840
 during the weekend and I do not have to 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.090
 accumulate a whole week 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.710
 then if you are a lot of subscribers 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.940
 You can leave me the usual channels 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.680
 some comment 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.330
 with your opinion if you prefer it is 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.690
 same or video new monday or watching the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:31.090
 Friday or as you see and good 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.670
 we went to another topic as you saw 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.680
 I have done the unboxing of Algeria and I 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.600
 I will leave at the end in the description the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.830
 video link description 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.830
 or towards him 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:50.390
 the truth now I can not upload all the 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.370
 that I think I would like to be worth then 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.459
 I know if I will record someday with the camera hd 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.459
 the screen you know why 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.970
 I have to tell you, capturing buyer 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.880
 at Christmas but good is left 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.580
 enough so let's wait and see 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.100
 what's happening and well I think it's more 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.590
 or less everything commented I have nothing left 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.580
 more than saying was that when 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.950
 we found another little friend of the clan 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.910
 create a visual greeting or tics good 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.100
 I had to leave the visual club 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.810
 but he wishes you well, I hope that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.810
 go ahead that are machines 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.020

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.170
 I thought it was amazing 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.530
 is that it shows a lot of time is what 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.420

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.970
