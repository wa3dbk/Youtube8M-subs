00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 I think regular viewers and connoisseurs 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.029
 heading secrets mastery notice that 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.740
 Topics that choose a lead for new 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 lessons are getting harder and harder 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 I want to appeal to those who watch this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.299
 first column for sure 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.900
 time to browse the entire archive of secrets 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.090
 craftsmanship 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.320
 since it is published separately on the site 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
 league billiards 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.460
 hello there is a kirichuk affair and rubric 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.289
 secrets of mastery in one of the past 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.160
 issues we have considered a 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.630
 billiard stand 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.359
 which in my opinion is 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.520
 optimal however if we look at 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.989
 professional players and not 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.570
 only in Russian billiards but also in pool 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 snooker we will see that their racks can 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.870
 very different among themselves 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.309
 which does not interfere with the players 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.410
 show high results 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.600
 today we will figure out what are 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.920
 billiard stand items and how it 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.750
 affects the gameplay 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.730
 let's talk different for a start 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.500
 leg set up our legs 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.600
 perform two important functions this 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.699
 stability and ease of legs it 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 the foundation of our stand is from steady 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.989
 the position is directly dependent accuracy 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.600
 Kim hits in its balls 2 at least 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.150
 an important component is the convenience of many 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.439
 players who find themselves stable on 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.270
 not comfortable enough rack 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.850
 faces such a problem that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.950
 one and a half to two hours the game goes as it should 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 but starting from that moment onwards 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.170
 the number of marriages and so the position of the legs a 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.640
 should be steady and comfortable let's 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
 let's see what could be here 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.299
 options start with the first but put 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.790
 which is used for this sheet 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.400
 right leg support 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 the first option is both feet parallel 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.270
 strike line this option is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 the most stable but he is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.960
 most uncomfortable as a player 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.700
 starts to get up the rack immediately starts 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 pull the right leg hurts 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.270
 make this position a little less 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.880
 sustainable but much more convenient 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.399
 you can turn the right toe on comfortable 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.740
 us corner then we can put the left 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.710
 foot forward and due to this 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.520
 Become more comfortable The second option stands both 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 legs straight 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.240
 put very widely can put them 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.580
 at any angle to the strike line 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.580
 such a stand is very comfortable 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.530
 very steady will stop that in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.660
 such a rack becomes harder to get up 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.260
 Do not blow and because the right leg is already 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.390
 frame and does not hold the third rack option 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.890
 this is a stand with a support on the left foot such 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.700
 stance we can keep the right foot in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.460
 hitting the left foot put forward and 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.620
 transfer weight to her by bending her knee 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:30.090
 or we can put the right foot a little bit 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:33.570
 even aside from her well yes such a rack 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.160
 may be quite steady but she 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.709
 can not be logged on convenient because 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.800
 that the bent left leg will 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.110
 strain also when we get up in 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.900
 such a rack for what we 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.270
 we fall down on the left foot and also on 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.489
 control may be lost to our left hand 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.100
 over right- handed right- handed husband starts 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.810
 cuddle too much to ourselves we still 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.160
 one rack option which is small 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.010
 luxury spread billion 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.170
 occipital eliminated in bullets this rack in 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.660
 which the right leg is supporting 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.989
 but it is bent for example 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:10.170
 right leg bent left leg straight 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.430
 Either both legs are slightly bent. 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.830
 resistant are very comfortable 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.510
 special tall people but they 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.310
 are the least resistant of all 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.989
 possible options because two 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 toes is very difficult to keep 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.450
 balance now let's talk about tass 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.820
 we may not unwrap that at all 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.170
 put on the line of the gift then we get 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.690
 extra precision on short 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.980
 blows but blows with big plates to us 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.910
 make it very difficult either we can 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.880
 deploy tass then we 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.310
 there are blows with any swing with you 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.680
 wiring but it will be harder for us to manage 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.969
 ball for short distances 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.799
 also on precision shots 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:48.159
 dirty amplitudes i ed our right 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.469
 shoulder 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.439
 when we let the right food very low 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:56.170
 cale we have such a natural 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.629
 the lock is badly held high and becomes 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.150
 easy to control the balls on short 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.450
 punches if we hold the right shoulder 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.250
 high and get up in such a stable with us 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.379
 there is an opportunity designed for 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.260
 long strokes but disappears 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:13.480
 natural fixation and infusions more difficult 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.069
 control short balls like speaking 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.590
 right sins can either keep it 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.329
 relaxed and just kept in 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.099
 left hand in this position us 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.720
 there is a maximum movement 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.910
 someone gets harder to do 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.669
 straightforward to clip we can 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.160
 maximum hold him to her in such 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.860
 position on it gets a lot easier 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.259
 manage it do straight shots 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.570
 by is control but it appears 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.940
 also stiffness of movements as well 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.820
 if you try to cuddle your elbow 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.960
 then see to it that it does not lay down 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.490
 strongly on the back 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.510
 when he is swamped heavily side of the back on 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.220
 small swing, we could quite 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.530
 even blow when we do 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.720
 high amplitude shocks which 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.729
 start walking so if we press to 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.550
 yourself elbow need so unfolds 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.830
 rack so that he will still be Putin 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.430
 secular now let's talk about 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.919
 left hand 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.669
 the main function of the left hand is to hold 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.590
 our rack 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.120
 it is very easy to feel that 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.070
 maximally straighten your left arm we 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.320
 we get maximum fixation and 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.699
 rack control but very easy 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.409
 feel on a straight arm on 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.990
 some bumps may not be enough 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.900
 coiling cure we can 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.210
 pushing your arm away and bending a little 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.669
 elbow in this position we are a little bit 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.979
 lose control stand fixing but 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.680
 we get an additional fulcrum that 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.330
 allows us to control hitting 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.039
 big deputies now let's talk 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.490
 about the situation as I am relative to ours 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:41.380
 Chin our two can be hold cue 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.480
 straight chin or shift it 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.070
 here's the right and left eye the easiest 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.200
 service combining 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.330
 our eyes are a scarf and direction of impact 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.670
 then if our head will move 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.580
 forward vertical plane of quicasso 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.200
 under the chin on will be easy to keep 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.150
 direction of impact in order to 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.880
 get the same direction holding 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.500
 head a little bit away from kia us 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.810
 some point will have to lead 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.790
 head to the side lighting the same head 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.190
 regarding the strike line we and immediately 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.560
 Losing restores will have it already in 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.450
 rack and it is unnecessary machine line of impact 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.250
 so we looked at various 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.440
 elements of which can be yours 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.330
 stand for let's see how it all 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.880
 may look altogether 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.450
 For example, a good stand for short 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.620
 hitting we put straight legs 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:32.440
 turn around take 7 right shoulder 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:34.750
 and do a short for individual strikes 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760
 can try another stand wide 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.860
 legs apart will give us the maximum 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.750
 stability and comfort deployed tass 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.720
 high right shoulder will give us 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.890
 the opportunity to make a big swing and 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.690
 bent elbow us at the opportunity 

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:49.110
 control blow big 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.110
 amplitude 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:55.749
 well that's all for today are studying 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.979
 design pick the most 

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:58.360
 suitable options for you 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:00.129
 and if you still have questions on 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.599
 today's topic do not hesitate 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:03.129
 leave them in the comments and we 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:05.319
 be sure to consider in the next 

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:07.769
 releases with you was a kirichuk novel before 

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.769
 new meetings
