I<00:02:04.420> just<00:02:04.810> realized<00:02:05.709> that<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.130> was<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> bigger

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
I just realized that it was a bigger

I just realized that it was a bigger
challenge<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.479> thought<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.869> the

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
challenge and I thought with the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.440 
challenge and I thought with the
language<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.590> everything<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.130> in

language that everything is in
but<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.560> just<00:02:10.739> required<00:02:11.190> hard<00:02:11.580> work<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.300> kind

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
