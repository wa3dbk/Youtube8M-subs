delivered on that triple axel which is

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
delivered on that triple axel which is
something<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> kim<00:01:53.280> yu-na<00:01:53.430> does<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
something that kim yu-na does not do so

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
something that kim yu-na does not do so
if<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.630> put<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.020> side-by-side<00:01:55.560> the

performances<00:01:56.700> explain<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.180> me<00:01:57.299> why<00:01:57.509> asada<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
performances explain to me why asada is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.560 
performances explain to me why asada is
in<00:01:58.710> second<00:01:59.130> place<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:01:59.790> going<00:02:00.000> easiest

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
in second place well I'm going easiest

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.060 
in second place well I'm going easiest
way<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> explain<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.290> triple<00:02:01.619> axels<00:02:01.979> an

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
way to explain as a triple axels an

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.770 
way to explain as a triple axels an
extraordinary<00:02:02.579> achievement<00:02:02.700> triple<00:02:03.420> axel

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
extraordinary achievement triple axel

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
extraordinary achievement triple axel
but<00:02:04.229> she<00:02:04.409> ends<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> combination<00:02:05.790> with<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
but she ends the combination with a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.490 
but she ends the combination with a
double<00:02:06.180> toe<00:02:06.329> loop<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> add<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.990> rotations

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
double toe loop so you add the rotations

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.949 
double toe loop so you add the rotations
three<00:02:08.099> and<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.250> half<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> triple<00:02:08.879> axel<00:02:09.000> two

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
three and a half for a triple axel two

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.690 
three and a half for a triple axel two
for<00:02:10.470> double<00:02:10.560> toe<00:02:10.830> loop<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.160> five<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> half

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
for double toe loop that's five and half

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.770 
for double toe loop that's five and half
revolutions<00:02:12.239> triple<00:02:12.930> triple<00:02:13.200> combination

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
revolutions triple triple combination

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.240 
revolutions triple triple combination
not<00:02:13.930> only<00:02:14.050> get<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.410> keep<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.709> speed<00:02:14.950> off<00:02:15.130> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
not only get to keep the speed off the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.620 
not only get to keep the speed off the
first<00:02:15.459> trip<00:02:15.640> bowl<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.569> do

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
first trip bowl but you have to do

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.270 
first trip bowl but you have to do
another<00:02:16.840> triple<00:02:17.230> on<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.380> landing<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:17.830> six

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
another triple on the landing that's six

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.309 
another triple on the landing that's six
revolutions<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.569> actually<00:02:19.900> worth<00:02:20.080> more

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
revolutions so it's actually worth more

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.949 
revolutions so it's actually worth more
points<00:02:20.350> so<00:02:20.980> as<00:02:21.160> much<00:02:21.670> as<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.880> triple<00:02:22.240> axel<00:02:22.360> miles

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
points so as much as a triple axel miles

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.480 
points so as much as a triple axel miles
the<00:02:23.110> only<00:02:23.380> woman<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.680> world<00:02:23.860> that's<00:02:24.190> done

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
the only woman in the world that's done

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.949 
the only woman in the world that's done
it's<00:02:24.670> done<00:02:24.819> it<00:02:25.000> and<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> first<00:02:25.420> time<00:02:25.600> Olympic

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
it's done it and the first time Olympic

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.940 
it's done it and the first time Olympic
history<00:02:26.200> has<00:02:26.350> been<00:02:26.500> done<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.740> short

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
history has been done in the short

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.949 
history has been done in the short
program<00:02:27.240> it's<00:02:28.240> still<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> half<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.750> revolution

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
program it's still a half a revolution

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.870 
program it's still a half a revolution
less<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:29.980> a<00:02:30.010> triple<00:02:30.400> triple<00:02:30.670> combination

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
less and so a triple triple combination

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.690 
less and so a triple triple combination
is<00:02:31.330> still<00:02:31.930> much<00:02:32.200> more<00:02:32.230> difficult<00:02:32.709> and<00:02:33.580> very

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
is still much more difficult and very

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.120 
is still much more difficult and very
quickly<00:02:34.150> Kim<00:02:34.450> Yuna<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.750> almost<00:02:35.590> five<00:02:35.830> points

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
quickly Kim Yuna is almost five points

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.960 
quickly Kim Yuna is almost five points
ahead<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.340> everybody<00:02:36.610> else<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.150> she<00:02:37.300> catchable

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
ahead of everybody else is she catchable

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.360 
ahead of everybody else is she catchable
hmm<00:02:40.020> she's<00:02:41.020> going<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.230> have<00:02:41.380> to<00:02:41.500> really<00:02:42.100> fall

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
hmm she's going to have to really fall

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.309 
hmm she's going to have to really fall
apart<00:02:42.730> okay<00:02:43.180> for<00:02:43.390> anybody<00:02:43.720> else<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.959> catch<00:02:44.140> her

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
apart okay for anybody else to catch her

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.860 
apart okay for anybody else to catch her
in<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.280> was<00:02:45.370> saying<00:02:45.910> earlier<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.660> one

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
in you know I was saying earlier the one

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.330 
in you know I was saying earlier the one
of<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.140> best<00:02:47.290> biographies<00:02:47.830> I've<00:02:47.980> ever<00:02:48.130> read

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
of the best biographies I've ever read

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.670 
of the best biographies I've ever read
was<00:02:48.550> Seabiscuit<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.330> Seabiscuit<00:02:50.110> was<00:02:50.380> known

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
was Seabiscuit and Seabiscuit was known

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.770 
was Seabiscuit and Seabiscuit was known
for<00:02:50.860> breaking<00:02:51.070> down<00:02:51.400> other<00:02:51.580> horses<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.300> when

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
for breaking down other horses and when

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.020 
for breaking down other horses and when
I<00:02:52.810> look<00:02:53.140> at<00:02:53.320> her<00:02:53.709> biggest<00:02:53.920> competition<00:02:54.700> like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
I look at her biggest competition like

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.940 
I look at her biggest competition like
you<00:02:55.720> knows<00:02:55.870> biggest<00:02:56.200> competition<00:02:56.680> is<00:02:56.709> Mao

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
you knows biggest competition is Mao

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.430 
you knows biggest competition is Mao
Mao's<00:02:57.850> going<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.180> triple<00:02:58.720> axels<00:02:59.140> and<00:02:59.350> two

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
Mao's going to triple axels and two

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.860 
Mao's going to triple axels and two
triple<00:02:59.709> flips<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:01.209> probably<00:03:01.540> is<00:03:01.720> going

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
triple flips but that probably is going

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.990 
triple flips but that probably is going
to<00:03:01.959> be<00:03:02.050> enough<00:03:02.319> because<00:03:02.590> when<00:03:03.519> you<00:03:03.610> add<00:03:03.760> up<00:03:03.790> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
to be enough because when you add up the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.090 
to be enough because when you add up the
points<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.540> when<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> look<00:03:04.870> at<00:03:05.019> what<00:03:05.350> what

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
points and when you look at what what

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.240 
points and when you look at what what
Kim<00:03:06.550> Yuna<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.819> rewarded<00:03:07.510> for<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:08.250> it's
