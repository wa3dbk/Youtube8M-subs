00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 He was the most successful film in 2013 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.810
 German cinemas and also a small one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.130
 surprise victory and its continuation 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.630
 is expecting us this year in cinemas 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.880
 and with that we take a look at the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.750
 to remunerate teasers 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.100
 2 a really good teacher designed 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
 teach always descriptive 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
 The man put dicks in the women 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.369
 then send them out in there 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 until the browser itself came and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.039
 further can watch the film topmodel 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 for the elementary students 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 they are the little ones I thought 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.670
 that a smoking child killed two he 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 goes on international class rides 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 I will certainly do the land with it 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:55.309
 weak market as well as cloud and 21 18 in the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:55.309
 cinema welcome to berlin clear 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.190
 is only a small teaser because 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.809
 There is not much to tell about the story 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.509
 but basically we should make it clear 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.190
 are back because fact goethe 2 brings 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.320
 us constantin film expected from 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.000
 the tenth of september 2015 in the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.680
 german cinemas and animal in this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.509
 Of course teaser is just this and 2 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 Rhinoceros caches that way a bit 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.320
 the inferior intelligence of the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.909
 Class 9b back in the foreground 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.979
 wants to move back and what do you do of course 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.930
 in a continuation man grabs everyone 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.670
 together and is going on a big trip because 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.680
 the new b drives the way it looks 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.509
 to thailand and that means great 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.920
 class drive there is a whole lot around 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.899
 getting to know new people and before 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.670
 also a huge roadtrip 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.590
 chaos that we can live together and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.119
 Of course you wanted to go to the success of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.830
 Once upon a time goethe torches flare up 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.750
 but it is good to hope 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.789
 because bora dagtekin the director that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.259
 the same from the first day among others 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.330
 but also with the inventer of Turkish 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.950
 for beginners and already shown that 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.780
 he felt a super good sense when it comes to it 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 is going to stage actors 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.659
 Nice timing in front of the camera 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 capture and the americans 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.170
 karoline herfurth katja riemann and 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.549
 again others from the first part again 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.509
 Of course I could always be there 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.250
 Ensemble now a bit 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.780
 played again really nice 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.829
 prove in front of the camera but of course 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.750
 there is also a bit of pressure afterwards 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.280
 so in the second part should therefore be called 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 I'm always curious even if 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 I use this money with these elementary students 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.900
 not really here in this teaser 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.220
 I like to top that success 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.810
 At least there is a big one 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.370
 goodbye from the tenth of september what 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.750
 tell them about this first teaser shots 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.250
 like to be in the comments because I am 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.320
 through with this video can load one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.850
 thumb there if you leave that word 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.320
 stay if not know otherwise 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.700
 There are still a few left around me 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.100
