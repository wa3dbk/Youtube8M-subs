00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
that we learn is by going back to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.499 
that we learn is by going back to
fundamentals<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.040> practicing<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:11.940> over

and over again till we really have them

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.300 
and over again till we really have them
off<00:00:14.519> pat<00:00:15.179> now<00:00:15.929> if<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> remember<00:00:16.680> back<00:00:16.949> in<00:00:17.010> the
