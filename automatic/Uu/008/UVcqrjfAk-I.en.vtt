cabinets right off place them on the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.849

00:01:10.849 --> 00:01:10.859 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:13.649 

by<00:01:11.859> the<00:01:11.920> way<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.549> heavier<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.329> the<00:01:13.479> two

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
by the way the heavier of the two

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.349 
by the way the heavier of the two
cabinets<00:01:13.899> weights<00:01:14.770> about<00:01:15.039> 75<00:01:15.729> pounds<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:16.359

cabinets weights about 75 pounds the
lighter<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.750> the<00:01:16.899> two<00:01:17.020> weighs<00:01:17.649> about<00:01:17.829> half

lighter of the two weighs about half

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.350 
lighter of the two weighs about half
back<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:20.200> each<00:01:20.409> one<00:01:20.710> comes<00:01:21.340> with<00:01:21.490> protection

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
back now each one comes with protection

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.880 
back now each one comes with protection
cover<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:23.110> like<00:01:23.289> a<00:01:23.319> seat<00:01:23.619> here<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.770> the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
cover just like a seat here and the

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.169 
cover just like a seat here and the
reason<00:01:27.219> to<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.399> big<00:01:27.579> difference<00:01:27.969> in<00:01:28.090> the

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
reason to the big difference in the

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:29.999 
reason to the big difference in the
weight<00:01:28.360> is<00:01:28.509> because<00:01:28.810> the<00:01:28.959> top<00:01:29.170> cabinet<00:01:29.439> which

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
weight is because the top cabinet which

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.469 
weight is because the top cabinet which
we're<00:01:30.189> going<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.340> see<00:01:30.459> in<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.610> minute<00:01:30.909> has<00:01:31.149> all

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
we're going to see in a minute has all

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.569 
we're going to see in a minute has all
the<00:01:31.509> components<00:01:31.780> completely<00:01:32.649> locked<00:01:32.920> in<00:01:33.219> and

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 
the components completely locked in and

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.580 
the components completely locked in and
loaded<00:01:34.299> so<00:01:34.450> that<00:01:34.479> you<00:01:34.689> don't<00:01:34.959> have<00:01:35.110> to<00:01:35.259> connect

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
loaded so that you don't have to connect

00:01:35.590 --> 00:02:02.630 
loaded so that you don't have to connect
anything<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:37.509> where<00:01:37.899> your

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.030 

if<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.720> see<00:02:03.900> how<00:02:04.020> easily<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> pops<00:02:04.830> into

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
if you see how easily that pops into

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:15.720 
if you see how easily that pops into
place<00:02:05.160> as<00:02:06.060> well

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.370 

so<00:02:16.730> just<00:02:16.970> like<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.150> it's<00:02:17.569> all<00:02:17.750> set<00:02:18.050> up<00:02:18.080> and

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
so just like that it's all set up and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.740 
so just like that it's all set up and
locked<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.310> loaded<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:20.060> can<00:02:20.209> see<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.540> light

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
locked and loaded you can see how light

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.160 
locked and loaded you can see how light
commutes<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.530> yet<00:02:21.890> it's<00:02:22.040> still<00:02:22.130> very<00:02:22.430> stormy
