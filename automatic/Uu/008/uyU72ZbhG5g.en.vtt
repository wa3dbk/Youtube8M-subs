rust<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.170> it's<00:00:22.769> annoying<00:00:23.100> when<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
rust and it's annoying when the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.339 
rust and it's annoying when the
stainless<00:00:24.600> steel<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.340> whatever<00:00:26.340> these<00:00:27.349> for
