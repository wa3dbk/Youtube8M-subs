00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.550
 very good to all welcome to the new 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.319
 tutorial in which we will learn a 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.220
 system to connect the purse to 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.220
 our recreational machine 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.570
 for this system we will use a 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.320
 electronic purse like the one they are 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.320
 watching on screen 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.250
 a 12 volt relay relay 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.610
 a source of power exactly 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.610
 we will use the cable moles of it 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.570
 and any button on a joystick to which 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.570
 we will perform the hack 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.829
 if you look closely at these two 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.750
 purses in the part that I am 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.340
 selecting cables will be connected 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.260
 that will feed the purse with the 12 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.840
 volts and in turn the purse us 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.450
 will send a pulse giving us a credit in 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.489
 our machine 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.140
 in this section we can replace the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.090
 currency with which we want it to work 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.280
 the purse 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.530
 and this is the most important part that 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.240
 we have to know where the 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.880
 instructions on how we should connect 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.649
 our purse correctly of those 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 options we will only use three of them 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:22.850
 the first where it says power of cee where 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.130
 will be connected the 12 volts that 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.670
 will feed the purse the second where 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.740
 the dry in signar caput is the cable that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.350
 will send us the signal to the purse 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.630
 our machine and in the third part of 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.500
 that ground gn that is what will make 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.500
 earth or mass 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.630
 of the molex connector will only serve us two 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.310
 cables 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.580
 the yellow cable that he hands us 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.530
 just 12 volts 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:58.010
 and any of the two black wires 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.010
 that will serve us as land or as a negative 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 this is the 12 volt relay that we're going 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.160
 to use which will serve us as 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.590
 switch or switch in our 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.750
 small circuit 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.860
 the following diagram shows us how 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.870
 is this relay internally 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.090
 how can you see each black dot of 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.290
 our diagram represents each 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.939
 terminal of our relay 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.310
 and how can they realize in the 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:29.040
 diagram in these two points there are 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.930
 continuity then when it connects 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.450
 12 volts to any of these two 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.840
 points passes electric current through this 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.250
 coil which creates a magnetic field and 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.010
 therefore, there is no longer 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.209
 continuity at this point and happens to have 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.209
 continuity in the next 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.970
 and after this little explanation 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.950
 step to leave the following diagram 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.050
 complete how they should connect 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.240
 correctly all the cables so that 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.390
 operate our machine with a purse 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.390
 electronic 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.200
 in this diagram we go step by step what 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.600
 first that we look at will be in the 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.090
 molex connector as you can see it comes out a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.520
 yellow line which feeds 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.520
 of 12 volts to the relay that also 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.230
 12 volt power to the coin purse 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.840
 the same way a line of 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.450
 black color of the molex connector which 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.700
 is connected to the negative of the purse 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.220
 now of the purse how can be fixed 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.260
 a red line comes out which 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.000
 represents the signal that the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.360
 purse when we place a 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.190
 currency 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.410
 when we place a coin and 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 the purse recognizes this currency sends 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.830
 this signal which is connected to the pin 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.750
 number one of our watch 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.720
 this same signal creates a short in the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.520
 internal coil of our nativity scene cutting 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.280
 the continuity of the first point and 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.830
 passing the continuity to the next 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.870
 and in this way the phase and the earth of 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.610
 button of our joystick come together and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.760
 create a pulse by sending our 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.610
 recreational machine and giving us a 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.170
 credit in our favorite game 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.400
 this diagram will leave you in the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.740
 description of the video so that if 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.380
 they have at hand and they can see it when 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.640
 you wish and good friends this has 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.590
 been everything for today I hope you have 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.900
 liked the tutorial and with the small 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.359
 they are recreational acrylics do not forget 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.160
 to share it like if they liked it and 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.340
 remember it was the hendry and even the 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.090
 next 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.090
 now 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.860
 but not
