do is measure between the post about 38
inches<00:00:23.330> let<00:00:24.330> me<00:00:24.480> measure<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.960> height<00:00:26.330> which

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
inches let me measure the height which

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.580 
inches let me measure the height which
is<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.920> little<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.130> 30<00:00:29.369> inches<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:30.199> put<00:00:31.199> on<00:00:31.320> some

set<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.250> being<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.579> I'm<00:00:38.790> making<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> 35<00:00:40.280> 38

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
set up being that I'm making it 35 38

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.830 
set up being that I'm making it 35 38
inches<00:00:42.770> I'll<00:00:43.770> make<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.910> block<00:00:45.180> equal<00:00:45.629> two

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
inches I'll make one block equal two

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
inches I'll make one block equal two
inches<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.070> it'll<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.340> easy<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.700> transfer<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
inches so it'll be easy to transfer it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.160 
inches so it'll be easy to transfer it
over<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.750> wood<00:00:50.510> okay<00:00:51.539> here's<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:52.110> two

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

like this when we're finished a router

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.020 
like this when we're finished a router
table<00:01:51.039> would<00:01:51.219> have<00:01:51.250> been<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> better<00:01:51.670> choice

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
table would have been a better choice

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.630 
table would have been a better choice
but<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.049> just<00:01:53.289> got<00:01:53.469> a<00:01:53.500> new<00:01:53.710> set<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> dado<00:01:54.250> blades

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
rabbit cuts on it and corresponding cuts

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.009 
rabbit cuts on it and corresponding cuts
on<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:08.200> actual<00:02:08.560> shelf<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:10.509> will<00:02:10.690> be<00:02:10.810> the
