that's<00:00:26.789> all<00:00:26.939> I'd<00:00:27.089> ever<00:00:27.210> heard<00:00:27.449> about<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> game

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that's all I'd ever heard about the game

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
that's all I'd ever heard about the game
so<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> just<00:00:28.830> assumed<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.339> horrible<00:00:29.820> and

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
so I just assumed it was horrible and

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
so I just assumed it was horrible and
this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.570> why<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:31.019> never<00:00:31.199> assume<00:00:31.710> I'm

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
this is why we never assume I'm

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
this is why we never assume I'm

it's never been one that's really
appealed<00:00:35.490> to<00:00:35.610> me<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.970> kind<00:00:36.150> of<00:00:36.210> seems<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.600> me

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
appealed to me it kind of seems to me

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.390 
appealed to me it kind of seems to me
like<00:00:36.900> it's<00:00:37.050> part<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.470> popcorn<00:00:37.830> flick

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
mind about that but it reminded me

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.120 
mind about that but it reminded me
that's<00:00:42.570> straying<00:00:42.870> from<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.230> usual<00:00:43.410> genres

every once in a while it can be a lot of
fun<00:00:45.810> the<00:00:45.990> gameplay<00:00:46.290> is<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> blast<00:00:47.040> although<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
fun the gameplay is a blast although the

controls get continuously more confusing

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.540 
controls get continuously more confusing
as<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.070> play

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
as you play

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
as you play
well<00:00:50.790> maybe<00:00:51.090> not<00:00:51.360> confusing<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.200> understood<00:00:52.710> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
well maybe not confusing I understood it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
well maybe not confusing I understood it
it<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.220> just<00:00:53.460> hard<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.790> master<00:00:54.150> which<00:00:54.540> trigger

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it was just hard to master which trigger

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.300 
it was just hard to master which trigger
you're<00:00:55.080> holding<00:00:55.380> down<00:00:55.530> determines<00:00:56.100> which

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
you're holding down determines which

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.160 
you're holding down determines which
type<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.640> attack<00:00:57.150> you<00:00:57.180> use<00:00:57.630> there<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.110> these

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
type of attack you use there are these

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.230 
type of attack you use there are these
light<00:00:58.500> blue<00:00:58.680> attacks<00:00:59.160> or<00:00:59.460> these<00:00:59.610> red<00:00:59.880> attacks

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
light blue attacks or these red attacks

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.270 
light blue attacks or these red attacks
or<00:01:00.540> there's<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.930> neutral<00:01:01.470> tax<00:01:01.740> that<00:01:02.010> happen

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
or there's these neutral tax that happen

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
or there's these neutral tax that happen
when<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.520> hold<00:01:02.700> down<00:01:02.790> no<00:01:03.210> triggers<00:01:03.660> some

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
when you hold down no triggers some

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
when you hold down no triggers some
monsters<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.620> only<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:05.070> hurt<00:01:05.309> by<00:01:05.460> certain

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
monsters can only be hurt by certain

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.160 
monsters can only be hurt by certain
attacks<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.480> have<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.840> sure<00:01:07.050> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
attacks so you have to be sure to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
attacks so you have to be sure to
remember<00:01:07.350> which<00:01:07.710> monsters<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.550> be<00:01:08.640> hurt<00:01:08.850> by

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
remember which monsters can be hurt by

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
remember which monsters can be hurt by
what<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> which<00:01:09.840> trigger<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.440> need<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.770> press

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
what and which trigger you need to press

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.220 
what and which trigger you need to press
basically<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.300> lot<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> options<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
basically it's just a lot of options to

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.260 
basically it's just a lot of options to
choose<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> fly<00:01:14.520> I'm<00:01:14.880> sure<00:01:15.060> other

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
choose from on the fly I'm sure other

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
choose from on the fly I'm sure other
people<00:01:15.330> struggled<00:01:16.050> with<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.320> far<00:01:16.620> less<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
people struggled with it far less than I

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740 
people struggled with it far less than I
did<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.700> never<00:01:17.909> really<00:01:18.180> felt<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
did but I never really felt like I

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.570 
did but I never really felt like I
totally<00:01:19.230> got<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> down<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.980> was<00:01:20.070> fun<00:01:20.340> though

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
totally got it down it was fun though

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.790 
totally got it down it was fun though
hacking<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.240> slashing<00:01:21.390> away<00:01:21.900> at<00:01:22.050> demons<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
hacking and slashing away at demons the

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.740 
hacking and slashing away at demons the
story<00:01:23.040> isn't<00:01:23.280> super<00:01:23.760> interesting<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
story isn't super interesting and the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
story isn't super interesting and the
twist<00:01:25.140> ending<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:25.920> obvious<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
twist ending was so obvious that it

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
twist ending was so obvious that it
actually<00:01:27.210> made<00:01:27.390> me<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.990> angry<00:01:28.440> that

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
actually made me a little bit angry that

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.080 
actually made me a little bit angry that
they<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:28.920> went<00:01:29.220> through<00:01:29.460> with<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.909> guess

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
they even went through with it I guess

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.399 
they even went through with it I guess
that's<00:01:30.270> another<00:01:30.390> reason<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.020> feels<00:01:31.140> like

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that's another reason it feels like

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
that's another reason it feels like
playing<00:01:31.650> through<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> popcorn<00:01:32.220> flick<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.880> me

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
playing through a popcorn flick to me

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.030 
playing through a popcorn flick to me
