 the scarlet runner flash the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.469
 1989 batman smash opened the 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.870
 Hollywood doors to many characters 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.940
 not only from the comic but also 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.280
 some created or converted into the 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.499
 same gloomy tone that Tim burton used 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.929
 in his film they did not wait and 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.480

 the shinny ninja turtles at 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.769
 tragic and vengeful dark man and even 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.870
 the ultra patriotic capitan america had 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.839
 your opportunity in a cheap and 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.780
 disastrous production this right right 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.630
 to the video well there were many other attempts 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.210
 some with better results than others 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.460
 and the small screen was not free 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.620
 of the attempt to get on the profits 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.450
 of the superheroes taking series 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.039
 based on various franky 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.960
 and that directly made for 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.600
 TV 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.790
 the argument the series is based on the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.979
 famous character of the dc comics of 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.260

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.940
 the comics the whole plot of the series is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.369

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.760

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.620
 enemies and protecting the city from 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:51.510
 they as mentioned the series made 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.970
 some changes to the history of comics 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.090
 to adapt it to television for example 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.609
 barry was investigating and bng 'not the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.890
 death of his brother and alen in the 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.319

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.900
 person who was flash during the second

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.379
 comics barry uses a ring with a 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.480
 complex hydro compression technology 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.430
 of molecules but this ring was 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.069
 too unreal for the series of 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.810
 television the first villain that he 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.180
 faced flash in the series was the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.549

 altered in a way that could be 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.450
 adapt to tone of the series in one of the 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.299
 final episodes a clone appears

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.760
 leonard is 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.890
 the series premiered in 1990 a year 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.890
 after the tim batman movie 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.410
 burton and the influence is evident the 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.600
 series was dark it focused more on the 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.940
 neighborhood aspect in as a scientist and 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.340
 detective that in science fiction the 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.220
 superhero creating a series of action 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.530

 batman on the program the actor john 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.380
 wesley was interpreted neighborhood in with the 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.180
 optimism joviality and curiosity that 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.940
 characterized the character in the 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.490
 comics no doubt the series was entertaining 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.590
 and it's one of the best attempts by 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.260
 take a character from the comics to the 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:30.080
 television the only season that 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.820
 is filmed on DVD series 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.280
 was canceled because its 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.320
 budget continued to increase and 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.540
 transmission schedules put it to 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.050
 compete with series that had a greater 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:44.000
 audience number like the simpsons 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.100
 some of the most relevant episodes 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.270
 as the two-hour pilot and the two 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.900
 trick appearances 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.210
 that had already been released in vhs are 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.620
 available on youtube or other sites 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.199

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.930
 adaptation to the small screen of this 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:14.180
 character believe me it is highly recommended
