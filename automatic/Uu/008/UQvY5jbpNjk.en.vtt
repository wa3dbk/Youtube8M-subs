chromatically to go to chord 6 so why
did<00:02:40.519> there<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:44.510> don't<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.840> play<00:02:44.959> this

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
did there you don't have to play this

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.330 
did there you don't have to play this
one<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.410> can<00:02:45.530> buy<00:02:45.620> any<00:02:45.769> voicing<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.130> want<00:02:46.280> you

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
one you can buy any voicing you want you

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.400 
one you can buy any voicing you want you
can<00:02:46.459> just<00:02:46.519> go<00:02:46.609> down<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:46.940> basic<00:02:47.390> triad

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.900 

only<00:02:51.040> nasty<00:02:51.550> or<00:02:52.300> you<00:02:52.780> can<00:02:52.930> add<00:02:53.110> in<00:02:53.260> some

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
only nasty or you can add in some

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.160 
only nasty or you can add in some
extensions<00:02:54.910> of<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.030> court<00:02:55.390> what<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.020> was

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
extensions of that court what I was

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:26.100 
extensions of that court what I was
playing<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:56.950> example<00:03:17.970> 37<00:03:24.660> like<00:03:25.660> u7<00:03:25.990> then

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
playing in the example 37 like u7 then

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.110 
playing in the example 37 like u7 then
leads<00:03:26.320> back<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.830> a7<00:03:27.280> chord<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.580> think

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
leads back to the a7 chord if you think

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:48.380 
leads back to the a7 chord if you think
about<00:03:31.240> this<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.470> course<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.040> basic<00:03:45.700> order<00:03:46.030> one

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
about this so course I basic order one

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.950 
about this so course I basic order one
I'd<00:03:49.390> be<00:03:49.420> throwing<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:51.030> 602<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.660> those<00:03:52.780> are<00:03:52.870> the

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
I'd be throwing in 602 so those are the

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:22.170 
I'd be throwing in 602 so those are the
two<00:03:53.080> ones<00:03:53.230> I've<00:03:53.500> really<00:03:53.860> added<00:03:54.700> and<00:03:55.000> mixed

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:38.490 

so<00:04:23.650> basically<00:04:35.440> that's<00:04:36.440> what<00:04:36.530> let's<00:04:36.740> change<00:04:36.950> it

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
so basically that's what let's change it

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.470 
so basically that's what let's change it
okay<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:39.560> that<00:04:40.010> basically<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.400> sequence<00:04:40.820> pay

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
okay so that basically the sequence pay

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.720 
okay so that basically the sequence pay
for<00:04:41.660> you<00:04:41.920> after<00:04:42.920> the<00:04:43.010> sequence<00:04:43.310> I<00:04:43.400> paid<00:04:43.580> little

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
for you after the sequence I paid little

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.180 
for you after the sequence I paid little
was<00:04:44.480> known<00:04:44.600> as<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.870> turnaround<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.590> think<00:04:46.130> I've

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
was known as the turnaround I think I've

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.280 
was known as the turnaround I think I've
done<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.370> video<00:04:46.490> I'll<00:04:46.730> turn<00:04:46.880> around<00:04:46.970> before

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
done a video I'll turn around before

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.810 
done a video I'll turn around before
just<00:04:48.290> to<00:04:48.350> recap<00:04:48.620> turnarounds<00:04:49.490> basically

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
just to recap turnarounds basically

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.000 
just to recap turnarounds basically
which<00:04:50.060> leads<00:04:50.330> back<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.630> the<00:04:50.840> next<00:04:51.020> verse<00:04:51.290> so

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
which leads back to the next verse so

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:05.970 
which leads back to the next verse so
the<00:04:52.460> cores<00:04:53.450> are<00:04:53.510> used<00:04:53.690> for<00:04:53.780> the<00:04:53.900> turnaround

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.550 

the<00:05:07.780> basic<00:05:08.780> theory<00:05:08.990> behind<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.260> is<00:05:09.380> it's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
the basic theory behind that is it's

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.350 
the basic theory behind that is it's
called<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.800> tritone<00:05:09.980> substitution<00:05:10.730> again<00:05:11.120> I

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
called a tritone substitution again I

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.580 
called a tritone substitution again I
won't<00:05:11.450> go<00:05:11.540> into<00:05:11.720> this<00:05:11.840> video<00:05:12.110> as<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:12.440> quite

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
won't go into this video as it's quite

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.170 
won't go into this video as it's quite
complicated<00:05:13.120> but<00:05:14.120> basically<00:05:15.010> d7<00:05:16.010> chord<00:05:16.180> that

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
complicated but basically d7 chord that

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
complicated but basically d7 chord that
means<00:05:17.360> batter<00:05:18.340> g7

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:33.420 

that<00:05:26.200> turnaround<00:05:26.530> sequence<00:05:26.980> was<00:05:29.430> 787<00:05:32.430> the

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
that turnaround sequence was 787 the

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.430 
that turnaround sequence was 787 the
match<00:05:33.610> of<00:05:33.790> G<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.750> that's<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.990> way<00:05:35.080> I've

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
match of G so that's the way I've

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.690 
match of G so that's the way I've
changed<00:05:35.740> the<00:05:35.800> table<00:05:36.190> this<00:05:36.310> is<00:05:36.400> obviously

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
changed the table this is obviously

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.210 
changed the table this is obviously
newest<00:05:37.390> ways<00:05:37.600> of<00:05:37.810> changing<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.290> but<00:05:38.920> that's<00:05:39.040> a

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
newest ways of changing it but that's a

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.190 
newest ways of changing it but that's a
standard<00:05:39.580> way<00:05:39.700> of<00:05:39.730> doing<00:05:40.030> it<00:05:40.150> when<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.600> must<00:05:41.110> be

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
standard way of doing it when I must be

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.010 
standard way of doing it when I must be
doing<00:05:41.440> a<00:05:41.500> groove<00:05:42.450> and<00:05:43.450> that's<00:05:43.630> all<00:05:43.720> I<00:05:43.810> want<00:05:43.960> to

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
doing a groove and that's all I want to

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.510 
doing a groove and that's all I want to
say<00:05:44.080> in<00:05:44.170> this<00:05:44.230> video<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.770> hope<00:05:45.190> this<00:05:45.340> video

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
say in this video I hope this video

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.580 
say in this video I hope this video
helps<00:05:45.790> and<00:05:45.970> please<00:05:46.690> feel<00:05:46.870> free<00:05:47.200> to<00:05:47.350> leave<00:05:47.530> a

comment<00:05:47.770> about<00:05:48.070> anything<00:05:48.370> we'll<00:05:48.730> see<00:05:48.910> in<00:05:49.000> the
