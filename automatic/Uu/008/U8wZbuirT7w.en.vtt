 new developments for mine 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.720
 evolutions and with itself and the particularity is 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 that the number is greatly increased 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.400

 I realized that historical but nice 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.970
 the urban grass is beautiful, they invent themselves 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.990
 of a few and therefore we find another 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.750

 a fight so he challenges us and guys 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:49.050

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:04.389
 will do in two parts and then aimed them like this 

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:05.710
 it will be easier to do the whole zig zag a 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:12.280
