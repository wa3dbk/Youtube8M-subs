I

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.140 

here<00:00:10.710> at<00:00:10.799> the<00:00:10.950> aberdeen<00:00:11.219> skatepark<00:00:11.820> us<00:00:11.940> out<00:00:12.059> to

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
here at the aberdeen skatepark us out to

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.720 
here at the aberdeen skatepark us out to
go

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
go

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.630 
go
driver<00:00:14.920> there's<00:00:15.920> two<00:00:16.070> things<00:00:16.250> you<00:00:16.369> have<00:00:16.490> to

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
driver there's two things you have to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.740 
driver there's two things you have to
know<00:00:16.670> before<00:00:17.029> you<00:00:17.060> start<00:00:17.180> trying<00:00:17.449> the<00:00:17.570> truck

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
know before you start trying the truck

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.929 
know before you start trying the truck
driver<00:00:17.990> and<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.830> first<00:00:19.039> is<00:00:19.189> a<00:00:19.220> 180<00:00:19.609> bar<00:00:19.730> spin

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
driver and the first is a 180 bar spin

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.589 
driver and the first is a 180 bar spin
in<00:00:20.090> the<00:00:20.119> second<00:00:21.009> and<00:00:22.090> so<00:00:23.090> what<00:00:23.329> you<00:00:23.419> have<00:00:23.480> to

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599 
in the second and so what you have to

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.380 
in the second and so what you have to
know<00:00:24.079> about<00:00:24.110> the<00:00:24.439> one<00:00:24.560> of<00:00:24.680> us<00:00:24.919> man<00:00:25.130> is<00:00:25.369> first<00:00:26.239> it

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
know about the one of us man is first it

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.939 
know about the one of us man is first it
shouldn't<00:00:26.630> be<00:00:26.840> on<00:00:26.989> a<00:00:27.020> slant<00:00:27.470> even<00:00:27.890> though

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:27.949 
shouldn't be on a slant even though

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.060 
shouldn't be on a slant even though
that's<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.189> good<00:00:28.220> start<00:00:28.579> I'll<00:00:29.210> make<00:00:29.419> with<00:00:29.660> that

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.500 

what<00:00:34.070> it<00:00:34.190> should<00:00:34.370> be<00:00:34.400> is<00:00:34.699> I<00:00:34.940> could<00:00:35.089> just<00:00:35.239> aren't

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
what it should be is I could just aren't

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.310 
what it should be is I could just aren't
flat<00:00:36.160> with<00:00:37.330> so<00:00:38.330> you're<00:00:38.540> gonna<00:00:38.629> go<00:00:38.839> on<00:00:39.019> class

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
flat with so you're gonna go on class

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.270 
flat with so you're gonna go on class
and<00:00:40.269> get<00:00:41.269> a<00:00:41.300> fake<00:00:41.510> you<00:00:41.629> out<00:00:41.660> probably<00:00:42.500> half<00:00:42.680> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
and get a fake you out probably half the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200 
and get a fake you out probably half the
best<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.390> the<00:00:45.520> bar<00:00:46.520> spin<00:00:46.730> should<00:00:46.910> be<00:00:47.000> caught

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
best and the bar spin should be caught

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.709 
best and the bar spin should be caught
like<00:00:48.020> come<00:00:48.949> on<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.160> ground<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.670> then<00:00:49.820> land<00:00:50.059> or

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
like come on the ground and then land or

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:51.849 
like come on the ground and then land or
else<00:00:50.870> you<00:00:51.020> won't<00:00:51.110> be<00:00:51.289> able<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.500> start<00:00:51.649> cover

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
else you won't be able to start cover

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.000 
else you won't be able to start cover
and<00:00:52.280> then<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.730> third<00:00:52.760> thing<00:00:52.940> is<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:54.010> you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
and then the third thing is that you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.680 
and then the third thing is that you
should<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:55.430> spreading<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.030> bars<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
should be spreading the bars the

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.170 
should be spreading the bars the
opposite<00:00:57.109> way<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.469> Europe<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.579> for<00:00:58.879> me<00:00:58.969> I'm

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
opposite way that Europe so for me I'm

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.840 
opposite way that Europe so for me I'm
irregular<00:01:00.109> cut<00:01:00.469> the<00:01:00.620> morgue<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:01.760> I'm

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
irregular cut the morgue and so I'm

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.869 
irregular cut the morgue and so I'm
going<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.120> 180<00:01:02.780> clockwise<00:01:03.289> and<00:01:04.009> spin<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:04.699> bars

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
going to 180 clockwise and spin the bars

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.400 
going to 180 clockwise and spin the bars
counterclockwise<00:01:05.479> that's<00:01:05.960> going<00:01:06.140> to<00:01:06.200> make<00:01:06.259> it

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
counterclockwise that's going to make it

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.560 
counterclockwise that's going to make it
a<00:01:06.470> whole<00:01:06.649> lot<00:01:06.679> easier<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.970> second<00:01:08.330> thing<00:01:08.420> is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
a whole lot easier the second thing is

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.990 
a whole lot easier the second thing is
you<00:01:08.810> have<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:09.080> know<00:01:09.170> how<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.289> 360<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.039> the<00:01:10.490> only

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
you have to know how to 360 and the only

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.460 
you have to know how to 360 and the only
thing<00:01:11.149> I<00:01:11.330> have<00:01:11.450> to<00:01:11.479> tell<00:01:11.690> you<00:01:11.780> about<00:01:11.869> that<00:01:11.960> is

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
thing I have to tell you about that is

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.910 
thing I have to tell you about that is
that<00:01:12.789> it<00:01:13.789> should<00:01:14.119> be<00:01:14.360> like<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.780> low<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.440> faster

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
that it should be like a low and faster

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.770 
that it should be like a low and faster
than<00:01:16.039> 60<00:01:16.399> I'm<00:01:16.580> sorry<00:01:16.820> I'll<00:01:17.210> show<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.509> what<00:01:17.660> I'm

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
than 60 I'm sorry I'll show you what I'm

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.609 
than 60 I'm sorry I'll show you what I'm
happening<00:01:18.050> on<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.459> this<00:01:19.759> one<00:01:20.000> will<00:01:20.959> be<00:01:21.110> low<00:01:21.380> and

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
happening on so this one will be low and

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:29.350 
happening on so this one will be low and
fast<00:01:23.590> um<00:01:24.590> but<00:01:25.429> what<00:01:25.849> you<00:01:26.000> want<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.420> do<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:28.360> like

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
fast um but what you want to do is like

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.960 
fast um but what you want to do is like
a<00:01:29.630> pyre<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.229> then<00:01:30.679> by<00:01:31.069> hoppy<00:01:31.280> higher<00:01:31.580> you'll

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
a pyre and then by hoppy higher you'll

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.180 
a pyre and then by hoppy higher you'll
be<00:01:32.149> able<00:01:32.239> to<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:32.630> it<00:01:32.840> rotates<00:01:33.259> Lord<00:01:33.890> and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
be able to like it rotates Lord and

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.030 
be able to like it rotates Lord and
you're<00:01:35.760> Baltimore<00:01:36.690> artistry<00:01:37.440> fixing<00:01:37.830> up<00:01:37.950> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
you're Baltimore artistry fixing up this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.020 
you're Baltimore artistry fixing up this
one<00:01:38.250> will<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.940> lot<00:01:39.210> easier

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:53.370 

so<00:01:43.930> you<00:01:43.990> don't<00:01:44.200> want<00:01:44.320> any<00:01:44.440> barchi<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:52.380> after

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
so you don't want any barchi so after

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.999 
so you don't want any barchi so after
you<00:01:53.500> learn<00:01:53.740> those<00:01:53.920> two<00:01:54.490> tricks<00:01:55.060> I<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.799> should

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
you learn those two tricks I you should

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.430 
you learn those two tricks I you should
start<00:01:57.250> practicing<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.850> motion<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.409> I

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
start practicing the motion and so I

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.320 
start practicing the motion and so I
usually<00:01:59.979> push<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.460> my<00:02:00.490> front<00:02:00.909> foot<00:02:00.970> what<00:02:01.240> I'm

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
usually push with my front foot what I'm

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.870 
usually push with my front foot what I'm
trying<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.690> even<00:02:02.619> though<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:03.009> normally<00:02:03.700> push

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
trying this even though I normally push

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.350 
trying this even though I normally push
back<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:05.399> then<00:02:06.399> you<00:02:06.610> just<00:02:06.790> look<00:02:06.940> at<00:02:07.060> just<00:02:07.270> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
back and then you just look at just the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.490 
back and then you just look at just the
load<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:09.850> like<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.690> bar<00:02:10.840> spin<00:02:11.080> should<00:02:11.350> be

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
load it like the bar spin should be

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.559 
load it like the bar spin should be
thrown<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.250> turf<00:02:12.489> ever<00:02:12.730> around<00:02:13.420> the

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
thrown in the turf ever around the

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.310 
thrown in the turf ever around the
middle<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.440> probably<00:02:14.770> around<00:02:15.010> by<00:02:15.870> 150<00:02:16.870> degrees

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
middle so probably around by 150 degrees

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.540 
middle so probably around by 150 degrees
to<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:17.820> 210<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.150> don't<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.930> know<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.830> around

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
to like 210 I don't I know just around

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.440 
to like 210 I don't I know just around
the<00:02:21.700> 18<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:24.730> will<00:02:24.910> feel<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.209> little

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
the 18 and so that will feel a little

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.530 
the 18 and so that will feel a little
later<00:02:25.750> than<00:02:26.050> him<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.130> 180<00:02:27.459> bar<00:02:27.670> smith<00:02:27.880> is

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
later than him just a 180 bar smith is

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.740 
later than him just a 180 bar smith is
so<00:02:28.900> just<00:02:29.380> as<00:02:30.040> long<00:02:30.130> as<00:02:30.250> you're<00:02:30.519> having<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.300> in

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
so just as long as you're having that in

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.620 
so just as long as you're having that in
practice<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.319> would<00:02:32.920> recommend<00:02:33.010> that<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
practice I would recommend that you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.190 
practice I would recommend that you
start<00:02:35.620> trying<00:02:35.800> to<00:02:35.920> flatten<00:02:36.280> I'm<00:02:36.970> a<00:02:37.120> bank<00:02:37.450> or<00:02:37.810> a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
start trying to flatten I'm a bank or a

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:55.390 
start trying to flatten I'm a bank or a
hit<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.950> i'll<00:02:39.069> show<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.280> those

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.380 

there<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.489> three<00:02:56.700> steps<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.180> truck<00:02:57.360> drivers

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
there are three steps for truck drivers

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.990 
there are three steps for truck drivers
first<00:02:58.379> carve<00:02:58.799> and<00:02:58.980> hop<00:02:59.129> like<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> normal<00:02:59.790> high

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
first carve and hop like a normal high

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.350 
first carve and hop like a normal high
360<00:03:00.750> around<00:03:01.500> 90<00:03:02.099> focus<00:03:02.430> only<00:03:02.549> on<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.849> bars<00:03:03.030> and

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
360 around 90 focus only on the bars and

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.390 
360 around 90 focus only on the bars and
just<00:03:03.480> close<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.019> 360<00:03:04.590> when<00:03:05.129> you've<00:03:05.220> caught

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
just close to the 360 when you've caught

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.610 
just close to the 360 when you've caught
the<00:03:05.430> bars<00:03:05.730> think<00:03:06.000> 360<00:03:06.569> good<00:03:06.750> unlike<00:03:07.440> this

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
the bars think 360 good unlike this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.020 
the bars think 360 good unlike this
horrible<00:03:08.010> example<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.640> should<00:03:08.790> turn<00:03:08.940> your

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
horrible example you should turn your

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.089 
horrible example you should turn your
head<00:03:09.180> towards<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.629> landing<00:03:10.849> all<00:03:11.849> right<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
head towards the landing all right so

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.319 
head towards the landing all right so
the<00:03:14.099> things<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.519> go<00:03:14.640> wrong<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.150> truck

what you have motion down and you're at

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.620 
what you have motion down and you're at
the<00:04:03.110> point<00:04:03.260> where<00:04:03.470> you're<00:04:03.560> just<00:04:03.650> looking<00:04:04.069> to

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
the point where you're just looking to

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.090 
the point where you're just looking to
make<00:04:05.630> sure<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.020> hopefully<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.620> land<00:04:06.800> it<00:04:06.950> i

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
make sure so hopefully you land it i

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.030 
make sure so hopefully you land it i
would<00:04:07.370> try<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:07.670> on<00:04:07.790> flat<00:04:08.060> instead<00:04:09.020> of<00:04:09.290> fly<00:04:09.860> out

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
would try it on flat instead of fly out

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.760 
would try it on flat instead of fly out
because<00:04:10.910> i<00:04:11.270> know<00:04:11.720> for<00:04:11.989> some<00:04:12.200> reason<00:04:12.230> these<00:04:12.590> are

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
because i know for some reason these are

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.520 
because i know for some reason these are
harder<00:04:13.010> glad<00:04:13.250> and<00:04:13.660> or<00:04:14.660> might<00:04:15.170> want<00:04:15.410> to<00:04:15.470> be

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
harder glad and or might want to be

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.319 
harder glad and or might want to be
other<00:04:15.650> thick<00:04:15.860> tissue<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.730> now<00:04:17.000> i'm<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.269> to
