00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.530
As far as my eyes can see

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.890
There is silver and gold ruling the world

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.230
As long as I could believe

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.770
I picked up love and hope and everything good

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.430
As far as my wings take me

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.370
Fighting and scrambling fill the world

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.730
With all the power I have

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.930
I was trying to hide such a world

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.110
I never thought I would find a sadness

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.030
within such a beautiful thing like you

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.090
I never wanna see your sad expression again

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.190
So I fly high to make an end

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.910
Tonight I am burning

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.150
Everything is burning

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.930
Every piece of your darkness

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.610
Tonight we turn into ashes

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.290
Night is on fire

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
Burn the town red, town red, town red

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.830
Let’s just forget everything

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.270
At least ’til the morning comes

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.530
Cause we’ll all know in the morning

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.830
Nothing has changed in this concrete world

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.250
Let’s just pretend we are free

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.630
There is nothing here to make you sad

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.030
And everything is kind

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.350
At least ’til the morning comes

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.390
I never thought I would find an agony

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.850
in such a pure gentle thing like you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.990
I never wanna let the world break you again

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.410
So I fly high to make an end

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.230
Tonight I am burning

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.370
Everything is burning

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.190
Every piece of your darkness

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.910
Tonight we turn into ashes

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.530
Night is on fire

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.350
Burn the town red, town red, town red

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.670
I wave goodbye

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.830
Everything goodbye

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.650
Everything I set on fire

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.010
Tonight we look at the world turning gray

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.970
Night is burning, burning, burning

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.210
I never thought I would find a sadness

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.650
within such a beautiful thing like you

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.790
I never wanna see your sad expression again

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.270
So I fly high to make an end

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.990
Tonight I am burning

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.210
Everything is burning

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.970
Every piece of your darkness

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.710
Tonight we turn into ashes

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.350
Night is on fire

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.210
Burn the town red, town red, town red

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.450
I wave goodbye

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.670
Everything goodbye

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.430
Everything I set on fire

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.830
Tonight we look at the world turning gray

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.630
Night is burning, burning, burning
