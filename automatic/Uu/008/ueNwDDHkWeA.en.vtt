you<00:00:47.850> guys<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.510> first<00:00:48.719> one<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.379> an

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
you guys my first one is I'm just an

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.200 
you guys my first one is I'm just an
average<00:00:49.590> gamer<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.700> good<00:00:50.820> but

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
average gamer and I'm not that good but

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.520 
average gamer and I'm not that good but
that<00:00:51.360> one<00:00:51.480> did<00:00:51.600> sound<00:00:51.780> too<00:00:51.960> good<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.230> decide

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that one did sound too good so I decide

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.900 
that one did sound too good so I decide
to<00:00:52.559> say<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.010> game<00:00:53.190> was<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.489> short

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
to say this this game was really short

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
to say this this game was really short
that's<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.289> probably<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.680> best<00:00:55.829> excuse

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that's my that's probably my best excuse

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.189 
that's my that's probably my best excuse
like<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:56.850> run<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.149> like<00:00:57.300> 45<00:00:57.989> minutes

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
like the first run was like 45 minutes

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
like the first run was like 45 minutes
alone<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> then<00:00:58.739> else<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> second<00:00:59.309> one

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
alone and then else in the second one

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.790 
alone and then else in the second one
was<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.640> rapid-fire<00:01:00.180> but<00:01:00.809> bound<00:01:01.199> we're<00:01:01.559> done
