00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hey people stefan from android here you 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.480
 I'm sure you heard whatsapp did 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 finally a web client at least half 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.849
 Today we want to show you how you are 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 the on the tray gets something on 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.089
 So the tablet is a very difficult one 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.910
 traditionally it catches naturally 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.000
 unfortunately still everything with the app 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.609
 you still need them and that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 this is version 2.11 point 4 984 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.970
 which should not have yet goes in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.619
 press gate and you download yourself 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.390
 Otherwise , you will find it opened 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.510
 on the internet where he then manually 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.270
 can download and yes that's it 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.430
 the beginning so the next step leads us 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.410
 then, of course, on the tray 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.079
 the whole works unfortunately only in 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.030
 Chrome browser so far what you do 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.219
 you have to go to the browser of each web 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.000
 whatsapp dot com 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.039
 it is important that he is not on any 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.829
 Forgot your case because you could otherwise 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.140
 now invites nowhere reaches her 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.100
 you have to request the desktop version and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.020
 then the whole is not a problem 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.909
 the side should have it immediately 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.720
 that's exactly what it is now, so to speak 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.409
 the interface 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.780
 you get a QR code and with that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:23.520
 opens her a session and this 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.900
 Session opens her so goes into the app 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.479
 in and then I had the option here 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.000
 whatsapp webber 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.159
 that opens up the scanner 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.220
 you do that directly from whats app 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.560
 out now he has scanned this 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.090
 connects as you see it is 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.030
 actually so that whole runs after 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 in front of the phone which is a disadvantage 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.869
 because consumed in the worst case 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.750
 thus data volume makes on 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.509
 best only in the wlan network 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.619
 Now you are in the session and you can 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.850
 As usual here colleague Eric Herrmann 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.290
 we have a problem right now 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.220
 you see, the whole thing is a bit 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.080
 reggae 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.420
 that is much slower as well as the 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:11.790
 app gives delay in the eps remained 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.570
 but it works if you are correct 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.370
 could write 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.170
 that would help but it works 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.120
 and that is simply the beautiful thing 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.300
 even if he closes the whole thing 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.120
 you do not have to change over every time 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.880
 the feces of their application, the session 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.790
 stays a whole small 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.230
 and yes, here you see, the whole is 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.530
 a bit slow but that's how you get 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.300
 whats app on not mistype that way 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.220
 that gets out of tablet and that is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.590
 halfway practical practical 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 Of course, still the variant it 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.020
 you practically allows the app 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.040
 to bring a tray 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.420
 then you have to cheat a bit 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.220
 how he does that we have you on 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.200
 android pit.de shown in an article 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.670
 There you will find all of them 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.230
 more information should be something 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 not been clear here now 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.100
 we hope you have a lot of fun and with 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.670
 web apps on the tablet and we see 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.670
 us next time
