00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.110
 hello our step by step today is a 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.140
 corn for you to decorate glasses 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:24.070
 first you will do 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:26.320
 Corn is the choice that has made you 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.880
 you may notice that in the back I do not 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.239
 I put the corn that will not be 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.930
 We'll cover and here to 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:36.420
 ride the case on the cob you'll do 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.309
 the corn cores 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.109
 I have done here several faithful in three 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:46.420
 sizes with higher average gain 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.320
 the smallest will depend on the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.089
 size of the wait you want to make 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.449
 You'll get a sheet to make a 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:00.399
 this size here for you to have a 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:04.260
 idea to make one of this size 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:13.110
 You'll get a sheet of paper towel. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:13.110
 and will fold double in 4 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:25.070
 then again and make a cookie 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.070
 with it you can pass a little glue 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:43.080
 and make a cookie to assemble explain 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.670
 dismantle the making of fear can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:53.220
 push it because it will not go here 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:55.890
 I'll get some natural 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.090
 is the dough without dying has no ink 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:07.350
 is natural and I'll get the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 enough to cover the roley looks there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:17.450
 work place here and avoid letting in 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.450
 of the piece is then pushed 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.790
 cover the entire paper 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:40.950
 done it there is a little bit to 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.950
 make mirror 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.160
 you may notice that corn cob also 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.880
 explains she has a part so it 's more 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:04.010
 thin the tip and here the thickest part 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:10.550
 so this is it here you will start to 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:17.300
 to pick up the corn pit 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:20.260
 the glue will tidying very prissy 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:23.209
 some ears of corn in the tombs 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.320
 they really have a car without 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:31.640
 others are already more unequal 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:38.420
 So, it's going to be as you like. 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:43.810
 tidying the biggest first mega up 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:48.610
 a certain part are to central groups 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.610
 four careers maybe 5 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.250
 when drying the pasta here in case 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.650
 harvested this one corn is already dry 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:08.849
 and this one will not then it will shrink goes 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:15.680
 get together even more after you come 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:15.680
 the middle and placing the middle 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.680
 almost to the tip 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:50.660
 and when you get more into the account you already 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:57.020
 will put the smaller ones always putting 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:00.020
 glue on the tip and placing in the 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:05.860
 The fact that they are dry is good because 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:09.050
 it will not form and goes to the 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.530
 before the leaf we will see how to do the 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.530
 corn 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:55.140
 You will get mass hit with color 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:06:00.900
 green here I mixed two shades of 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:12.890
 lightest green and open the 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:12.890
 pasta with rolls you can open 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:36.419
 it can be in a thin thickness 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:42.629
 It's there after you open the dough you go 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:50.430
 cut look you see by size 10 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:54.900
 follow it is not going to report the middle sheet 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:58.819
 if you can not make the cut to the 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.819
 free hand you can make a mold 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:08.960
 recalls in a sheet format 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.960
 January 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:23.630
 this is the corn husk is already dry 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.780
 You can even get good corn straw. 

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:30.740
 I'll paste it on a little table that will 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.229
 to serve you is emphasizing not only the 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.930
 in case the corn leaf when you do 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:37.580
 This excludes but you will be able to 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.520
 also other things that we will be 

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:44.060
 teaching later the straw of the 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:47.510
 dry corn you glue a table you can 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:50.470
 glue puts on an afternoon still wins that one 

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.470
 do not stick
