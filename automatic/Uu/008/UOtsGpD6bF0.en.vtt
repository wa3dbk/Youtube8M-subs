a<00:01:35.430> procure<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.869> bang<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
a procure and then the bang I really

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.249 
a procure and then the bang I really
like<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> crawfish<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.939> shad<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
like the crawfish the shad and then the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.730 
like the crawfish the shad and then the
cross<00:01:40.470> add<00:01:40.740> makes<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.250> combo<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:43.619> it's

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
cross add makes the combo I think it's

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.310 
cross add makes the combo I think it's
important<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> help<00:01:44.460> mask<00:01:44.670> stuff<00:01:45.119> boat<00:01:45.990> owners

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
important to help mask stuff boat owners

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.420 
important to help mask stuff boat owners
know<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.590> when<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.920> stop<00:01:47.130> at<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.280> gas

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
know that when you stop at the gas

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.219 
know that when you stop at the gas
station<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:47.939> might<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.329> gas<00:01:48.540> or<00:01:48.780> oil<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.079> your

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.810 
station you might get gas or oil on your
hands<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.610> big

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
hands I think that's a really big

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.929 
hands I think that's a really big
turn-off<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> fish<00:01:51.829> personally<00:01:52.939> not

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
turn-off to the fish personally not

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.300 
turn-off to the fish personally not
necessarily<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.140> believe<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
necessarily do I believe that the the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
necessarily do I believe that the the
scent<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.850> something<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> fish<00:01:57.600> are<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
scent is something that fish are really

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
scent is something that fish are really
key<00:01:58.290> into<00:01:58.619> they're<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.860> oh<00:01:59.009> my<00:01:59.040> gosh<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
key into they're like oh my gosh that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
key into they're like oh my gosh that
smells<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.149> crawdad<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:01.170> they

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
smells just like a crawdad I think they

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.539 
smells just like a crawdad I think they
think<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> smells<00:02:01.710> like<00:02:01.979> something<00:02:02.399> that's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
think it smells like something that's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
think it smells like something that's
something<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.299> something<00:02:03.750> isn't<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> human

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
something is up something isn't a human

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.709 
something is up something isn't a human
or<00:02:04.680> something<00:02:04.920> unnatural<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.479> little

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
or something unnatural so it's a little

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.059 
or something unnatural so it's a little
bit<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:06.960> conducive<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.500> actually<00:02:07.890> get<00:02:08.039> a

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
bit more conducive to actually get a

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.180 
bit more conducive to actually get a
fish<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.879> turn<00:02:09.179> strike<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.039> you'll

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
fish to in turn strike so the one you'll

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.650

no matter what rainbow trouts get to for

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.280 
no matter what rainbow trouts get to for
putting<00:02:16.740> on<00:02:16.800> swimbaits<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.460> in<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> bang<00:02:18.390> on

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
putting on swimbaits and in the bang on

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740 
putting on swimbaits and in the bang on
my<00:02:19.350> front<00:02:19.710> deck<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.070> usually<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.460> both<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.420> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
my front deck I usually have both so I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.780 
my front deck I usually have both so I
really<00:02:22.680> like<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.980> sense<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> guys<00:02:23.580> have

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
really like the sense if you guys have

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.730 
really like the sense if you guys have
any<00:02:24.000> sense<00:02:24.270> maybe<00:02:24.600> try<00:02:24.900> four<00:02:25.200> pressure<00:02:25.380> fish

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
any sense maybe try four pressure fish

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.170 
any sense maybe try four pressure fish
maybe<00:02:26.010> it'll<00:02:26.250> make<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.400> difference<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:27.150> know

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
maybe it'll make a difference you know

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.390 
maybe it'll make a difference you know
it's<00:02:27.270> not<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> huge<00:02:27.630> critical<00:02:28.380> thing<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.890> but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
it's not a huge critical thing to do but

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.160 
it's not a huge critical thing to do but
I<00:02:29.460> really<00:02:29.520> do<00:02:29.970> think<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.540> does<00:02:30.720> help<00:02:30.960> in

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
I really do think that it does help in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.830 
I really do think that it does help in
some<00:02:31.410> scenarios<00:02:31.890> when<00:02:32.070> you're<00:02:32.190> out<00:02:32.280> fishing

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
some scenarios when you're out fishing

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.170 
some scenarios when you're out fishing
you<00:02:33.840> know<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.440> little<00:02:34.590> extra<00:02:34.800> bonus

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
you know to have that little extra bonus

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
you know to have that little extra bonus
the<00:02:36.180> bank<00:02:36.450> comes<00:02:36.780> in<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.020> spray<00:02:37.470> canister<00:02:37.950> you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the bank comes in a spray canister you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.370 
the bank comes in a spray canister you
see<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:39.150> kind<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.360> oily<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:40.020> spray<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.320> in

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
see it's kind of oily you spray it in

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:41.570 
see it's kind of oily you spray it in
the<00:02:40.440> water<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.130> big<00:02:41.340> oil

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the water and you can see a big oil

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.820 
the water and you can see a big oil
slick<00:02:41.910> I<00:02:42.060> also<00:02:42.240> think<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:43.110> maybe<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.650> bang

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
slick I also think that maybe the bang

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.680 
slick I also think that maybe the bang
has<00:02:44.130> some<00:02:44.400> sort<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.670> visual<00:02:44.880> property<00:02:45.570> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
has some sort of visual property that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.150 
has some sort of visual property that
might<00:02:45.840> appeal<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.380> fish<00:02:46.560> because<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> does

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
might appeal to the fish because it does

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.510 
might appeal to the fish because it does
have<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.400> oily<00:02:48.000> texture<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.630> light<00:02:49.520> and

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
have that oily texture in the light and

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.540 
have that oily texture in the light and
the<00:02:50.700> trophy<00:02:51.030> bass<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> not<00:02:52.950> aerosol

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
the trophy bass is like a not aerosol

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.720 
the trophy bass is like a not aerosol
bass<00:02:53.760> it's<00:02:54.030> really<00:02:54.270> more<00:02:54.450> like<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> thick<00:02:54.990> oily

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
bass it's really more like a thick oily

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.580 
bass it's really more like a thick oily
slippery<00:02:56.730> type<00:02:56.970> type<00:02:57.690> mixture<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.290> I<00:02:58.320> really

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
slippery type type mixture so I really

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.620 
slippery type type mixture so I really
like<00:02:58.740> it<00:02:58.770> on<00:02:58.980> swim<00:02:59.220> baits<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.700> fish<00:03:00.210> bites<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
like it on swim baits a fish bites is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.880 
like it on swim baits a fish bites is
you<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.020> whole<00:03:01.140> bait<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.800> know

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
you can get the whole bait and you know

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.290 
you can get the whole bait and you know
it'll<00:03:02.100> sliding<00:03:02.490> around<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.850> their<00:03:02.940> mouths<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it'll sliding around in their mouths and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.280 
it'll sliding around in their mouths and
help<00:03:03.450> them<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.660> hook<00:03:03.780> a<00:03:03.870> little<00:03:03.960> bit<00:03:04.140> better

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
help them get hook a little bit better

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.810 
help them get hook a little bit better
so<00:03:04.590> check<00:03:05.370> them<00:03:05.520> out

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
so check them out

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.230
