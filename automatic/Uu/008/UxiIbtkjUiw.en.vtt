00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello to all and welcome 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.860
 on this photographic for this new 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.750
 tutorial 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.020
 so today we're actually going 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.560
 learn a mix and photos the photo 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 one so on a late sun tone of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.990
 day and picture 2 it's pretty much 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.820
 night and we will mix these two photos 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.790
 to arrive at this effect day night that 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.230
 I find it pretty cool and I decided 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.899
 to show you today how she 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.180
 is therefore one first course 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.870
 thing to do is open both 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.289
 pictures then what to do is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.480
 have both layers within the same 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.710
 photo so there I am for example on the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.730
 first i will have duplicate calq 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.830
 and I see that so this photo calls for 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.909
 5952 and this one the 5970 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.280
 so suddenly the toy copy it into the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.740
 5970 paf 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.229
 now if I will surely document 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 5970 I realize that I have here the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.840
 heavy photo and night photo 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.939
 so suddenly this one I do not have any more 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.460
 need 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:34.020
 that's the example, well, we're going too 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.829
 be separated from hop 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.329
 so now what to do 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.079
 it's saturated the photos are well 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.860
 superimposed so to do that I put myself 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:52.290
 for example on the first picture I 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:55.890
 drop the opacity to about 52% 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.000
 I zoom in and there I realize that it's going 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.790
 not at all 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.250
 the cables of the bridge see between the photo 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.250
 one and the picture of them are not at all 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.200
 superimpose perfectly by hip hop 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.550
 pillar of the bridge laughs well we see if I 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.110
 still have going here we have will change 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.970
 tool 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.940
 but see here a bad 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.140
 layering so suddenly I had 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.720
 reason to put myself on the tool 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.849
 moving because he'll have to 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 move the photo so my sure to be at 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:36.349
 100% then on the picture one is all 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.349
 simply with the keys of the keyboard 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:46.530
 I come to put the pixel on the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.140
 photo and send it we no longer see them 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640
 cables have the wrong overlay 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.730
 cables that means that my 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.540
 photo is perfectly superimposed I 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.010
 I just have to go back to my opacity 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.150
 turn his game zooms now I 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.510
 am quiet so I can attack 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.610
 my effect today to do that I 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.830
 put me on the first picture that 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.019
 moreover remembered days and if we go 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.659
 call it night 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.269
 so like that at least then so I 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:26.099
 go on the picture that I called day 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:30.110
 I add to it what is called a 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:33.030
 fusion mask I click on here 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.790
 my little white rectangle appears 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.950
 I will not explain to you what it is 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.650
 that a fusion mask for the simple and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.069
 good reason that I have already done a 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.319
 tutorial that explains so I 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:48.959
 hopefully very specific how that 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.280
 so works for those who do not know 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.159
 not what a flight mask is 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.909
 and on one side I invite you to go on 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.420
 my blog 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.790
 or so to watch the tutorial 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.019
 destiniez the video tutorial for the 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.000
 fusion masks then day and night 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.980
 so what am I going to do eh ben 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.980
 I will take my tool here degraded 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.510
 to be sure to have a gradient 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.570
 linear I press the key 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.470
 upper case and for example so has it 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.780
 masturbates is in black and white or rather 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.250
 white to black by the way because 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.270
 the blacks re-entrant parents I you the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.590
 remember so I click 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.080
 I'm going to get dirty makes different and 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.750
 is that we will put such 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.860
 between the two pillars of the bridge it's not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:44.000
 bad at all I can try diagonally 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:48.740
 says I want with parties degrade more 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:52.250
 more smaller more net there is no 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.449
 limit actually in this sense there that 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.740
 will give what can be so interesting 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.310
 in the other direction also see there is 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.310
 full of possibilities 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.580
 so at some point you have to choose 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.370
 I loved myself personally 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:13.880
 effect between the two pillars 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:15.320
 that's okay, it's almost 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.300
 finished we already have something 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.630
 rather nice so I can always 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.620
 used for example the entities tool or 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.639
 for example but of course you have to be 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:34.580
 on the identity layer bridge the more we go 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:37.449
 increase the size of the tool see 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.449
 it's for example I want to increase 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:47.740
 the accented effect called the clouds there one 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.370
 remains approximately 5 10% 1 not healthier 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:54.919
 you see we get to play games 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.340
 was nice enough I may have 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:02.800
 been a little bit hard I 'm going to take a shot 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.800
 it was like that at the beginning see up 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:12.030
 here it's too dark we can always 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:19.680
 use here density - to come 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:20.730
 clear up the grove so see with these 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:24.420
 small tools one can also in 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:31.460
 enjoy to retouch locally the 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:33.420
 post here is bah listen it's over 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.100
 whatever else we could in 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:41.910
 take advantage to add a calculation 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:47.030
 Contrast brightness for mir lighten 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:52.520
 a little bit of the whole picture 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.520
 even the contrast a little more 

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.850
 here he listened to me this tutorial is at 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:03.150
 present ended not quite 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:06.660
 because having to shift the 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:11.700
 photo she and not 4 she is no longer she 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:13.880
 is to crop so I take 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:16.050
 my cropping tool 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.880
 here I'm reframing 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:22.740
 obviously we do not exclude the small area of 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:25.980
 bo images crop and here's this time 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.420
 here the tutorial and finished well it does not 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:27.660
 is more than to say you have fun 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:31.850
 well 

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.850
 and see you soon on photographer x
