and if you look at the actual bones of

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.600 
and if you look at the actual bones of
the<00:01:10.869> lower<00:01:11.080> leg<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.710> can<00:01:11.890> actually<00:01:12.100> notice

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
the lower leg you can actually notice

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.219 
the lower leg you can actually notice
the<00:01:12.729> tibia<00:01:13.210> here<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:13.690> you'll<00:01:13.780> notice<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
the tibia here and you'll notice the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.020 
the tibia here and you'll notice the
anterior<00:01:14.710> border<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.310> tibia<00:01:15.640> actually

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
anterior border of the tibia actually

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.609 
anterior border of the tibia actually
feels<00:01:16.330> pretty<00:01:16.450> sharp<00:01:16.990> it's<00:01:17.200> almost<00:01:17.410> like<00:01:17.590> a

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
feels pretty sharp it's almost like a

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.950 
feels pretty sharp it's almost like a
spine<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.820> reason<00:01:19.150> for<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.420> is<00:01:19.600> because<00:01:19.630> a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
spine the reason for that is because a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.920 
spine the reason for that is because a
lot<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.229> ligaments<00:01:20.770> insert<00:01:21.640> into<00:01:22.030> there<00:01:22.690> and

lot of ligaments insert into there and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.270 
lot of ligaments insert into there and
you're<00:01:23.080> not<00:01:23.200> supposed<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.860> too<00:01:24.100> much

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
you're not supposed to have too much

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.219 
you're not supposed to have too much
weight<00:01:24.520> distributed<00:01:25.180> there<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.900> addition

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
weight distributed there in addition

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.600 
weight distributed there in addition
there<00:01:26.380> are<00:01:26.470> certain<00:01:26.740> important<00:01:27.130> landmarks

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610

like<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.789> tibial<00:01:28.270> tubercle<00:01:28.630> which<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:29.020> have

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
like the tibial tubercle which you have

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.050 
like the tibial tubercle which you have
to<00:01:29.200> be<00:01:29.350> careful<00:01:30.039> of<00:01:30.190> whenever<00:01:30.789> you're<00:01:30.940> adding

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
to be careful of whenever you're adding

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.870 
to be careful of whenever you're adding
any<00:01:31.420> type<00:01:31.690> of<00:01:31.830> weight<00:01:32.830> onto<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.250> body<00:01:33.550> if<00:01:33.789> you

any type of weight onto the body if you

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.790 
any type of weight onto the body if you
actually<00:01:34.210> notice<00:01:34.509> your<00:01:34.690> own<00:01:34.840> leg<00:01:35.470> and<00:01:35.740> you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
actually notice your own leg and you

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.710 
actually notice your own leg and you
feel<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.280> anterior<00:01:37.030> portion<00:01:37.300> of<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.600> it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
feel the anterior portion of it it's

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.450 
feel the anterior portion of it it's
pretty<00:01:37.869> sharp<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.350> can<00:01:38.380> feel<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.950> bone<00:01:39.130> there

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460

more soft tissue there and that's where

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.600 
more soft tissue there and that's where

wrapping around the bone in an
anatomically<00:01:53.080> correct<00:01:53.170> way<00:01:53.740> now<00:01:54.369> when<00:01:54.580> we

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
anatomically correct way now when we

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.120 
anatomically correct way now when we
design<00:01:55.030> body<00:01:55.390> togs<00:01:55.750> we<00:01:56.050> again<00:01:56.380> decided<00:01:56.979> to

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
design body togs we again decided to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.460 
design body togs we again decided to

of ligaments come in and insert into
that<00:02:38.860> area<00:02:39.280> there's<00:02:39.760> a<00:02:39.820> particular<00:02:40.140> landmark

that area there's a particular landmark
which<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.410> notice<00:02:41.680> on<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.829> skeleton<00:02:42.400> is<00:02:42.579> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
which you notice on the skeleton is a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.390 
which you notice on the skeleton is a
tibial<00:02:43.360> tubercle<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.799> an<00:02:44.980> area

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
tibial tubercle now that is an area

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.520 
tibial tubercle now that is an area
where<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.730> number<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.329> young<00:02:46.930> athletes

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
where a number of young athletes

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
where a number of young athletes
sometimes<00:02:47.950> experience<00:02:48.519> pain<00:02:48.820> through<00:02:49.420> a

so you don't want to have any extra

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.210 
so you don't want to have any extra
