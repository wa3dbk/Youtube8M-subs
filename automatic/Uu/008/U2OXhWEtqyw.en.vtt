growth for like three months or

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.180 
growth for like three months or
something<00:00:53.049> like<00:00:53.350> that<00:00:53.559> so<00:00:53.710> I'm<00:00:53.799> not<00:00:53.830> really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.040 
expecting a ton of a broke surge but I

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.189 
expecting a ton of a broke surge but I
really<00:00:57.369> like<00:00:57.519> the<00:00:57.640> vitamins<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.180> far<00:00:58.449> and<00:00:58.689> one
