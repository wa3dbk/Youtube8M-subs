00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
expansion port which I posted a picture

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.539 
expansion port which I posted a picture
right<00:03:16.280> there

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
right there

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.740 
right there
and<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.860> it<00:03:18.950> slides<00:03:19.160> right<00:03:19.310> in<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.790> once<00:03:20.570> it's

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
and so it slides right in and once it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.470
