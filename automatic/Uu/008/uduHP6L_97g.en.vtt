00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.330

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.830
 still sasha can be here 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 I honestly say you managed 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.019
 a plate to what you said to 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.619
 90 90 99 percent will stay in Tula in 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:47.440
 arsenal 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:49.740
 one percent what influences left by 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.050
 Of course the city was and the village 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.900
 everyone was amazed actually was very 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.450
 interesting idea with the bus that's people 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.880
 who did not understand what was happening but 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.410
 probably all the people who are in the city 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.730
 understood they were already waiting in the park 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.190
 when we drove into the park I saw so much 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.530
 to the people and in fact 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.750
 For me it was a surprise, I ask 11 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.940
 new as national what but how 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.130
 heroes I meet this is not for her I 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.240
 I think that even cisco I now brought sleep 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.189
 Russia and so means both us and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.079
 they just never met me 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:24.430
 life i think i'm grateful to these people 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.979
 which simply support us 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.730
 constant came here and i think that over 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.330
 we 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.210
 here we lie down, that is all the forces as 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.810
 says growth will give fun for it 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.640
 teams this city and we will fight and 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 try not to yield to the premier league 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.930
 Anybody today Dmitriy Anatolyevich 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.659
 said something like 99 percent 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.670
 he remains in Tula arsenal you 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.439
 learned this a little earlier or was also 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.640
 surprises words we live in one 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 yard 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.690
 people live long ago and so sometimes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.479
 occurs in informal rate then 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.320
 eat in the courtyard and see me joking 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.030
 but we understand that 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.520
 most likely us on a little earlier it 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.460
 understand probably look like a people 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.200

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870
