00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello people how were you are igneous and this 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.269
 is the existing good I have a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 new simple interior tutorial from 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.890
 casey I think almost nobody knows or some 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.080
 they know they do not see something strange in it they fall 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.630
 picture 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.900
 good as you can see every picture there 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.990
 two items in each action this morning 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.520
 in each frame there are two items as good as 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.940
 they know they are usually you can put 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.250
 some who do so well put in the box 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.070
 and they put one where it goes one can no longer go 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.050
 more because if you want to put another one 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.750
 what it does is flip will be good and 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.519
 discovered a way for two to go 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.580
 I hope it will help them to move to 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.580
 qinghai cause better said good it gets 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.309
 and where they point of mergers and if you put 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:58.559
 with this fence state go czech good 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.839
 because the fence can be the picture or the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.100
 framework to put is let's say any 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.920
 object that you want I say I want to 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.340
 here a bone then I go in the part of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 back from here when the fence and placed 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.159
 another framework so you realize 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.940
 and it's already good and to put the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.820
 other objects before though 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.820
 look like this towards the frame I approach 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.340
 already 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.750
 there I approach when it's like that where 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.650
 placed the object that wants to see that 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.580
 I want to put 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.590
 to a sword 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.530
 and turning back the bone NomÃ¡s 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.100
 Turn is ready as you can see the bone 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.150
 and the sword 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.120
 here I want to put something something more 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:46.320
 of right and he approached me a bit and we're going 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.320
 a fence 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.549
 and the fence as you can see there is the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.109
 crossbow the aha peak and so you can do 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.979
 when you want it is going to be the 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.920
