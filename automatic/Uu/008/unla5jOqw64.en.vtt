00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.020 
because we're standing on such great
shoulders<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:47.069> we<00:02:47.190> have<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> remember<00:02:47.700> those

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
shoulders and we have to remember those

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.479 
shoulders and we have to remember those
shoulders<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.780> which<00:02:48.989> we<00:02:49.140> stand<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.829> think<00:02:50.069> it's

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
shoulders on which we stand I think it's

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.180 
shoulders on which we stand I think it's
important<00:02:51.060> that<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.450> look<00:02:52.140> back<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:53.069> those

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
important that we look back to those

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.120 
important that we look back to those
people<00:02:53.519> to<00:02:54.000> allow<00:02:54.630> us<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.470> our<00:02:55.620> present

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
people to allow us to be in our present

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.069 
people to allow us to be in our present
and<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> look<00:02:56.640> forward<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.480> future<00:02:57.840> I

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
and to look forward to the future I

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.470 
and to look forward to the future I
think<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.799> wonderful<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.030> something

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
think that it's wonderful it's something

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.629 
think that it's wonderful it's something
that<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.720> heard<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> long<00:03:01.560> time<00:03:01.829> ago<00:03:02.069> if<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
that I heard a long time ago if you

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.640 
that I heard a long time ago if you
don't<00:03:03.030> know<00:03:03.450> your<00:03:03.660> history<00:03:03.780> you're<00:03:04.200> destined

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
don't know your history you're destined

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.470 
don't know your history you're destined
to<00:03:04.799> repeat<00:03:04.950> it<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:05.850> think<00:03:06.030> it's<00:03:06.299> very

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
to repeat it so I think it's very

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.020 
to repeat it so I think it's very
important<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.560> remember<00:03:08.010> what<00:03:08.549> happened

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
important that we remember what happened

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.599 
important that we remember what happened
and<00:03:09.269> hopefully<00:03:09.870> remember<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:10.980> when<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:11.459> get

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
and hopefully remember that when we get

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.750 
and hopefully remember that when we get
all<00:03:11.760> hateful<00:03:12.269> and<00:03:12.389> angry<00:03:12.959> at<00:03:13.380> people<00:03:13.620> how<00:03:14.340> that

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
all hateful and angry at people how that

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.449 
all hateful and angry at people how that
can<00:03:14.970> take<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.540> bad<00:03:16.079> turn<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.889> turn<00:03:17.250> into

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
can take is a bad turn and turn into

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.580 
can take is a bad turn and turn into
something<00:03:17.579> like<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.359> but<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.660> think<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.380> also

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
something like this but I think it also

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.420 
something like this but I think it also
leads<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.250> give<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.930> positive<00:03:22.500> things<00:03:23.069> I
