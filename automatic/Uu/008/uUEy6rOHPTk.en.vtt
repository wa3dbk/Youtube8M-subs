point of view if somebody doesn't
exercise<00:02:26.709> at<00:02:27.099> all<00:02:27.220> then<00:02:27.610> simply<00:02:28.000> starting<00:02:28.540> off

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
exercise at all then simply starting off

as<00:02:29.190> 20<00:02:30.190> minute<00:02:30.400> workouts<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.120> great<00:02:31.540> place

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
as 20 minute workouts is a great place

as 20 minute workouts is a great place
to<00:02:32.019> start<00:02:32.230> i<00:02:32.379> mean<00:02:32.500> that's<00:02:32.650> probably<00:02:33.069> all

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:33.129 
to start i mean that's probably all

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.520 
to start i mean that's probably all
their<00:02:33.519> work<00:02:34.269> capacity<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:35.019> allow<00:02:35.230> them<00:02:35.379> to
