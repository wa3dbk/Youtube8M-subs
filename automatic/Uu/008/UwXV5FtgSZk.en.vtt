roll is made but each figure rolls
defense<00:02:28.370> dice<00:02:28.730> separately<00:02:29.720> now<00:02:30.350> you'll

defense dice separately now you'll

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.460 
defense dice separately now you'll
notice<00:02:31.010> that<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.430> does<00:02:31.730> say<00:02:32.090> each<00:02:32.470> figure

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
heart is going to get hit by this

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.270 
heart is going to get hit by this
because<00:02:38.780> he<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.290> adjacent<00:02:39.890> but<00:02:40.100> more

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
because he is adjacent but more

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.830 
because he is adjacent but more
importantly<00:02:40.760> this<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.240> to<00:02:41.300> hit<00:02:41.540> these

importantly this is going to hit these
three<00:02:42.290> monsters<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.760> we'll<00:02:43.940> flip<00:02:44.180> leoric's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
three monsters so we'll flip leoric's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.140 
three monsters so we'll flip leoric's
card<00:02:45.290> over<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.740> show<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.100> we<00:02:46.250> have<00:02:46.460> used<00:02:46.820> his

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
card over to show that we have used his

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.080 
card over to show that we have used his
heroic<00:02:47.930> feet<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:48.800> then<00:02:49.460> we'll<00:02:49.610> go<00:02:49.760> ahead<00:02:49.880> and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
heroic feet and then we'll go ahead and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
heroic feet and then we'll go ahead and
make<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.630> die<00:02:50.900> roll<00:02:50.930> with<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> blue<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.010> a<00:02:52.340> yellow

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
make a die roll with a blue and a yellow

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.410 
make a die roll with a blue and a yellow
attack<00:02:53.240> die<00:02:53.540> for<00:02:53.990> his<00:02:54.200> sunburst<00:02:55.150> see<00:02:56.150> what<00:02:56.270> we

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
attack die for his sunburst see what we

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.770 
attack die for his sunburst see what we
get<00:02:57.460> we<00:02:58.460> get<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.670> pretty<00:02:58.910> good<00:02:59.150> roll<00:02:59.360> we<00:02:59.570> get

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
get we get a pretty good roll we get

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.400 
get we get a pretty good roll we get
three<00:03:00.670> parts<00:03:01.670> and<00:03:01.910> one<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.630> surge

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
three parts and one is surge

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.150 
three parts and one is surge
so<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:05.030> could<00:03:05.330> potentially<00:03:05.510> be<00:03:06.080> five<00:03:06.440> points

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
so that could potentially be five points

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.960 
so that could potentially be five points
of<00:03:07.280> damage

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
of damage

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.990 
of damage
or<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.240> could<00:03:08.480> stun<00:03:08.930> people<00:03:09.440> I<00:03:09.620> think<00:03:10.160> for<00:03:10.790> what

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
or it could stun people I think for what

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.180 
or it could stun people I think for what
we're<00:03:11.210> about<00:03:11.240> to<00:03:11.780> do<00:03:11.990> and<00:03:12.350> hoping<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:12.800> kill<00:03:13.160> a

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
we're about to do and hoping to kill a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.990 
we're about to do and hoping to kill a
lot<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.550> monsters<00:03:14.680> we<00:03:15.680> may<00:03:16.220> want<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.610> go<00:03:16.700> ahead

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
lot of monsters we may want to go ahead

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.570 
lot of monsters we may want to go ahead
and<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.480> plus<00:03:18.020> damage<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:19.310> to<00:03:19.430> make

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
and do the the plus damage just to make

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.190 
and do the the plus damage just to make
sure<00:03:19.760> that<00:03:19.910> we<00:03:20.030> get<00:03:20.150> it<00:03:20.300> through<00:03:20.630> so<00:03:20.930> we'll<00:03:21.080> go

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
sure that we get it through so we'll go

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.930 
sure that we get it through so we'll go
ahead<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.470> use<00:03:21.770> that<00:03:21.800> as<00:03:22.160> a<00:03:22.280> plus<00:03:22.580> two<00:03:23.030> for<00:03:24.020> a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
ahead and use that as a plus two for a

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.760 
ahead and use that as a plus two for a
attack<00:03:25.940> for<00:03:26.720> four<00:03:27.020> damage<00:03:27.230> so<00:03:27.500> we'll<00:03:27.620> have

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
attack for four damage so we'll have

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.220 
attack for four damage so we'll have
five<00:03:28.040> hearts<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.670> we're<00:03:29.300> gonna<00:03:29.420> roll<00:03:29.780> all<00:03:30.200> the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
five hearts and we're gonna roll all the

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.470 
five hearts and we're gonna roll all the
way<00:03:30.440> around<00:03:30.800> let's<00:03:31.070> start<00:03:31.460> with<00:03:31.820> rain<00:03:32.210> heart

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
way around let's start with rain heart

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.690 
way around let's start with rain heart
since<00:03:32.750> he<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.020> adjacent<00:03:33.590> he's<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.010> hero<00:03:34.280> here

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
since he is adjacent he's the hero here

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.830 
since he is adjacent he's the hero here
he'll<00:03:35.450> roll<00:03:35.660> one<00:03:35.960> defense<00:03:36.410> die<00:03:36.680> of<00:03:36.890> three

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
he'll roll one defense die of three

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.080 
he'll roll one defense die of three
because<00:03:38.840> we<00:03:39.020> used<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.440> surge<00:03:39.710> for<00:03:40.280> the<00:03:40.670> plus

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
because we used the surge for the plus

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.990 
because we used the surge for the plus
two<00:03:41.450> he<00:03:41.720> will<00:03:41.840> actually<00:03:42.290> take<00:03:42.560> two<00:03:42.890> damage<00:03:43.370> so

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
two he will actually take two damage so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.150 
two he will actually take two damage so
it's<00:03:44.120> not<00:03:44.240> great<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.990> not<00:03:45.230> bad<00:03:45.830> that's

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
it's not great but it's not bad that's

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.000 
it's not great but it's not bad that's
actually<00:03:46.580> really<00:03:46.820> good<00:03:46.910> for<00:03:47.720> rain<00:03:47.870> heart<00:03:48.140> now

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
actually really good for rain heart now

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.400 
actually really good for rain heart now
we'll<00:03:49.310> start<00:03:49.580> off<00:03:49.760> with<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:50.390> master<00:03:50.990> monster

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
we'll start off with the master monster

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.890 
we'll start off with the master monster
who<00:03:51.530> also<00:03:51.710> has<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.040> great<00:03:52.340> offense<00:03:52.760> he<00:03:53.660> rolls

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
who also has a great offense he rolls

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.080 
who also has a great offense he rolls
nothing<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:54.950> this<00:03:55.160> guy<00:03:55.310> is<00:03:55.430> gonna<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.700> moved

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
nothing so this guy is gonna be moved

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
that one attack did a great job of

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.180 
that one attack did a great job of
getting<00:04:16.820> rid<00:04:16.970> of<00:04:17.239> three<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.260> those<00:04:18.470> monsters

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
getting rid of three of those monsters

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
choice

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.440

adjacent<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:54.470> each<00:04:54.710> recover<00:04:55.400> two<00:04:55.880> health

adjacent to you each recover two health

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.650 
adjacent to you each recover two health
points<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.680> this<00:04:57.860> could<00:04:58.100> potentially<00:04:58.660> take

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
points so this could potentially take

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
points so this could potentially take
the<00:04:59.990> two<00:05:00.260> health<00:05:00.560> points<00:05:01.040> back<00:05:01.460> from<00:05:02.680> rain

that massive rune blasts from sunburst

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.840 
that massive rune blasts from sunburst
that<00:05:08.690> leoric<00:05:09.200> did<00:05:09.440> so<00:05:10.280> we'll<00:05:10.430> go<00:05:10.550> ahead<00:05:10.580> and

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
that leoric did so we'll go ahead and

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.600 
that leoric did so we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:05:11.030> add<00:05:11.240> one<00:05:11.750> fatigue<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.800> astron<00:05:13.280> because

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
we'll add one fatigue to astron because

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.280 
we'll add one fatigue to astron because
that's<00:05:13.850> how<00:05:14.150> much<00:05:14.330> it's<00:05:14.480> gonna<00:05:14.600> cost<00:05:14.900> us<00:05:15.110> to

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
that's how much it's gonna cost us to

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:17.590 
that's how much it's gonna cost us to
use<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.680> blessed<00:05:16.040> strike<00:05:16.370> and<00:05:16.640> then<00:05:17.300> we'll<00:05:17.420> go

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
use the blessed strike and then we'll go

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.480 
use the blessed strike and then we'll go
ahead<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.930> we'll<00:05:18.110> roll<00:05:18.320> an<00:05:18.470> attack<00:05:18.830> using<00:05:19.190> the

health we'll go ahead and pump that up

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.150 
health we'll go ahead and pump that up
to<00:05:37.850> ensure<00:05:38.300> they're<00:05:38.480> gonna<00:05:38.600> die<00:05:38.870> they'll<00:05:39.830> roll

best on this which is three they would
still<00:05:44.660> be<00:05:44.840> dead<00:05:45.080> so<00:05:45.950> this<00:05:46.220> guy<00:05:46.520> goes<00:05:47.090> away<00:05:47.480> and

Caravan spot save for the shadow of the
dragon<00:05:53.440> but<00:05:54.440> more<00:05:54.620> importantly<00:05:55.130> we<00:05:55.370> did

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
dragon but more importantly we did

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.720 
dragon but more importantly we did
damage<00:05:56.090> so<00:05:56.450> both<00:05:56.840> Astra<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.500> heals<00:05:57.980> -<00:05:58.340> and

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730 
damage so both Astra and heals - and

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.500 
damage so both Astra and heals - and
rain<00:05:59.420> heart<00:05:59.780> heals<00:06:00.200> -<00:06:00.620> as<00:06:00.920> he<00:06:01.700> is<00:06:01.790> adjacent<00:06:02.360> to

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
rain heart heals - as he is adjacent to

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.810 
rain heart heals - as he is adjacent to
her<00:06:02.690> right<00:06:03.410> there<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.340> that<00:06:04.370> brings<00:06:04.670> rain

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
her right there so that brings rain

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.120

apart<00:06:05.360> back<00:06:05.630> down<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:06.080> his<00:06:06.200> seven<00:06:06.710> damage

apart back down to his seven damage

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.100 
apart back down to his seven damage

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
which is really good and manageable and

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.700
