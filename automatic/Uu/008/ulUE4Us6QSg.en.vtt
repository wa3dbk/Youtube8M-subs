00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
recently to the you know the last year's

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.730 
recently to the you know the last year's
rookie<00:00:54.610> class<00:00:54.790> and<00:00:55.150> well<00:00:55.870> deserving<00:00:56.290> you<00:00:56.650> know

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
rookie class and well deserving you know

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.470 
rookie class and well deserving you know
those<00:00:56.860> guys<00:00:57.010> have<00:00:57.310> came<00:00:57.790> right<00:00:57.970> away<00:00:58.090> and

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
those guys have came right away and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.930 
those guys have came right away and
played<00:00:58.930> and<00:00:59.110> made<00:00:59.260> their<00:00:59.410> marks<00:00:59.770> you<00:01:00.610> know<00:01:00.700> one

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
played and made their marks you know one

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.479 
played and made their marks you know one
playoff<00:01:01.210> games<00:01:01.690> and<00:01:02.020> so<00:01:02.950> there's<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.310> think

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
playoff games and so there's I think

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.380 
playoff games and so there's I think
there's<00:01:03.640> always<00:01:03.790> going<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.089> be<00:01:04.180> that

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
there's always going to be that

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.080 
there's always going to be that
comparison<00:01:05.199> whether<00:01:06.100> it's<00:01:06.370> just<00:01:06.880> or<00:01:07.060> unjust

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
comparison whether it's just or unjust

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.240 
comparison whether it's just or unjust
and<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:08.050> don't<00:01:08.560> feel<00:01:08.770> like<00:01:08.920> there's<00:01:09.100> any

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
and I don't feel like there's any

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.520 
and I don't feel like there's any
pressure<00:01:09.610> on<00:01:09.760> my<00:01:10.000> part<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.540> live<00:01:10.750> up<00:01:10.869> to<00:01:11.020> them<00:01:11.170> I
