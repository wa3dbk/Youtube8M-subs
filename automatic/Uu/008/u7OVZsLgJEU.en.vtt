00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.240
 and good despite good reviews and 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.340
 of the great game that can be considered 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.829
 dragon ball will not bears that by the way 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.709
 I'm super hooked on this title there 

00:00:09.829 --> 00:00:15.049
 to say that precisely in the term 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.939
 online in its multiplayer side not 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.519
 it is being precisely right 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:21.320
 attention because bandai namco works in 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.810
 the online problems of dragon ball 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.939
 sine bears users follow 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.279
 experiencing connectivity problems 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.990
 in several versions of the game the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.820
 dragon ball users will not see if 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.860
 they are very angry they experience 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.350
 problems with online multiplayer 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.990
 of the title that are increasingly being 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.850
 let's say more complicated and you 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.280
 I can say that I personally have 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.560
 tried to play several missions online and 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.390
 there are times that it is impossible to connect with 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.300
 the servers that is to say that bandai namco a 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.010
 see if you put the batteries though 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.870
 recently announced updates and 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.750
 improvements in the servers to optimize 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.450
 the game experience eye I do not know if 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.510
 they are doing it at all or not but in 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.040
 The end needs to be corrected, whatever 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.449
 attentive to the words that have left 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.920
 from bandai namco because they said 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.680
 will follow 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.630
 ripping and adjusting servers and 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.390
 clients to reach a success rate 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.670
 of 100% very soon they said it about 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.140
 days these improvements were announced to 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.170
 through the twitter account also 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.049
 but the reality is other users 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.909
 We continue to report errors that 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.100
 include, for example, the impossibility of 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.710
 access online modes paralÂ·lel 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.799
 quest and online battle the truth is that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.360
 it's true it 's tedious the truth I 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.720
 final good then ended up doing 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.490
 secondary broadcasts without connection and by 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.530
 course the story mode that the truth 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.330
 is that of a dragon ball is of the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.979
 best we have found and for 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.170
 you know the first time you change the 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.119
 story of dragon ball to show 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.159
 another different slope what would 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.950
 past yes, if they had happened 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:56.899
 other things in the fighting finally good 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 boys and girls we will be aware of 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.549
 all this information about dragon 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.470
 sines ball and its online side 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.140
 all those problems in which bandai 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.140
 namco I repeat is working very hard
