00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.470
 hi guys all right here in the law and 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.610
 we will see how to do these 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.610
 lines of blue flowers 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.859
 then you will need an enamel 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:24.919
 white one fine brush green one blue 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.919
 clear blue medium one dark blue one 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.839
 scorer a toothpick 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.819
 so I've already spent a base in the 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.559
 my fingernail and I'll go through two layers of 

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:38.300
 creamy white enamel and let dry 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.850
 I 'll make some here later. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.940
 old men with the brush of green enamel 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.940
 thin 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.809
 I 'll do my things later. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.660
 using the scorer and the blue notes 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.180
 so start here with dark blue then 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.250
 make five balls forming a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.710
 circle and then I'll fill in the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.710
 center with medium blue enamel 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.119
 I 'll do the other ones later. 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 little things with light blue enamel with 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.700
 same thing I did in the first one 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.170
 changes the color and also filling this with 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170
 the average use in the medium 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.830
 and after I 've done it for the first time, I'm going 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.960
 make some balls using all 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.750
 the shades of blue so I'll do with the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.750
 light blue medium blue and dark blue 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 and it will stay there like this 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.800
 Then you expect to dry well after that. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.720
 passing coverage is ready 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.910
 so this is personal if you like 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.730
