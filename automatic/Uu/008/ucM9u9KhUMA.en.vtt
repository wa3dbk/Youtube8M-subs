take<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.130> look<00:00:08.340> at<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> zerg<00:00:08.760> strategy<00:00:09.300> this<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
take a look at a zerg strategy this is

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.480 
take a look at a zerg strategy this is
going<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.200> be<00:00:10.320> speedling<00:00:10.800> roach<00:00:11.040> early

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
going to be speedling roach early

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.400 
going to be speedling roach early
aggression<00:00:11.960> basically<00:00:12.960> it's<00:00:13.080> going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.349> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
aggression basically it's going to be a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.709 
aggression basically it's going to be a
zerg<00:00:13.679> vs<00:00:14.009> protoss<00:00:14.370> strategy<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:15.570> going

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
zerg vs protoss strategy what it's going

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.689 
zerg vs protoss strategy what it's going
to<00:00:15.839> entail<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.320> getting<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.710> handful<00:00:17.400> speed

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
to entail is getting out handful speed

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.279 
to entail is getting out handful speed
links<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.210> then<00:00:18.300> kind<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.779> pumping<00:00:19.140> out<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
links and then kind of pumping out a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.769 
links and then kind of pumping out a
large<00:00:19.590> force<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.070> roaches<00:00:20.490> pushing<00:00:21.449> into<00:00:21.570> our

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
large force of roaches pushing into our

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.540 
large force of roaches pushing into our
prototypes<00:00:22.230> opponent's<00:00:22.680> base<00:00:22.769> really<00:00:23.310> really

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
prototypes opponent's base really really

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.880 
prototypes opponent's base really really
early<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.029> trying<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.869> basically<00:00:25.320> hit<00:00:25.740> them

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
early and trying to basically hit them

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.320 
early and trying to basically hit them
and<00:00:26.010> catch<00:00:26.189> them<00:00:26.220> off<00:00:26.490> guard<00:00:26.519> before<00:00:26.939> they<00:00:27.210> get

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
and catch them off guard before they get

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.419 
and catch them off guard before they get
into<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.599> full<00:00:27.840> swing<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.230> things<00:00:28.429> basically

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
into the full swing of things basically

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.830 
into the full swing of things basically
we're<00:00:29.580> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:29.939> trying<00:00:30.119> trying<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.660> get

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
we're going to be trying trying to get

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.359 
we're going to be trying trying to get
to<00:00:30.990> them<00:00:31.140> before<00:00:31.349> they<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.800> their<00:00:31.980> warp<00:00:32.189> gate

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
to them before they get their warp gate

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.950 
to them before they get their warp gate
research<00:00:32.730> up<00:00:32.940> before<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> bunch<00:00:33.840> of

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
research up before they get a bunch of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
research up before they get a bunch of
gateways<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.160> before<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.850> into<00:00:36.030> that

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
gateways and before they get into that

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.340 
gateways and before they get into that
position<00:00:36.420> where<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.230> start

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
position where they can just start

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.619 
position where they can just start
massing<00:00:37.770> up<00:00:37.890> units<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:39.000> kind<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.329> all-in

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
massing up units it's kind of an all-in

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.000 
massing up units it's kind of an all-in
strategy<00:00:40.050> we're<00:00:40.170> basically<00:00:40.410> trying<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.800> push

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
strategy we're basically trying to push

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.319 
strategy we're basically trying to push
forward<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.370> everything<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.910> got<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
forward with everything we got and

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.540 
forward with everything we got and
trying<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.500> damage<00:00:43.530> possible<00:00:44.430> and

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
trying to do as much damage possible and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.520 
trying to do as much damage possible and
take<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.910> out<00:00:45.000> early<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> game<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.350> again

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
take them out early in the game so again

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.380 
take them out early in the game so again
this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> zerg<00:00:47.250> vs<00:00:47.879> strategy

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this is going to be a zerg vs strategy

see here the Protoss player is getting a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.300 
see here the Protoss player is getting a
full<00:01:12.810> scout<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.140> our<00:01:13.229> base<00:01:13.409> he<00:01:13.680> sees<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.100> pretty

full scout of our base he sees a pretty
basic<00:01:14.520> stuff<00:01:14.729> nothing<00:01:15.119> too<00:01:15.390> fancy<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:16.020> on

basic stuff nothing too fancy going on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
basic stuff nothing too fancy going on
is<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:16.530> seeing<00:01:16.770> an<00:01:16.860> extractor<00:01:17.310> or<00:01:17.490> spawning

dropping<00:01:24.540> buildings<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.080> he's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.470> be

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
dropping buildings that he's going to be

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.249 
dropping buildings that he's going to be
in<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.770> good<00:01:25.890> position<00:01:26.750> taking<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.110> at

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
in a good position taking a look here at

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.630 
in a good position taking a look here at
the<00:01:28.409> Protoss<00:01:28.770> players<00:01:29.040> base<00:01:29.250> where<00:01:29.520> we're

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the Protoss players base where we're

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.100 
the Protoss players base where we're
seeing<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.060> we<00:01:30.180> saw<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.450> nine<00:01:30.659> pylon

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
seeing is we saw that nine pylon

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230 
seeing is we saw that nine pylon
followed<00:01:31.439> by<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.710> 12<00:01:31.950> gateway<00:01:32.340> pretty

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
followed by that 12 gateway pretty

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.450 
followed by that 12 gateway pretty
standard<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.750> terms<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.170> openings<00:01:34.680> it's<00:01:35.310> not

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
standard in terms of openings it's not

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.950 
standard in terms of openings it's not
until<00:01:35.759> after<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.240> point<00:01:36.540> where<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.810> can

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
until after this point where we can

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.600 
until after this point where we can
really<00:01:37.110> tell<00:01:37.439> what's<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> what

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
really tell what's going on and what

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
really tell what's going on and what
he's<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.329> let<00:01:39.930> me<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.200> pull<00:01:40.439> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
he's going for let me just pull this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.929 
he's going for let me just pull this
production<00:01:41.070> tab<00:01:41.280> here<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.670> sure<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.850> don't

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
production tab here make sure we don't

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
production tab here make sure we don't
miss<00:01:42.060> anything<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.110> there<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.380> spawning

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
miss anything so there we go spawning

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
miss anything so there we go spawning
pool<00:01:44.040> did<00:01:44.220> just<00:01:44.399> go<00:01:44.520> down<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:44.970> 14<00:01:45.479> supply<00:01:45.810> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
pool did just go down at 14 supply and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.130 
pool did just go down at 14 supply and
it<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.409> followed<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.770> with<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.009> extractor

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
it was followed up with that extractor

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.539 
it was followed up with that extractor
now<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.380> Ana<00:01:49.530> simulator<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.189> second

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
now we have Ana simulator in a second

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
now we have Ana simulator in a second

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
base at this point which we are finally

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.219 
base at this point which we are finally
coming<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> scout<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.750> tells<00:01:58.020> us

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
coming in with the scout it tells us

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
coming in with the scout it tells us
that<00:01:58.409> he's<00:01:58.619> not<00:01:58.799> likely<00:01:59.130> to<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.520> going

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
that he's not likely to be going

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
that he's not likely to be going
straight<00:02:00.149> for<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> gay<00:02:00.960> kind<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.290> push

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
straight for like a to gay kind of push

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.920 
straight for like a to gay kind of push
because<00:02:02.460> he<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.729> spending<00:02:02.969> money<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.630> at<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
because he is spending money on at a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.749 
because he is spending money on at a
simulator<00:02:04.320> who<00:02:04.619> does<00:02:04.890> obviously<00:02:05.130> intend<00:02:05.670> on

getting<00:02:05.909> VES<00:02:06.210> bien<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:07.409> we<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.860> still

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
getting VES bien but we really still

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.710 
getting VES bien but we really still
even<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.849> information<00:02:09.149> we're<00:02:09.539> not

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
even with that information we're not

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.520 
even with that information we're not
fully<00:02:10.110> aware<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.500> what's<00:02:10.770> going<00:02:10.860> on

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
fully aware of what's going on

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.770 
fully aware of what's going on
because<00:02:12.370> he<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.850> mean<00:02:12.880> he<00:02:13.060> does<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
because he I mean he does have the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
because he I mean he does have the
option<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.350> holding<00:02:15.130> off<00:02:15.310> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
option of just holding off that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.730 
option of just holding off that
cybernetics<00:02:16.300> core<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.750> instead<00:02:17.380> getting<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
cybernetics core and instead getting a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.830 
cybernetics core and instead getting a
second<00:02:18.130> gateway<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.180> actually<00:02:19.690> going

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
second gateway and actually going

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.270 
second gateway and actually going
through<00:02:19.990> with<00:02:20.170> a<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.530> gate<00:02:20.709> push<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.160> this

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
through with a to gate push so this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.670 
through with a to gate push so this
could<00:02:21.459> be<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.610> little<00:02:21.790> deceiving<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:23.020> what<00:02:23.590> you

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
could be a little deceiving and what you

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.230 
could be a little deceiving and what you
typically<00:02:24.190> want<00:02:24.400> to<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.880> this<00:02:25.000> situation

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
typically want to do in this situation

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.690 
typically want to do in this situation
if<00:02:25.810> you're<00:02:25.990> just<00:02:26.170> seeing<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:27.100> gateway<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
if you're just seeing one gateway and

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.640 
if you're just seeing one gateway and
Anna<00:02:27.970> simulator<00:02:28.480> is<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.110> want<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.319> wait<00:02:29.500> until

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
Anna simulator is you want to wait until

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.170 
Anna simulator is you want to wait until
you<00:02:29.800> see<00:02:29.920> what<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.310> next<00:02:30.459> structure<00:02:30.819> being

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you see what the next structure being

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.490 
you see what the next structure being
dropped<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.690> you<00:02:31.870> want<00:02:32.020> to<00:02:32.080> wait<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.350> see<00:02:32.380> if

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
dropped is you want to wait to see if

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.140 
dropped is you want to wait to see if
it's<00:02:32.680> going<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:32.890> be<00:02:32.950> another<00:02:33.100> gateway<00:02:33.459> or<00:02:33.819> if

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
it's going to be another gateway or if

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:35.430 
it's going to be another gateway or if
it's<00:02:34.270> going<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.450> be<00:02:34.569> a<00:02:34.600> cybernetics<00:02:35.200> core

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
it's going to be a cybernetics core

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.449 
it's going to be a cybernetics core
because<00:02:35.620> that's<00:02:35.770> really<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> tell<00:02:36.370> you

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
because that's really going to tell you

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.240 
because that's really going to tell you
what<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.670> expect<00:02:37.709> so<00:02:38.709> taking<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.010> look<00:02:39.040> back

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
what to expect so taking a look back

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.860 
what to expect so taking a look back
here<00:02:39.310> at<00:02:39.580> Air<00:02:39.670> Base<00:02:39.819> i'm<00:02:40.209> getting<00:02:40.690> back<00:02:40.810> into

here at Air Base i'm getting back into
things<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.560> course<00:02:41.709> i<00:02:41.920> said<00:02:42.100> we're<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.370> for

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
that speedling in roch build so we are

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.320 
that speedling in roch build so we are
dropping<00:02:44.380> out<00:02:44.650> Roche<00:02:44.830> warrant<00:02:45.190> here<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:46.090> took

dropping out Roche warrant here it took
took<00:02:46.660> that<00:02:46.870> down<00:02:47.050> at<00:02:47.290> 18<00:02:48.070> supplies<00:02:48.459> when<00:02:48.730> we

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
took that down at 18 supplies when we

we're in and then here we go our Queens

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.130 
we're in and then here we go our Queens
finally<00:02:54.880> coming<00:02:55.209> up<00:02:55.330> we<00:02:55.780> started<00:02:56.050> building

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
finally coming up we started building

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.509 
finally coming up we started building
that<00:02:56.410> Queen<00:02:56.620> I'm<00:02:56.860> sorry<00:02:57.069> I<00:02:57.160> didn't<00:02:57.370> mention

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
that Queen I'm sorry I didn't mention

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.250 
that Queen I'm sorry I didn't mention
that<00:02:57.730> a<00:02:57.790> queen<00:02:58.060> production<00:02:58.420> start<00:02:58.660> at<00:02:58.810> 16

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
that a queen production start at 16

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.420 
that a queen production start at 16
that's<00:02:59.470> typically<00:02:59.830> when<00:03:00.069> you're<00:03:00.160> going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> be

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
that's typically when you're going to be

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.300 
that's typically when you're going to be
doing<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.930> 15<00:03:01.930> or<00:03:02.050> 16<00:03:02.319> supplies<00:03:02.800> when<00:03:03.190> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
doing it 15 or 16 supplies when the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.670 
doing it 15 or 16 supplies when the
Queen's<00:03:03.580> coming<00:03:03.940> out<00:03:04.060> I<00:03:04.269> think<00:03:04.720> I<00:03:05.019> think<00:03:05.560> it's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
Queen's coming out I think I think it's

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.229 
Queen's coming out I think I think it's
almost<00:03:05.860> always<00:03:06.069> 16<00:03:06.610> though<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.790> think<00:03:07.090> that's

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
almost always 16 though I think that's

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.059 
almost always 16 though I think that's
pretty<00:03:07.450> much<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.630> standard<00:03:07.989> thing<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.890> get

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
pretty much the standard thing you get

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.860 
pretty much the standard thing you get
drones<00:03:09.370> up<00:03:09.550> until<00:03:09.790> 16<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.330> make<00:03:10.480> your<00:03:10.630> queen

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
drones up until 16 you make your queen

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.600 
drones up until 16 you make your queen
that<00:03:11.080> puts<00:03:11.290> you<00:03:11.350> at<00:03:11.470> 18<00:03:11.739> out<00:03:11.890> of<00:03:11.920> 18<00:03:12.340> and<00:03:12.370> then

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
that puts you at 18 out of 18 and then

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.729 
that puts you at 18 out of 18 and then
you<00:03:12.730> make<00:03:12.880> an<00:03:13.000> overlord<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.560> roach

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
you make an overlord so that roach

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.870 
you make an overlord so that roach
warren<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.069> going<00:03:15.190> to<00:03:15.250> be<00:03:15.310> coming<00:03:15.459> up<00:03:15.670> right

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
warren is going to be coming up right

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.850 
warren is going to be coming up right
now<00:03:15.910> we<00:03:16.720> do<00:03:16.840> have<00:03:16.870> these<00:03:17.140> zerglings<00:03:17.590> out<00:03:17.739> on

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
now we do have these zerglings out on

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.170 
now we do have these zerglings out on
the<00:03:17.950> board<00:03:18.160> and<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.430> are<00:03:18.549> researching<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the board and we are researching the

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.850 
the board and we are researching the
speed<00:03:19.420> links<00:03:19.720> we're<00:03:19.810> going<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:19.989> be<00:03:20.079> moving<00:03:20.620> out

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
speed links we're going to be moving out

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.250 
speed links we're going to be moving out
with<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.160> zerglings<00:03:21.400> here<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.110> trying<00:03:23.110> to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
with the zerglings here and trying to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.870 
with the zerglings here and trying to
basically<00:03:23.470> contain<00:03:24.040> our<00:03:24.220> opponents<00:03:24.610> see<00:03:24.760> what

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
basically contain our opponents see what

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.979 
basically contain our opponents see what
they're<00:03:25.030> doing<00:03:25.060> see<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.510> they're<00:03:25.750> trying<00:03:25.959> to

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
they're doing see if they're trying to

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.830 
they're doing see if they're trying to
push<00:03:26.170> out<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.590> us<00:03:27.030> taking<00:03:28.030> another<00:03:28.450> look<00:03:28.630> back

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
push out on us taking another look back

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.449 
push out on us taking another look back
in<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.110> Protoss<00:03:29.470> player<00:03:29.739> space<00:03:30.010> we<00:03:30.190> do<00:03:30.310> see

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
in the Protoss player space we do see

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.400 
in the Protoss player space we do see
that<00:03:30.549> second<00:03:31.030> gateway<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:32.079> we<00:03:32.260> see

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
that second gateway and we see

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.289 
that second gateway and we see
cybernetics<00:03:33.040> core<00:03:33.280> warping<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.790> right<00:03:33.940> now<00:03:34.120> as

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
cybernetics core warping in right now as

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.229 
cybernetics core warping in right now as
well<00:03:34.860> so<00:03:35.860> again<00:03:36.640> we're<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:36.940> going<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.150> be<00:03:37.209> able

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
well so again we're not going to be able

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.520 
well so again we're not going to be able
to<00:03:37.420> push<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:37.690> quite<00:03:37.900> at<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.140> point<00:03:38.380> because

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
to push in quite at this point because

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.960 
to push in quite at this point because
of<00:03:38.739> those<00:03:38.860> zealots<00:03:39.100> sitting<00:03:39.489> at<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.700> front<00:03:39.820> of

of those zealots sitting at the front of

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.060 
of those zealots sitting at the front of
the<00:03:40.090> base<00:03:40.299> but<00:03:41.109> we<00:03:41.200> are<00:03:41.320> able<00:03:41.440> to<00:03:41.620> control<00:03:41.920> the

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
the base but we are able to control the

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.650 
the base but we are able to control the

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:46.359 
to what's going on roaches coming out

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.610 
to what's going on roaches coming out
right<00:03:46.480> now<00:03:46.660> as<00:03:46.780> soon<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.049> i<00:03:47.109> broach<00:03:47.320> warren

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
popped up that's when we went ahead and

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.390 
popped up that's when we went ahead and
started<00:03:49.180> our<00:03:49.420> roach<00:03:49.600> production<00:03:50.100> now<00:03:51.100> people

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
started our roach production now people

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.680 
started our roach production now people
may<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.549> wondering<00:03:51.910> why<00:03:52.030> we're<00:03:52.209> vesting<00:03:52.540> so

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
may be wondering why we're vesting so

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.690 
may be wondering why we're vesting so
many<00:03:52.870> resources<00:03:53.769> into<00:03:54.280> getting<00:03:54.549> this

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
many resources into getting this

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.550 
many resources into getting this
metabolic<00:03:55.239> boost<00:03:55.570> when<00:03:56.170> we're<00:03:56.380> not<00:03:56.500> really

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
metabolic boost when we're not really

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.610 
metabolic boost when we're not really
going<00:03:57.370> for<00:03:57.640> a<00:03:57.700> ton<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:57.910> zerglings<00:03:58.329> well<00:03:59.230> even

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
going for a ton of zerglings well even

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.170 
going for a ton of zerglings well even
with<00:03:59.859> just<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.250> handful<00:04:00.549> of<00:04:00.609> zerglings<00:04:00.940> that

with just a handful of zerglings that

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.520 
with just a handful of zerglings that
metabolic<00:04:01.390> boost<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.870> going<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.079> be<00:04:02.140> very

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
metabolic boost is going to be very

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.840 
metabolic boost is going to be very
beneficial<00:04:02.769> it's<00:04:03.310> going<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.519> allow<00:04:03.579> you<00:04:03.640> to

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
beneficial it's going to allow you to

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.000 
beneficial it's going to allow you to
micro<00:04:04.180> them<00:04:04.329> more<00:04:04.510> properly<00:04:04.930> again<00:04:05.829> we're

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
micro them more properly again we're

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.560 
micro them more properly again we're
kind<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.250> going<00:04:06.400> for<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.730> full-on<00:04:06.970> push<00:04:07.359> air

forward with these roaches again the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.600 
forward with these roaches again the
stalkers<00:04:56.380> are<00:04:56.500> faster<00:04:56.980> than<00:04:57.130> them<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.490> they

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
stalkers are faster than them so they

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.010 
stalkers are faster than them so they
are<00:04:57.760> able<00:04:57.940> to<00:04:58.090> kind<00:04:58.390> of<00:04:58.420> kite<00:04:58.630> them<00:04:58.780> around

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
are able to kind of kite them around

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.750 
are able to kind of kite them around
it's<00:04:59.800> not<00:04:59.980> until<00:05:00.220> you<00:05:00.310> get<00:05:00.460> some<00:05:00.610> more

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
it's not until you get some more

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.010 
it's not until you get some more
speedlings<00:05:01.180> in<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.420> base<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.840> you're<00:05:01.930> going

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
speedlings in the base that you're going

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.240 
speedlings in the base that you're going
to<00:05:02.080> be<00:05:02.170> able<00:05:02.320> to<00:05:02.410> really<00:05:02.590> get<00:05:02.680> us<00:05:02.800> around<00:05:03.040> on

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
to be able to really get us around on

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.300 
to be able to really get us around on
them<00:05:03.400> and<00:05:03.520> take<00:05:03.700> them<00:05:03.880> out<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:05.130> yeah<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.160> mean

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
them and take them out and yeah I mean

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:07.230 
them and take them out and yeah I mean
that's<00:05:06.430> pretty<00:05:06.610> much<00:05:06.730> it<00:05:06.820> we're<00:05:07.000> going<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.180> be

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
that's pretty much it we're going to be

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.270 
that's pretty much it we're going to be
mopping<00:05:07.540> up<00:05:07.750> his<00:05:07.930> units<00:05:08.290> here<00:05:08.530> then<00:05:09.130> we're

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
mopping up his units here then we're

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.730 
mopping up his units here then we're
gonna<00:05:09.370> fall<00:05:09.730> suit<00:05:10.090> by<00:05:10.300> taking<00:05:11.170> out<00:05:11.260> his<00:05:11.350> pylon

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
gonna fall suit by taking out his pylon

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.890 
gonna fall suit by taking out his pylon
stop<00:05:12.040> any<00:05:12.250> more<00:05:12.490> production<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.660> want<00:05:13.840> to

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
stop any more production you want to

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.420 
stop any more production you want to
take<00:05:14.050> out<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.290> pylons<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.800> are<00:05:14.920> basically

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
take out the pylons that are basically

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.280 
take out the pylons that are basically
want<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.030> start<00:05:16.210> off<00:05:16.300> by<00:05:16.510> taking<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.900> pylons

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
want to start off by taking the pylons

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.410 
want to start off by taking the pylons
that<00:05:17.860> are<00:05:17.980> powering<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.550> gateways<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:19.240> then

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
that are powering the gateways and then

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:20.700 
that are powering the gateways and then
you<00:05:19.510> can<00:05:19.660> move<00:05:19.750> on<00:05:19.930> from<00:05:20.080> there<00:05:20.260> go<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.530> the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
you can move on from there go to the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.470 
you can move on from there go to the
mineral<00:05:21.010> line<00:05:21.160> take<00:05:21.550> out<00:05:21.700> the<00:05:21.910> tech<00:05:22.090> like<00:05:22.360> the

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
mineral line take out the tech like the

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.930 
mineral line take out the tech like the
cybernetics<00:05:23.050> core<00:05:23.460> but<00:05:24.460> at<00:05:24.580> this<00:05:24.700> point

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
cybernetics core but at this point

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.160 
cybernetics core but at this point
obviously<00:05:25.180> he<00:05:25.480> doesn't<00:05:25.660> even<00:05:25.810> have<00:05:25.960> anything

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
obviously he doesn't even have anything

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.170 
obviously he doesn't even have anything
out<00:05:26.500> he's<00:05:27.070> trying<00:05:27.550> to<00:05:27.640> produce<00:05:27.820> some<00:05:28.060> more

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
out he's trying to produce some more

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.550 
out he's trying to produce some more
zealots<00:05:28.510> but<00:05:28.630> even<00:05:28.870> if<00:05:28.960> those<00:05:29.080> zealots<00:05:29.260> came

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
zealots but even if those zealots came

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.720 
zealots but even if those zealots came
out<00:05:29.710> they're<00:05:29.890> not<00:05:30.040> going<00:05:30.160> to<00:05:30.220> be<00:05:30.340> doing<00:05:30.460> too

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
out they're not going to be doing too

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.760 
out they're not going to be doing too
much<00:05:30.910> and<00:05:31.750> the<00:05:31.840> Protoss<00:05:32.230> player<00:05:32.410> goes<00:05:32.620> ahead

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
much and the Protoss player goes ahead
