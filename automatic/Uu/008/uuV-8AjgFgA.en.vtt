no silicone paper I put on the paper put
on<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> painting<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.489> go<00:03:38.730> in<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.970> iron<00:03:39.270> it

on the painting and I go in to iron it
the<00:03:40.739> stroke<00:03:41.100> theoretically<00:03:42.060> is<00:03:42.360> from<00:03:42.750> render

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
the stroke theoretically is from render

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:48.470 
the stroke theoretically is from render
out<00:03:43.970> together<00:03:44.970> air<00:03:45.840> out<00:03:46.380> no<00:03:47.370> bubble<00:03:47.880> left<00:03:48.120> in

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
out together air out no bubble left in

between<00:03:49.050> but<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.680> painting<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.400> kind<00:03:51.180> of

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
between but this painting is kind of

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.530 
between but this painting is kind of
small<00:03:52.820> so<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.450> make<00:03:54.660> sure<00:03:55.370> you

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
small so you just to make sure you

all now how perfect
but<00:04:55.009> for<00:04:55.970> this<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.419> little<00:04:56.720> bit<00:04:57.130> wave<00:04:58.130> I<00:04:58.610> can<00:04:58.910> do

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
but for this a little bit wave I can do

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.129 
but for this a little bit wave I can do
on<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.710> back<00:05:00.949> to<00:05:01.849> iron<00:05:02.150> some<00:05:04.810> he's<00:05:05.810> actually

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
on the back to iron some he's actually

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.850 
on the back to iron some he's actually
not<00:05:06.979> very<00:05:08.650> necessary<00:05:09.650> when<00:05:10.639> you<00:05:10.820> frame<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.860> you

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
not very necessary when you frame it you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:21.250 
not very necessary when you frame it you
put<00:05:13.240> no<00:05:14.240> problem<00:05:14.780> for<00:05:15.139> this<00:05:18.849> you<00:05:19.849> can<00:05:20.260> peel

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260

this backing paper and iron to another
harder<00:05:27.289> board<00:05:29.139> but<00:05:30.139> you<00:05:30.740> can<00:05:30.979> just<00:05:31.400> simply<00:05:31.729> use

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 
harder board but you can just simply use

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.480 
harder board but you can just simply use
this<00:05:32.810> as<00:05:33.409> backing<00:05:34.370> paper<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:35.270> frame<00:05:36.139> it<00:05:36.490> thank

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
this as backing paper to frame it thank

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:46.140 
this as backing paper to frame it thank
you<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:37.880> watching
