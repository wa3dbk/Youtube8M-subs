and emotional level it was really during

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
a yoga intensive out in Estes Park and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.950 
a yoga intensive out in Estes Park and
my<00:01:10.950> friend<00:01:11.250> Sam<00:01:11.580> Paul<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.630> were<00:01:12.750> there

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
my friend Sam Paul and I were there

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.950 
my friend Sam Paul and I were there
doing<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> ton<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> yoga<00:01:14.580> every<00:01:14.880> day<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.420> then

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
doing a ton of yoga every day and then

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.870 
doing a ton of yoga every day and then
we'd<00:01:16.619> set<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:16.979> something<00:01:17.250> called<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.610> slackline

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
we'd set up something called a slackline

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.580 
we'd set up something called a slackline
which<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.390> essentially<00:01:18.900> kind<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> dynamic

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
which is essentially kind of a dynamic

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.880 
which is essentially kind of a dynamic
tightrope<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.110> slackline<00:01:22.710> yo<00:01:22.830> he

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
tightrope and it was slackline yo he

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.530 
tightrope and it was slackline yo he
came<00:01:23.100> out<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> release<00:01:24.119> from<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
came out it just as a release from that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.670 
came out it just as a release from that
we're<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.810> let's<00:01:24.930> do<00:01:25.170> something<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
we're like let's do something a little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
we're like let's do something a little
more<00:01:25.710> playful<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.240> being<00:01:27.540> in

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
more playful like we're not being in

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.450 
more playful like we're not being in
perfect<00:01:27.840> alignment<00:01:28.170> we're<00:01:28.680> moving<00:01:29.009> around<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
perfect alignment we're moving around a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.870 
perfect alignment we're moving around a
lot

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.240 

and<00:01:32.880> pretty<00:01:33.540> much<00:01:33.750> started<00:01:34.320> simply<00:01:34.890> seeing<00:01:35.130> if

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and pretty much started simply seeing if

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.590 
and pretty much started simply seeing if
we<00:01:35.310> could<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> warrior<00:01:35.939> pose<00:01:36.149> on<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.360> line

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
we could do a warrior pose on the line

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
we could do a warrior pose on the line
and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.079> seeing<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:37.439> we<00:01:37.500> could<00:01:37.619> do<00:01:37.710> tree<00:01:37.950> pose

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and then seeing if we could do tree pose

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
and then seeing if we could do tree pose
and<00:01:38.549> then<00:01:38.700> maybe<00:01:38.880> another<00:01:39.409> standing<00:01:40.409> balance

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
and then maybe another standing balance

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
and then maybe another standing balance
and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:41.820> eventually<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.420> know<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:43.020> basic

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
and then eventually you know just basic

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.080 
and then eventually you know just basic
yoga<00:01:43.680> poses<00:01:43.860> become<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.460> simple<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
yoga poses become pretty simple on the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.760 
yoga poses become pretty simple on the
line<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.570> them<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.840> many<00:01:45.960> times<00:01:46.289> so<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:46.649> we

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
line we do them so many times so then we

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
line we do them so many times so then we
just<00:01:46.799> start<00:01:47.159> building<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.929> to

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
just start building on that and so to

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.859 
just start building on that and so to
get<00:01:49.320> back<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.679> that<00:01:49.830> space<00:01:50.100> where<00:01:50.869> everything

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
get back to that space where everything

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
get back to that space where everything
disappears<00:01:52.320> we<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.039> level<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
disappears we have to up the level the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
disappears we have to up the level the
poses<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.179> bit<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:57.929> would<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> one

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
poses a little bit so we would do one

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
poses a little bit so we would do one
pose<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.979> instead<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.310> just<00:01:59.460> stepping<00:01:59.759> off

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
pose and instead of just stepping off

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.639 
pose and instead of just stepping off
the<00:01:59.909> line<00:02:00.179> and<00:02:00.390> doing<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.630> next<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:00.899> we<00:02:01.409> try

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the line and doing the next one we try

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.910 
the line and doing the next one we try
to<00:02:01.710> flow<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:03.539> became<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.110> really

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to flow and it became this really

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.399 
to flow and it became this really
radical<00:02:05.159> form<00:02:05.700> of<00:02:05.819> practice<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.539> within<00:02:07.049> ten

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
radical form of practice that within ten

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.410 
radical form of practice that within ten
minutes<00:02:07.560> felt<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.970> had<00:02:09.090> been<00:02:09.209> practicing

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
minutes felt like we had been practicing

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.710 
minutes felt like we had been practicing
on<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> ground<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.830> an<00:02:10.920> hour<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> half<00:02:11.720> so

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
on the ground for an hour and a half so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.059 
on the ground for an hour and a half so
they<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.930> moving<00:02:13.200> meditation<00:02:13.830> where<00:02:14.040> you

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
they can moving meditation where you

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.740

flexible and my partner isn't well I
can't<00:04:34.610> do<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.150> high<00:04:35.389> acrobatics<00:04:36.289> so<00:04:36.590> we<00:04:36.710> sort

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:36.889 
can't do is high acrobatics so we sort

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.190 
can't do is high acrobatics so we sort
of<00:04:36.950> have<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.130> meet<00:04:37.400> somewhere<00:04:37.760> in<00:04:37.820> the<00:04:38.000> middle

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
of have to meet somewhere in the middle

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.270 
of have to meet somewhere in the middle
you<00:04:39.200> know<00:04:39.229> you've<00:04:39.500> got<00:04:39.680> somebody<00:04:39.919> on<00:04:40.160> your

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
you know you've got somebody on your

you're<00:04:41.990> balancing<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.500> somebody<00:04:42.860> else's<00:04:43.130> feet

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
you're balancing on somebody else's feet

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.050 
you're balancing on somebody else's feet
so<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:44.180> really<00:04:44.479> becomes<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:45.260> release<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.710> ego<00:04:46.039> a

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
difference between doing acro with

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.570

in that relationship both of you can

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.469 
in that relationship both of you can

quite challenging but you know how this

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:16.999 
quite challenging but you know how this
person<00:05:16.220> moves

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:17.009 
person moves

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.189

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
for a long time and you really start to

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.269 
for a long time and you really start to
build<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:24.119> deep<00:05:24.809> friendship<00:05:25.319> and<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.800> deep<00:05:25.949> trust

with them for me it can be very graceful
and<00:05:32.330> very<00:05:33.330> beautiful<00:05:33.649> but<00:05:34.649> it<00:05:34.770> can<00:05:34.919> bring<00:05:35.099> up<00:05:35.279> a

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:35.399 
and very beautiful but it can bring up a

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:39.019 
and very beautiful but it can bring up a
lot<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.610> your<00:05:35.879> fears<00:05:36.240> at<00:05:36.599> the<00:05:36.719> same<00:05:36.899> time<00:05:38.029> it's

account you know you you you can
withdraw<00:05:45.449> more<00:05:45.899> so<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.199> higher<00:05:46.379> level<00:05:46.770> stuff

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
withdraw more so the higher level stuff

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:48.920 
withdraw more so the higher level stuff
you<00:05:47.399> know<00:05:47.490> that's<00:05:47.669> like<00:05:47.819> a<00:05:47.849> big<00:05:47.969> withdraw<00:05:48.539> so

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:50.389 
you have to have that trust built up

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:53.659

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
share a bit of joy teaching I think is

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.010 
share a bit of joy teaching I think is
the<00:06:17.189> number<00:06:17.490> one<00:06:17.669> priority<00:06:18.240> and<00:06:18.330> what<00:06:18.479> we<00:06:18.569> do<00:06:18.749> I

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
the number one priority and what we do I

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.170 
the number one priority and what we do I
