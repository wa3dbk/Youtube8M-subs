00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
should we lost a lot of quality seniors

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.539 
should we lost a lot of quality seniors
last<00:02:01.590> year<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.219> people<00:02:02.310> didn't

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
last year and I think people didn't

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.359 
last year and I think people didn't
expect<00:02:02.820> us<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.969> maybe<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> whole<00:02:03.719> lot<00:02:03.750> and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
expect us to maybe do a whole lot and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.130 
expect us to maybe do a whole lot and
accomplished<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.490> ton<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.270> think<00:02:06.509> they've

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
accomplished a ton and I think they've

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.510 
accomplished a ton and I think they've
set<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> precedent<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.799> us<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.069> mattia<00:02:08.340> they've

I<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.509> know<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.840> think<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.290> boys<00:02:11.439> are<00:02:12.959> can<00:02:13.959> be
