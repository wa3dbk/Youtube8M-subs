00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
than gloss afire but I think it's a lot

than gloss afire but I think it's a lot
more<00:00:47.250> sticky<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.680> don't<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.860> that's<00:00:50.039> going

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
more sticky I don't know if that's going

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:16.719 
more sticky I don't know if that's going
to<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.399> away<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.820> not<00:01:13.640> ok<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.020> left<00:01:16.320> is

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729

glossa fire Plasti Dip on the rise of
flexi<00:01:21.509> dip<00:01:22.700> I'm<00:01:23.700> surprised<00:01:24.240> but<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:26.400> flexi

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
flexi dip I'm surprised but the flexi

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.069 
flexi dip I'm surprised but the flexi
dip<00:01:26.939> seems<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.680> good<00:01:29.900> flexi<00:01:30.900> dips

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
dip seems to be not as good flexi dips

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.219 
dip seems to be not as good flexi dips
is<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.040> lot<00:01:32.460> stickier<00:01:32.850> than<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.600> Plasti

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
is also a lot stickier than the Plasti

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:51.039 
is also a lot stickier than the Plasti
Dip<00:01:34.259> side<00:01:37.400> yep

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.310 

the<00:01:52.049> classifier<00:01:52.619> side<00:01:52.979> seems<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.789> be<00:01:54.110> darker<00:01:55.110> I

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the classifier side seems to be darker I

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.359 
the classifier side seems to be darker I
guess<00:01:57.110> but<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.229> both<00:01:58.350> work<00:01:58.409> fine<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
guess but they both work fine and the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.649 
guess but they both work fine and the
Flexi<00:02:00.299> dip<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.930> easier<00:02:01.649> one<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> spray

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
Flexi dip is the easier one to spray

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.889 
Flexi dip is the easier one to spray
glossa<00:02:03.659> fire<00:02:03.929> likes<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.820> build<00:02:05.820> up<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.360> lot<00:02:06.570> and

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
glossa fire likes to build up a lot and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.400 
glossa fire likes to build up a lot and
it<00:02:07.649> likes<00:02:07.829> to<00:02:08.009> run<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:08.849> keep<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:09.989> mind<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
it likes to run so keep that in mind I

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.470 
it likes to run so keep that in mind I
guess
