 Borken 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.199

 Hameln UBE 2 today I'll show you how to make her animated up to the course 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.999
 can the annual already pulls 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:28.130
 that means we can normal to Veith files 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.689
 So videos 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.520
 as a tester Peter Kurth played 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.579
 the whole goes Soli does not go to any of the download - in the description 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.550
 speak for Windows 7 32 64-bit or Whistler or XP 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.280
 so download the program 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.950
 I saw ourselves 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.720
 and double-clicked it opens a small window 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.060
 and 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.420
 Follow the instructions given by the Press of the Nikkei 2 Services 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.550
 relate and Windows 7 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 I express simplify Inter 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.190
 then it will be installed 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.420
 and then Spies is a Explorer exe 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.220
 that is, the ex-civil rights activist started 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.620
 and then who are many civilians 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.600
 Erwin Staudt yes what that means that it has been installed without Errors 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.820
 Rastatt Nick Hayek to cut that the Lynx Windows 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.330
 Close as well as Windows 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.920
 and afterwards is at 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.780
 for him to install installed then you can 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.640
 worldwide, for example, to select Inden video 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.940
 for example now at 1 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.390
 there is context menu half time process is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.560
 Percentage Paper and there is the desired and off 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.610
 where now things red shop can Zeestow and the website of Queenston 

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:14.059
 or moment feared 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.079
 the Bad Ischl is at play or when window is a role model 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.609
 she walks the animation Witten stopped the speaker a little 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.759
 a lot of questions 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.189
 So that means that this is me playing games and beeping is optimized 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.019
 Do not do that because we're on full screen now 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.879
 in vain as plays is the national sport 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.290
 so then you can do that here as I myself am still Greenstein 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.679
 Percentage points more expensive go and loaded 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.679
 the most important tip in the description 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.029
 I'm here already one percent 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:59.049
 for example, the own of IAS resigns for the time being free Alex 14 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.769
 and I can just go out for the year, for example 

00:03:06.179 --> 00:03:11.069
 Six Right Days also gives that best double prompt 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:15.719
 and already percent 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.299
 it is very rarely picture set 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.529
 so that it is now so StÃ¼rzer tenants no longer in the background 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:26.549
 Background the cocaine is just like that 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.900
 yes, the percent 4 Abs in the test field is not 40 euros because otherwise it just stops 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.989
 has been overloaded because I am now fully packed 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.680
 Well that was a problem but the program and loaded 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.959
 to install 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.959
 and contrary would 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:52.669
 Any kind of jubilee about the latest idea is driving as the day and 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.179
 screen 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:55.709
 set up 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.039
 I hope you enjoyed it, I'll just say goodbye and me 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.819
 to hope 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.819
 is Balkan
