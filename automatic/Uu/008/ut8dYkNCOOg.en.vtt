00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
I believe on the voxel box I me just f1

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.670 
I believe on the voxel box I me just f1
so<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.480> see<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> better<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:36.380> yes<00:00:37.380> there

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
so you can see it better and yes there

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.389 
so you can see it better and yes there
are<00:00:37.829> there<00:00:38.460> are<00:00:38.489> players<00:00:38.820> inside<00:00:40.280> don't<00:00:41.280> worry

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
are there are players inside don't worry

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.549 
are there are players inside don't worry
about<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:42.079> but<00:00:43.079> yeah<00:00:43.230> um<00:00:45.170> Lego<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.379> brought

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
about that but yeah um Lego just brought

about that but yeah um Lego just brought
me<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.890> his<00:00:47.070> box<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.910> his<00:00:48.950> building<00:00:49.950> test<00:00:50.219> area

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
me to his box all his building test area

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.020 
me to his box all his building test area
and<00:00:51.230> this<00:00:52.230> caught<00:00:52.559> my<00:00:52.590> eye<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.340> very<00:00:53.850> nice

build one of my favorites actually one
of<00:00:57.780> my<00:00:57.870> favorite<00:00:57.930> organic<00:00:58.379> builds<00:00:59.219> and<00:01:01.039> yeah

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
of my favorite organic builds and yeah

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.399 
of my favorite organic builds and yeah
but<00:01:03.000> I'd<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.570> next<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:04.610> next<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.409> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
ship he is going to be a teleporter

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.469 
ship he is going to be a teleporter
running<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> sits<00:01:13.380> quite<00:01:13.650> nicely<00:01:13.860> on<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
running and it sits quite nicely on a

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.570 
running and it sits quite nicely on a
oriental<00:01:16.130> thin<00:01:17.130> tree<00:01:17.990> with<00:01:19.159> orange<00:01:20.159> leaves

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580

sort of falling off in autumn time and a
few<00:01:24.780> berries<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.380> attract<00:01:26.360> mr.<00:01:27.360> Frederico<00:01:28.939> so

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
few berries to attract mr. Frederico so

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.749 
few berries to attract mr. Frederico so
there<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> go<00:01:32.270> very<00:01:33.270> nice<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:34.430> remember<00:01:35.430> if

there we go very nice and remember if
you're<00:01:36.240> interested<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.840> joining<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.380> voxel

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you're interested in joining the voxel

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
you're interested in joining the voxel
box<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:38.670> sure<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.509> application<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
box be sure to make an application on

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.850 
box be sure to make an application on
the<00:01:40.799> website<00:01:43.070> fill<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.159> out<00:01:44.390> probably<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> you

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the website fill it out probably so you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.569 
the website fill it out probably so you
don't<00:01:47.009> get<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.340> client<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.820> first<00:01:47.970> time<00:01:48.210> a

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
don't get to client for the first time a

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
don't get to client for the first time a
bit<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.790> nice<00:01:50.970> screenshots<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:51.990> builds

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
bit some nice screenshots of your builds
