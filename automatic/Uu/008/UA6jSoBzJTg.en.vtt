the<00:04:49.470> headset<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.860> on<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.790> that's<00:04:51.420> a<00:04:51.570> really

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
the headset is on so that's a really

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.300 
the headset is on so that's a really
nice<00:04:51.930> feature<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.440> chip<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.860> in<00:04:53.040> the<00:04:53.130> right

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
nice feature the chip is in the right

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.190 
nice feature the chip is in the right
side<00:04:53.340> I<00:04:53.850> do<00:04:54.120> want<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.390> make<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.510> quick<00:04:54.780> note<00:04:54.960> if

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
side I do want to make a quick note if

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.410 
side I do want to make a quick note if
you<00:04:55.320> are<00:04:55.470> outside<00:04:55.710> using<00:04:56.490> these<00:04:56.640> which<00:04:57.240> I'm

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
you are outside using these which I'm

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.409 
you are outside using these which I'm
sure<00:04:57.630> some<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.050> will<00:04:58.320> be<00:04:58.850> with<00:04:59.850> Bluetooth

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
sure some of you will be with Bluetooth

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.750 
sure some of you will be with Bluetooth
chips<00:05:01.350> with<00:05:01.560> basically<00:05:02.010> all<00:05:02.310> Bluetooth

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
chips with basically all Bluetooth

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.060 
chips with basically all Bluetooth
headsets<00:05:03.210> they<00:05:03.419> work<00:05:03.600> best<00:05:03.780> inside<00:05:04.320> because

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
headsets they work best inside because

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.740 
headsets they work best inside because
the<00:05:05.190> signal<00:05:05.400> can<00:05:05.730> bounce<00:05:05.910> off<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.270> walls<00:05:06.480> and

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
the signal can bounce off the walls and

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
the signal can bounce off the walls and
you<00:05:06.810> don't<00:05:06.960> have<00:05:07.020> any<00:05:07.169> issues<00:05:07.380> but<00:05:07.560> if<00:05:07.650> you're

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
you don't have any issues but if you're

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.950 
you don't have any issues but if you're
outside<00:05:07.940> try<00:05:08.940> and<00:05:09.150> keep<00:05:09.330> whatever<00:05:09.570> device

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960
