00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 I was reading this fabulous newspaper 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.270
 that destroys my neurons day after 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.150
 day at the office when in one of the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.340
 pages I found this picture do not tell me 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.219
 another original animated movie of the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.020
 dreamworks good geniuses beyond 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.390
 catalog this baby at first sight 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.520
 it made me think of a drawing of the year of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.529
 the pear then I said why not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.510
 I remember what I do and I share it 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.000
 with you so that later they do not say that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.010
 I already removed the drawing that today 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.869
 I will speak is like an animate that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.190
 transmitted in the old discovery kids 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.920
 as I said in the year of the pear or 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.750
 1993 was created by film román and I do not even know 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.000
 why do I mention it if you can find it 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.100
 on wikipedia when I talk about the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.200
 time computer I mentioned to you that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.629
 you can not judge with the same rod a 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
 program entertainment purposes 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.100
 one for educational purposes that's not 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.010
 means that the latter can not 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 be criticizable and this is the case but 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 has an incredibly argument 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.699
 simpleton a Latin scientist there a 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.189
 brat grone find in the arctic a 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.470
 frozen woolly mammoth which results 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.080
 be alive and over talk 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.940
 it turns out that the mammoth is called film and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.400
 tells stories of how they lived in the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.920
 passed along with his packmates 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 there are prehistoric humans is there 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.940
 where cro enters the brat protagonist 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.550
 who lives with other humans 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.470
 the only thing salvageable prehistoric and 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.660
 interesting is to mention that the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.980
 Crossmates are Neanderthals 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.440
 while I think he is a man of 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.420
 chromagnon that's why being created a more 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.640
 obviously evolved is more 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.310
 smart while the others are more 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.710
 wild and stupid the idea is good 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 only that in execution does not convince me 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.420
 because it 's an excuse to put 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.670
 Cliché characters type trivia to your 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.070
 After living with a pack of film 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.170
 mammoths recontra tormenting who hate 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.869
 humans and generally use them as 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.850
 useful fools the educational part of the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.680
 program falls on the argument of each 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.690
 chapter since usually the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.790
 characters of the present have some 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.800
 difficulty and end tells them how it was 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 overcome a similar problem in his time 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.179
 clear that these problems require the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.860
 physical math application and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.810
 basic logic 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 well I will start to destroy this 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.190
 drawing starting because it seems little 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.440
 creative and lazy since being a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.750
 program for educational purposes is so 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.030
 little coherent more even knowing that you 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.430
 they teach exact realities such as 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.200
 formal sciences is like wanting 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.390
 learn laws of physics by looking 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 battles of the anime of pokemon and not what 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.110
 I say for the fancy fact that the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.330
 Mammoths speak to be smarter 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.220
 that the fucking humans and perform 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.290
 human activities but the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.180
 contour is so loose and boring that 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.640
 it simply does not attract the attention of 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.980
 viewer even the opinion that you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.410
 do at first glance will not change much 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.780
 after watching the program by the side 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.600
 of the characters there are one or two hits 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.270
 the rest is for oblivion first 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.360
 we have acro in my opinion the character 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.709
 most correct of all because it's easy 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.840
 identify with him since he is a brat 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.060
 that although usually it always has the 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.400
 reason they never take it into account for being 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.290
 precisely a brat a feeling 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.750
 that many children of seven or nine years 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.970
 they pass when they are silenced by others 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.070
 Moderately acceptable characters are 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.180
 Dr. Cecilia and Mike partly 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.430
 because they appear 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.319
 what makes them very flat have a 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.390
 short adventure developed at the beginning 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 with a small segment in the middle of 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.659
 chapter and the conclusion at the end with its 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.659
 respective chascarrillo 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.060
 I remember the other characters with 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.400
 much frustration starting with the 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.960
 neandertales that I really detest by 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.180
 its lack of originality 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.280
 I think with one was enough but they are two and 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.950
 they also have a plus that is the monkey 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.740
 pet or a kind of hominid type 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.020
 missing link or relative of lucy then 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.030
 is the old woman of all these that not only 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.920
 is imbecile like the others but that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.560
 protects I believe as if it were his son 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
 these characters are so little to me 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.370
 creative that when I see them I 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.500
 remember those extra characters from 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.950
 the looney tunes the mobsters the 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.780
 mountaineers the red thing or the boxer 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.330
 then there are the mammoths that are several 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.850
 characters highlighting a field that is a 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:23.160
 medium pig awe and rosquete then 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.560
 is your german a few pigs pet 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.480
 quite upset matriarch chancha 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.330
 of the pack and finally the brothers 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.340
 fucking who are the spoilers because 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.810
 They are very conservative opponents 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.230
 any shit and do not let the 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.540
 Neanderthals throw themselves at their premiums xp 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.760
 end these two pigs are so fucked 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.160
 that fit well to be the bad guys 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.380
 the movie however like mammoth not 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.720
 eat mammoth have included villains of 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.360
 truth by leaving them like two fucking squid 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.400
 2 the villains are a tiger fangs 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.590
 from saber and some wolves to roe 2 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.170
 I will not affect the accuracies 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.450
 scientific and historical since it is a 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.280
 waste of time I'm just going to add that 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.260
 the investigations and advances more 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.150
 important with respect to the life of the 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.000
 Neanderthals have been achieved in the past 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.550
 15 or 20 years breaking that stereotype 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.380
 of predatory beast men that only 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.810
 they were engaged in hunting everything that 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.390
 moved that they lived in caves and robbed 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.610
 women to joe buck today we know that 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:22.740
 the Neanderthal was an intelligent being with 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.660
 technological skills that's why it 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.850
 catalogs as Neanderthal culture or 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.340
 musteriense comprising a whole range 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.900
 of artifacts and traditions even 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.570
 speaks of a religion or rite of 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.700
 Neanderthal burial with respect to 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.650
 the good mammoths it's funny to see how 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.630
 these animals coexist with men 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.520
 in the cartoon when we all know 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
 that man was one of the main 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.180
 factors of its extinction 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.310
 together with rapid climate change 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.860
 known as optimal and climatic 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.470
 at the beginning of the good holocene finally 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:55.620
 the series only had two seasons with 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.570
 only 19 episodes plus the pilot was 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.700
 translated into Spanish and transmitted in 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.710
 discovery kids although I'm in doubt 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.470
 because at that age I also saw handles that 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.240
 I was equally healthy or I do not understand why 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.220
 what the intro of that drawing I have it 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.440
 recorded in the mind since of brat 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.600
 I also rejected it because it seemed very 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.820
 absurd one of the things that I 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.950
 I questioned the brat was like the mammoth 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.140
 phil could be so happy counting 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.150
 stories knowing that it's the last being 

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.520
 of his kind and that all his friends are 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.220
 they died leaving more alone than a rat 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:28.170
 xd and that's all I'm going to talk to them 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.910
 about this caricature that has given me 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:32.040
 Wanting to see some series about 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.650
 dinosaurs and cavemen rapists 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.960
 chau I say goodbye and remember that if 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.960
 they held up here leave comments 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:44.079
 so if someone sees this movie can 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.939
 comment that it seemed to me I would not see it 

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:48.149
 even if they gave me the entrance to 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.149
 movie theater 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.760
 how not
