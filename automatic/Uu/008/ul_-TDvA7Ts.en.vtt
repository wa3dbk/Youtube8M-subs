00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
this and it worked I know there was a

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.440 
this and it worked I know there was a
little<00:05:04.650> bit<00:05:04.800> of<00:05:04.890> discussion<00:05:05.610> online<00:05:05.880> about

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
little bit of discussion online about

you know how they kind of went against

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.170 
you know how they kind of went against
the<00:05:09.300> curve<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:09.960> didn't<00:05:10.950> go<00:05:11.070> with<00:05:11.370> using<00:05:12.030> the

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180
