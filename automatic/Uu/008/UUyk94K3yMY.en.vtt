the big white circle that's a very large

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.080 
the big white circle that's a very large
area<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> gives<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.430> find<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.940> though

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
area that it gives you to find it though

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
triangle that's where you sort of where

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.540 
triangle that's where you sort of where
you<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.780> can<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.340> road

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you want to be you can also on the road

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.029 
you want to be you can also on the road
was<00:00:48.000> probably<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:49.020> probably<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.440> best<00:00:49.680> and

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
was probably it's probably the best and

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.770 
was probably it's probably the best and
easy<00:00:50.280> way<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> find<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.239> wasn't<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
easy way to find it but I wasn't on the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.310 
easy way to find it but I wasn't on the
road<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.350> sort<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.280> went<00:00:53.399> off-road<00:00:54.320> but

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
road I I sort of went off-road but

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.750 
road I I sort of went off-road but

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
am now you will sort of get the gist of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
am now you will sort of get the gist of
where<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> am<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.570> map<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.710> extremely

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
where I am on the map it's not extremely

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.359 
where I am on the map it's not extremely
hard<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.670> find<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.100> quite

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
hard to find but you you can quite

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
hard to find but you you can quite
easily<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.970> looking<00:01:33.360> for<00:01:33.540> quite<00:01:33.720> some<00:01:33.990> time

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
easily be looking for quite some time

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.649 
easily be looking for quite some time
for<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.939> thought<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.360> said

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
for it so I just thought like I said

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.410 
for it so I just thought like I said
they're<00:01:37.530> not<00:01:37.560> amazingly<00:01:38.460> hard<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> find<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.390> I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
they're not amazingly hard to find but I

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
they're not amazingly hard to find but I
thought<00:01:39.630> I'd<00:01:39.780> upload<00:01:39.960> them<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> has

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
thought I'd upload them for you it has

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.440 
thought I'd upload them for you it has
anyway<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.340> because<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.119> they're

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
anyway just because I think they're

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.100 
anyway just because I think they're
pretty<00:01:42.600> cool<00:01:42.720> anyway<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.409> barn<00:01:43.590> finds<00:01:43.950> um

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
pretty cool anyway the barn finds um

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.530 
pretty cool anyway the barn finds um
