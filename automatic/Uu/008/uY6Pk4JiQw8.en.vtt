00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.490
 and well place where everyone opposes 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.800
 not that you're fine I'm fine 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.420
 well today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.950
 video a little bit special already 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.039
 for a trick shots tutorial so I 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.900
 went to see on youtube and I have not 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.640
 the impression that this trick shots was 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 presented again so here I am 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.880
 allowed to do it I would not say that I 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.010
 do it first I think I'm in 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.830
 one of the first since they 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.740
 French community do not know 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
 at least I hope my tutorial 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.469
 can help you 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.969
 so these extremely cat intrigues 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.469
 simple I will present it to you before 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.510
 to explain it to you and that makes me 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.920
 extremely it does things 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.940
 extremely nice in someone from 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.250
 symbols and nothing to say what I just 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.510
 to say but that's basically it gives 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.270
 something nice about such 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 range here is then I present it to you 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.730
 eight facts hop here I start again one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 last time if you do not have the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.920
 time 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.360
 that's how you saw it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.820
 I do not know if you had the time to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.579
 to see him 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.840
 we can see the zoom of the walrus 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.010
 so already we will talk about access to this 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.890
 what's on the class for 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.030
 succeed this trick skips bilic brook I 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.040
 do not know how open 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.080
 how can we call that already there you 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.540
 need your sniper me I took the walrus 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.740
 personally with the adjustable zoom 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.420
 then the adjustable zoom is very 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.430
 important because zooming audition 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.140
 finally the basic areas the original zoom 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.040
 that's it does not do it so you have to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.009
 adjustable zoom 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.220
 that's what the stop zoom looks like and 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.450
 in secondary you need a weapon 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 equipped with a telescope then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.610
 personally I took a launcher 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 who is called the same who is equipped 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.119
 a telescope is a little the principle 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.830
 rpg I have not tried yet with the 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:40.910
 other secondary but I think I 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.770
 think it must be playable with 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.000
 almost all the secondary ones who have 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.050
 a bezel but it is very important 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.890
 that they have an honest I will you 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.710
 explain why 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.759
 so here's flying danger that's like I 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.320
 repeat it again I have not 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.240
 tried with all the secondary I 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.590
 just tried with this secondary the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.180
 same and it works 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.130
 good I think that normally with all 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.020
 glasses that worked so how 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.149
 do you have to do this trick 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.670
 shots it's really extremely simple 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.509
 at the moment you go zou but on 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.660
 your hand m 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.970
 here you just have to do one and 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.519
 single switch so for example for me 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.190
 is a player pc switch matoush that's 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:19.370
 So here is the key when it 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.510
 kiss but I'm going to press looked at 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.850
 I press on europe 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.709
 and there we see for a moment the moon has 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.030
 had the glasses of the walrus 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.190
 so if I should not be wrong in 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.980
 saying that for xbox players it's there 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.140
 is for ps3 players these triangles 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.400
 for the switch so here I repeat 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.410
 again you are on your 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.420
 secondary you go zou but at the moment 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180
 where you are zooming and you 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.040
 do you press y finally triangle 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.870
 any key but your 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.150
 switch button a single switch 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.620
 and that will do it alone 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.930
 really automatically there is nothing 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.430
 nothing more complicated to blow it 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.190
 can make extremely nice combos 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.660
 I think so that's where I have a little 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.180
 a little bit there that is sorry I 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.890
 think you must have seen 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.780
 can the gay but hey it's okay 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.310
