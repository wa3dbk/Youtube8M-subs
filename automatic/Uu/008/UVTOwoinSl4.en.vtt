actresses her final fantasy versus 13
it's<00:02:16.730> probably<00:02:17.180> still<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.510> early<00:02:17.720> development

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
it's probably still in early development

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.790 
it's probably still in early development
so<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:20.360> know<00:02:20.480> since<00:02:20.780> Noctis<00:02:21.290> doesn't<00:02:21.650> really

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
so you know since Noctis doesn't really

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.979 
so you know since Noctis doesn't really
have<00:02:22.040> an<00:02:22.190> official<00:02:22.430> voice<00:02:22.850> yet<00:02:23.239> I<00:02:23.420> figured<00:02:23.900> I

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
have an official voice yet I figured I

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.530
