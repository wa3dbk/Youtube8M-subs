right<00:02:14.510> here<00:02:14.660> kind<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:14.870> opens

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
right here kind of opens

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.620 
right here kind of opens
tiny<00:02:16.440> house<00:02:16.650> living<00:02:17.130> -<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> lot<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:17.760> exactly

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
tiny house living - a lot more exactly

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.670 
tiny house living - a lot more exactly
that's<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:19.020> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> problem<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:19.620> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
that's one of the problem is that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.140 
that's one of the problem is that
eventually<00:02:20.040> defeats<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> purpose<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
eventually defeats the purpose like I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.490 
eventually defeats the purpose like I
want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.390> live<00:02:21.510> tiny<00:02:21.690> but<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.080> need<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> truck

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
that gets two miles to the gallon to

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.190 
that gets two miles to the gallon to
