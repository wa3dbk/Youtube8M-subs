00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.940 

alright<00:00:02.340> I'm<00:00:02.460> outside<00:00:02.879> now<00:00:03.149> I'm<00:00:03.710> going<00:00:04.710> to

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
alright I'm outside now I'm going to

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.280 
alright I'm outside now I'm going to
show<00:00:05.250> you<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.609> front<00:00:06.150> porch<00:00:06.420> lit<00:00:06.720> up<00:00:06.870> off<00:00:07.230> of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
show you the front porch lit up off of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.220 
show you the front porch lit up off of
the<00:00:07.980> Joule<00:00:08.340> thief<00:00:08.550> circuit<00:00:08.870> and<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.110> can

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the Joule thief circuit and so you can

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.610 
the Joule thief circuit and so you can
see<00:00:10.410> there's<00:00:10.679> no<00:00:10.860> surrounding<00:00:11.550> wires<00:00:12.139> all<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
see there's no surrounding wires all the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.860 
see there's no surrounding wires all the
power<00:00:13.860> supplied<00:00:14.490> by<00:00:14.519> two<00:00:14.969> double-a<00:00:15.330> batteries

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
power supplied by two double-a batteries

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.529 
power supplied by two double-a batteries
and<00:00:16.770> they're<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.310> parallel<00:00:17.760> so<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.150> only<00:00:18.270> one

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and they're in parallel so it's only one

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.800 
and they're in parallel so it's only one
and<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.750> half<00:00:18.930> volts<00:00:19.670> so<00:00:20.670> I'm<00:00:21.000> gonna<00:00:21.210> plug<00:00:21.600> in

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and a half volts so I'm gonna plug in

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.990 
and a half volts so I'm gonna plug in
210<00:00:22.500> lights<00:00:23.070> at<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.369> time<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> beginning

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
210 lights at a time at the beginning

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.109 
210 lights at a time at the beginning
and<00:00:24.570> then<00:00:25.500> at<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.740> end<00:00:25.769> I'll<00:00:26.010> plug<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and then at the end I'll plug in the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.179 
and then at the end I'll plug in the
remaining<00:00:27.449> which<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.080> bushes<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
remaining which on the bushes and the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.090 
remaining which on the bushes and the
total<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:30.710> 805<00:00:31.710> lights<00:00:33.380> so<00:00:34.380> let's<00:00:34.890> start

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
total will be 805 lights so let's start

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.500 
total will be 805 lights so let's start
turning<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> circuit<00:00:37.670> there<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.239> neon

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
turning on the circuit there the neon

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.250 
turning on the circuit there the neon
lights<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.989> represents<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.140> high

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
lights up and that represents the high

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
lights up and that represents the high
voltage<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:44.070> present<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:46.469> I'm<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.700> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
voltage that's present and I'm going to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.020 
voltage that's present and I'm going to
plug<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.860> 210<00:00:49.860> LEDs<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> power<00:00:52.140> strip<00:00:53.030> turn

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
plug in 210 LEDs the power strip turn

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:04.549 
plug in 210 LEDs the power strip turn
that<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:56.120> okay<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.340> another<00:00:59.340> 210<00:01:03.559> that's

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
that on okay you know another 210 that's

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.980 
that on okay you know another 210 that's
420<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.640> far<00:01:09.110> that's<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> whole<00:01:10.439> front<00:01:10.770> porch

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
420 so far that's the whole front porch

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.260 
420 so far that's the whole front porch
the<00:01:12.990> rest<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.159> four<00:01:14.670> bushes<00:01:15.119> in

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the rest will be on the four bushes in

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:25.550 
the rest will be on the four bushes in
the<00:01:15.360> front<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.350> does<00:01:22.650> dim<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> bit<00:01:24.560> but

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the front and that does dim it a bit but

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.050 
the front and that does dim it a bit but
still<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.040> bad<00:01:26.810> for<00:01:27.810> two<00:01:27.930> doublea's<00:01:28.820> one<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
still not bad for two doublea's one and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.480 
still not bad for two doublea's one and
a<00:01:30.119> half<00:01:30.299> volts

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.750 

and<00:01:37.830> just<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.890> show<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:39.220> doesn't<00:01:39.490> run<00:01:39.580> off<00:01:39.729> of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
and just the show it doesn't run off of

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.460 
and just the show it doesn't run off of
1ee<00:01:40.450> we<00:01:40.540> can<00:01:40.690> take<00:01:40.869> this<00:01:40.990> one<00:01:41.140> out

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.090 

Tim's<00:01:44.470> little<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.040> not<00:01:45.159> too<00:01:45.400> bad

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
Tim's little but not too bad

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
Tim's little but not too bad
it<00:01:48.100> looks<00:01:48.310> real<00:01:48.550> good<00:01:48.729> though<00:01:48.909> if<00:01:49.420> you<00:01:50.729> unplug

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it looks real good though if you unplug

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.950 
it looks real good though if you unplug
the<00:01:53.140> bushes<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.830> just<00:01:54.009> have<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.310> front<00:01:54.520> porch

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the bushes and just have the front porch

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.420 
the bushes and just have the front porch
that's<00:01:55.960> off<00:01:56.200> of<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:56.770> double-a<00:01:57.280> battery<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
that's off of one double-a battery so

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.310 
that's off of one double-a battery so
I'm<00:02:03.610> going<00:02:03.759> to<00:02:03.790> keep<00:02:04.030> working<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.600> trying<00:02:05.080> to

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
I'm going to keep working on trying to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.100 
I'm going to keep working on trying to
improve<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:06.630> circuit<00:02:07.630> make<00:02:07.840> it<00:02:07.960> a<00:02:07.990> little

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
improve the circuit make it a little

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.440 
improve the circuit make it a little
more<00:02:09.000> energy-efficient<00:02:10.000> give<00:02:10.119> out<00:02:10.269> a<00:02:10.300> little

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
more energy-efficient give out a little

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.470 
more energy-efficient give out a little
more<00:02:10.630> juice<00:02:11.430> right<00:02:12.430> now<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.640> runs<00:02:12.820> fast<00:02:13.239> with

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
more juice right now it runs fast with

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:31.520 
more juice right now it runs fast with
two<00:02:13.750> doublea's<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.720> I'll<00:02:20.290> go<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.590> shut<00:02:20.860> down

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.010 

thanks<00:02:32.530> for<00:02:32.650> watching
