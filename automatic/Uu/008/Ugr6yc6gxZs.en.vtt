the aspect that stands out the most

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
striking thing about endless Road is its

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.930 
striking thing about endless Road is its
art<00:00:36.270> style<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:37.110> let's<00:00:37.290> address<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.739> first<00:00:38.160> it

looks<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> modern<00:00:44.070> art<00:00:44.340> installation

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
