00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.750
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.969
 new euro for two gameplay commentary 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.400
 and for you team deathmatch on the web 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.380
 query so ground on which the fdp could 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.910
 be different with the farmers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.980
 muffler dexterity full force 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.220
 and ninja my box as a secondary was for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.580
 the africa with silencer takes 5 cm 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.289
 peter harry and 1830 as a killstreaks me 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm here for the first time 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.820
 really with my new headset 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.040
 played or was that the first day and 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.059
 one of the first matches 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.290
 I had a round before 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.989
 also played a gameplay 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.190
 become out of it 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.420
 and yes, that was also here at the same time 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.399
 1 first match with my new one 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 Sensitivity because I am now at five 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.000
 put everyone from three to five 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 some may say their game now 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.410
 raise and meet everything is nice 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 and good 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.260
 It is always a change so there is 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.020
 then no matter if you go from one to three 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.829
 or from three to five or from 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.539
 eight to ten 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.869
 it is always a changeover and 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.210
 Changeover is always difficult 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.590
 mostly at least and yes that has me 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.430
 That's why Sam is a bit of a winner 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 because sometimes I do that a bit 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.880
 Overall, fits in any case, a cool 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.540
 and it got me first live comments 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 and recordings I finish that so horny 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.310
 horny round blatant gameplay live and 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.840
 but then so here I come 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.799
 not synchronized euro I come 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.890
 That can not be right together 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.950
 cut and so well before he does 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.729
 such a crown shit invites you to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.130
 example and the 50 players jacket that 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.110
 would not be a sow and then I thought so 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.570
 rather comment on it live 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.009
 Comments will come too 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.350
 In the last match, I found all that 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.119
 I did not ask community I know 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.630
 not who the last I know exactly back 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.430
 asks yes here would be life could not 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.780
 answers a two people have 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.579
 replied what is that supposed to do 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.810
 that's bad that I feel 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.520
 really disadvantaged here and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.380
 neglected here now again 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.789
 you want to have live comments 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.619
 do not see and will not continue now 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.730
 celebrating a party cry that is when 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.040
 think here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.610
 that's really me I'm against the 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.750
 Inferiority complex he without shit 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.890
 nutrition fun why does he have the last 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.090
 times no comments written 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.890
 write me that this come my 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.690
 Wanted live com tel or now and then 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.769
 so or not write in the comments 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.239
 then one more thing I have earlier 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.860
 time I received not know now so 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.030
 as the quality is there I have to 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.430
 I still look at've still on the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.890
 SD card and although I have my room 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.110
 shown 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.360
 I do not know if that's so cool 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.590
 so you just have to look at it again 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.030
 you also wanted to ask something here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.890
 at all or not because I see 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.879
 unfortunately no six minutes video high 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.280
 which will probably be pretty big 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.370
 from the file is because the camera with 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.560
 such a high file of high 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.629
 file size records although the quali even 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.010
 not so bombshell is just because I am 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.370
 have just no mirror reflex or something 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.410
 but the victory was not 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.810
 bad this neat but in 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.329
 relation to the file size case is not 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.150
 comprehend 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.590
 yes so much then again one 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 free i ask ask the whole 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.000
 shit if ever such a review to the astro 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.680
 that was a pretty awesome 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.459
 headset that review now and easy 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.630
 let's show you if you want to see 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.700
 write me that again in the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.329
 comments and then that time 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.190
 with questions 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.139
 I then I thought again such a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.569
 bit on the gameplay and explained 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.459
 my thoughts flow while gambling 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.260
 i believe here because i have one before the 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.120
 Predator the search again my kids 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.380
 while the host yes the horst with ner 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.000
 Passwords is always very dangerous 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.980
 when my leaves i always look first 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.239
 then forward in the direction where I am 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.859
 wants to run if there is one if he is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.739
 none are of course cross-country skiing 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.480
 of course simple tips but also many 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.799
 people just neglect the weather 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.760
 start running and concentrate a lot 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.919
 then no longer on what's around it 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.019
 happens and it is just important that 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.989
 her then maybe your leaves you 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.560
 you see, it's still something else 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.120
 and then maybe you play 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.989
 like a terrier like me, for example 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.419
 have made life 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.650
 in the hall there I have to 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.970
 example equal to my mister and plays 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.280
 because I've heard that with the headset 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.959
 yes and so what is important that you because 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.549
 do not always finish out right away yes 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.780
 still often, but then we do 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.389
 maybe you have a short time 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.470
 Just take a quick look because you know 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.269
 It certainly broke into the bankrupt 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.849
 Skin outside the death before the 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.580
 plate arrives and we all want that 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.370
 Not 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.330
 and well, here you see I try 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.920
 So here's a little bit back 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.570
 because I just do not mind 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.400
 had a format in the live commentary 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.600
 because the round in front of it was too 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.450
 on cory and that was just that 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.220
 biggest descent round because I always 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.370
 one died from in front of the boards 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.139
 and so, and that's why I'm rather 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.970
 stayed behind and he as I do 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.260
 here very easy men c many questions 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.940
 me always yes how do you do that with the 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.889
 doctor so that's actually no 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.360
 big secret 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.740
 I always look for the vacancies 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.800
 where most of the red dots are by 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.240
 that fat on it and on the small ones 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.560
 individual people then the smaller ones 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.460
 caliber that is not really so 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.330
 a great technique and many know it 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.590
 I do not have that 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.360
 club grounds I knew it for a long time, too 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.620
 not if you do not empty the caliber 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.780
 They do not charge you for that either 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.490
 means you can not do three or so of 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.870
 small caliber you should shoot 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.290
 all four shoot away because otherwise 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.330
 does not let up and that would be stupid 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.310
 and that definitely a tip that I 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.840
 can give and if you are with the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.760
 small caliber trying to have 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.960
 the ac moves safely and the opponent 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.220
 she moves and the bowl needs it 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.380
 bit far below therefore arrive 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.090
 go in front of the enemy and stick in 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.080
 the light circle and left and right 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.610
 motion moving 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.690
 then you jump over the opponent 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.820
 and actually always got a two 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.260
 people depending on whether you also on the 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.970
 gegner be on it if not then 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.860
 Of course, that did not happen logically 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.450
 and look i just love it when 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.710
 the kinect or if anything lies 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.289
 That's the nicest thing about such a game 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.669
 Like, write me in the 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.780
 comments like i said i have a few 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.190
 videos ask questions that say 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.190
 it back again until then
