same shape including a pumpkin or a
calabasa<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:18.180> best<00:00:18.390> way<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.630> start<00:00:19.109> doing

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
calabasa and the best way to start doing

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800 
calabasa and the best way to start doing
this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.340> point<00:00:20.609> your<00:00:20.820> knife<00:00:21.090> tip<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.750> the

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
this is to point your knife tip at the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.070 
this is to point your knife tip at the
stem<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.220> make<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> slice<00:00:23.970> straight<00:00:24.689> down

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
stem and then make a slice straight down

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
stem and then make a slice straight down
and<00:00:25.500> as<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:25.980> can<00:00:26.310> see<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.730> has<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> pretty<00:00:27.029> tough

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
and as you can see it has a pretty tough

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
and as you can see it has a pretty tough
skin<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.590> actually<00:00:29.010> my<00:00:29.160> husband

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
skin and this is actually my husband

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.490 
skin and this is actually my husband
doing<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:29.939> demonstration<00:00:30.179> because<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
doing this demonstration because it is

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
doing this demonstration because it is
difficult<00:00:31.820> make<00:00:32.820> another<00:00:33.149> slice<00:00:33.510> directly

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
difficult make another slice directly

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.170 
difficult make another slice directly
across<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.710> your<00:00:34.860> first<00:00:35.130> one<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:35.940> just

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
across from your first one and then just

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.630 
across from your first one and then just
pull<00:00:36.450> that<00:00:36.480> guy<00:00:36.809> apart<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:38.100> next<00:00:38.399> thing<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
pull that guy apart the next thing that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
pull that guy apart the next thing that
we're<00:00:38.940> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> do<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.809> remove<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.620> seeds

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
we're going to do is remove the seeds

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.119 
we're going to do is remove the seeds
from<00:00:41.160> inside<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:43.020> easiest<00:00:43.440> way<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.800> do

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
from inside and the easiest way to do

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.819 
from inside and the easiest way to do
this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:45.059> large<00:00:45.360> kitchen<00:00:45.840> spoon<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
this is with a large kitchen spoon and

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
this is with a large kitchen spoon and
you<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.309> just<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> scrape<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.510> those

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
you can just kind of scrape all of those

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.279 
you can just kind of scrape all of those
seeds<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:50.510> once<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> get<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> seeds

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
seeds right out once you get the seeds

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.410 
seeds right out once you get the seeds
out<00:00:52.559> go<00:00:52.920> ahead<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.489> give<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.670> an<00:00:53.820> extra<00:00:54.090> little

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
out go ahead and give it an extra little

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
out go ahead and give it an extra little
scrape<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.230> remove<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> extra<00:00:56.100> stuff

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
scrape just to remove the extra stuff

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
scrape just to remove the extra stuff
that's<00:00:56.579> inside<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.170> once<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.530> get

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that's inside of there and once you get

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
that's inside of there and once you get
that<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:59.070> cleaned<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.670> we're<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
that all cleaned out we're going to

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.990 
that all cleaned out we're going to
remove<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.870> stem<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.890> really<00:01:02.250> easy<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
remove the stem this is really easy just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.090 
remove the stem this is really easy just
do<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.449> v-shaped<00:01:04.170> cut<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:04.979> will

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
do a little v-shaped cut and that will

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.520 
do a little v-shaped cut and that will
come<00:01:05.309> right<00:01:05.610> off<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.090> now<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:07.140> lay<00:01:07.350> this

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
come right off and now you can lay this

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.560 
come right off and now you can lay this
down<00:01:07.590> flat<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.760> way<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.060> nice<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
down flat and that way it's nice and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.570 
down flat and that way it's nice and
steady<00:01:09.840> when<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.229> cutting<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:11.010> while

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
steady when you're cutting also while

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
steady when you're cutting also while
I'm<00:01:11.820> thinking<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.869> sure<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.140> you

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I'm thinking about it make sure that you

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
I'm thinking about it make sure that you
have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> wet<00:01:14.159> towel<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.520> wet<00:01:14.909> paper<00:01:15.150> towel

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
have a wet towel or wet paper towel

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.060 
have a wet towel or wet paper towel
under<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.780> cutting<00:01:16.080> board<00:01:16.439> so<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.770> isn't

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
under your cutting board so it isn't

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
under your cutting board so it isn't
sliding<00:01:17.520> around<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:18.060> you're<00:01:18.180> trying<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> cut

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sliding around when you're trying to cut

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.590 
sliding around when you're trying to cut
this<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> next<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.180> see<00:01:21.390> you're

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
this up so next as you can see you're

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
this up so next as you can see you're
just<00:01:21.720> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> cut<00:01:22.290> this<00:01:22.470> into<00:01:22.830> slices<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just going to cut this into slices that

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.270 
just going to cut this into slices that
are<00:01:23.759> more<00:01:24.180> manageable<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.110> once<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.159> it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
are more manageable and once you get it

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
are more manageable and once you get it
cut<00:01:26.460> into<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> slices<00:01:27.509> lay<00:01:28.200> it<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.409> flat

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
cut into the slices lay it down flat

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.240 
cut into the slices lay it down flat
again<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.369> then<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:30.900> around

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
again and then you just go around

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.920 
again and then you just go around
between<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.460> flesh<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> peel<00:01:33.600> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
between the flesh and the peel and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.760 
between the flesh and the peel and
remove<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.220> peel<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.600> once<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.650> get

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
remove that peel like so once you get

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
remove that peel like so once you get
the<00:01:37.950> peel<00:01:38.189> removed<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.390> ready<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.930> either

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the peel removed this is ready to either

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.710 
the peel removed this is ready to either
be<00:01:40.409> cut<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:40.799> pieces<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.700> frozen<00:01:42.119> for<00:01:42.479> later

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
be cut into pieces and frozen for later

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
be cut into pieces and frozen for later
use<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.740> freeze<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> use<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
use like you can freeze it and use it

use like you can freeze it and use it
for<00:01:44.670> soup<00:01:45.119> later<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.470> ready<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.860> shred<00:01:47.130> up
