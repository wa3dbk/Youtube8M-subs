here<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> we're<00:00:15.690> start<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.199> progress<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.010> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
here and we're start make progress so it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.859 
here and we're start make progress so it
was<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> little<00:00:18.300> hard<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.800> actual

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
was a little hard to get the actual

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.840 
was a little hard to get the actual
installing<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.199> components<00:00:22.859> because<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
installing of the components because the

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.670 
installing of the components because the
way<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.269> case<00:00:24.480> was<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.050> was<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.350> hard

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
way that the case was it was very hard

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.950 
way that the case was it was very hard
to<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:26.789> be<00:00:27.090> able<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.300> see<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.779> I'm

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to actually be able to see what I'm

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.620 
to actually be able to see what I'm
doing<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> just<00:00:29.789> wanted<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.150> do<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.359> video

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
doing so I just wanted to do a video

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
where we're at in the build and I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520 
where we're at in the build and I
apologized<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.690> wasn't<00:00:36.960> able<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.350> show

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
apologized that I wasn't able to show

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.069 
apologized that I wasn't able to show
you<00:00:37.590> every<00:00:37.890> single<00:00:38.219> component<00:00:38.399> going<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you every single component going in to

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.130 
you every single component going in to
the<00:00:40.410> bill<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.730> just<00:00:42.510> angling

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
the bill just because the just angling

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.160 
the bill just because the just angling
and<00:00:43.410> maybe<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.309> multiple<00:00:44.760> cameras<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
and maybe if I had multiple cameras I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
and maybe if I had multiple cameras I
would<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.770> able<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.280> better<00:00:47.520> shot

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
would be able to get a much better shot

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
would be able to get a much better shot
so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.809> apologize<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.219> you

so I do apologize for that but as you
can<00:00:50.700> see<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.300> motherboard

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
can see we have the motherboard

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
can see we have the motherboard
installed<00:00:52.520> we<00:00:53.520> have<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> processor

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
installed we have the processor

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.229 
installed we have the processor
installed<00:00:54.780> there<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.710> got<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> memory<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
installed there and I got the memory is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389 
installed there and I got the memory is
installed<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.960> did<00:00:58.140> put<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.440> graphics<00:00:58.980> card<00:00:59.280> in

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
installed I did put the graphics card in

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
installed I did put the graphics card in
this<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> EVGA<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> backplate

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
this is the EVGA this is the backplate

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.920 
this is the EVGA this is the backplate
so<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.399> showing<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.120> let<00:01:03.870> me

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so this is what I was showing you let me

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
so this is what I was showing you let me
see<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.680> better<00:01:06.710> better<00:01:07.710> picture

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
see if I get you a better better picture

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.149 
see if I get you a better better picture
there<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.740> see<00:01:13.740> how<00:01:13.860> there's<00:01:14.100> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
there so see see how there's this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.770 
there so see see how there's this
backplate<00:01:15.439> see<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.729> that<00:01:17.729> is<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.570> when<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
backplate see that that is so when you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
backplate see that that is so when you
look<00:01:19.049> inside<00:01:19.350> like<00:01:20.100> doesn't<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.520> look<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.939> lot

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
look inside like doesn't that look a lot

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.620 
look inside like doesn't that look a lot
nicer<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> um<00:01:22.820> go<00:01:23.820> ahead<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.030> zoom<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.420> out

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
nicer so um go ahead and zoom back out

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.240 
nicer so um go ahead and zoom back out
there<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.950> that's<00:01:26.220> pretty<00:01:26.790> much<00:01:27.890> thats<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:29.220> i

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
there so that's pretty much thats all i

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.480 
there so that's pretty much thats all i
got<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.810> power<00:01:30.810> supply<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> see

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
got the power supply and as you can see

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.080 
got the power supply and as you can see
this<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> modular<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.670> we<00:01:35.670> pick

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this is the modular one so this we pick

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
this is the modular one so this we pick
this<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.689> little<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.310> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
this up a little bit so I need a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.590 
this up a little bit so I need a
cameraman<00:01:39.470> be<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> cameraman<00:01:40.860> okay<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.360> this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
cameraman be the cameraman okay so this

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.090 
cameraman be the cameraman okay so this
will<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.320> into<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.829> motherboard

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
will actually go into the motherboard

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.120 
will actually go into the motherboard
this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.320> your<00:01:46.320> main<00:01:46.649> supply

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
this is going to be your main supply

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.700 
this is going to be your main supply
there<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.180> they're<00:01:48.899> they're<00:01:49.259> labeled

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
there and then they're they're labeled

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.429 
there and then they're they're labeled
which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.009> nice<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.479> there's<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.110> for

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
which is nice so there's two here for

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.760 
which is nice so there's two here for
pci-e<00:01:53.659> which<00:01:54.659> i'm<00:01:54.810> guessing<00:01:54.930> we'll<00:01:55.290> go<00:01:55.439> right

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
pci-e which i'm guessing we'll go right

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.190 
pci-e which i'm guessing we'll go right
into<00:01:56.070> their<00:01:56.549> looks<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> graphics<00:01:57.990> card

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
into their looks like this graphics card

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.810 
into their looks like this graphics card
actually<00:01:58.350> has<00:01:58.680> two<00:01:58.979> controls<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.610> power

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
actually has two controls for power

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.020 
actually has two controls for power
because<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> just<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> overall<00:02:01.439> beast<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.880> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
because of just the overall beast of a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.590 
because of just the overall beast of a
card<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:05.040> your<00:02:05.159> CPU<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.450> at

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
card it is this is for your CPU so up at

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.760 
card it is this is for your CPU so up at
the<00:02:06.689> top<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:06.960> there's<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.129> an<00:02:08.250> eight

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
the top here there's actually an eight

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.810 
the top here there's actually an eight
which<00:02:09.430> will<00:02:09.640> go<00:02:09.820> up<00:02:10.120> there<00:02:10.150> and<00:02:10.770> this<00:02:11.770> case<00:02:12.190> the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
which will go up there and this case the

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.460 
which will go up there and this case the
neat<00:02:13.030> thing<00:02:13.270> about<00:02:13.300> this<00:02:13.690> case<00:02:13.960> is<00:02:13.990> i<00:02:14.260> can

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
neat thing about this case is i can

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.770 
neat thing about this case is i can
actually<00:02:14.770> take<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.190> cables<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.910> if<00:02:16.450> i<00:02:16.570> want

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
actually take the cables and if i want

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.450 
actually take the cables and if i want
to<00:02:16.870> put<00:02:16.990> something<00:02:17.290> up<00:02:17.530> there<00:02:17.740> instead<00:02:18.400> of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
to put something up there instead of

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.850 
to put something up there instead of
having<00:02:18.790> which<00:02:19.180> was<00:02:19.390> a<00:02:19.420> cpu<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.140> one<00:02:20.350> Tim

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
having which was a cpu this one Tim

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.040 
having which was a cpu this one Tim
having<00:02:21.220> this<00:02:21.370> kind<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.880> go<00:02:22.240> across<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.570> look

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
having this kind of go across that look

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.140 
having this kind of go across that look
really<00:02:23.320> horrible<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.010> can<00:02:24.460> actually<00:02:24.820> run<00:02:25.120> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
really horrible I can actually run the

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.140 
really horrible I can actually run the
cable<00:02:25.660> through<00:02:25.690> here<00:02:26.350> up<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.010> top<00:02:27.580> here<00:02:27.610> and

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
cable through here up the top here and

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.050 
cable through here up the top here and
plug<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.440> this<00:02:29.800> way<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.040> doesn't<00:02:30.370> distract

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
plug in so this way it doesn't distract

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.610 
plug in so this way it doesn't distract
like<00:02:31.330> see<00:02:31.510> how<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> have<00:02:31.870> these<00:02:31.990> wires<00:02:32.260> which<00:02:32.500> I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
like see how I have these wires which I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.030 
like see how I have these wires which I
got<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.860> rear<00:02:33.100> out<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:34.230> put<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.350> hard<00:02:35.530> drives<00:02:35.800> in

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
got a rear out I put the hard drives in

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.130 
got a rear out I put the hard drives in
let<00:02:36.460> me<00:02:36.520> show<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.730> how<00:02:36.820> easy<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.690> hard<00:02:37.900> drives

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
let me show you how easy the hard drives

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.050 
let me show you how easy the hard drives
this<00:02:38.350> is<00:02:38.500> one<00:02:38.770> really<00:02:39.190> nice<00:02:39.340> thing<00:02:39.400> about<00:02:39.700> this

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
this is one really nice thing about this

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.870 
this is one really nice thing about this
case<00:02:40.530> if<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.680> need<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:42.040> let's<00:02:42.310> say<00:02:42.490> swap<00:02:42.850> a

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
case if you need to let's say swap a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.180 
case if you need to let's say swap a
hard<00:02:43.210> drive<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:44.320> just<00:02:44.620> opens<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:47.190> there's

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
hard drive this just opens and there's

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.280 
hard drive this just opens and there's
your<00:02:48.370> hard<00:02:48.520> drive<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.390> install<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:50.140> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
your hard drive so to install it and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.130 
your hard drive so to install it and
just<00:02:50.440> put<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.710> in<00:02:50.830> here<00:02:51.360> this<00:02:52.360> goes<00:02:52.600> inside

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
just put it in here this goes inside

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.090 
just put it in here this goes inside
here<00:02:53.640> and<00:02:56.610> push<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.830> hard<00:02:59.830> drives

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
here and push that in hard drives

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.040 
here and push that in hard drives
install<00:03:00.550> that's<00:03:01.030> about<00:03:01.270> as<00:03:01.390> simple<00:03:01.690> as<00:03:01.810> it<00:03:01.930> is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
install that's about as simple as it is

install that's about as simple as it is
I<00:03:02.800> got<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.310> SSD<00:03:03.850> up<00:03:04.000> top<00:03:04.240> here<00:03:04.270> at<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.690> one

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
I got the SSD up top here at the one

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.800 
I got the SSD up top here at the one
hard<00:03:05.200> drive<00:03:05.230> heater<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.890> hard<00:03:06.160> drive<00:03:06.220> here

hard drive heater one hard drive here
I'm<00:03:07.810> eventually<00:03:08.110> going<00:03:08.500> to<00:03:08.560> be<00:03:08.650> putting<00:03:08.860> more

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
I'm eventually going to be putting more

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.940 
I'm eventually going to be putting more
but<00:03:09.550> since<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.090> five<00:03:10.570> great<00:03:10.930> base<00:03:11.650> I

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
but since I have five great base I

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.440 
but since I have five great base I
figured<00:03:12.580> might<00:03:12.790> as<00:03:12.820> well<00:03:12.970> give<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.240> little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
figured might as well give it a little

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.150 
figured might as well give it a little
bit<00:03:13.630> of<00:03:13.750> space<00:03:14.020> i<00:03:14.320> might<00:03:14.470> actually<00:03:14.620> move<00:03:14.920> this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
bit of space i might actually move this

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.100 
bit of space i might actually move this
one<00:03:15.400> down<00:03:15.580> and<00:03:15.910> put<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.600> little<00:03:16.630> bit<00:03:16.900> space

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
one down and put a little bit space

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110 
one down and put a little bit space
between<00:03:17.440> here<00:03:17.740> i<00:03:17.890> plan<00:03:18.310> on<00:03:18.340> getting<00:03:18.730> they<00:03:18.880> make

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
between here i plan on getting they make

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.580 
between here i plan on getting they make
a<00:03:19.800> hard<00:03:20.800> drive<00:03:21.070> fan<00:03:21.580> of<00:03:21.970> black<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.140> red<00:03:23.350> which

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
a hard drive fan of black and red which

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.050 
a hard drive fan of black and red which
is<00:03:23.740> pretty<00:03:23.920> cool<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.340> goes<00:03:24.550> well<00:03:24.760> with<00:03:24.790> my

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
is pretty cool it goes well with my

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.720 
is pretty cool it goes well with my
theme<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:26.020> I<00:03:26.700> saw<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.760> second<00:03:28.420> fan<00:03:28.690> up<00:03:29.050> here<00:03:29.730> so

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
theme so I saw the second fan up here so

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.410 
theme so I saw the second fan up here so
I'll<00:03:30.880> show<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:32.590> remove<00:03:33.010> this<00:03:33.430> which<00:03:34.240> is

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
I'll show you you remove this which is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.580 
I'll show you you remove this which is
kind<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.720> actually<00:03:34.900> I'm<00:03:35.110> not<00:03:35.260> going<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.470> do<00:03:35.530> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
kind of actually I'm not going to do it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.590 
kind of actually I'm not going to do it
was<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:35.950> pain<00:03:36.280> in<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.490> butt<00:03:36.760> lady<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.570> the

was a pain in the butt lady to the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.860 
was a pain in the butt lady to the
cables<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:38.350> now<00:03:38.709> there's<00:03:39.340> actually<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.060> 200

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
millimeter fan here which is what comes

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060 
millimeter fan here which is what comes
stock<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.060> then<00:03:43.090> i<00:03:43.510> installed<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:44.170> other<00:03:44.620> 200

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
stock and then i installed the other 200

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.790 
stock and then i installed the other 200
millimeter<00:03:45.760> fan<00:03:46.180> here<00:03:46.570> I<00:03:46.720> did<00:03:47.230> not<00:03:47.410> put<00:03:47.770> the

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
millimeter fan here I did not put the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.730 
millimeter fan here I did not put the
radiator<00:03:48.490> in<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.880> end<00:03:49.030> because<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:50.440> want<00:03:50.680> to

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
radiator in the end because I want to

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.410 
radiator in the end because I want to
make<00:03:50.800> sure<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.610> everything<00:03:52.000> is<00:03:52.120> working

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
make sure one that everything is working

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.150 
make sure one that everything is working
I'm<00:03:53.320> not<00:03:53.470> going<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.709> be<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:54.040> know

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
I'm not going to be you know

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.610 
I'm not going to be you know
overclocking<00:03:54.760> or<00:03:55.030> anything<00:03:55.420> in<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
overclocking or anything in the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.860 
overclocking or anything in the
beginning<00:03:56.770> so<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.700> didn't<00:03:58.209> have<00:03:58.300> to<00:03:58.420> put<00:03:58.690> that

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
beginning so I didn't have to put that

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.190 
beginning so I didn't have to put that
in<00:03:59.110> right<00:03:59.380> away<00:03:59.470> so<00:04:00.750> once<00:04:01.750> everything<00:04:02.170> is

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
in right away so once everything is

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.630 
in right away so once everything is
working<00:04:02.500> and<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:02.950> know<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.310> it's<00:04:03.459> working

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
working and I know that it's working

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.520 
working and I know that it's working
then<00:04:04.000> we'll<00:04:04.180> install<00:04:04.270> the<00:04:04.540> radiator<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.170> didn't

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
then we'll install the radiator I didn't

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.140 
then we'll install the radiator I didn't
want<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.860> tubes<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:06.400> everything<00:04:06.430> in<00:04:06.880> case

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
want the tubes and everything in case

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.180 
want the tubes and everything in case
for<00:04:07.450> some<00:04:07.630> reason<00:04:07.989> I<00:04:08.170> probably<00:04:08.830> should<00:04:09.100> have

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
for some reason I probably should have

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.430 
for some reason I probably should have
tested<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.700> motherboard<00:04:10.410> before<00:04:11.410> i

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
tested the motherboard before i

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.150 
tested the motherboard before i
installed<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.220> but<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:13.480> for<00:04:14.350> some<00:04:14.380> reason<00:04:14.560> you

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
installed it but if for some reason you

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.010 
installed it but if for some reason you
know<00:04:15.310> I'm<00:04:15.370> praying<00:04:16.030> that<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.720> I<00:04:16.750> bought

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
know I'm praying that you know I bought

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.199 
know I'm praying that you know I bought
calling<00:04:17.470> parts<00:04:17.770> of

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
calling parts of

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.449 
calling parts of
really<00:04:18.389> hoping<00:04:18.810> was<00:04:19.680> my<00:04:19.799> biggest<00:04:20.039> fear<00:04:20.310> of<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
really hoping was my biggest fear of the

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.800 
really hoping was my biggest fear of the
motherboard<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.150> would<00:04:21.239> not<00:04:21.359> be<00:04:21.509> dead<00:04:21.690> on

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
motherboard that it would not be dead on

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.770 
motherboard that it would not be dead on
arrival<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:23.090> really<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.210> only<00:04:24.330> thing<00:04:24.600> I<00:04:24.660> have

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
arrival so really the only thing I have

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.379 
arrival so really the only thing I have
left<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:25.110> do<00:04:25.319> is<00:04:25.560> I<00:04:26.100> need<00:04:26.130> to<00:04:26.370> connect<00:04:26.729> all<00:04:26.940> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
left to do is I need to connect all the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.439 
left to do is I need to connect all the
cables<00:04:27.949> I've<00:04:28.949> got<00:04:29.099> this<00:04:29.280> ball<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:30.030> cables

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
cables I've got this ball the cables

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.999 
cables I've got this ball the cables
here<00:04:30.690> so<00:04:30.900> I<00:04:30.960> need<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.229> connect<00:04:31.500> all<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.860> cables

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
here so I need to connect all the cables

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.460 
here so I need to connect all the cables
for<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.430> hard<00:04:32.639> drive<00:04:32.880> I<00:04:33.090> did<00:04:33.630> order<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.960> cd-rom

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
for the hard drive I did order a cd-rom

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.710 
for the hard drive I did order a cd-rom
drive<00:04:34.800> it<00:04:35.039> wasn't<00:04:35.250> going<00:04:35.580> to<00:04:35.639> put<00:04:35.789> one<00:04:35.819> in<00:04:36.120> but

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
drive it wasn't going to put one in but

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.499 
drive it wasn't going to put one in but
then<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:36.930> started<00:04:37.800> thinkin<00:04:38.340> that<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:39.120> know<00:04:39.150> one

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
then I started thinkin that you know one

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.270 
then I started thinkin that you know one
I<00:04:39.539> got<00:04:39.870> him<00:04:39.960> installed<00:04:40.080> windows<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.009> I<00:04:41.069> could

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
I got him installed windows and I could

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.820 
I got him installed windows and I could
transfer<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.000> zip<00:04:42.240> drive<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.720> stuff<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.590> um

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
transfer to a zip drive and stuff but um

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.370 
transfer to a zip drive and stuff but um
I<00:04:44.069> picked<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.610> up<00:04:44.699> for<00:04:44.940> twenty<00:04:45.330> dollars<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.259> I'm

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
I picked it up for twenty dollars so I'm

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.050 
I picked it up for twenty dollars so I'm
going<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.590> install<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:47.130> now<00:04:47.160> and<00:04:47.639> then<00:04:47.849> I

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
going to install it now and then I

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.700 
going to install it now and then I
eventually<00:04:48.330> plan<00:04:48.750> on<00:04:48.870> putting<00:04:49.080> you<00:04:49.349> know<00:04:49.470> like

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
eventually plan on putting you know like

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.700 
eventually plan on putting you know like
faint<00:04:50.039> controllers<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.960> know<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> lot<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.349> like

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
faint controllers you know a lot of like

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.040 
faint controllers you know a lot of like
cool<00:04:53.009> LCD<00:04:53.729> displays<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.509> know<00:04:54.599> I<00:04:54.630> really<00:04:54.900> want

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
cool LCD displays you know I really want

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.110 
cool LCD displays you know I really want
to<00:04:55.110> make<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.320> front<00:04:55.500> just<00:04:55.650> look<00:04:55.979> all<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:57.000> know

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
really cool so I'll probably take that

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.120 
really cool so I'll probably take that
out<00:05:00.660> later<00:05:00.930> that<00:05:01.080> if<00:05:01.349> I<00:05:01.500> ever<00:05:01.530> need<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.860> I<00:05:02.009> can

up which I still trying to figure out

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.249 
up which I still trying to figure out
Noah<00:05:15.030> definitely<00:05:15.449> want<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.630> LCD<00:05:15.990> fan

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
Noah definitely want to LCD fan

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.460 
Noah definitely want to LCD fan
controller<00:05:16.680> and<00:05:17.569> you<00:05:18.569> know<00:05:18.690> so<00:05:18.930> I<00:05:18.960> got<00:05:19.229> to<00:05:19.349> take

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
controller and you know so I got to take

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.899 
controller and you know so I got to take
you<00:05:19.590> to<00:05:19.620> that<00:05:19.889> and<00:05:20.250> then<00:05:20.400> they<00:05:20.490> got<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.759> wrap

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
you to that and then they got to wrap

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.629 
you to that and then they got to wrap
these<00:05:21.060> cables<00:05:21.569> the<00:05:22.349> hard<00:05:22.590> drive<00:05:22.770> or<00:05:23.130> that<00:05:23.550> I'm

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
these cables the hard drive or that I'm

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.100 
these cables the hard drive or that I'm
sorry<00:05:23.849> the<00:05:24.000> power<00:05:24.240> supply<00:05:24.479> is<00:05:24.750> actually<00:05:25.080> very

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
sorry the power supply is actually very

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.589 
sorry the power supply is actually very
easy<00:05:25.409> to<00:05:25.949> install<00:05:26.190> you<00:05:26.849> just<00:05:27.030> line<00:05:27.240> it<00:05:27.270> up<00:05:27.449> to

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
easy to install you just line it up to

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.050 
easy to install you just line it up to
the<00:05:27.690> holes<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.110> do<00:05:28.229> have<00:05:28.680> the<00:05:28.830> air<00:05:28.979> going<00:05:29.340> up<00:05:29.699> and

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
the holes I do have the air going up and

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.749 
the holes I do have the air going up and
I<00:05:30.659> think<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.199> might<00:05:31.440> actually<00:05:31.680> turn<00:05:32.490> that

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
I think I might actually turn that

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.930 
I think I might actually turn that
around<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.389> actually<00:05:33.570> have<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.050> facing<00:05:34.289> down

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
around and actually have it facing down

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.100 
around and actually have it facing down
just<00:05:35.940> so<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.210> not<00:05:36.389> blowing<00:05:36.659> hot<00:05:37.080> air

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
just so it's not blowing hot air

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.040 
just so it's not blowing hot air
straight<00:05:37.680> on<00:05:37.889> my<00:05:38.099> graphics<00:05:38.669> card<00:05:38.759> I<00:05:39.180> have

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
straight on my graphics card I have

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.719 
straight on my graphics card I have
really<00:05:40.320> decided<00:05:40.860> if<00:05:40.979> I'm<00:05:41.099> going<00:05:41.280> to<00:05:41.400> take<00:05:41.520> and

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
really decided if I'm going to take and

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.790 
really decided if I'm going to take and
switch<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.120> yet<00:05:42.389> or<00:05:42.539> not<00:05:42.630> but<00:05:42.690> doesn't<00:05:43.680> it

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
switch that yet or not but doesn't it
