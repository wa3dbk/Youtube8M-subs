and they chose Nicole and Derek's jive I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.010 
and they chose Nicole and Derek's jive I
thought<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.390> great

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
thought it was great

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.260 
thought it was great
possibly<00:00:40.620> even<00:00:40.829> better<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.430> last<00:00:41.610> night<00:00:41.910> but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
possibly even better than last night but

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.510 
possibly even better than last night but
it's<00:00:42.420> hard<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:42.690> me<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.989> say<00:00:43.170> because<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:44.489> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's hard for me to say because when I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
it's hard for me to say because when I
watched<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.149> show<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.570> first<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.289> know

on the performance night I'm usually
taking<00:00:48.510> notes<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:48.899> there's<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.559> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
taking notes so there's things that I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
taking notes so there's things that I
miss<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.700> definitely<00:00:51.300> appreciated<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
miss so I definitely appreciated the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.889 
miss so I definitely appreciated the

he's got a thousand t-shirts

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.660 
he's got a thousand t-shirts
that's<00:01:29.880> probably<00:01:30.090> why<00:01:30.450> he<00:01:31.040> is<00:01:32.040> still<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
that's probably why he is still on the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
that's probably why he is still on the
show<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.150> he<00:01:33.270> had<00:01:33.420> all<00:01:33.540> his<00:01:33.659> alien

friends vote for him when he can count

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.920 
friends vote for him when he can count
that's<00:01:38.009> probably<00:01:38.280> why<00:01:38.610> he<00:01:38.909> only<00:01:38.939> gave<00:01:39.360> Nicole

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that's probably why he only gave Nicole

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.830 
that's probably why he only gave Nicole
