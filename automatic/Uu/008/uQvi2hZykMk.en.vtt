we've gotten all those pictures together
and<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:14.010> one<00:03:14.220> thing<00:03:14.430> let's<00:03:14.790> look<00:03:14.940> at<00:03:15.120> it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.320 

that<00:03:23.450> was<00:03:23.630> good<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.650> it<00:03:25.010> could<00:03:25.340> be<00:03:25.460> faster<00:03:25.970> so

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
that was good but it could be faster so

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:27.970 
that was good but it could be faster so
what<00:03:26.480> we're<00:03:26.630> going<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.840> do<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.500> over<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.830> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
what we're going to do is go over to the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.570 
what we're going to do is go over to the
zoom<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.720> ninth<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.170> classes<00:03:30.680> you

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
zoom and the ninth on classes you

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.740 
zoom and the ninth on classes you
another<00:03:31.850> soon<00:03:32.180> or<00:03:32.830> them<00:03:33.830> out<00:03:34.010> if<00:03:34.970> you<00:03:35.450> want<00:03:35.600> to

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.080 
another soon or them out if you want to
make<00:03:36.200> them<00:03:36.380> faster<00:03:36.800> women<00:03:37.460> at<00:03:37.550> least<00:03:37.730> once<00:03:37.970> or

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
make them faster women at least once or

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.800 
make them faster women at least once or
twice<00:03:38.240> and<00:03:38.630> then<00:03:38.690> drag<00:03:39.230> them<00:03:39.410> even<00:03:39.740> smaller

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
twice and then drag them even smaller

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.060 
twice and then drag them even smaller
