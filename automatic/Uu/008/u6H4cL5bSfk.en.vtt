in<00:00:00.510> this<00:00:00.659> video<00:00:01.050> I'm<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:01.740> demonstrate

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.269 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
the<00:00:02.639> mass<00:00:02.970> imbalance<00:00:03.449> facilities<00:00:04.100> within<00:00:05.100> the

new rocket root flight planning software
so<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.620> start<00:00:07.919> I'm<00:00:08.189> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.490> show<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.000> the

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
so to start I'm going to show you the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.270 
so to start I'm going to show you the
mess<00:00:10.080> imbalance<00:00:10.500> information<00:00:10.889> I've<00:00:11.070> set<00:00:11.250> up

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280

this last item and the arm for each
weight<00:00:48.629> position<00:00:49.140> I've<00:00:49.860> also<00:00:50.010> got<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:51.350> default

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
weight position I've also got a default

the maximum fuel loading of a hundred

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.979 
the maximum fuel loading of a hundred
and<00:00:54.059> two<00:00:54.210> US<00:00:54.480> gallons<00:00:54.809> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.020> 614<00:00:55.879> pounds

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
and two US gallons which is 614 pounds

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.740 
and two US gallons which is 614 pounds
and<00:00:58.579> further<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.850> you'll<00:01:00.149> see<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.629> have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
and further down you'll see that I have

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.170 
and further down you'll see that I have
defined<00:01:01.109> various<00:01:02.100> points<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.609> define<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
defined various points that define the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.980 
defined various points that define the
center<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.660> gravity<00:01:03.989> envelope<00:01:05.360> so<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.780> now

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
center of gravity envelope so I'm now

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.810 
center of gravity envelope so I'm now
going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.320> save<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.619> information<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
going to save that information and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
going to save that information and
prepare<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.030> that

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
prepare for that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.980 
prepare for that
so<00:01:15.100> I'm<00:01:15.369> going<00:01:15.549> to<00:01:15.609> use<00:01:15.789> that<00:01:16.030> aircraft<00:01:16.240> detail

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
so I'm going to use that aircraft detail

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.940 
so I'm going to use that aircraft detail
from<00:01:17.380> Toph<00:01:17.679> Romeo<00:01:18.009> Romeo<00:01:18.100> tango<00:01:18.520> tango<00:01:18.880> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
from Toph Romeo Romeo tango tango to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.789 
from Toph Romeo Romeo tango tango to
devise<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> flight<00:01:21.280> plan<00:01:21.490> from<00:01:22.329> Farnborough<00:01:23.200> to

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
devise a flight plan from Farnborough to

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:32.399 
devise a flight plan from Farnborough to
La<00:01:24.189> Rochelle<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:29.049> left<00:01:29.500> me<00:01:29.649> H<00:01:31.409> it's

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
La Rochelle which is a left me H it's

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.630 
La Rochelle which is a left me H it's
gonna<00:01:32.619> be<00:01:32.679> nine<00:01:32.829> for<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.009> flight<00:01:33.219> plan<00:01:33.429> at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
gonna be nine for a flight plan at

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.969 
gonna be nine for a flight plan at
flight<00:01:33.819> level<00:01:33.850> nine<00:01:34.149> zero<00:01:34.709> click<00:01:35.709> on<00:01:35.799> auto

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
flight level nine zero click on auto

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.240 
flight level nine zero click on auto
route<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.899> rocket<00:01:37.899> routes<00:01:38.110> will<00:01:38.319> die<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:39.100> a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
route and rocket routes will die in a

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.510 
route and rocket routes will die in a
few<00:01:39.429> seconds<00:01:39.759> give<00:01:40.030> me<00:01:40.179> a<00:01:41.250> IFR<00:01:42.250> flight<00:01:42.490> plan

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
few seconds give me a IFR flight plan

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.840 
few seconds give me a IFR flight plan
which<00:01:43.479> it<00:01:43.780> will<00:01:43.990> validate<00:01:44.409> against<00:01:45.280> your

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
which it will validate against your

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.870 
which it will validate against your
control<00:01:46.329> and<00:01:46.709> you<00:01:47.709> will<00:01:47.829> see<00:01:48.009> that<00:01:48.159> there<00:01:48.549> we

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
control and you will see that there we

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.020 
control and you will see that there we
are

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
are

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.979 
are
success<00:01:49.770> validated<00:01:50.770> by<00:01:50.860> your<00:01:51.009> control<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.810> go

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:52.989 
success validated by your control so go

00:01:52.989 --> 00:02:03.149 
success validated by your control so go
to<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.229> next<00:01:53.439> step<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.770> minimized

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
to the next step and I just minimized

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.249 
to the next step and I just minimized
some<00:02:03.520> of<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:03.670> data<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.360> can<00:02:04.479> better<00:02:05.140> see

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
some of this data so you can better see

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.550 
some of this data so you can better see
the<00:02:05.469> mass<00:02:05.590> and<00:02:05.770> balance<00:02:06.009> information<00:02:07.140> so<00:02:08.140> it

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the mass and balance information so it

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.919 
the mass and balance information so it
is<00:02:08.799> defaulted<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.399> the<00:02:09.880> hundred<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.420> two<00:02:10.660> US

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
is defaulted to the hundred and two US

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.890 
is defaulted to the hundred and two US
gallons<00:02:11.290> on<00:02:11.470> board<00:02:11.709> I<00:02:12.640> can<00:02:13.420> obviously<00:02:13.510> change

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
gallons on board I can obviously change

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.890 
gallons on board I can obviously change

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
and the maximum takeoff weight so what I

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.130 
and the maximum takeoff weight so what I
need<00:03:15.530> to<00:03:15.739> do<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:15.980> adjust<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:17.480> amount<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.870> fuel

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140

I have onboard now it in many cases it
is<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.470> would<00:03:21.830> have<00:03:21.920> decided<00:03:22.160> for<00:03:22.340> example<00:03:22.519> that

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
is I would have decided for example that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.809 
is I would have decided for example that
I<00:03:23.150> might<00:03:23.360> have<00:03:24.080> 80<00:03:24.590> US<00:03:25.280> gallons<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.700> fuel

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
I might have 80 US gallons of fuel

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
so but I'm gonna change it I don't have

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.820

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
75 let us say and that would give me 3

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.339 
75 let us say and that would give me 3

then<00:05:36.220> come<00:05:36.520> back<00:05:36.550> and<00:05:37.259> check<00:05:38.259> the<00:05:38.289> massive

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
then come back and check the massive

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.879 
then come back and check the massive
balances<00:05:39.159> and<00:05:39.430> possibly<00:05:39.789> change<00:05:39.849> it<00:05:40.409> so<00:05:41.409> let's

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
balances and possibly change it so let's

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.159 
balances and possibly change it so let's
say<00:05:42.099> that<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.310> that<00:05:42.819> I<00:05:42.940> without<00:05:43.930> father

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169
