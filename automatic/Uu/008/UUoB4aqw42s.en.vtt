00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.230
 just now they were still in the field 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.200
 and now the cucumbers are already here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.660
 freshly into the glass if it is cucumber 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.210
 beet or cabbage at the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.359
 processing of sour canned foods is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 freshness a top priority 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 this quality claim has the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.529
 carl bold kg obliged 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.660
 the traditional family business 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.690
 is also highly valued in terms of technology 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:46.050
 on availability flexibility and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:49.110
 Reliability is so important 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.350
 Time window from harvest to canning 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 to pasteurize to keep relatively short 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.789
 I need equipment for that so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.039
 really do not have any traffic jams 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.039
 no no back pressure in the production 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.390
 therefore one decided in the bold work 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 in radiant at the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.369
 German-Dutch border for one 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.590
 special concept the temporal and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.200
 spatial decoupling of production 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.390
 bottling on one side and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.960
 Labeling and packaging on the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.060
 The other side of Krones delivered for this 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.140
 two labellers packaging and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.360
 Paletti filled and filled 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 stored sour canned glasses 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 Be on the two packaging lines 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.960
 unloaded from the pallets 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.410
 isolated 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.010
 labeled 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.450
 and in her and packaging on trey 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 shrunk for the responsible 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.420
 bold a good decision 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.200
 the beautiful is simply the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.970
 problematic of the interfaces 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.220
 caved in 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.810
 We have been a huge topic in the run-up to the event 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.670
 have from the past often 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.280
 single machines bought themselves 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.410
 Assembled and just hold the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
 linkage made at this 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.010
 Complexity of the plants 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.690
 Control technology behind it today 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.280
 that is not so easy 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.900
 more possible and we would be or we 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.360
 would have suffered shipwreck 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.209
 individual plants hit and therefore 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.519
 we decided that too 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.090
 could offer complete package of a 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.220
 to z 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 we have a clean packaging that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 glass is clean in there we have one 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.010
 clean just sit the label in 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.120
 a tight-fitting box what 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.319
 later also for load securing 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.150
 on the truck, it is important to achieve these goals 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.510
 can be achieved with all technical 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.799
 respected between quality units 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.519
 the already filled and sealed 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.350
 Glasses are on a longer route 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.040
 isolated and then arrive at each 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.040
 one of the two multi-module 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 labeling machines 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.220
 These are each covered with two wet glue 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.950
 aggregates for front and back 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.990
 tag stocked up to 16 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.020
 different glass sizes and shapes 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:17.890
 are currently processing future 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.510
 there is room to move upwards 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.830
 that we have just been equipped for the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.000
 equipped for the future 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.910
 a main topic in the past was 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.709
 very often that we just tagged 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.000
 requirements can not meet because 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.420
 The machine is just not fair 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.310
 in front of the back label or siebel and 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.970
 That was just the reason to say we 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.940
 Take a good basic equipment 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.209
 how to expand the same 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.060
 also applies to modern and packaging 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.860
 after labeling the glasses become 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.140
 subsequently produced together 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.810
 the packaging machines vario patrol 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:59.310
 a great variety of end packages 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.310
 in different park pictures 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.340
 Gentle on the glasses are first in 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.560
 The individual cash registers fed one 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.390
 Active band control prevents this 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.390
 lateral run of the band 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.220
 in the shrinking tunnel ensure optimal 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.210
 Air ducts for a perfect result 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.210
 the container 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.580
 then the containers arrive 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.070
 each a payer a robo box 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.170
 container copying systems during the 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.270
 entire rotation and distributed process 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.560
 The containers are form-fitting from 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.560
 a claw 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.340
 The finished sheets will take, among other things 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:09.410
 a modul page lucy palais animals on and 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.410
 thus forms perfectly well pallets 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.809
 freshly processed under highest 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.659
 Availability made and all around 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:39.559
 attractively packed so the goods arrive 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:42.080
 in 50 countries worldwide with one vinegar 

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:44.479
 Brewery in Berlin has started it all 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.809
 an internationally successful 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.580
 Company has evolved from it 

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:54.009
 one thing has always remained with bold people 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.009
 freshness as a top priority
