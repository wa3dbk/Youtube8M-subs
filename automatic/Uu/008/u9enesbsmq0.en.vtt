00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
rich sand color and i have it on and it

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.400 
rich sand color and i have it on and it
really<00:03:37.670> matches<00:03:37.940> my<00:03:38.240> skin<00:03:38.300> tone<00:03:38.600> really<00:03:39.230> well

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
really matches my skin tone really well

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.320 
really matches my skin tone really well
so<00:03:39.770> I<00:03:40.130> think<00:03:40.940> I<00:03:41.030> chose<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.600> good<00:03:42.080> a<00:03:43.040> good<00:03:44.000> one

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
so I think I chose a good a good one

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:48.730 
so I think I chose a good a good one
this<00:03:44.960> one<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.740> was<00:03:45.950> like<00:03:46.220> 8<00:03:46.850> 99<00:03:47.360> for<00:03:48.110> this<00:03:48.350> and

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
this one it was like 8 99 for this and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.530 
this one it was like 8 99 for this and
then<00:03:48.920> I<00:03:49.100> think<00:03:49.310> this<00:03:49.430> is<00:03:49.580> like<00:03:49.760> six<00:03:50.090> dollars

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
then I think this is like six dollars

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.490 
then I think this is like six dollars
and<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.830> DA<00:03:52.400> was<00:03:52.760> about<00:03:53.120> six<00:03:53.810> dollars<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.320> well

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
and the DA was about six dollars as well

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.650 
and the DA was about six dollars as well
so<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.490> think<00:03:55.580> I<00:03:55.880> chose<00:03:56.090> some<00:03:56.300> really<00:03:56.510> good

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
so I think I chose some really good

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.970 
so I think I chose some really good
things<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.200> I'm<00:03:57.320> going<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.470> come<00:03:57.650> back<00:03:57.800> on
