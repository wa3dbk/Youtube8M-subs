00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.340 
about it because I remember that NARS to
stick<00:03:19.980> similar<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.640> this<00:03:21.000> one<00:03:21.330> Norris<00:03:22.050> mom

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
stick similar to this one Norris mom

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.670 
stick similar to this one Norris mom
doesn't<00:03:22.650> come<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.720> free<00:03:24.720> sharpener<00:03:25.530> so

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
doesn't come with a free sharpener so

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.320 
doesn't come with a free sharpener so
you<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.100> buy<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.340> separately<00:03:27.980> also<00:03:29.330> Mars

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you have to buy it separately also Mars

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.800 
you have to buy it separately also Mars
is<00:03:30.630> smaller<00:03:31.110> than<00:03:31.950> this<00:03:32.070> one<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.580> it's<00:03:33.450> there

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
is smaller than this one and it's there

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.990 
is smaller than this one and it's there
is<00:03:33.960> this<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.560> prices<00:03:34.830> are<00:03:35.160> very<00:03:35.550> similar<00:03:35.880> I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
is this the prices are very similar I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.860 
is this the prices are very similar I
think<00:03:36.150> Norris<00:03:36.950> costs<00:03:37.950> about<00:03:38.390> 1400<00:03:39.390> something

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
think Norris costs about 1400 something

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.490 
think Norris costs about 1400 something
while<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.260> one<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.550> 1500<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:43.460> yeah<00:03:44.480> if<00:03:45.500> we

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
while this one is 1500 so yeah if we

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.200

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
to the counters just to check the colors

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.310 
to the counters just to check the colors
because<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.240> ones<00:03:54.420> online<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.990> pictures
