 with María Inés Jaramillo we will be 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 talking about what are the trends in 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.800
 underwear for those nights 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.390
 specials for wedding night for 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 brides also for that moment so 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.890
 special so welcome thanks for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.360
 being with us thank you very much very 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.690
 happy to be here with you 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.760
 talk about a topic as special as it is 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.279
 the moment of brides and marriage 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.590
 for women but it is also 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.629
 we speak specifically that first 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.580
 night the wedding night the woman has 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.199
 to be produced a lot, that is, 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.239
 many let's say the elements that make 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:43.830
 part that a woman that bhp her sensual 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.080
 but like time receive a night that 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.150
 it's so important exactly when 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.309
 We are talking about the subject of brides 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.979
 we refer to many moments here we are going to 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.559
 start watching trends for that night 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.030
 which, as we have said, is a night 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.430
 absolutely romantic but it's not 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.500
 only the wedding night is everything 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 what is the woman living in that 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.670
 moment that is a moment of much 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.409
 romanticism and much subtlety of many 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.520
 dreams even though brides have 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.859
 changed as the part 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.850
 apart from femininity has not changed 

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:14.549
 has not changed 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380
 that is at that moment the romanticism 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.240
 come back and come out they have it with all the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.789
 sensitivity at this moment we are 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.250
 seeing a corset that is an ideal garment 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:26.560
 to stylize the body when 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.479
 brides put on their dresses they put on 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.329
 much this garment precisely for 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.340
 give him to help his silhouette and 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:36.549
 fun a little more comfortable and 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.530
 apart from that for the little glitter all 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.259
 the part then of the romanticism of 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.329
 socks with the light then as I said 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.860
 an hour is a time where brides 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:47.140
 so they would not have lived it before 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.119
 they become absolutely romantic 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.220
 dedicated with another of these details 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.380
 good but not only the wedding night is 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.020
 important although everything is very important 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.569
 the day becomes important within the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.369
 girlfriend then how to do so that those 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.759
 costumes are made suddenly with 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.159
 rhinestones with this ornaments and things so 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.769
 subtle are also suitable with the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.379
 dress that suddenly will not compete 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:14.350
 or do not go to see and be more aesthetic 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.580
 then we for that night have 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.770
 a large portfolio 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.630
 If the dress is a very dress 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.380
 Delgadito that what is not put by 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.290
 under 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.730
 let's say it's going to interfere with the dress 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.830
 then there are a lot more garments 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.570
 much more basic lists and we look are 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.640
 the silhouettes are the brides buy 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.100
 Lower- cut silhouettes are with backs 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 discovered but if the dress allows 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.180
 because thicker one more garment 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.740
 elaborate can choose a garment like 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.710
 we just saw what happens with the 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.150
 stockings because before the average was not lacking 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.430
 in a girlfriend but now we see that the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.590
 brides are wearing more sandals 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.330
 soon the most discovered fingers 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.130
 then how to make so the stockings 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.490
 and they look appropriate because the suspenders 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.380
 they are supremely sensual and if you touch them 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.440
 choose two things if you want to be with 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.260
 her garter belt stocking very sexy for 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.180
 the occasion must have a shoe 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.820
 covered if you want to be in sandals 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.400
 if by recommendations they say even of 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.260
 put socks that have a toe cap because 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.450
 there are also some socks that do not have 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.920
 tip and can be used with sandalwood 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.180
 what did you tell me now what kind of 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.950
 garment 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.959
 it's not just for the dress 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.719
 remember that around marriage 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.400
 many events happen and during the 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.439
 marriage when the woman marries 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.090
 he also wants to be begins to change 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.560
 a little bit your wardrobe habits 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.469
 then also the elaborated garments 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.060
 with transparencies is one way 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.670
 opportunity let's say to show a 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.079
 little bit more the outside of this kind of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.000
 garments that are where they influence from 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.939
 soon these trends in clothing 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.900
 outside when talking about garments 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:49.120
 people a lot if they have a lot of influence 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.560
 goes very much in the style of each woman 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.720
 we can generalize that it is a 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.269
 influence or that all models 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.879
 come if the woman is very romantic in 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.700
 your day to day take advantage of these clothes with 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.870
 these lace that we are seeing here 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.599
 precisely to show them or with a 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.819
 neckline or with some shirts with something 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.439
 transparency but with many useful me 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.299
 love the way for example the 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.609
 corsetry that is a French type that does not 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.260
 have hoops or go as it leaves as the 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:16.329
 natural fall of the bust is a 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.459
 very natural modeling are some lace 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.289
 with elasticity that fit 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.570
 perfectly before the lace was very 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.820
 rigid 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.230
 and then I did not give all this modeling so 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.350
 natural that we are seeing here and the 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:31.110
 width of the bread has a fat santi 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.270
 it helps a lot because first it does not mark is 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.750
 true it's very nice because all the 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.970
 part that gives the outline is a bread has 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.160
 lace this when for us it is the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.560
 trend and pantic that women look 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.330
 a lot and that we're going to take advantage of 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.460
 arrange to give to people 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.080
 that we are seeing the 10 people that 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.920
 they call us at this time we are going to 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.920
 give a funky 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 167 register with their ID number 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.170
 and all of them will be delivering is the 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.840
 then the panty that is this panty 30 and 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.220
 true that it is beautiful courtesy 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.810
 then of tania and the three graces 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.280
 in the san diego tania 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.200
 that it is suddenly easier 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240
 move from bath and they go tomorrow with their 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.340
 speak and claim the panty of color that 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.920
 more like it because I'm in tulle only 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.470
 from experience I'm getting married 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.960
 let's put some of it down here if we 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.030
 let's play how much should I buy 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.160
 in underwear to carry us 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.670
 for the wedding night but to the moon of 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.400
 honey 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.990
 exactly to be very relative as 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.120
 said mother that depends a lot on each 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.570
 noble but when we are close to the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.150
 girlfriend let's say they have about 78 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:41.940
 complete games because it is also very 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.290
 important to see that this is a girlfriend in 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.220
 your day to day will also use some 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:46.710
 basic clothes 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.470
 then not all do lace here we see 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:51.570
 a garment a highlight bra with the 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.190
 bottom of the contour and the 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.960
 back with lace that gives a lot 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:57.330
 subtlety but it is a garment that gives 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.440
 very good modeling to the bust because there 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.600
 many women who say that they do not 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.160
 They can put romantic clothes on the 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.980
 support topic let's look at this is a 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.870
 garment that gives very good support for the 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.550
 bust of the woman this cup I love 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.900
 because it is a smooth cup that is not marked 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.370
 when one is going to use any 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.570
 get on top because I do not think 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.880
 nothing more terrifying than one with the 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.920
 bra marked on top of the garment and 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.550
 that's exactly why now they make me 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.920
 the question of how many sets 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.720
 well or clothes must have the girlfriend 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:27.120
 then let's say you have about six 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.590
 seven complete sets with lace with 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.960
 romanticism but also customers 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:33.330
 basic lists for every day one 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.640
 You can combine suddenly if you do not have the 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.910
 seven complete sets 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.070
 For example, buy other shorts 

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.590
 that are not the same now true of 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:45.660
 You can soon dare to judge for 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.060
 combine and have one more more 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.710
 versatility and more Victorian day 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.940
 dumps for example the most packed 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.880
 a tanya and you start playing 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.920
 perfectly by colors inclusive already 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.270
 the mix of colors also works 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.670
 very well there are already people who put on a 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.500
 white bra with gray gloves or 

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.090
 with colors plug-ins thanks to English 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.310
 to accompany the thanks for being with 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.570
 us to help us and not only 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.190
 those women who are going to marry me 

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.570
 I think that is also to innovate in 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.910
 those people those women who 

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:14.100
 already married and sometimes we say that 

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:16.050
 inner part is so exterior in knowing 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.790
 that makes us feel beautiful figures of what 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.560
 that we are wearing, in fact, so 

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:21.360
 thank you for joining us thank you very much 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.650
 and we paste them internal already know then 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.780
 the first two calls for 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:33.380
 can claim their base templates 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:33.380
 we absolutely live in this list
