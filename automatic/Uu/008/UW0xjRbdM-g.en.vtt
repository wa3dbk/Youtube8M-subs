00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
would do is we would mix the fenugreek

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
would do is we would mix the fenugreek
leaves<00:00:42.440> with<00:00:43.010> some<00:00:43.160> salt<00:00:44.980> fenugreek<00:00:45.980> leaves

leaves with some salt fenugreek leaves

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.819 
leaves with some salt fenugreek leaves
or<00:00:46.610> methi<00:00:47.030> has<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:47.539> peculiar<00:00:47.989> bitter<00:00:48.320> taste<00:00:48.649> or

or methi has a peculiar bitter taste or

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.830 
or methi has a peculiar bitter taste or
flavor<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.370> to<00:00:49.610> cut<00:00:49.789> down<00:00:49.940> this<00:00:50.090> flavor<00:00:50.360> we

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
flavor and to cut down this flavor we

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.959 
flavor and to cut down this flavor we
have<00:00:51.079> this<00:00:51.230> process<00:00:51.680> of<00:00:51.860> adding<00:00:52.219> salt<00:00:52.670> in<00:00:52.820> it

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
have this process of adding salt in it

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.090 
have this process of adding salt in it
once<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.510> salt<00:00:53.719> is<00:00:53.899> added<00:00:54.050> there<00:00:54.590> is<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> lot<00:00:54.949> of

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
once the salt is added there is a lot of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.740 
once the salt is added there is a lot of
moisture<00:00:55.309> loss<00:00:55.760> in<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.270> fenugreek<00:00:56.449> leaves

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
moisture loss in the fenugreek leaves

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.959 
moisture loss in the fenugreek leaves
and<00:00:57.140> along<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.370> entire<00:00:58.699> bitter

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
and along with that the entire bitter

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.029 
and along with that the entire bitter
flavor<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.420> removed<00:00:59.780> so<00:01:00.230> let's<00:01:00.410> mix<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.829> salt

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
flavor is removed so let's mix the salt

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.709 
flavor is removed so let's mix the salt
in<00:01:01.280> the<00:01:01.430> fenugreek<00:01:01.670> leaves<00:01:01.940> we<00:01:02.390> would<00:01:02.510> mix

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
in the fenugreek leaves we would mix

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.570 
in the fenugreek leaves we would mix
this<00:01:02.930> nicely<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.559> keep<00:01:03.829> it<00:01:03.980> aside<00:01:04.070> for<00:01:04.250> some

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
this nicely and keep it aside for some

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.960 
this nicely and keep it aside for some
time<00:01:05.830> after<00:01:06.830> keeping<00:01:07.399> these<00:01:07.520> fenugreek

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
time after keeping these fenugreek

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.359 
time after keeping these fenugreek
leaves<00:01:08.090> for<00:01:08.509> a<00:01:08.539> while<00:01:08.750> you<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.500> see<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:09.920> has

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
leaves for a while you can see it has

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.640 
leaves for a while you can see it has
released<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:11.000> lot<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.570> moisture<00:01:11.750> all<00:01:12.170> the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
released a lot of moisture all the

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.380 
released a lot of moisture all the
juices<00:01:12.890> have<00:01:13.040> been<00:01:13.369> released<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:14.119> will<00:01:14.210> just

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
juices have been released we will just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.399 
juices have been released we will just
squeeze<00:01:15.229> them<00:01:15.530> nicely<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.869> this<00:01:17.869> is<00:01:18.020> what<00:01:18.259> we

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
squeeze them nicely and this is what we

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.469 
squeeze them nicely and this is what we
get<00:01:18.560> in<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.950> end<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:19.340> this<00:01:19.790> is<00:01:19.939> what<00:01:20.150> we<00:01:20.390> are

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
get in the end so this is what we are

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.240 
get in the end so this is what we are
going<00:01:20.600> to<00:01:20.720> use<00:01:20.869> for<00:01:21.080> our<00:01:21.110> pakodas<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.070> let's

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
going to use for our pakodas so let's

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.850 
going to use for our pakodas so let's
take<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.610> in<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.820> bowl<00:01:23.290> with<00:01:24.290> the<00:01:24.439> squeezed

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
deep-fried what we would do is we would

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.670 
deep-fried what we would do is we would
break<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.910> into<00:02:26.060> half<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.720> this<00:02:26.750> once<00:02:27.530> all

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
break them into half like this once all

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.500 
break them into half like this once all
these<00:02:27.830> pakoras<00:02:28.310> are<00:02:28.340> broken<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.239> we<00:02:29.360> would

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
these pakoras are broken what we would

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.809 
these pakoras are broken what we would
do<00:02:29.660> is<00:02:29.840> we<00:02:30.290> would<00:02:30.410> deep<00:02:30.680> fry<00:02:30.890> them<00:02:31.100> again<00:02:31.310> in

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
do is we would deep fry them again in
