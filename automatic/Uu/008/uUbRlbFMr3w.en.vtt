would also stop people from getting

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.760 
would also stop people from getting
cable<00:06:27.669> and<00:06:28.080> never<00:06:29.080> thing<00:06:29.289> they<00:06:29.440> could<00:06:29.590> just

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
cable and never thing they could just

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.700 
cable and never thing they could just
run<00:06:29.979> with<00:06:30.099> a<00:06:30.159> BB<00:06:30.490> network<00:06:31.289> but<00:06:32.289> no<00:06:32.440> I<00:06:32.469> don't

last<00:07:20.360> week's<00:07:20.720> brawl<00:07:21.020> and<00:07:21.290> last<00:07:21.500> week<00:07:21.740> smack

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010 
last week's brawl and last week smack

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.469 
last week's brawl and last week smack
them<00:07:22.190> then<00:07:22.700> it<00:07:22.850> just<00:07:23.000> seems<00:07:23.180> kind<00:07:23.389> of

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
them then it just seems kind of

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:25.090 
them then it just seems kind of
pointless<00:07:23.690> because<00:07:24.290> I<00:07:24.320> can<00:07:24.620> just<00:07:24.770> go<00:07:24.950> on

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100 
pointless because I can just go on

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.070 
pointless because I can just go on
youtube<00:07:25.520> and<00:07:25.669> watch<00:07:25.760> the<00:07:26.120> same<00:07:26.360> exact<00:07:26.750> stuff

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080
