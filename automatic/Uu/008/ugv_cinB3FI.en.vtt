00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
your very early stages and you're not

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
your very early stages and you're not
allowed<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.180> down<00:00:48.360> below<00:00:48.600> 10<00:00:48.809> meters<00:00:49.110> but

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
allowed to go down below 10 meters but

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
allowed to go down below 10 meters but
for<00:00:49.920> snorkeling<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.030> using<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
for snorkeling or you know using in the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
for snorkeling or you know using in the
pool<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:52.170> perfect<00:00:52.670> but<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:53.969> point

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
pool it's perfect but more to the point

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.760 
pool it's perfect but more to the point
perhaps<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> fact<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
perhaps is the fact that you can use it

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
perhaps is the fact that you can use it
at<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> beach<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.820> sand<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> dusts<00:00:58.109> are<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
at the beach so sand and dusts are you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.340 
at the beach so sand and dusts are you
know<00:00:58.590> real<00:00:58.770> killers<00:00:59.129> for<00:01:00.079> for<00:01:01.079> digital

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
know real killers for for digital

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
know real killers for for digital
cameras<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> fact<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.059> it's

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
cameras this one the fact that it's

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
cameras this one the fact that it's
waterproof<00:01:03.359> means<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> also<00:01:04.110> dust<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.650> sand

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
waterproof means it's also dust and sand

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.410 
waterproof means it's also dust and sand
proof<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> know<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.330> have

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
proof so you can you know you can have

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.140 
proof so you can you know you can have
it<00:01:06.600> drop<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> sand<00:01:07.770> just<00:01:08.040> rinse<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.000> off

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it drop it in the sand just rinse it off

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
it drop it in the sand just rinse it off
in<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> water<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.500> you're<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.369> to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
in the in the water and you're good to

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.859 
in the in the water and you're good to
go

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
go

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.560 
go
so<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> 14<00:01:13.409> megapixel<00:01:13.979> camera<00:01:14.340> five<00:01:15.240> times

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
so it's a 14 megapixel camera five times

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.570 
so it's a 14 megapixel camera five times

for charging I might have gotten those
two<00:01:53.880> backwards<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.409> point<00:01:56.899> so

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
two backwards but you get the point so

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.539 
two backwards but you get the point so
then<00:01:58.020> we<00:01:58.110> close<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.950> thing<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.310> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
then we close this thing up like this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.850 
then we close this thing up like this
lock<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> back<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.509> place<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.110> now<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.229> fully

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
lock it back in place and now it's fully

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.830 
lock it back in place and now it's fully
waterproof<00:02:02.360> so<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.450> also<00:02:03.570> has<00:02:03.780> GPS

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
waterproof so it also has GPS

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.859 
waterproof so it also has GPS

but it's an option that's there if you
want<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.910> use<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.180> now<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:27.990> a<00:02:28.050> four<00:02:28.230> hundred

things<00:02:49.200> are<00:02:49.410> actually<00:02:49.680> present<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.130> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
things are actually present in the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.130 
things are actually present in the
camera<00:02:50.580> so<00:02:51.090> you<00:02:51.150> can<00:02:51.330> see<00:02:51.480> here<00:02:51.690> we're<00:02:51.870> in

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
camera so you can see here we're in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.580 
camera so you can see here we're in
shooting<00:02:52.950> mode<00:02:52.980> right<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:53.310> we<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.590> navigate

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
shooting mode right now we can navigate

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
shooting mode right now we can navigate
through<00:02:55.860> some<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:56.910> different<00:02:57.180> modes<00:02:57.300> that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
through some of the different modes that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.229 
through some of the different modes that
are<00:02:57.660> here<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.560> if<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:59.239> go<00:03:00.239> into<00:03:00.390> magic<00:03:02.239> I'm

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
are here so if we go into magic I'm

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.540 
are here so if we go into magic I'm
going<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.540> wrong<00:03:03.660> way<00:03:03.720> there's<00:03:04.110> magic<00:03:04.550> so

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
going the wrong way there's magic so

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.340 
going the wrong way there's magic so
select<00:03:05.850> magic<00:03:06.030> now<00:03:06.300> we<00:03:06.360> have<00:03:06.540> access<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.080> few

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
select magic now we have access to a few

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.740 
select magic now we have access to a few
different<00:03:07.489> camera<00:03:08.489> effects<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.290> can

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
different camera effects so we can

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.310 
different camera effects so we can
difficult<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.810> do<00:03:12.959> when<00:03:13.110> I'm<00:03:14.030> like<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:16.230> we

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
difficult to do when I'm like this so we

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.900 
difficult to do when I'm like this so we
can<00:03:16.350> go<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.010> different<00:03:17.550> camera<00:03:17.760> modes

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
can go up to the different camera modes

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.100 
can go up to the different camera modes
that<00:03:18.000> are<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.390> can<00:03:18.510> see<00:03:18.630> fisheye

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
that are here you can see fisheye

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.320 
that are here you can see fisheye

some of the different modes that are

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.490 
some of the different modes that are
here<00:03:27.209> now<00:03:27.330> some<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.810> these<00:03:27.959> modes<00:03:28.170> will<00:03:28.320> work

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
here now some of these modes will work

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.500 
here now some of these modes will work

not<00:04:18.540> really<00:04:18.810> going<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:18.989> be<00:04:19.049> getting<00:04:19.290> in<00:04:19.380> there

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
not really going to be getting in there

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.349 
not really going to be getting in there
too<00:04:19.680> much<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.100> adjusting<00:04:20.880> those<00:04:21.030> settings

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
too much and adjusting those settings

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.240 
too much and adjusting those settings
but<00:04:21.870> if<00:04:21.959> we<00:04:22.049> go<00:04:22.140> back<00:04:22.320> up<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.650> top<00:04:22.800> here<00:04:23.099> you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
but if we go back up to the top here you

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.860 
but if we go back up to the top here you
do<00:04:23.640> have<00:04:23.669> some<00:04:24.030> scene<00:04:24.240> modes<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.539> can<00:04:24.660> choose
