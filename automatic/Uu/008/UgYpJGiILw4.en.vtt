so I just got finished with the really
intense<00:00:11.200> work<00:00:11.470> I<00:00:11.620> just<00:00:11.980> did<00:00:12.160> about<00:00:12.280> 45<00:00:12.880> minutes

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
intense work I just did about 45 minutes

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.549 
intense work I just did about 45 minutes
of<00:00:13.300> cardio<00:00:13.809> I<00:00:13.990> don't<00:00:14.140> know<00:00:14.230> if<00:00:14.290> you<00:00:14.380> guys<00:00:14.500> ever

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
of cardio I don't know if you guys ever

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.720 
of cardio I don't know if you guys ever
heard<00:00:14.980> of<00:00:15.160> insanity<00:00:16.260> DVDs<00:00:17.260> but<00:00:17.679> no<00:00:18.340> joke

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
heard of insanity DVDs but no joke

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.730 
heard of insanity DVDs but no joke
that's<00:00:19.270> what<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:19.480> just<00:00:19.539> did<00:00:19.810> as<00:00:20.050> your<00:00:20.230> exercise

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
that's what I just did as your exercise

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.950 
that's what I just did as your exercise
blood<00:00:21.250> is<00:00:21.400> pumping<00:00:21.940> through<00:00:22.270> your<00:00:22.510> whole<00:00:22.690> body

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
blood is pumping through your whole body

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.810 
blood is pumping through your whole body
at<00:00:23.260> a<00:00:23.289> rapid<00:00:23.740> rate<00:00:23.770> because<00:00:24.430> your<00:00:24.550> heart<00:00:24.760> is

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
at a rapid rate because your heart is

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.130 
at a rapid rate because your heart is
beating<00:00:25.090> so<00:00:25.300> fast

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
beating so fast

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.279 
beating so fast
so<00:00:26.590> our<00:00:26.859> hair<00:00:27.279> requires<00:00:27.850> a<00:00:28.539> good<00:00:29.020> blood

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
so our hair requires a good blood

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.380 
so our hair requires a good blood
circulation<00:00:29.800> or<00:00:30.279> for<00:00:30.580> those<00:00:30.699> follicles<00:00:30.970> to

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
circulation or for those follicles to

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.029 
circulation or for those follicles to
get<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.660> nutrients<00:00:32.199> that<00:00:32.230> Amin<00:00:32.590> so<00:00:32.800> it<00:00:32.890> can

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
get the nutrients that Amin so it can

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.319 
get the nutrients that Amin so it can
grow<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:34.269> when<00:00:35.230> we<00:00:35.320> exercise<00:00:35.739> those<00:00:36.670> hair

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
grow so when we exercise those hair

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.400 
grow so when we exercise those hair
follicles<00:00:38.050> I<00:00:38.410> have<00:00:39.309> my<00:00:39.460> phone<00:00:39.670> again<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:41.290> when

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
follicles I have my phone again but when

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.620 
follicles I have my phone again but when
we<00:00:41.530> exercise<00:00:42.040> those<00:00:42.309> hair<00:00:42.579> follicles<00:00:43.149> get<00:00:43.480> the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:43.630 
we exercise those hair follicles get the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.299 
we exercise those hair follicles get the
nutrients<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.200> it<00:00:44.410> needs<00:00:44.440> from<00:00:44.829> our<00:00:45.010> blood

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
nutrients that it needs from our blood

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.369 
nutrients that it needs from our blood
and<00:00:45.610> it<00:00:46.210> allows<00:00:46.510> our<00:00:46.690> hair<00:00:46.930> to<00:00:47.110> grow

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
and it allows our hair to grow

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.950 
and it allows our hair to grow
so<00:00:47.649> speaking<00:00:47.860> of<00:00:48.010> like<00:00:48.219> cardio<00:00:48.760> or<00:00:49.210> aerobics

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
so speaking of like cardio or aerobics

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.729 
so speaking of like cardio or aerobics
workouts

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
workouts

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.220 
workouts
those<00:00:51.340> help<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.149> get<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.390> heart<00:00:52.629> pumping<00:00:52.719> and

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
those help to get the heart pumping and

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.440 
those help to get the heart pumping and
the<00:00:53.320> blood<00:00:53.559> circulating<00:00:54.129> so<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.550> can<00:00:54.670> get<00:00:54.850> go

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
the blood circulating so you can get go

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.029 
the blood circulating so you can get go
all<00:00:55.719> around<00:00:56.050> our<00:00:56.110> body<00:00:56.350> and<00:00:56.590> your<00:00:56.680> hair<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.890> not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
going to grow overnight but I can
