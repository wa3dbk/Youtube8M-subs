so if I want have a four twelve or one

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.540 
so if I want have a four twelve or one
twelve<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:38.020> I<00:00:38.140> could<00:00:38.320> mix<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.710> match<00:00:38.920> so<00:00:39.340> if<00:00:39.460> I

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
twelve and I could mix and match so if I

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.760 
twelve and I could mix and match so if I
wanted<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:39.940> have<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.180> hundred<00:00:40.660> watt<00:00:40.809> lead<00:00:41.140> head

to<00:00:41.949> going<00:00:42.190> into<00:00:42.399> a<00:00:42.430> one<00:00:42.699> twelve<00:00:43.000> cabinet<00:00:43.510> it's

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
to going into a one twelve cabinet it's

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.189 
to going into a one twelve cabinet it's
no<00:00:44.230> problem<00:00:44.699> we<00:00:45.699> also<00:00:45.820> have<00:00:46.120> our<00:00:46.449> pedal<00:00:46.960> board

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
no problem we also have our pedal board

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.619 
no problem we also have our pedal board
and<00:00:47.379> our<00:00:47.770> pedal<00:00:48.070> board<00:00:48.309> you<00:00:48.850> can<00:00:49.000> add<00:00:49.239> any

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
and our pedal board you can add any

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.720 
and our pedal board you can add any
number<00:00:49.840> of<00:00:50.140> plugins<00:00:50.739> here<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.219> if<00:00:51.309> I<00:00:51.399> wanted<00:00:51.609> to

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
number of plugins here so if I wanted to

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.760 
number of plugins here so if I wanted to
have<00:00:51.820> a<00:00:51.850> wah<00:00:52.120> wah<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.600> these<00:00:53.260> could<00:00:53.469> all<00:00:53.590> be

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
have a wah wah and these could all be

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.310 
have a wah wah and these could all be
have<00:00:54.039> total<00:00:54.550> midi<00:00:54.879> control<00:00:55.329> I<00:00:55.510> could<00:00:55.780> also<00:00:55.930> add

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
have total midi control I could also add

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.630 
have total midi control I could also add
a<00:00:56.940> phaser<00:00:57.940> or<00:00:58.210> flanger<00:00:59.050> delay<00:00:59.079> now<00:00:59.829> any<00:01:00.399> of<00:01:00.519> the

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
a phaser or flanger delay now any of the

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.580 
a phaser or flanger delay now any of the
tempo<00:01:01.030> based<00:01:01.269> effects<00:01:01.690> can<00:01:01.960> actually<00:01:02.289> if<00:01:02.469> you

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
tempo based effects can actually if you

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.009 
tempo based effects can actually if you
click<00:01:02.829> right<00:01:03.010> here<00:01:03.460> can<00:01:03.760> now<00:01:03.910> be<00:01:04.150> tempo<00:01:04.600> synced

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
click right here can now be tempo synced

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.560 
click right here can now be tempo synced
so<00:01:05.530> as<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.980> play<00:01:06.220> it<00:01:06.250> would<00:01:06.610> automatically<00:01:07.210> be

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
so as you play it would automatically be

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.929 
so as you play it would automatically be
to<00:01:08.170> automatic<00:01:08.650> quarter<00:01:08.950> notes<00:01:09.159> or<00:01:09.400> half<00:01:09.580> notes

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
to automatic quarter notes or half notes

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.390 
to automatic quarter notes or half notes
