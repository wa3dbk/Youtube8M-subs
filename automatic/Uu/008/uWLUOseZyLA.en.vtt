sparkles are quite interesting so we

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.339 
sparkles are quite interesting so we
said<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> try<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.090> find<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.809> scientific

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
then we also penned up a very nice

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
then we also penned up a very nice
restaurant<00:00:41.969> very<00:00:42.210> romantic<00:00:42.899> restaurant<00:00:43.410> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
restaurant very romantic restaurant and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.779 
restaurant very romantic restaurant and
what<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.920> do<00:00:44.040> why<00:00:44.190> we<00:00:44.219> were<00:00:44.399> having<00:00:44.670> these

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
what we do why we were having these

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.180 
what we do why we were having these
meals<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.270> measure<00:00:45.809> their<00:00:46.079> heart<00:00:46.350> rate<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
meals we measure their heart rate and we

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.740 
meals we measure their heart rate and we
also<00:00:47.309> measure<00:00:47.640> things<00:00:47.879> called<00:00:48.149> skin

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
also measure things called skin

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
also measure things called skin
conductance<00:00:49.289> which<00:00:49.500> shows<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.070> excited<00:00:50.879> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
conductance which shows how excited you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
conductance which shows how excited you
are<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:51.899> compare<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> two<00:00:52.559> results

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
are we then compare the two results

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.500 
are we then compare the two results
where<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.399> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.670> more<00:00:53.879> excited<00:00:54.420> by

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
where they going to be more excited by

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.700 
where they going to be more excited by
their<00:00:54.629> Papa<00:00:54.870> celebrates<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.620> were

their<00:01:10.290> pulses<00:01:10.799> raised<00:01:11.070> far<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> their

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
their pulses raised far more and their

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.390 
their pulses raised far more and their
skin<00:01:12.659> conduction<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> far<00:01:13.710> higher<00:01:13.950> level<00:01:14.310> of

at home served by their partners so it's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
at home served by their partners so it's
very<00:01:19.229> significant<00:01:20.009> extent<00:01:20.220> more<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.640> they

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
very significant extent more than they

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.109 
very significant extent more than they
enjoyed<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.450> restaurant<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.850> why

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
enjoyed them in your restaurant so why

enjoyed them in your restaurant so why
should<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.509> why<00:01:24.930> should<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.439> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
should this be why should it make so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.469 
should this be why should it make so
much<00:01:25.860> difference<00:01:25.890> when<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.790> husband<00:01:27.270> cooks

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
much difference when the husband cooks

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
much difference when the husband cooks
the<00:01:27.689> meal<00:01:27.840> well<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> think<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:28.979> three

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the meal well I think there are three

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
the meal well I think there are three
reasons<00:01:29.400> first<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.970> all<00:01:30.119> there's<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.780> privacy

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
reasons first of all there's of privacy

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.469 
reasons first of all there's of privacy
in<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.799> rest<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.220> surrounding<00:01:32.820> by<00:01:32.939> strangers

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
in a rest or surrounding by strangers

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.600 
in a rest or surrounding by strangers
and<00:01:33.689> maybe<00:01:34.409> you're<00:01:34.619> worried<00:01:34.920> TT<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.490> know

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and maybe you're worried TT you know

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.069 
and maybe you're worried TT you know
you're<00:01:35.850> murdering<00:01:36.180> sweet<00:01:36.479> nothings<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.900> one

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
you're murdering sweet nothings to one

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.080 
you're murdering sweet nothings to one
another<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.860> overheard<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.759> think

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
another this will be overheard I think

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.520 
another this will be overheard I think
the<00:01:39.150> second<00:01:39.479> thing<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.930> intimacy

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the second thing is that the intimacy

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.820 
the second thing is that the intimacy
it's<00:01:40.860> much<00:01:41.130> more<00:01:41.340> intimate<00:01:41.610> home
