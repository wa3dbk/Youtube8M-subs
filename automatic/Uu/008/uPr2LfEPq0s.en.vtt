to release to the weight of the rain

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:35.569 
to release to the weight of the rain
that<00:00:33.809> being<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.289> number<00:00:34.590> one<00:00:34.770> factor<00:00:35.129> here

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that being the number one factor here

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430

once the horse has developed enough top

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.830 
once the horse has developed enough top
line<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.890> begin<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.460> he<00:00:38.940> must<00:00:39.300> work<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.720> the

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
line to begin this he must work in the

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.479 
line to begin this he must work in the
way<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.170> rain<00:00:40.350> otherwise<00:00:40.770> when<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.070> start

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
way to the rain otherwise when you start

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.010 
way to the rain otherwise when you start
working<00:00:41.700> P<00:00:42.000> outdoors<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.630> going<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.810> bolt

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
working P outdoors it's going to bolt

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.870 
working P outdoors it's going to bolt
out<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.380> reins<00:00:43.560> if<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:44.280> horse<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> used

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:44.880 
out of the reins if your horse is used

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.790 
out of the reins if your horse is used
to<00:00:45.000> being<00:00:45.180> held<00:00:45.390> against<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> reins<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.649> it's

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to being held against the reins so it's

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
to being held against the reins so it's
very<00:00:46.920> important<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.820> only<00:00:48.090> works<00:00:48.630> if<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
very important this only works if you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840 
very important this only works if you
ride<00:00:49.290> in<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> classical<00:00:50.250> system<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.760> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
ride in the classical system that is you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.979 
ride in the classical system that is you
ride<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> horse<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> weight<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
ride the horse on the weight of the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.960 
ride the horse on the weight of the
reins<00:00:52.200> light<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.920> not<00:00:53.130> pulling<00:00:53.610> against<00:00:53.910> the
