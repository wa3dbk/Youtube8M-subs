00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 Yes 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.660
 hello mr 1 first a nice 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.369
 third if we have today yes 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.960
 you look right after a month wait 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.529
 that finally a video again 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.430
 appeared 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.680
 that's because I either 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.430
 he has no time or just no desire 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.620
 to make the video so it's 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.460
 actually more or less care 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.960
 every case now , always before me 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.489
 keep going because I 've seen 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.219
 are still a few beans to contact 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.500
 of course it was possible to get out with his video 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:46.420
 I also have one more shit 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.550
 Bit broken with a colleague 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.649
 which also makes youtube videos 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.089
 so with two ps but so the device is so 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.350
 he means he belongs to it he does too 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:54.760
 no more videos shit who thought 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.039
 wait otherwise offers a bit 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.109
 no one ripped through 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.269
 well, that would make me alone 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.879
 stand here a video and indeed 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.100
 has been in the last few years 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.570
 videos a year the beta maps and he 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.080
 something desired or new 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.909
 Maps I'm doing this spontaneously video 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.790
 and in the short term now a server 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.140
 has set up etc 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.550
 I thought I'll show you 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.050
 just like inserting a new map and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.000
 while the swearing is training on it 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.030
 he just bakes then you have too 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 a little new map the beta maps so 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.970
 a shit it comes then everything later 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.070
 tuned in to tutorial English 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.730
 planned before then with a huge break 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.130
 had inserted 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.600
 and yes, we'll catch you best 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.940
 right at the problem not at all 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.080
 you only need a lot of fox no that 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.660
 of course, does not need that, even after 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.190
 the program needs only me he needed 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.290
 best in surfer makes him only once 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.330
 to a client who works and 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.970
 we can still access with him and 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.619
 of course a lot 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.940
 Well then let's start right now we go 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.940
 the club contacts the server 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.549
 then we also went west gameloft 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.440
 on the two points from very nice 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.720
 he clearly realizes that at the top now 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.179
 underlined money underlined plays that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.800
 is a map that 101 big that it 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.910
 Actually , you can go with it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.300
 use or something 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.950
 that is not quite in it and yes me 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.290
 show how not to insert properly and 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.830
 Although the human rights activist one goes the 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.090
 be gone the title ins plus we know 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.850
 Of course, even if I do not anymore 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 and do not pull on the desktop and 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.230
 then edit that is of course synonymous 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.519
 and then do the following for her 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.010
 does at the last end 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.290
 So that looks like that and then you do 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.530
 the nearest pay when bet 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.530
 2007 and then to client assignment 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.909
 I think there's my spacebar it because 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.409
 make my spacebar and then you do 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:00.079
 gm one writes the name held 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.480
 then it should be underlined picture 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.170
 I could look a few more 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.030
 cell release is not a problem and 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.040
 well, that corresponds noticeably but the 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.650
 number of the front have written so 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.560
 207 notice we pull that you nothing 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.870
 In here, override and think 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.299
 we still get on top of the two points 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.129
 go there again and again 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.150
 and not now I have 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.280
 already 14 and the game 90 1 for example 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.590
 just two games its config file the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.849
 makes direct viewing and editing or 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.109
 retires to the desktop 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.129
 work there you have a map behind 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:42.829
 thanks the names made the spacebar 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:44.060
 Write your memory 207 we stop it 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:47.409
 or aim therefore again from the guests 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.409
 What's going on at every channel ? 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.030
 2 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.900
 now nothing more distant 7 always looks that 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.900
 is writing correctly 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.570
 Yes 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.120
 there 27 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:19.100
 and the last time in the game 90 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:22.500
 Let's write another 20 7 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.090
 because you 2007 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.900
 so then we would have regulated that too 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.060
 do yes and then I will too 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.220
 I would finish my goal 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.550
 make a fix as well and me 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.449
 pause the video of my time is 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:42.550
 equal 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:45.069
 so on, something bleeds you can 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.080
 can start yes, you probably see 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.370
 that lied to me in 2007 still exists 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.849
 then you finally have everything relatively 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.849
 done right 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.770
 with the two client extra 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.620
 so try here and then once 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.660
 if it works 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.310
 right now gntm right has something 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.840
 not really looking like 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.840
 said they are freshly set up they are 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.450
 much better difference 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.190
 me and so far is now one 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.190
 tutorial to show that I'm still alive 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:51.400
 something is alas that is this 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:51.400
 advent calendar quest okay 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:06:02.370
 interesting will be in the case 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:08.340
 should that be okay ok I have 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:10.020
 I mean, if that's a yes 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.840
 show exactly that was about the 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.490
 forget the map and that the choice 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.080
 coordinate expensive map then you do 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.919
 simply the geneva with the gm makes 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:28.710
 enter / and then spacebar was then 8320 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:29.460
 so letters talente and then you become 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.030
 Do not believe it 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:35.070
 on what a website such a 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:37.919
 nice role as I said here is 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:40.890
 a large area here could be gene 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.560
 or teleporter or whatever 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.410
 and here actually a nice big one 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:49.979
 area for any pug or media 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:53.060
 or no idea what he actually can 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:57.330
 all in one place for a large area 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.890
 framed by the mountains so me 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.090
 would you media sites like that but 

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.410
 with you about which one makes me 

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:02.820
 of course still made videos like you 

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.990
 Media placed like monsters suddenly 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.190
 So my friend from the girls makes 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.169
 what I still wanted and me 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:09.479
 have a big fat list of how 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.760
 I'm getting a little better now 

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.280
 which can not work yes my 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.870
 watch it until you 're so yes that was it 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.460
 actually , first of all, I have 

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.280
 try even a video per week out to 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.650
 hewn or two videos plus 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.530
 christmas special new special and 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.699
 that not everything would be like that 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.830
 next time some back on me 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:28.970
 come on this channel and yes how 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.289
 This video is actually normal 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.449
 that is not still alive and that we are so 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:33.590
 I get a nice merkel 

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.690
 I hope I do not like it though 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.430
 give me a thumbs up 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.930
 Subscribed to the top has done much 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.020
 so you do not have another video 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:43.520
 missed if we should come one and 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.259
 yes of course always comments 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.910
 like to write your video wishes below 

00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:48.620
 I will enter on my list 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.210
 and see what I can do there 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:55.930
 that was it already 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.930
 again until next time alone 2
