00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.500

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.109

 the nora canindé people I did not speak Look us 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.710
 remembering that the person to make a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.140
 suspense for you but the stop that she 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.840

 white and black traditional face 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.920
 The coolest thing is that being here is 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.960

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.030
 this beak half rounded to 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.010
 low is the group of visits Indians are 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.990
 birds that feed on seeds 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.610
 one other thing a lot way is that the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.450
 macaws when they found a partner 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.060
 them they do not change the rest of life 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.470
 All the time, the house is only for 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.470

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.530
