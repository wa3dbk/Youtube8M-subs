flutter button or i should say the jump

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.540 
flutter button or i should say the jump
button<00:00:54.899> your<00:00:55.500> foot<00:00:55.739> are<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.280> higher

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
than you normally would that comes in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.279 
than you normally would that comes in
handy<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.219> some<00:00:59.520> levels<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:00.899> think<00:01:00.930> it's

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
handy on some levels and is i think it's

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.709 
handy on some levels and is i think it's
even<00:01:01.410> required<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.370> some<00:01:02.579> places<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.390> get<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
even required in some places to get the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.030 
even required in some places to get the
perfect<00:01:03.899> score<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.379> others<00:01:06.439> just<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.590> camera
