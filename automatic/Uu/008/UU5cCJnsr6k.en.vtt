 Japan 

00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:07.443
 Good luck, Ruiyou, I have to warn you. 

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:09.872
 I am a master of "orange" 

00:00:09.872 --> 00:00:13.607
 Well, although I don’t like people just calling me "the guy", you called my name wrong. 

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:16.346
 The correct way of thinking should be "long", not "Ruiyou" 

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:17.986
 Oh, this is a good time to remember. 

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:20.658
 Because this is rhyming with PU. 

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:21.666
 do you know? 

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.291
 I am coming to overturn your willow ass. 

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:27.143
 First round, start 

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:28.856
 Hadouken! What? 

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.544
 Have you just said Hoboken? (Hoboken, New Jersey place name) 

00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:32.500
 No! Fluctuation punch! 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.612
 You said Hoboken, the one in New Jersey? 

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:36.158
 I didn't say anything about Hoboken of New Jersey. 

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:38.487
 Oh, that’s good, because that’s my killing skill. 

00:00:38.487 --> 00:00:40.198
 Hoboken! Hoboken! 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.063
 Tornado whirlwind feet! 

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:46.456
 You talked about a bunch of fun words. 

00:00:46.456 --> 00:00:48.783
 Silon 

00:00:48.783 --> 00:00:50.576
 Hey, knock on the door! Do not 

00:00:50.576 --> 00:00:51.527
 Knock on the door 

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:53.304
 I don't want to play, I want to fight 

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:54.429
 Knock on the door!! 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:55.787
 Forget it, who is it? 

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:58.634
 Who is Ruiyou? 

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.993
 Is that you are the best in Ruiyou? 

00:01:01.993 --> 00:01:04.513
 L Dragon Fist! 

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:06.075
 L Dragon Fist! 

00:01:06.075 --> 00:01:07.748
 what? What did you just say? 

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:10.643
 L Dragon Fist! Do you say "Of course"? ("Sure you can" is homophonic with the dragon" 

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:13.512
 No, I mean.. Shenglongquan! 

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:16.134
 No, no, I think you are saying that of course you can 

00:01:16.134 --> 00:01:18.411
 Hey! Hey! Ruiyou! Can I date your sister? 

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.155
 L Dragon Fist! Thank you! 

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.629
 I will definitely be good to her. 

00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:25.121
 Hey! Hey! Can I have your mother's phone number? 

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:27.774
 L Dragon Fist! awesome! (Liu Ding is understood as "of course") 

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:29.704
 Hey, let me try it too? L Dragon Fist! 

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:32.079
 Ok, that's you, KEN!! (He remembers the sure you can be a sure you KEN, KEN is another character of the game) 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.579
 (He remembers you as a sure you KEN, KEN, another character of this game) 

00:01:34.424 --> 00:01:36.987
 Do you understand? I said "Is you, Ken?" 

00:01:36.987 --> 00:01:39.478
 Who is next? 

00:01:39.478 --> 00:01:43.286
 Wow, I really appreciate your samurai spirit (kendo spirit, literally the martial spirit, referring to the samurai spirit, but he pronounced ken-do with the Ken) 

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:44.207
 Hoboken 

00:01:46.207 --> 00:01:47.987
 Win! 

00:01:47.987 --> 00:01:50.777
