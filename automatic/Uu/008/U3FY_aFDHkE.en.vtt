00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
I stable I start this done really just

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.289 
I stable I start this done really just
it<00:04:13.420> doesn't<00:04:13.569> really<00:04:13.810> have<00:04:14.050> that<00:04:14.080> much<00:04:15.299> recoil

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
it doesn't really have that much recoil

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.360 
it doesn't really have that much recoil
itself<00:04:16.690> so<00:04:17.080> true<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:17.440> once<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.130> stock

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
itself so true so once the stock

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.640 
itself so true so once the stock
wouldn't<00:04:18.729> be<00:04:18.820> really<00:04:19.150> necessary<00:04:19.660> for<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
wouldn't be really necessary for it so I

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.500 
wouldn't be really necessary for it so I
just<00:04:20.830> used<00:04:21.010> a<00:04:21.190> box<00:04:21.430> talk<00:04:21.669> on<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.210> it's
