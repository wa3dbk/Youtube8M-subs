00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
these crazy boss fights but I think that

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.270 
these crazy boss fights but I think that
it<00:02:12.870> would<00:02:12.930> be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
it would be

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770 
it would be
able<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.490> add<00:02:13.640> these<00:02:13.850> much<00:02:14.180> tougher<00:02:14.510> enemies

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
able to add these much tougher enemies

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.600 
able to add these much tougher enemies
and<00:02:15.140> especially<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:15.950> actual<00:02:16.310> end<00:02:16.520> of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
and especially one at the actual end of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.309 
and especially one at the actual end of
the<00:02:16.670> game<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:17.270> after<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:17.780> game<00:02:17.990> once<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
the game but after that game once you

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.750 
the game but after that game once you
finally<00:02:18.680> beat<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.069> like<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> idea<00:02:19.550> of

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
finally beat it I like the idea of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.370 
finally beat it I like the idea of
adding<00:02:19.970> more<00:02:20.240> enemies<00:02:20.600> like<00:02:20.780> ebony<00:02:21.200> Knight

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
adding more enemies like ebony Knight

that<00:04:41.900> are<00:04:42.020> harder<00:04:42.350> to<00:04:42.380> find<00:04:42.710> and<00:04:42.950> get<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.520> then

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that are harder to find and get to then

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.680 
that are harder to find and get to then
for<00:04:44.390> instance<00:04:44.810> the<00:04:44.900> alien<00:04:45.530> gun<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:46.730> i<00:04:47.060> like<00:04:47.540> the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
for instance the alien gun so i like the

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:48.760 
for instance the alien gun so i like the
idea<00:04:47.780> you're<00:04:48.050> coming<00:04:48.320> forward<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.590> have

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
idea you're coming forward we have

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.530 
idea you're coming forward we have
talked<00:04:49.010> about<00:04:49.130> climbing<00:04:49.760> and<00:04:49.940> sprinting<00:04:50.420> and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
talked about climbing and sprinting and

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.690 
talked about climbing and sprinting and
all<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.780> stuff<00:04:50.930> in<00:04:51.170> this<00:04:51.320> series<00:04:51.560> but<00:04:52.430> I

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
all that stuff in this series but I

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.520 
all that stuff in this series but I
figured<00:04:53.300> that<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.810> kind<00:04:53.990> of<00:04:54.050> an<00:04:54.170> overall

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
figured that this is kind of an overall

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.580 
figured that this is kind of an overall
trevor<00:04:55.160> traversal<00:04:56.150> idea<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.870> a<00:04:57.350> lot<00:04:57.530> of

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
trevor traversal idea and a lot of

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.200 
trevor traversal idea and a lot of
people<00:04:57.830> are<00:04:57.890> like<00:04:58.010> why<00:04:58.130> can't<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.520> do<00:04:58.670> parkour

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
but I like the idea he's got here now I

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.720 
but I like the idea he's got here now I
don't<00:05:10.010> think<00:05:10.130> we're<00:05:10.220> gonna<00:05:10.280> be<00:05:10.400> getting<00:05:10.520> any

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
don't think we're gonna be getting any

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.060 
don't think we're gonna be getting any
bat<00:05:11.060> claws<00:05:11.360> in<00:05:11.630> this<00:05:11.750> game<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.170> assuming

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
bat claws in this game and assuming

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.050 
bat claws in this game and assuming
that's<00:05:13.220> what<00:05:13.250> he<00:05:13.400> means<00:05:13.550> about<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.730> shootable

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
that's what he means about a shootable

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.360 
that's what he means about a shootable
koala<00:05:14.390> thing<00:05:14.660> but<00:05:15.350> I<00:05:15.560> like<00:05:15.860> the<00:05:16.010> idea<00:05:16.160> of

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
koala thing but I like the idea of

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.950 
koala thing but I like the idea of
climbing<00:05:16.910> or<00:05:17.060> getting<00:05:17.390> to<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.570> end<00:05:17.720> of<00:05:17.870> the

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
climbing or getting to the end of the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.270 
climbing or getting to the end of the
area<00:05:18.290> and<00:05:18.410> kind<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.650> bring<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:18.980> down<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.250> a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
area and kind of bring you down to a

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.760 
area and kind of bring you down to a
central<00:05:19.700> area<00:05:20.000> from<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.300> zip<00:05:20.540> line<00:05:20.780> or<00:05:21.050> climbing

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
central area from a zip line or climbing

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.190 
central area from a zip line or climbing
down<00:05:21.860> a<00:05:21.920> rope<00:05:22.250> along<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.700> wall<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.660> that<00:05:23.690> it's

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
down a rope along the wall so that it's

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.890 
down a rope along the wall so that it's
not<00:05:24.380> annoying<00:05:25.100> where<00:05:25.580> Skyrim<00:05:26.330> had<00:05:26.480> a<00:05:26.510> very

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
not annoying where Skyrim had a very

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.470 
not annoying where Skyrim had a very
great<00:05:27.410> system<00:05:27.980> where<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.460> was<00:05:28.610> always<00:05:28.850> you'd

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
great system where it was always you'd

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.570 
great system where it was always you'd
go<00:05:29.750> through<00:05:30.080> one<00:05:30.350> end<00:05:30.710> of<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.010> cave<00:05:31.220> and<00:05:31.250> out

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
go through one end of the cave and out

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.670 
go through one end of the cave and out
the<00:05:31.880> other<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.390> was<00:05:32.540> never<00:05:32.720> go<00:05:33.140> through<00:05:33.530> this

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
the other it was never go through this

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.500 
the other it was never go through this
cave<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.250> then<00:05:34.370> turn<00:05:34.610> around<00:05:34.640> and<00:05:35.000> come<00:05:35.180> all

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
cave and then turn around and come all

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.440 
cave and then turn around and come all
the<00:05:35.810> way<00:05:35.840> back<00:05:35.990> it<00:05:36.530> was<00:05:36.920> a<00:05:36.950> very<00:05:37.040> smooth<00:05:38.030> you

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
the way back it was a very smooth you

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.670 
the way back it was a very smooth you
know<00:05:38.480> you'd<00:05:38.780> go<00:05:38.960> through<00:05:39.170> the<00:05:39.260> cave<00:05:39.440> and<00:05:39.470> you

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
know you'd go through the cave and you

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.050 
know you'd go through the cave and you
exit<00:05:40.040> out<00:05:40.100> somewhere<00:05:40.430> else<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.610> you'd<00:05:40.730> open

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
exit out somewhere else and you'd open

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.030 
exit out somewhere else and you'd open
up<00:05:41.090> this<00:05:41.240> another<00:05:41.450> area<00:05:41.840> and<00:05:42.050> you'd<00:05:42.560> see<00:05:42.800> a

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
up this another area and you'd see a

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.370 
up this another area and you'd see a
bunch<00:05:43.370> of<00:05:43.490> more<00:05:43.700> waypoints<00:05:44.600> on<00:05:44.720> your<00:05:44.960> map<00:05:45.140> of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
bunch of more waypoints on your map of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.740 
bunch of more waypoints on your map of
places<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.950> would<00:05:46.190> go<00:05:46.370> and<00:05:47.240> from<00:05:47.570> there<00:05:47.720> you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
places you would go and from there you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.440 
places you would go and from there you
go<00:05:48.050> into<00:05:48.230> another<00:05:48.470> area<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:49.040> I<00:05:49.670> think<00:05:50.120> that

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
go into another area and I think that

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.500 
go into another area and I think that
the<00:05:51.110> idea<00:05:51.260> of<00:05:51.650> that<00:05:52.070> being<00:05:52.670> pulled<00:05:52.970> into<00:05:53.120> here

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
the idea of that being pulled into here

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.050 
the idea of that being pulled into here
would<00:05:53.780> be<00:05:53.900> very<00:05:54.080> cool<00:05:54.500> um<00:05:54.800> you<00:05:55.700> know<00:05:55.760> you<00:05:55.850> go

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
would be very cool um you know you go

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.940 
would be very cool um you know you go
through<00:05:56.300> this<00:05:56.420> this<00:05:56.690> cave<00:05:57.020> and<00:05:57.290> you<00:05:57.440> come<00:05:57.680> at

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
through this this cave and you come at

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.950 
through this this cave and you come at
the<00:05:58.160> end<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:58.490> you're<00:05:58.580> like<00:05:58.850> above<00:05:59.540> and<00:05:59.840> you're

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
the end and you're like above and you're

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.650 
the end and you're like above and you're
at<00:06:00.080> this<00:06:00.230> unique<00:06:01.090> sightseeing<00:06:02.090> area<00:06:02.510> or

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
at this unique sightseeing area or

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.060 
at this unique sightseeing area or
something<00:06:02.990> like<00:06:03.110> that<00:06:03.170> where<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:03.770> can<00:06:03.920> look

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
something like that where you can look

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:06.100 
something like that where you can look
over<00:06:04.190> a<00:06:04.310> lot<00:06:04.640> of<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:04.910> wasteland<00:06:05.300> but<00:06:05.900> there's

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
over a lot of the wasteland but there's

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.630 
over a lot of the wasteland but there's
a<00:06:06.170> zip<00:06:06.440> line<00:06:06.620> so<00:06:06.860> once<00:06:07.040> you're<00:06:07.160> done<00:06:07.310> kind<00:06:07.610> of

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
a zip line so once you're done kind of

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.770 
a zip line so once you're done kind of
looking<00:06:07.910> at<00:06:08.060> that<00:06:08.240> that's<00:06:08.420> kind<00:06:08.630> of<00:06:08.660> your

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
looking at that that's kind of your

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.180 
looking at that that's kind of your
treat<00:06:09.110> at<00:06:09.230> the<00:06:09.290> end<00:06:09.380> they<00:06:09.560> cave<00:06:09.740> along<00:06:09.950> with
