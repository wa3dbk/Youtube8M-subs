00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 To be sure and message all 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.600
 you have to come back 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.279
 First of all, note the following 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.890
 driving technique in the entrance to the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.670
 At the top I press my bike on 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 handlebar strong to curves inside through 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 this presses the wheel touches my 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.170
 thigh and thereby I have one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.420
 fifth contact point z 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.680
 My gaze goes far beyond the curve 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.360
 end in the direction of travel thereby 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.570
 my upper body revolves around the vertical 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.220
 axis for perfect control 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.480
 I need a lot of pressure on the front wheel 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.230
 second, the line selection in the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.540
 Spitzkehre The line choice is whole 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.610
 crucial for a successful one 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.920
 driving through the Spitzkehre I drive with 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.500
 the front wheel the curve so far outside 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.660
 as possible and tax only from the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.119
 vertex of the curve the front wheel in 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.369
 the new direction is important because 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 my back wheel the way of the front wheel 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.960
 always abbreviates and otherwise at the curves 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.119
 inside hang naturally 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.310
 also influences the underground and the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.280
 Obstacles decisive line selection in 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.930
 the sharp-end sweep puts the rear wheel in 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.180
 offset the pointed corner on the rear wheel 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.020
 I can go straight to the bend 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.660
 give in 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm looking for a point with me 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.149
 good traction where i use my front wheel 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 The front brake can then block 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.399
 I jump out of my knee and knee 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.009
 as soon as my rear wheel in the air 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.830
 My hip goes into the new one 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.530
 direction that I reach through mine 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:58.970
 look the view should again far ahead 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.970
 go in the new direction
