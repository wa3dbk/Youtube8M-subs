00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:08.130
 Hello I wanted to share information on 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.880
 about such a program for 1 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:17.029
 the monitor is called this program 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.859
 reads information from sensors and gives and 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.650
 temperature 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:26.609
 that is, everything here is abundant to you 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.900
 it is clear that I like it shows 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.910
 maximum achievable temperature from 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
 load when your computer is running 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.380
 under load just this program can 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
 collapse and background she is here 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:45.329
 remember all the maximum loads then 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 there is a temperature and I can still say this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:52.410
 the program is no 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.520
 an integral part for those who drive 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.760
 processor when 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.920
 wait what to drive i think 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.509
 it's worth reading these temperatures 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.229
 and generally make sure if 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:15.580
 motherboard at all for overclocking because 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:18.630
 it is often the case that the temperature is permissible 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.700
 bringing the north bridge 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.220
 inadequately shows very overpriced 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.759
 I have such a temperature 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.450
 a couple breaks up my burned mamok 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.270
 curiosity, and how it would be possible to say 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 illiteracy at that time I already 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.530
 mothers burned out 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.240
 power supply was also a matter 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.750
 pay attention to this line 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.649
 called you 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.679
 pin 2 it shows the temperature just 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:57.869
 this north bridge 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:02:00.899
 cheat he cools mostly always 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.899
 passive radiator 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:11.730
 Well, let's say now such 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:15.720
 Nurse is still can say that here 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.690
 This area is this node is responsible for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.599
 power is all mother i mean processor 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.230
 here is the phase stabilizer and here 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.370
 this 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.209
 the area of the transistor keys she too 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.040
 Generally strongly heats up and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.950
 if you have at least one key blows 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.390
 then you will most likely have to go because 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:47.489
 new mother shop so what else do I want 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.290
 pay attention that this one here 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.599
 region 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.230
 data Nurse she is a budget then 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:59.209
 there is a cheaper option she is this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.209
 the area is practically protected by nothing 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.069
 here 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.670
 This revision is already there 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:12.730
 radiator that at this point is also worth 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:15.250
 pay attention more of course I 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.560
 I wanted you to focus on 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.560
 on this page is always like 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.440
 control this temperature it will 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.299
 It is useful if the temperature is in 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.760
 within 70 80 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.410
 and then some have 90 degrees 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.670
 I can say it is not normal 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:38.170
 temperature means possible thermal paste 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.989
 it is necessary to replace it under the radiator or 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.680
 do buy some more 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.040
 radiator and even with a fan or 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.750
 simply do not drive alignment 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:57.250
 processor like 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:59.550
 so that's all in principle that I could 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.220
 told by this program 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.620
 she show and temperature is hard 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.600
 ssd disk 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.300
 if you have a computer here too 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.090
 video card which is also important 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.850
 show your power consumption 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.489
 processor if you have functions there 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.920
 some energy savings are provided 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.270
 of these processes here he may not 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.870
 maximum power will issue 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.340
 in this mode, we allow 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.659
 low power consumption 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:40.530
 here 120 shows me as you see 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:44.509
 here is a nuclear phenomenon 5 an old process 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:47.879
 former top but he's pretty hot and 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:52.039
 basically cool this 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.039
 ok tower fan stands 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:01.039
 principle everything is possible still about something 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:04.169
 I'll tell you a little later 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:10.039
 I think this information will be for many 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:10.039
 It is very important to all thanks
