my<00:03:04.320> attack<00:03:04.860> menu<00:03:05.700> up<00:03:05.850> and<00:03:06.090> I<00:03:06.270> realized<00:03:07.020> was

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
my attack menu up and I realized was

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.160 
my attack menu up and I realized was
part<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.300> days<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.330> them<00:03:09.600> for<00:03:09.870> four

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
part of it and days of them for four

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.430 
part of it and days of them for four
rounds<00:03:10.350> twenty<00:03:10.920> percent<00:03:11.250> chance<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:12.300> not<00:03:13.230> act

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
rounds twenty percent chance to not act

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.460 
rounds twenty percent chance to not act
and<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:14.130> great<00:03:14.370> thing<00:03:14.400> about<00:03:14.610> it<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.060> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
and the great thing about it is that it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.229 
and the great thing about it is that it
deals<00:03:16.470> elemental<00:03:17.190> damage<00:03:17.370> according<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.120> your

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
weapon so as you can see fifteen percent

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.060 
weapon so as you can see fifteen percent

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
videos so just trying to get some SP to

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.930 
videos so just trying to get some SP to
be<00:06:05.950> able<00:06:06.040> to<00:06:06.250> use<00:06:06.550> this<00:06:07.710> spell<00:06:11.340> it's<00:06:12.340> a<00:06:12.610> heel

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940 
be able to use this spell it's a heel

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:18.090 
be able to use this spell it's a heel
and<00:06:13.530> it's<00:06:15.690> not<00:06:16.690> the<00:06:16.870> greatest<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.620> wouldn't

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
and it's not the greatest so I wouldn't

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.340 
and it's not the greatest so I wouldn't
really<00:06:18.340> it's<00:06:18.700> probably<00:06:19.180> the<00:06:19.390> least<00:06:20.020> useful

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
really it's probably the least useful

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.550 
really it's probably the least useful

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
boxes I'd say the armor and the weapon
are<00:06:28.780> probably<00:06:29.200> the<00:06:29.350> best<00:06:29.620> and<00:06:30.660> the<00:06:31.660> pet<00:06:32.290> is
