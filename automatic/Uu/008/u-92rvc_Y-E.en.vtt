00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
share so I found it a lot of controllers

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.200

something<00:00:45.210> like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.359> bum<00:00:45.629> bag<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.109> then<00:00:46.800> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
something like a bum bag and then you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.459 
something like a bum bag and then you
can<00:00:47.039> take<00:00:47.249> a<00:00:47.489> hydro<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:49.230> left

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
can take a hydro and like this the left

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.250 
can take a hydro and like this the left
one<00:00:49.559> in<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.219> demo<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> place<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> in

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
one in my demo and you place that in

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.369 
one in my demo and you place that in
your<00:00:52.379> bum<00:00:52.499> bag<00:00:52.710> needs<00:00:53.339> to<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.760> your<00:00:53.879> chest

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 
your bum bag needs to be on your chest

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.660 
your bum bag needs to be on your chest
the<00:00:55.379> higher<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.589> better<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.249> this<00:00:56.519> is

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
the higher the better because this is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
the higher the better because this is
going<00:00:56.819> to<00:00:56.879> track<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.780> direction<00:00:58.170> your<00:00:58.409> body

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
going to track which direction your body

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.489 
going to track which direction your body
is<00:00:58.710> facing<00:00:59.159> but<00:00:59.819> also<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:01.109> know<00:01:01.229> your

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
is facing but also you know your

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.219 
is facing but also you know your
movement<00:01:01.979> so<00:01:02.159> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:03.510> around<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.110> can

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
movement so you can move around you can

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.630 
movement so you can move around you can
duck<00:01:04.440> down<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.070> look<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.309> things<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
duck down you can look at things in the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.810 
duck down you can look at things in the
virtual<00:01:05.790> scene<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.710> work<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> demo<00:01:08.760> you

you can duck down and look at all the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.530 
you can duck down and look at all the
details<00:01:46.230> in<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:48.000> I've<00:01:48.090> made<00:01:48.300> a<00:01:48.330> game

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
details in there so I've made a game

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.230 
details in there so I've made a game
demo<00:01:48.870> with<00:01:49.050> this<00:01:49.260> which<00:01:50.220> involves<00:01:50.670> using<00:01:50.850> your

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
demo with this which involves using your

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.160 
demo with this which involves using your
Hydra<00:01:51.810> want<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.410> pick<00:01:52.620> up<00:01:53.300> these<00:01:54.300> Easter<00:01:55.140> eggs

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
Hydra want to pick up these Easter eggs

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.320 
Hydra want to pick up these Easter eggs
which<00:01:55.560> I've<00:01:55.740> hidden<00:01:56.070> around<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.460> level<00:01:56.760> so

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
which I've hidden around the level so

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.700 
which I've hidden around the level so
you<00:01:57.420> have<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.660> find<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> Easter<00:01:58.020> eggs<00:01:58.290> you

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
you have to find the Easter eggs you
