coming out which will be cool but anyway
i<00:05:10.820> think<00:05:11.720> i<00:05:11.810> read<00:05:11.960> it's<00:05:12.200> about<00:05:14.110> 100<00:05:15.110> pages<00:05:15.230> i

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
i think i read it's about 100 pages i

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.440 
i think i read it's about 100 pages i
think<00:05:16.220> so<00:05:16.910> a<00:05:18.160> really<00:05:19.160> good<00:05:19.370> well<00:05:20.150> put<00:05:20.300> together

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
think so a really good well put together

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:27.720 
think so a really good well put together
it<00:05:20.840> feels<00:05:20.960> like<00:05:21.290> not<00:05:21.890> real<00:05:22.100> cheap<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:24.130> okay

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.390 

and<00:05:28.730> here's<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:30.790> code<00:05:31.790> for<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.090> sound<00:05:33.190> sorry<00:05:34.190> my

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
and here's a code for the sound sorry my

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.130 
and here's a code for the sound sorry my
phone<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.820> being<00:05:35.240> loud<00:05:35.480> here's<00:05:35.720> a<00:05:35.780> code<00:05:35.960> for

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
phone is being loud here's a code for

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.360 
phone is being loud here's a code for
the<00:05:36.230> soundtrack<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.920> you<00:05:37.070> can<00:05:37.190> download

the soundtrack that you can download
which<00:05:37.730> is<00:05:37.850> always<00:05:38.000> cool<00:05:38.980> and<00:05:39.980> here's<00:05:40.790> the<00:05:40.970> big

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
which is always cool and here's the big

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.050 
which is always cool and here's the big
draw<00:05:41.980> here's<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.100> thing<00:05:43.400> that<00:05:43.610> i<00:05:43.640> think<00:05:43.730> most

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
draw here's the thing that i think most

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.520 
draw here's the thing that i think most
people<00:05:44.450> would<00:05:44.630> probably<00:05:46.990> they<00:05:47.990> pre-ordered

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
people would probably they pre-ordered

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.310 
people would probably they pre-ordered
it<00:05:48.650> probably<00:05:49.460> pre-ordered<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.150> for<00:05:50.420> this<00:05:50.660> this

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
it probably pre-ordered it for this this

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.920 
it probably pre-ordered it for this this
is<00:05:51.470> the<00:05:52.870> deaths<00:05:53.870> mask<00:05:54.290> as<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:55.010> can<00:05:55.130> see<00:05:55.930> it's
