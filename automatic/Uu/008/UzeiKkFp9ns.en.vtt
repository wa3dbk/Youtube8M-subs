00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 other beautiful dear friends sincerely 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.339
 Welcome to this video it's about 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.339
 photos under the Christmas tree 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.910
 yes that does not just sound romantic 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.130
 It is certainly also you are determined 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 also on christmas eve nice photos 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
 maybe under the christmas tree 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.430
 maybe with the family, too 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.710
 alone 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.779
 depending on how the relationship and me 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 tell you in this video how horny you are 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.340
 make pictures under Christmas tree 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 can make the mistake many people make 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.570
 if you have such a photo just now 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.790
 want to make is that they are the camera 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 most people are wrong when setting 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.489
 Now come tell me 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 I now make time sun visor here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.460
 no idea 49 or whatever the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.399
 not really matter 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.770
 100 shutter speed iso 100 lightning 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.969
 flashes the white balance and lightning 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.100
 that's just an ectl 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 blitz what is not bad what later 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.239
 In addition , the lightning is he anyway 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 in automatic mode it means communicates 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.270
 just like that with the camera everything 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 is set is at the lightning 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.960
 passed and he says so and so 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 the power has a lot to do in the end 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 are 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 I am now looking through focusing and 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.630
 machen.foto then I can see it rico 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.530
 the lightning is definitely on 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.020
 arrived to him 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.189
 but the christmas tree background of the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.689
 somehow does not look so good 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.250
 he looks kind of shitty somehow 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.320
 it looks a bit like that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.729
 sad, too, does not have any more 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.520
 this beautiful color mood is not anymore 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 Things to look right lit the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.930
 whole beautiful tinsel what's in there is yes 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.049
 that reflects and this beautiful 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.280
 Illumination is just gone why 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.689
 was flashed away he has to be like that 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.740
 imagine the lightning is in the end 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.270
 the fist and the skin just this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.829
 nice light mood away because they are stronger 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.570
 is more available 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.180
 In addition there is this room of the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.890
 All in all I know very bright white 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.810
 completely every wall is white here 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.579
 another oblique that is it is at 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 just like its huge reflector of 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.020
 all sides and throws the light, so to speak 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.790
 criss-crossing the room 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 what can you do about this now? 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.689
 to prevent whole in the end so 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.380
 just when you know what to look for 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.160
 got to 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:11.350
 this secret is coming now 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.940
 in the end, it is relatively easy for me 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.860
 just put the camera on 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.660
 a blind 10 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.150
 and now comes the trick on the whole 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.860
 thing i extend the closing time 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.540
 and as long as you actually 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 never expect that one 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.590
 a decent picture at all 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.330
 I 'm getting so close here 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.560
 two seconds two seconds I have 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.970
 chosen because if I'm here now 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.740
 just make light metering 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 and by watching then he sees 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.200
 Christmas tree at these two seconds 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.910
 very very good 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.380
 I would now, for example, in 800 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.650
 Shutter time I would only have this 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.030
 all small little lights in the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.920
 see end effect and nothing of the 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.239
 Ambient lighting that means I go 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.090
 Now it will take two seconds 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.070
 the picture overall very very beautiful 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.590
 warm also from the color temperature looks 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.760
 the straight and rico is dark though 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.350
 is not bad there you come 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.660
 lightning then to use 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.340
 ok now the same with the 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.340
 same settings again a picture 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.980
 Of course this takes two seconds to two 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.110
 for seconds now is the picture 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.640
 made and when rico moves in 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.350
 It may be that two seconds 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.510
 so a little bit of blur arises 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.489
 he is once sharply imaged by 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.340
 the lightning that is quasi son freeze 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.019
 from him he is once exposed up 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.730
 almost on the picture when he feels like it 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.000
 moves then that gives through this long 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.340
 Exposure again a bit yes him 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.840
 so to speak, sees the picture running through it 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.370
 Sun and manage that is you have to 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 keep really quiet for these two 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.790
 seconds and no faxing is done yet 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.790
 really quiet two seconds 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.580
 very good and if the picture times big 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.680
 look it looks schaaf and he is 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.150
 clearly visible 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.760
 and if we look at the picture again 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.720
 from before the background and look 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.370
 These lights are much better too 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.260
 recognize the light mood is a whole 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.150
 quite different yes you can see this beautiful 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.900
 yellowish this warm light mood it 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.220
 looks very cool 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.080
 now there are others in my trick 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.300
 am here on 24 millimeters with the 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.970
 objectively has the lightning here in the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.320
 editor mode recognized and here in front 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.360
 there's one for a wide angle 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.230
 in the flash I drive 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.030
 just go out now 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.620
 This, on the one hand, makes the light more 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.660
 scattered and on the other hand 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.070
 bit diffuse done because it's 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.350
 in the end an obstacle by that 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.060
 the court has to and that's what it does 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.560
 overall it's a bit weaker too 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.970
 means is scattered more and comes now 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.240
 not so much on the background 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:31.390
 on 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.470
 I'll take another picture and you 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.080
 looks especially at his face 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.450
 which is again far fritter soft 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.580
 looks overall through the room 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.740
 I like that pretty cool though 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.600
 Now I would say if one more 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.400
 few more people to be pure so first 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.870
 it is now the picture a bit me 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.140
 the whole time have the palm in it 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.300
 and then the pieces to the left 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:53.770
 rico of dios you off and now I go 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.940
 just yourself still in the picture league is 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.900
 a focal point so i give them 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.580
 sleep and me on the 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.660
 background that's important again yes 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.460
 not that your background 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.690
 all time focused now activate 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.430
 I self-timer the ten seconds 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.750
 now comes the best part of it all 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.250
 history now you can just yourself 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:10.900
 even with in the picture pure so me 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:13.950
 focus the point there he is now 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:19.140
 I just go to the same height 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.140
 here is the tree in between camera ppp 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.680
 they could keep still and the photo 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.360
 would have to be in the box in the end if 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.310
 you did not do anything stupid he did 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.460
 is in it and looks great I'll do it 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.290
 again comparative photo with us both 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.360
 with the other attitude I forward 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:43.800
 had dazzle 400 shutter everything 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.800
 is equal to the white balance it is the same 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.180
 silent we hold two seconds smile 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.000
 and as we see it is totally stupid 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.920
 in fact, that is actually quite the case 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.410
 Just to take a cool picture 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.360
 under Christmas tree tried out something 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.220
 otherwise important is that the 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.810
 a certain distance is to the tree because 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.240
 that, of course, as well as closer to one 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.320
 a tree is and the brighter also 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.330
 in the end the room is so with 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.980
 white walls, for example, the more 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.050
 the light is reflected to the sea 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.730
 Flash light also reaches the tree 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.440
 if you are outside, for example 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.940
 had no white walls around them 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.020
 also no white blanket could then 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.310
 For example, maybe in the 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.150
 closing time even a bit 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:30.500
 go shorter and it would anyway 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.660
 work and that would be the effect 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.970
 still the same and you would from 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.260
 the distance not so far away 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.450
 have to go 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.920
 tripod but now very important 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.960
 because we have two seconds closing time 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.820
 clearly one blurs another more positively 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.560
 side effect now of course tripod 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.540
 self-timer I do not have to do that myself 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.800
 make a picture but just on it 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.450
 push or do not have to go behind the 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.210
 camera can be press on it 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.700
 and then put me next to it and all 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.470
 are in the picture a great 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.900
 Christmas panorama with beautiful 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:00.890
 light mood into the sheet one milk me 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.980
 am really looking forward to it 

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:05.480
