 after we do we request the car 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.530

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.530
 I have a car, I'm not going to choose this 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.870
 the green is worth 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:04.150

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.550
 garage and taught the car 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.640
 I hope that the menu video of Esteve 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.110

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.280

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.280
 we remove it 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.440
 and so it is much better 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.430
 let's hope the message arrives 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.430

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.069
