00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.570 
so you can't just go to any random toy
store<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:34.979> get<00:05:35.160> it

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
store and get it

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.510 
store and get it
I<00:05:35.610> just<00:05:36.090> got<00:05:36.300> added<00:05:36.630> toys<00:05:37.009> but<00:05:38.009> it<00:05:38.220> could<00:05:38.400> be

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
I just got added toys but it could be

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.330 
I just got added toys but it could be
random<00:05:38.789> so<00:05:39.570> that's<00:05:40.530> about<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:41.009> for<00:05:41.220> the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
random so that's about it for the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.920 
random so that's about it for the
boating<00:05:41.789> school<00:05:42.539> if<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:43.470> have<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:43.949> set<00:05:44.690> but<00:05:45.690> I

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
boating school if you have it set but I

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.219 
boating school if you have it set but I
hope<00:05:46.259> you<00:05:46.410> have<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> all<00:05:47.039> the<00:05:47.340> correct<00:05:47.699> pieces

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
hope you have the all the correct pieces

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.499 
hope you have the all the correct pieces
mine<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.590> got<00:05:49.949> because<00:05:50.880> some<00:05:51.330> would<00:05:51.479> have

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
mine I got because some would have

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.050 
mine I got because some would have
pieces<00:05:52.259> were<00:05:52.590> maybe<00:05:53.039> they<00:05:53.220> were<00:05:53.280> used<00:05:53.729> or

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 
pieces were maybe they were used or

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.760 
pieces were maybe they were used or
something<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.660> they<00:05:54.780> put<00:05:55.020> the<00:05:55.139> wrong<00:05:55.320> pieces

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
something and they put the wrong pieces

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.950 
something and they put the wrong pieces
in<00:05:55.979> so<00:05:56.280> they<00:05:57.060> are<00:05:57.210> probably<00:05:57.419> put<00:05:57.690> in<00:05:57.780> the<00:05:57.840> wrong

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
in so they are probably put in the wrong

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.540 
in so they are probably put in the wrong
place<00:05:58.199> there's<00:05:58.470> all<00:05:58.680> right<00:05:58.919> okay<00:05:59.910> but<00:06:00.599> um
