00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.369 
because I knew because I have to do I
research<00:02:15.489> different<00:02:15.940> plants<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:16.690> can

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
research different plants that can

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.600 
research different plants that can
create<00:02:17.590> oxygen<00:02:17.770> okay

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
create oxygen okay

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.360 
create oxygen okay
so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.150> could<00:02:19.270> actually<00:02:19.420> live<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.410> here<00:02:20.800> with

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
oxygen from outside so in fact if I

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.380
