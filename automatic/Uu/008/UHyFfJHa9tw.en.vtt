00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160 
electric bikes that eco bike and this is
a<00:00:08.040> prebuilt<00:00:08.429> electric<00:00:08.940> bike<00:00:09.150> brand<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.050> we

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
a prebuilt electric bike brand that we

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.680 
a prebuilt electric bike brand that we
carry<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.800> one<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.759> I'm<00:00:11.940> pretty<00:00:12.150> happy<00:00:12.420> with

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
carry and one that I'm pretty happy with

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.379 
carry and one that I'm pretty happy with
so<00:00:12.990> let's<00:00:13.740> just<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.040> what<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.250> looks<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
so let's just see what it looks so this

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.720 
so let's just see what it looks so this
is<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> eco<00:00:15.929> bike<00:00:16.109> elegance<00:00:16.949> model<00:00:17.430> which<00:00:17.580> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
is the eco bike elegance model which is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
is the eco bike elegance model which is
their<00:00:17.940> step<00:00:18.240> through<00:00:18.449> model<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.109> they<00:00:20.039> have

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
their step through model and they have

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.529 
their step through model and they have
three<00:00:20.369> different<00:00:20.640> models<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.090> one<00:00:21.150> they

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
three different models this one they

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.929 
three different models this one they
have<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> folding<00:00:22.230> bike<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.460> also<00:00:23.609> have

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939

have a folding bike and they also have
one<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> more<00:00:25.439> traditional<00:00:25.580> triangle

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
one with a more traditional triangle

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.540 
one with a more traditional triangle
frame<00:00:27.800> one<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.980> things<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.369> nice

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
frame one of the things that's nice

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.120 
frame one of the things that's nice
about<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:30.449> design<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:30.990> bikes<00:00:31.349> is<00:00:31.619> as

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
about the design of these bikes is as

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.979 
about the design of these bikes is as
with<00:00:32.640> most<00:00:32.880> pre-built<00:00:33.450> electric<00:00:33.780> bikes

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
with most pre-built electric bikes

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.569 
with most pre-built electric bikes
there's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.380> nice<00:00:34.559> space<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.250> battery

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
there's a nice space for the battery

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.299 
there's a nice space for the battery
behind<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> seat<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.160> gives

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
behind the seat and that kind of gives

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.630 
behind the seat and that kind of gives
it<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> nice<00:00:38.640> clean<00:00:39.059> design<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> motor<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it a nice clean design the motor in this

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
it a nice clean design the motor in this
one<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> rear<00:00:42.300> motor<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.320> relatively

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
one is a rear motor it's a relatively

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.990 
one is a rear motor it's a relatively
small<00:00:44.399> motor<00:00:44.969> back<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:46.610> that's<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.850> right

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
small motor back here that's it right

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.310 
small motor back here that's it right
there<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.660> a<00:00:48.840> 350<00:00:49.770> watt<00:00:49.910> motor<00:00:51.320> but

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
there and it's a 350 watt motor but

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.430 
there and it's a 350 watt motor but
actually<00:00:52.940> reasonably<00:00:53.940> powerful<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.780> lot<00:00:55.289> of

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
actually reasonably powerful a lot of

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.490 
actually reasonably powerful a lot of
pre-built<00:00:55.770> electric<00:00:56.340> bikes<00:00:56.870> are<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.140> very

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
pre-built electric bikes are not very

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.680 
pre-built electric bikes are not very
high<00:00:58.800> powered<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.359> don't<00:01:00.449> do

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
high powered and so they really don't do

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
high powered and so they really don't do
all<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.840> well<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> hills<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.640> one<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
all that well on hills but this one I

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
all that well on hills but this one I
found<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.809> pretty<00:01:04.260> good<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.250> actually

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
found to be pretty good and it actually

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.600 
found to be pretty good and it actually
gives<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.960> boost<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.740> you're<00:01:07.950> going

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
gives you a good boost when you're going

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.539 
gives you a good boost when you're going
up<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> hill<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:10.170> of<00:01:10.200> their<00:01:10.409> biggest

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
up a hill and one of their biggest

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.160 
up a hill and one of their biggest
dealers<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.240> San<00:01:12.479> Francisco

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
dealers is actually in San Francisco

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.210 
dealers is actually in San Francisco
obviously<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> very<00:01:14.010> hilly<00:01:14.220> place<00:01:14.720> where<00:01:16.220> they

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
obviously a very hilly place where they

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.999 
obviously a very hilly place where they
found<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.850> be<00:01:17.880> pretty<00:01:18.479> popular<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:19.200> think<00:01:19.680> if

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
found it to be pretty popular I think if

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.399 
found it to be pretty popular I think if
I<00:01:20.100> lived<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.430> San<00:01:20.640> Francisco<00:01:20.700> an<00:01:21.659> electric

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
I lived in San Francisco an electric

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.749 
I lived in San Francisco an electric
bike<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.830> definitely<00:01:23.220> be<00:01:23.310> something<00:01:23.580> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
bike would definitely be something I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.679 
bike would definitely be something I
would<00:01:24.360> consider<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:26.040> comes<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
would consider it comes with with the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.319 
would consider it comes with with the
rack<00:01:27.900> everything<00:01:28.470> built-in<00:01:29.369> fenders<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
rack everything built-in fenders so it's

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.890 
rack everything built-in fenders so it's
already<00:01:30.689> set<00:01:30.960> up<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:32.000> commuting<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.360> riding

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
already set up for commuting or riding

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.240 
already set up for commuting or riding
around<00:01:34.079> town

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
around town

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
around town
kind<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.550> a<00:01:35.640> nice<00:01:35.820> town<00:01:36.120> bike<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.440> it's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
kind of a nice town bike and this it's

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.860 
kind of a nice town bike and this it's
got<00:01:37.830> a<00:01:37.860> pretty<00:01:38.100> upright<00:01:38.630> comfortable<00:01:39.630> riding

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
got a pretty upright comfortable riding

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.040 
got a pretty upright comfortable riding
feel<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.760> has<00:01:41.910> a<00:01:41.940> suspension<00:01:42.480> fork<00:01:42.900> on<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
feel it has a suspension fork on the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.370 
feel it has a suspension fork on the
front<00:01:43.580> so<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:45.000> lot<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.360> things<00:01:45.630> comfortable<00:01:46.020> see
