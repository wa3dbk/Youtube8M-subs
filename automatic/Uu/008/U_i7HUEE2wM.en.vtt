00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.300
 if you are new you can learn 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.660
 shoot 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.140
 somewhere well ok shoots together for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 three 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.090
 if you are not particularly so climb 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.920
 everybody there 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.849
 here's how to shoot yourself take 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.189
 take aim 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 and u so walk different sides 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 let's say this is the enemy 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.010
 here you will need to try to shorter 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:45.000
 shoot the center at the enemy like this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.629
 well, the enemy is also moving like us 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.180
 up to 100 times to get you days advise 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.699
 clamp two buttons right left 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.430
 don't shoot u just so let's say 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 gone half a year it started 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:06.180
 shoot you want to learn better 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.340
 shoot and there is such a bug 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:15.979
 called + c is shooting bursts with 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.979
 digla look 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:28.900
 you see yes how to shoot here take 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.660
 take aim shoot fast c take 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:38.130
 aim to shoot them heart 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:41.160
 aim and then where are you shooting 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.760
 once again when aiming shoot 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.760
 aim for these c 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.540
 to quickly learn 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.120
 I advise you to press the spacebar 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:02:00.850
 because it happens that you sit down 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:02.979
 there I do not know first press the spacebar and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:09.360
 then you will not have him c push 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:12.780
 see not appreciated i basically do like this 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.959
 I press a button to go here and ducks 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.360
 strip along the way 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.670
 Well, I think you understand how to shoot digle 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.800
 now let's go shotgun 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.760
 step can not also shoot like this 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.880
 as I have taught you and you can degli 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.980
 shoot aiming and pulse with digle 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.970
 plus size of the war is bad but somehow 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.650
 it's like that 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.650
 only there a little bit different 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.540
 Well, something like this 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.570
 so well kalashnikov automatic and 4 and 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.310
 shoots the same asshole we clamp and 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.660
 shoot better shoot 74 because 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.830
 it is more accurate how to shoot with 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.230
 sniper rifle I think everything is recognized 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.800
 But that's a sniper rifle I think 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:14.040
 not very important well, in general, all 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.140
 I taught you and so subscribe to my 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.580
 channel put likes thanks for your 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.580
