00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.960
 good after opening the box 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.740
 here we are just the one I'm going to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740
 continue with the unboxing 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.550
 you do not shut up 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.090
 hello everyone I'm next good frame and you 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.580
 I bring the unboxing of the jaime of fx 8.350 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.680
 ok is an 8-core processor that 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.120
 It has 4 gigahertz in each core 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.360
 OK 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.760
 well you can see that the box is fine 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.890
 presented there we have the processor and 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.079
 well I will explain some 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.030
 features of this processor 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.499
 is unlocked already or can you 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.499
 make the overclock that you want 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.829
 and I think it's the first processor 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.620
 of 8 emery cores 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.059
 as there is no budget for scissors 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.250
 but for processors and we're going to 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.630
 cut it with your nails 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 shit after the box is opened 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 we have to the left just in this 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.420
 part 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.420
 the processor 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.190
 It weighs pretty and comes with a sticker 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.720
 from mdf x 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.880
 and then we meet 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.000
 what seems to be a manual of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 instructions 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.820
 and finally a heatsink 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 is a dissipator that the truth is of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.620
 copper and I have not heard good opinions 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.650
 about him rather bad but good to 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.540
 simple view does not seem to be a 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.970
 processor of these they would like or be a 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.040
 dissipator that is so bad but of all 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.470
 and they say it will be for something and everyone 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.390
 I have another way and I hope that you 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.720
 I liked this unboxing soon I will upload 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.070
 more unboxing of 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.070
 to my motherboard and good bye
