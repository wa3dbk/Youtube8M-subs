you<00:00:09.270> know<00:00:09.360> one<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> things<00:00:09.660> we're<00:00:09.900> seeing

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:10.140 
you know one of the things we're seeing

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.440 
you know one of the things we're seeing
it<00:00:10.290> has<00:00:10.680> technology<00:00:11.639> changes<00:00:12.120> we<00:00:12.210> see<00:00:12.360> how

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it has technology changes we see how

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.840 
it has technology changes we see how
people<00:00:12.510> use<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> technology<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:14.040> it

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
people use this technology and it

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.550 
people use this technology and it
sometimes<00:00:15.180> sets<00:00:15.660> up<00:00:15.780> vulnerabilities<00:00:16.410> we

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
sometimes sets up vulnerabilities we

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.650 
sometimes sets up vulnerabilities we
didn't<00:00:16.800> expect<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:18.000> more<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.360> more<00:00:18.480> people

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
didn't expect as more and more people

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.260 
didn't expect as more and more people
use<00:00:19.380> their<00:00:19.650> smartphones<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.640> streaming

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
use their smartphones as streaming

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.960 
use their smartphones as streaming
devices<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.960> get<00:00:22.140> news<00:00:22.439> get<00:00:23.009> radio<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.700> a<00:00:23.730> lot

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
devices to get news get radio get a lot

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.229 
devices to get news get radio get a lot
of<00:00:24.029> things<00:00:24.180> like<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.509> over<00:00:25.169> their<00:00:25.439> networks

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
of things like that over their networks

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.850 
of things like that over their networks
I<00:00:27.239> don't<00:00:27.930> think<00:00:28.079> people<00:00:28.169> realize<00:00:28.500> how

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
I don't think people realize how

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.139 
I don't think people realize how
vulnerable<00:00:29.070> they<00:00:29.430> get<00:00:29.610> so<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:29.939> saw<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:30.149 
vulnerable they get so we saw a

00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:33.139 
vulnerable they get so we saw a
situation<00:00:30.390> back<00:00:31.550> here<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.640> DC<00:00:32.790> where<00:00:33.060> there

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
situation back here in DC where there

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.020 
situation back here in DC where there
was<00:00:33.239> an<00:00:33.300> earthquake<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.690> Virginia<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:35.030> there

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
was an earthquake in Virginia and there

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.790 
was an earthquake in Virginia and there
was<00:00:36.149> no<00:00:36.329> real<00:00:36.600> damage<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.350> cell<00:00:37.590> system

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
was no real damage to the cell system

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.790 
was no real damage to the cell system
but<00:00:38.550> there<00:00:38.700> was<00:00:38.820> such<00:00:39.030> high<00:00:39.329> data<00:00:40.050> demand<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
but there was such high data demand and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
but there was such high data demand and
demand<00:00:41.460> for<00:00:41.730> getting<00:00:42.000> through<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.269> system

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
demand for getting through the system

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.049 
demand for getting through the system
crashing<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> couldn't<00:00:43.710> dial<00:00:43.920> out<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.940> of

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
crashing you couldn't dial out so all of

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
crashing you couldn't dial out so all of
a<00:00:45.120> sudden<00:00:45.449> your<00:00:45.600> smartphone<00:00:46.109> became<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> brick

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
a sudden your smartphone became a brick

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.840 
a sudden your smartphone became a brick
you<00:00:47.190> didn't<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.269> anything<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.489> we<00:00:50.489> saw<00:00:50.699> this

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you didn't have anything and we saw this

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
you didn't have anything and we saw this
again<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.210> Sandy<00:00:51.660> as<00:00:51.809> people<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.589> migrated

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
again with Sandy as people have migrated

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.259 
again with Sandy as people have migrated
to<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.399> using<00:00:53.699> one<00:00:54.300> device<00:00:55.550> when<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> cell

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
to this using one device when the cell

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.819 
to this using one device when the cell
systems<00:00:57.629> went<00:00:57.809> down<00:00:58.019> or<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> data<00:00:58.679> was

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
systems went down or the data was

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.020 
systems went down or the data was
overloaded<00:00:59.160> they<00:00:59.489> couldn't<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.850> information

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
overloaded they couldn't get information

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.329 
overloaded they couldn't get information
so<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> get<00:01:01.559> things<00:01:01.769> where<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.219> can

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
so when you get things where you can

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.009 
so when you get things where you can
start<00:01:02.519> combining<00:01:02.699> functions<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:03.690> putting

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
start combining functions like putting

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.870 
start combining functions like putting
FM<00:01:04.290> chips<00:01:04.589> into<00:01:04.800> cell<00:01:05.280> phones<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> start

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
FM chips into cell phones and you start

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.940 
FM chips into cell phones and you start
getting<00:01:06.030> radio<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:07.110> even<00:01:07.440> if<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.770> cell

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
getting radio so even if the cell

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500 
getting radio so even if the cell
systems<00:01:08.370> are<00:01:08.460> overloaded<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.120> still<00:01:09.330> get

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
systems are overloaded you can still get

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
systems are overloaded you can still get
that<00:01:09.780> information<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> moves<00:01:10.980> it's

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that information and it moves it's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
that information and it moves it's
beyond<00:01:11.580> your<00:01:11.730> streaming<00:01:12.090> but<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.899> think<00:01:13.110> people

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
beyond your streaming but I think people

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.289 
beyond your streaming but I think people
need<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.590> take<00:01:13.829> a<00:01:13.860> step<00:01:14.159> back<00:01:14.430> there's<00:01:15.149> this

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
need to take a step back there's this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.760 
need to take a step back there's this
tendency<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.840> think<00:01:16.049> that<00:01:16.200> things<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:16.619> work

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
tendency to think that things that work

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.590 
tendency to think that things that work
in<00:01:17.009> our<00:01:17.130> everyday<00:01:17.430> lives<00:01:17.790> are<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.509> work

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
in our everyday lives are going to work

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.950 
in our everyday lives are going to work
the<00:01:18.750> same<00:01:18.930> way<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.290> disaster<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.930> lot<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the same way in a disaster and a lot of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.840 
the same way in a disaster and a lot of
our<00:01:22.170> tendency<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.710> use<00:01:22.860> streaming<00:01:23.310> devices<00:01:23.579> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
our tendency to use streaming devices to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.510 
our tendency to use streaming devices to
be<00:01:23.880> dependent<00:01:24.360> upon<00:01:24.420> broadband<00:01:25.520> capabilities

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
be dependent upon broadband capabilities

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.899 
be dependent upon broadband capabilities
are<00:01:27.049> vulnerable<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.320> disaster<00:01:28.920> we<00:01:29.850> either

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
are vulnerable in a disaster we either

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.260 
are vulnerable in a disaster we either
through<00:01:30.210> congestion<00:01:30.899> or<00:01:31.049> outages<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> again

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
through congestion or outages so again

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.810 
through congestion or outages so again
we<00:01:33.479> still<00:01:33.750> recommend<00:01:34.110> every<00:01:34.979> kit<00:01:35.219> have<00:01:35.520> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
we still recommend every kit have a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.880 
we still recommend every kit have a
portable<00:01:36.479> radio<00:01:36.630> with<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
portable radio with some sort of

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980 
portable radio with some sort of
emergency<00:01:38.130> power<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.700> battery<00:01:39.240> solar<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.689> hand

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
emergency power was battery solar a hand

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.260 
emergency power was battery solar a hand
cranked<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:41.039> so<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.399> start<00:01:41.969> seeing<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
cranked and so you start seeing the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
cranked and so you start seeing the
technology<00:01:42.750> moving<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.409> smartphone's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
technology moving in the smartphone's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
technology moving in the smartphone's
where<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.340> radio<00:01:44.640> chips<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.180> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
where you have radio chips in there this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
where you have radio chips in there this
would<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.229> again<00:01:46.560> another<00:01:46.829> way<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.460> ensure

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
would be again another way to ensure

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.450 
would be again another way to ensure
that<00:01:47.909> when<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.509> else<00:01:48.689> fails<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.979> can<00:01:50.130> still

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
that when all else fails you can still

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.029 
that when all else fails you can still
get<00:01:50.759> from<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> broadcaster's<00:01:52.200> information

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
get from the broadcaster's information

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.170 
get from the broadcaster's information
because<00:01:53.280> government's<00:01:53.670> going<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> turn<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
because government's going to turn to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.429
