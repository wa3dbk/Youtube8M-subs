behind the waterfall swing well it was a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.570 
behind the waterfall swing well it was a
concept<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:24.779> were<00:00:24.900> trying<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> come<00:00:25.650> up<00:00:25.680> with<00:00:25.949> a

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
concept we were trying to come up with a

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
concept we were trying to come up with a
project<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.689> could<00:00:27.869> take<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.380> do<00:00:28.740> some

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
project that we could take and do some

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
project that we could take and do some
tours<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.699> summer<00:00:29.880> festivals<00:00:30.390> with<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.960> we

tours and summer festivals with and we

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.740 
tours and summer festivals with and we
were<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:32.219> excited<00:00:32.369> about<00:00:32.790> water<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
were really excited about water and that

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.290 
were really excited about water and that
kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:33.989> came<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.530> know<00:00:35.399> me<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.730> Ian<00:00:35.850> kind

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
kind of came in to know me and Ian kind

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.549 
kind of came in to know me and Ian kind
of<00:00:36.390> ran<00:00:36.570> through<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.530> of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
of ran through this way to kind of

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
of ran through this way to kind of
digitally<00:00:38.070> print<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.730> do<00:00:38.790> different

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
digitally print it and do different

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.000 
digitally print it and do different
things<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:39.690> Ian<00:00:39.809> had<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.140> drew<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:40.860> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
things and then Ian had the drew at this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.490 
things and then Ian had the drew at this
spark<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.579> us<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:42.480> put<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> swing<00:00:42.960> through<00:00:43.170> it's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
spark to us to put a swing through it's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.080 
spark to us to put a swing through it's
really<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> feat<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.340> engineering<00:00:44.879> because

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
really a feat of engineering because

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
really a feat of engineering because
while<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.420> may<00:00:45.570> get<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> sprinkle<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.379> two<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
while we may get a sprinkle or two the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.100 
while we may get a sprinkle or two the
idea<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.820> sopping<00:00:48.570> wet

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
idea is not to get sopping wet

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.380 
idea is not to get sopping wet
how<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:49.890> trial<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> error<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:51.270> when

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
how much trial and error there when

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.569 
how much trial and error there when
you're<00:00:51.510> putting<00:00:51.690> this<00:00:51.840> together<00:00:52.250> took<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.399> fair

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you're putting this together took a fair

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.930 
you're putting this together took a fair
amount

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
amount

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.619 
amount
I<00:00:54.000> took<00:00:54.750> Whitney<00:00:55.020> rides<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.440> wing<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.800> got

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
I took Whitney rides this wing I got

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
I took Whitney rides this wing I got
just<00:00:58.110> getting<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.379> timing<00:00:58.649> right<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.219> what's

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
just getting that timing right is what's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.189 
just getting that timing right is what's
the<00:01:00.000> tricky<00:01:00.180> thing<00:01:00.420> these<00:01:00.840> guys<00:01:01.020> are<00:01:01.170> very

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

don't worry I think we should get up

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
don't worry I think we should get up
something<00:01:04.470> ready<00:01:04.650> which<00:01:05.369> side<00:01:05.610> do<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.820> get
