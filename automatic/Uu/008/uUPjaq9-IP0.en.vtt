00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
just looks more stylish stylish than the

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.710 
just looks more stylish stylish than the
gyro<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.340> said<00:02:15.520> before<00:02:15.930> um<00:02:18.630> my<00:02:19.630> stem<00:02:20.320> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
gyro like I said before um my stem is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.710 
gyro like I said before um my stem is
Eastern<00:02:22.720> stock<00:02:23.080> stem<00:02:23.830> comes<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> mothra<00:02:25.480> I

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
Eastern stock stem comes on the mothra I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.050 
Eastern stock stem comes on the mothra I
think<00:02:26.170> it<00:02:26.230> might<00:02:26.410> be<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.710> choker<00:02:26.980> stem<00:02:27.460> but

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
think it might be the choker stem but

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.670 
think it might be the choker stem but
I'm<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:30.250> a<00:02:30.280> hundred<00:02:30.550> percent<00:02:30.700> sure<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.680> don't

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680
