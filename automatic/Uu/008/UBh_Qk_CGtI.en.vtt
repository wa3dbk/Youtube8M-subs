00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
v1 version I'm going to use just around

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.810 
v1 version I'm going to use just around
the<00:00:19.670> track<00:00:19.940> just<00:00:20.480> to<00:00:20.600> measure<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.960> volts<00:00:21.820> and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
the track just to measure the volts and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.910 
the track just to measure the volts and
the<00:00:23.090> v2<00:00:23.540> version<00:00:23.780> I'm<00:00:24.140> going<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:24.380> connect<00:00:24.710> up

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
the v2 version I'm going to connect up

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.049 
the v2 version I'm going to connect up
to<00:00:24.950> my<00:00:25.420> in<00:00:26.420> C<00:00:27.260> a<00:00:27.910> pro<00:00:30.190> so<00:00:31.190> I<00:00:31.220> can<00:00:31.490> tell<00:00:31.730> how<00:00:31.880> many

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
to my in C a pro so I can tell how many

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.680 
to my in C a pro so I can tell how many
amps<00:00:32.270> I'm<00:00:32.629> drawing<00:00:33.079> on<00:00:33.200> the<00:00:33.320> whole<00:00:33.500> layout

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
amps I'm drawing on the whole layout

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.299 
amps I'm drawing on the whole layout
which<00:00:35.690> will<00:00:35.899> go<00:00:36.079> all<00:00:36.289> through<00:00:36.680> me<00:00:36.860> circuit

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
which will go all through me circuit

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:52.529 
which will go all through me circuit
breakers<00:00:38.980> which<00:00:44.079> are<00:00:45.079> all<00:00:45.290> in

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:01:00.479 

so<00:00:53.199> I'll<00:00:53.500> show<00:00:53.739> you<00:00:53.769> how<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.899> work<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.219> he's

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
so I'll show you how they work so he's

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.870 
so I'll show you how they work so he's
out<00:01:00.699> all<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:01.180> instructions<00:01:05.640> trying<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.700> sleep

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
out all the instructions trying to sleep

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:24.760 
out all the instructions trying to sleep
might<00:01:07.330> be<00:01:07.450> out<00:01:07.540> of<00:01:07.570> raid

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.709 

this<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.240> v1<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:29.000> I<00:01:30.000> put<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> track

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
this is the v1 and I put it on the track

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:40.789 
this is the v1 and I put it on the track
and<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.020> show<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.409> how<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.340> works<00:01:39.799> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and just show you how it all works you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:48.649 
and just show you how it all works you
see<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.250> says<00:01:41.600> 14.2

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.870 

and<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.140> nine<00:01:49.380> point<00:01:49.680> two<00:01:49.799> point<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> I

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
and for nine point two point one so I

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.410 
and for nine point two point one so I
can<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.299> around<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.810> whole<00:01:54.960> track<00:01:57.200> with<00:01:58.200> this

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
can go around the whole track with this

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:09.580 
can go around the whole track with this
to<00:02:00.420> say<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:00.930> any<00:02:01.110> voltage<00:02:01.320> loss

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:18.970 

at<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.709> veto<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.850> say<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.450> got<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.600> case

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.090 

which<00:02:19.980> I'm<00:02:20.160> gonna<00:02:20.340> have<00:02:20.580> it<00:02:20.810> displayed<00:02:22.100> all

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
which I'm gonna have it displayed all

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.550 
which I'm gonna have it displayed all
the<00:02:23.340> time<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.569> tell<00:02:24.810> them<00:02:24.989> how<00:02:25.200> many

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the time so I can tell them how many

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.990 
the time so I can tell them how many
volts<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.069> how<00:02:26.190> many<00:02:26.430> eggs<00:02:27.980> I'm<00:02:28.980> drawing<00:02:29.520> for

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
volts and how many eggs I'm drawing for

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.540 
volts and how many eggs I'm drawing for
the<00:02:30.090> whole<00:02:30.209> way<00:02:30.390> up<00:02:31.040> but<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.130> gonna<00:02:32.220> show<00:02:32.489> you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
and then the right side will go to where

00:04:21.040 --> 00:05:01.160 
and then the right side will go to where
me<00:04:21.190> sir<00:04:21.600> Braca<00:04:22.600> start

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.010 

and<00:05:02.170> as<00:05:02.320> you<00:05:02.470> can<00:05:02.650> see<00:05:02.890> on<00:05:03.790> our<00:05:04.240> at<00:05:04.480> fourteen

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
and as you can see on our at fourteen

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.200 
and as you can see on our at fourteen
point<00:05:05.350> two<00:05:05.440> volts<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:07.500> point<00:05:08.500> four<00:05:08.980> four<00:05:09.430> amps

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
point two volts and point four four amps

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.110 
point two volts and point four four amps
and<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.450> reason<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.750> got<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:12.460> many<00:05:12.730> amps

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
and the reason I got that many amps

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.080 
and the reason I got that many amps
there<00:05:13.390> without<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.990> train<00:05:14.380> or<00:05:14.620> like<00:05:14.860> go<00:05:15.040> on<00:05:15.250> is

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
there without a train or like go on is

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.000 
there without a train or like go on is
because<00:05:16.450> all<00:05:16.570> my<00:05:16.780> circuit<00:05:17.230> breakers<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:17.710> the

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
because all my circuit breakers and the

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.310 
because all my circuit breakers and the
audio<00:05:18.340> reverses<00:05:18.970> that<00:05:19.540> drawing<00:05:19.990> that<00:05:20.080> much

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
audio reverses that drawing that much

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:31.260 
audio reverses that drawing that much
car<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:29.710> now<00:05:29.890> guys<00:05:30.100> now<00:05:30.430> put<00:05:30.640> a<00:05:30.670> like<00:05:30.910> out<00:05:31.150> on

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
car so now guys now put a like out on

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.810
