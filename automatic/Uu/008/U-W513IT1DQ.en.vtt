let's<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.670> at<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:05.910> p2<00:00:06.359> bomb<00:00:06.629> site<00:00:06.980> starting

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
let's look at the p2 bomb site starting

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.500 
let's look at the p2 bomb site starting
with<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.160> highlights<00:00:08.550> on<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.760> top<00:00:08.970> left<00:00:09.269> with

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.910 
with the highlights on the top left with
the<00:00:09.719> aircraft<00:00:10.110> gauges<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.710> give<00:00:10.830> us

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
the aircraft gauges that give us

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.440 
the aircraft gauges that give us
important<00:00:11.340> information<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.910> our<00:00:12.179> heading

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
important information like our heading

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.810 
important information like our heading
altitude<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.290> airspeed<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:14.400> are<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.120 
altitude and airspeed these are the
input<00:00:15.120> controls<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.350> where<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.770> input

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
input controls this is where we input

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.830 
input controls this is where we input
the<00:00:17.250> calculated<00:00:17.789> wind<00:00:18.029> drift<00:00:18.240> angle<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the calculated wind drift angle and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.359 
the calculated wind drift angle and
information<00:00:19.350> from<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.619> aircraft<00:00:19.949> gauges

information from the aircraft gauges

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.570 
information from the aircraft gauges
these<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.720> viewing<00:00:22.050> controls<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:23.430> are

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
these are the viewing controls you are

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580 
these are the viewing controls you are
either<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.000> bombing<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.570> viewing<00:00:24.810> mode<00:00:25.140> but

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
either in a bombing or viewing mode but

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
either in a bombing or viewing mode but
only<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.949> viewing<00:00:26.189> mode<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.730> use<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.119> knob<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
only in viewing mode can use the knob to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.689 
only in viewing mode can use the knob to
change<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.869> perspective<00:00:28.250> here's<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.460> site

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
change the perspective here's the site

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.700 
change the perspective here's the site
with<00:00:29.910> its<00:00:30.060> crosshair<00:00:30.570> acceleration<00:00:31.439> bubble

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
with its crosshair acceleration bubble

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
with its crosshair acceleration bubble
and<00:00:31.859> weather<00:00:32.250> report<00:00:32.610> button<00:00:33.200> ideally<00:00:34.200> you

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
and weather report button ideally you

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
and weather report button ideally you
shouldn't<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.739> accelerating<00:00:35.399> when<00:00:35.489> bombing

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
shouldn't be accelerating when bombing

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
shouldn't be accelerating when bombing
so<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.570> best<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> keep<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> center<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
so it's best to keep it in the center of

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.979 
so it's best to keep it in the center of
the<00:00:37.950> bomb<00:00:38.129> site<00:00:38.570> lastly<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the bomb site lastly we have the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.530 
the bomb site lastly we have the
aircraft<00:00:40.350> controls<00:00:40.739> here<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.030> steer<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
aircraft controls here we can steer the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.420 
aircraft controls here we can steer the
aircraft<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:43.290> well<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.620> managing<00:00:44.070> our<00:00:44.219> bombs

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
aircraft as well as managing our bombs

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.170 
aircraft as well as managing our bombs
and<00:00:44.730> bomb<00:00:44.940> bay<00:00:45.120> doors<00:00:46.579> what<00:00:47.579> determines

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and bomb bay doors what determines

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.790 
and bomb bay doors what determines
whether<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.660> bombing<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.170> accurate<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.710> not

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
whether your bombing is accurate or not

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.650 
whether your bombing is accurate or not
is<00:00:50.100> how<00:00:50.340> you<00:00:50.399> calculate<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.030> wind<00:00:51.360> drift

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
is how you calculate the wind drift

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.709 
is how you calculate the wind drift
angle<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.969> take<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.360> heading

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
angle to do this you take your heading

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
angle to do this you take your heading
and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> winds<00:00:55.170> heading<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.620> then<00:00:55.920> find<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and the winds heading and then find the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
and the winds heading and then find the
shortest<00:00:56.699> difference<00:00:57.059> between<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.570> two<00:00:57.780> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
shortest difference between the two so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.529 
shortest difference between the two so
in<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:58.890> example<00:00:59.100> we're<00:01:00.030> heading<00:01:00.270> three

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
in this example we're heading three

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.299 
in this example we're heading three
three<00:01:00.780> zero<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> wind<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.829> blowing<00:01:01.859> from

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
three zero and the wind is blowing from

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.670 
three zero and the wind is blowing from
zero<00:01:02.520> nine<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.910> zero<00:01:03.140> this<00:01:04.140> means<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
zero nine to zero this means that the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.270 
zero nine to zero this means that the
correction<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.220> 120<00:01:05.939> degrees<00:01:06.270> right<00:01:07.280> note

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
correction is 120 degrees right note

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
correction is 120 degrees right note
that<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.760> calculate<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.330> difference<00:01:09.780> as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that if you calculate your difference as

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
that if you calculate your difference as
being<00:01:10.229> greater<00:01:10.500> than<00:01:10.619> 180<00:01:11.340> degrees<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:12.150> means

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
being greater than 180 degrees it means

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.480 
being greater than 180 degrees it means
you<00:01:12.570> went<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.900> wrong<00:01:13.020> way

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.819 

level<00:01:16.490> bombing<00:01:16.820> needs<00:01:17.090> good<00:01:17.360> preparation<00:01:17.829> so

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
level bombing needs good preparation so

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.069 
level bombing needs good preparation so
before<00:01:19.219> you<00:01:19.310> take<00:01:19.520> off<00:01:19.729> plan<00:01:20.539> the<00:01:20.719> route<00:01:20.899> you

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
before you take off plan the route you

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.380 
before you take off plan the route you
will<00:01:21.229> take<00:01:21.439> to<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:21.740> target<00:01:22.180> no<00:01:23.180> you're

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
will take to the target no you're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.419 
will take to the target no you're
expected<00:01:23.960> final<00:01:24.289> heading<00:01:24.500> airspeed<00:01:25.280> and

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
expected final heading airspeed and

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:27.880 
expected final heading airspeed and
altitude<00:01:25.899> make<00:01:26.899> sure<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:27.320> check<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.710> weather

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
altitude make sure you check the weather

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.620 
altitude make sure you check the weather
report<00:01:28.340> for<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.670> expected<00:01:29.090> wind<00:01:29.329> at<00:01:29.509> your

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
report for the expected wind at your

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.690 
report for the expected wind at your
altitude<00:01:29.929> and<00:01:30.320> then<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.100> input<00:01:31.490> those

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
altitude and then you input those

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.390 
altitude and then you input those
approximate<00:01:32.270> values<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.810> save<00:01:33.020> time

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.910 

now<00:01:36.390> we'll<00:01:36.570> go<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.870> game<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.440> see<00:01:37.620> this<00:01:37.770> in

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
now we'll go on game to see this in

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.310 
now we'll go on game to see this in
motion

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.570 

twisting<00:01:47.320> perspective<00:01:47.890> I'm<00:01:48.130> going<00:01:48.430> to<00:01:48.490> be

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
twisting perspective I'm going to be

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.250 
twisting perspective I'm going to be
making<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:49.030> bombing<00:01:49.240> run<00:01:49.510> against<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:50.020> bridge

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
making a bombing run against a bridge

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.590 
making a bombing run against a bridge
going<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.190> come<00:01:51.370> up<00:01:51.580> along<00:01:51.850> this<00:01:52.000> river<00:01:52.240> from

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
going to come up along this river from

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.930 
going to come up along this river from
the<00:01:52.720> South<00:01:53.130> using<00:01:54.130> these<00:01:54.250> two<00:01:54.490> airfields<00:01:54.850> as

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
the South using these two airfields as

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.200 
the South using these two airfields as
landmarks<00:01:55.510> and<00:01:56.460> then<00:01:57.460> we<00:01:57.580> can<00:01:57.700> see<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.970> bridge

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
landmarks and then we can see the bridge

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.450 
landmarks and then we can see the bridge
there<00:01:58.450> just<00:01:58.810> south<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.470> large<00:01:59.740> city<00:02:02.460> now

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
there just south of that large city now

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.800 
there just south of that large city now

the knot this enables us to look ahead
at<00:02:24.489> where<00:02:24.670> we're<00:02:24.790> going<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.630> we<00:02:25.780> can

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
at where we're going and that way we can

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.640 
at where we're going and that way we can
adjust<00:02:25.989> our<00:02:26.290> course<00:02:27.330> by<00:02:28.330> doing<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:28.870> I've<00:02:29.110> seen

the<00:02:29.739> first<00:02:29.950> city<00:02:30.310> on<00:02:30.489> my<00:02:30.640> map<00:02:30.880> which<00:02:31.090> I<00:02:31.209> was

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
the first city on my map which I was

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.660 
the first city on my map which I was
using<00:02:31.510> as<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> landmark<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:33.370> want<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.580> bring

using as a landmark and I want to bring

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.280 
using as a landmark and I want to bring
myself<00:02:33.850> to<00:02:34.209> the<00:02:34.270> left<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.600> bit<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.959> keep<00:02:35.140> myself

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
myself to the left a bit to keep myself

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.260 
myself to the left a bit to keep myself
on<00:02:35.650> track

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.910 

now<00:02:38.780> I'm<00:02:38.930> heading<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:39.320> roughly<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.770> right

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
now I'm heading in roughly the right

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.580 
now I'm heading in roughly the right
direction<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:41.360> improve<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:42.020> airspeed<00:02:42.470> and

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
direction I can improve my airspeed and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.690 
direction I can improve my airspeed and
altitude<00:02:42.680> save<00:02:43.430> time<00:02:44.770> my<00:02:45.770> altitude<00:02:46.070> is<00:02:46.460> three

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.640 

and<00:03:15.000> we<00:03:15.180> want<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.420> take<00:03:15.630> a<00:03:15.660> note<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.260> we're

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and we want to take a note of we're

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.160 
and we want to take a note of we're
heading<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.070> wind<00:03:17.280> is<00:03:17.400> blowing<00:03:17.580> from<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.900> we

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
heading the wind is blowing from and we

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.510 
heading the wind is blowing from and we
can<00:03:19.320> see<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:19.650> blown<00:03:19.950> from<00:03:20.160> 276<00:03:22.190> now<00:03:23.190> as<00:03:23.340> you

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
can see it's blown from 276 now as you

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.700 
can see it's blown from 276 now as you
can<00:03:23.640> see<00:03:23.700> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.210> bomb<00:03:24.360> site<00:03:24.690> we're<00:03:25.350> coming<00:03:25.620> up

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
can see in the bomb site we're coming up

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.480 
can see in the bomb site we're coming up
on<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> first<00:03:26.130> landmark<00:03:26.550> city<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.490> further

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
on the first landmark city and further

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.910 
on the first landmark city and further
north<00:03:29.820> we<00:03:30.060> have<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.240> airfields<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.770> that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
north we have the airfields so that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.530 
north we have the airfields so that
means<00:03:32.100> even<00:03:32.250> further<00:03:32.550> north<00:03:32.790> was<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.270> bridge

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
means even further north was the bridge

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:40.350 
means even further north was the bridge
and<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.080> other<00:03:34.230> landmarks<00:03:34.890> er<00:03:35.130> music

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.290 

now<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:41.080> back<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.500> wind<00:03:41.680> correction

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
now going back to the wind correction

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.770 
now going back to the wind correction
the<00:03:43.300> winds<00:03:43.600> heading<00:03:43.870> was<00:03:44.020> 276<00:03:45.210> our<00:03:46.210> heading<00:03:46.630> is

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
the winds heading was 276 our heading is

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.520 
the winds heading was 276 our heading is
0<00:03:47.170> 1<00:03:47.500> 5<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.060> this<00:03:49.150> means<00:03:49.450> our<00:03:49.690> calculation<00:03:50.410> is

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
0 1 5 so this means our calculation is

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.580 
0 1 5 so this means our calculation is
going<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.800> be<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:50.920> hundred<00:03:51.160> degrees<00:03:51.430> left<00:03:52.590> this

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
going to be a hundred degrees left this

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.770 
going to be a hundred degrees left this
isn't<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.980> final<00:03:54.160> calculation<00:03:54.880> though<00:03:55.030> is<00:03:55.540> we

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
isn't a final calculation though is we

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.300 
isn't a final calculation though is we
need<00:03:55.960> to<00:03:56.080> see<00:03:56.260> how<00:03:56.470> much<00:03:56.590> offset<00:03:57.040> we<00:03:57.130> need

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
need to see how much offset we need

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.070 
need to see how much offset we need
within<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.760> bomb<00:03:57.910> site<00:03:58.180> itself<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.810> put<00:03:58.960> the

within the bomb site itself to put the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.690 
within the bomb site itself to put the
crosshair<00:03:59.500> on<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.710> target<00:04:02.130> so<00:04:03.130> switching

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
crosshair on the target so switching

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.900 
crosshair on the target so switching
back<00:04:03.850> and<00:04:04.030> forth<00:04:04.210> between<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.870> two<00:04:05.050> modes<00:04:05.260> I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
back and forth between the two modes I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.480 
back and forth between the two modes I
can<00:04:06.910> see<00:04:07.090> there<00:04:07.300> in<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.690> aiming<00:04:08.080> mode<00:04:08.490> are

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:09.490 
can see there in the aiming mode are

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.300 
can see there in the aiming mode are
more<00:04:09.760> or<00:04:09.820> less<00:04:09.880> offset<00:04:10.150> to<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.570> right<00:04:11.190> so<00:04:12.190> this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
more or less offset to the right so this

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.310 
more or less offset to the right so this
means<00:04:12.640> when<00:04:13.060> I'm<00:04:13.180> in<00:04:13.300> the<00:04:13.420> viewing<00:04:13.660> mode<00:04:13.780> I

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
means when I'm in the viewing mode I

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.530 
means when I'm in the viewing mode I
need<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.100> actually<00:04:15.280> be<00:04:15.580> further<00:04:15.880> left<00:04:16.209> than<00:04:16.359> I

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
need to actually be further left than I

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.560 
need to actually be further left than I
would<00:04:16.720> expect<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.109> be<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:18.940> I<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.330> course

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
would expect to be so I go to the course

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.310 
would expect to be so I go to the course
correction<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.260> bring<00:04:21.100> myself<00:04:21.280> to<00:04:21.640> the<00:04:21.730> left

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
correction I bring myself to the left

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.930 
correction I bring myself to the left
and<00:04:23.320> this<00:04:23.410> will<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.710> turn<00:04:23.740> align<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.550> bomb<00:04:24.700> so

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
and this will in turn align the bomb so

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.670 
and this will in turn align the bomb so
across<00:04:25.120> here<00:04:25.420> with<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.660> target<00:04:26.080> even<00:04:26.590> though

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
across here with the target even though

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.430 
across here with the target even though
I<00:04:26.710> haven't<00:04:26.950> switched<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.460> year<00:04:28.140> that<00:04:29.140> minor

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
I haven't switched to a year that minor

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.110 
I haven't switched to a year that minor
heading<00:04:29.830> change<00:04:30.100> has<00:04:30.400> now<00:04:30.610> changed<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
heading change has now changed the

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.900 
heading change has now changed the
calculations<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.900> wind<00:04:32.580> it's<00:04:33.580> only<00:04:33.730> by

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
calculations of the wind it's only by

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.030 
calculations of the wind it's only by
that<00:04:34.060> five<00:04:34.270> degrees<00:04:34.660> so<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.410> can<00:04:35.440> just<00:04:35.740> bring<00:04:35.890> it

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
that five degrees so I can just bring it

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.770 
that five degrees so I can just bring it
down<00:04:36.070> five<00:04:36.400> degrees<00:04:36.760> and<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.240> will<00:04:37.330> be<00:04:37.420> back<00:04:37.600> on

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
down five degrees and it will be back on

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.870 
down five degrees and it will be back on
target

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
target

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.120 
target
so<00:04:39.510> now<00:04:39.660> pretty<00:04:39.990> much<00:04:40.080> should<00:04:40.440> be<00:04:40.560> lined<00:04:40.770> up<00:04:41.010> on

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
so now pretty much should be lined up on

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.240 
so now pretty much should be lined up on
my<00:04:41.280> bridge<00:04:41.490> Targa<00:04:41.880> that<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> want<00:04:42.920> so<00:04:43.920> I<00:04:43.950> can<00:04:43.980> do

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
my bridge Targa that I want so I can do

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.130 
my bridge Targa that I want so I can do
the<00:04:44.400> double<00:04:44.700> checks<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.150> my<00:04:45.330> altitude<00:04:45.900> and

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
the double checks of my altitude and

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.050 
the double checks of my altitude and
airspeed<00:04:46.400> make<00:04:47.400> sure<00:04:47.520> there<00:04:47.730> import

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
airspeed make sure there import

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.890 
airspeed make sure there import
correctly<00:04:50.030> also<00:04:51.030> check<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.540> Bombay

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
correctly also check that the Bombay

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.360 
correctly also check that the Bombay
doors<00:04:52.110> are<00:04:52.410> open

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
doors are open

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.280 
doors are open
now<00:04:54.940> we<00:04:55.000> need<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.330> keep<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.660> mind<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:56.110> wind

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
now we need to keep in mind the wind

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:57.840 
now we need to keep in mind the wind
direction<00:04:56.440> coming<00:04:56.949> on<00:04:57.130> this<00:04:57.280> final<00:04:57.639> run

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
direction coming on this final run

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.180 
direction coming on this final run
because<00:04:58.480> it's<00:04:58.780> blowing<00:04:59.199> from<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.500> West<00:04:59.770> it's

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
because it's blowing from the West it's

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.010 
because it's blowing from the West it's
actually<00:05:00.520> pushing<00:05:00.970> us<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:01.300> right<00:05:01.570> which

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
actually pushing us to the right which

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.390 
actually pushing us to the right which
means<00:05:02.320> our<00:05:02.470> crosshair<00:05:02.860> should<00:05:03.100> be<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
means our crosshair should be to the

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.370 
means our crosshair should be to the
left<00:05:03.699> of<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.910> target<00:05:04.150> on<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.600> run<00:05:04.780> in<00:05:04.930> and

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
left of the target on the run in and

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.260 
left of the target on the run in and
this<00:05:05.650> way<00:05:05.860> we<00:05:05.979> get<00:05:06.100> blown<00:05:06.370> onto<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.880> target

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
this way we get blown onto the target

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.770 
this way we get blown onto the target
when<00:05:07.449> we<00:05:07.510> get<00:05:07.690> there<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:10.270> get<00:05:10.389> the<00:05:10.540> bombs

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
when we get there we get the bombs

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.450 
when we get there we get the bombs
button<00:05:11.199> when<00:05:11.440> the<00:05:11.470> crosshair<00:05:11.949> is<00:05:12.070> over<00:05:12.340> the

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
button when the crosshair is over the

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.700 
button when the crosshair is over the
target<00:05:12.699> and<00:05:13.690> then<00:05:13.990> we<00:05:14.080> can<00:05:14.199> watch<00:05:14.350> the<00:05:14.530> bombs

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
target and then we can watch the bombs

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.030 
target and then we can watch the bombs
fall<00:05:15.479> now<00:05:16.479> that<00:05:16.720> all<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:16.960> bombs<00:05:17.169> are<00:05:17.350> gone<00:05:17.500> we

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
fall now that all the bombs are gone we

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.620 
fall now that all the bombs are gone we
don't<00:05:18.220> need<00:05:18.370> to<00:05:18.580> use<00:05:18.790> the<00:05:19.090> aiming<00:05:19.479> mode

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
don't need to use the aiming mode

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.680 
don't need to use the aiming mode
anymore<00:05:20.580> so<00:05:21.580> we<00:05:21.699> can<00:05:21.729> switch<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.120> the<00:05:22.330> viewing

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
anymore so we can switch to the viewing

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.590 
anymore so we can switch to the viewing
mode<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:24.010> by<00:05:24.160> dragging<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.669> knob<00:05:24.880> down<00:05:25.150> we

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
mode and by dragging that knob down we

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.909 
mode and by dragging that knob down we
can<00:05:25.780> actually<00:05:25.840> watch<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.350> bombs<00:05:26.560> hit<00:05:26.770> the

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
can actually watch the bombs hit the

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:32.560 
can actually watch the bombs hit the
target

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:39.500 

the<00:05:32.930> forms<00:05:33.200> are<00:05:33.290> still<00:05:33.500> falling

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.180 

we<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.110> some<00:05:40.260> good<00:05:40.410> hits<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.920> then<00:05:41.040> the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
we have some good hits and then the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.360 
we have some good hits and then the
bridge<00:05:41.370> is<00:05:41.520> destroyed<00:05:42.410> to<00:05:43.410> finish<00:05:43.680> up<00:05:43.860> look<00:05:44.280> at
