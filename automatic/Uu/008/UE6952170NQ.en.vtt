00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

cutting the ends I think I should cut my
ends<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.810> third<00:01:06.810> anniversary<00:01:07.170> maybe<00:01:08.960> but<00:01:09.960> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.859 
ends on my third anniversary maybe but I
don't<00:01:11.010> think<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.430> ends<00:01:11.670> are<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.810> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
don't think my ends are that they don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
don't think my ends are that they don't
get<00:01:13.170> tangled<00:01:13.610> when<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> wear<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.180> curly<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.580> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
get tangled when I wear it curly so and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.230 
get tangled when I wear it curly so and
I<00:01:17.700> didn't<00:01:17.970> use<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.149> hot<00:01:18.509> iron<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.100> hate<00:01:21.000> how

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
