00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello good to all yes com before we are 

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:07.169
 here in the first part of the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.100
 strategy of the players I'm going to 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:12.560
 explain quickly what we are going to say 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.450
 let's take the titan worth before 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.790
 go up then let's do the 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.800
 maximum possible points before uploading 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.480
 on average I'll be here running around 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.060
 zombies and I the one who is going is going to go 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.470
 up then those comrades are the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 partner will be down 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.550
 and I will be I would be under forgiveness and the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.200
 partner will be up then 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.079
 he regrouped everything and when they are 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 all regrouped we throw the bait of 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.280
 we shoot 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.080
 and so we got to get on with 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.000
 the titan and then we no longer have to 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:50.780
 what to work fast in a way 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.469
 good in jazz 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.469
 OK 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.309
 the 60 with 2300 and shots in the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.120
 next the next the good thing about the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.080
 weeks 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.080
 but 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.920
 s 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:24.290
 because I have a perfect perfect for 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.270
 more dogs 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.270
 and also again I want to clarify 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.170
 the next the next round is that 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.690
 you have all the most zombies me 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.000
 I have most dogs 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.170
 but more than anything, the strip is where 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.680
 are you where is your air strip 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.880
 for for 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.880
 Now be careful with the trolleys 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.060
 that is to be here I have another moment 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.550
 this shot shot I had a structure 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.390
 pomegranate 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.390
 if you can 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.280
 what remains for me with 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.290
 and also to me also what I what 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.760
 wanted to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.990
 I'm going to catch good 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.070
 how do we do this I get off then you 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.170
 I'm going to change 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.060
 but nothing more 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.060
 to throw it out if you want to be 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.620
 perfect perfect perfect but you can 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620
 do not 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.519
 see change changes work debate 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.270
 and now let's go 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.100
 now we put this we are going to continue 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.190
 applying we already have the tee so much 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.290
 so now we're going to put up here in 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.209
 the windows towards the necessary points 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.020
 already to be able to leave more for that is 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.400
 vouchers by the door there 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.950
 the important thing nothing else 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.830
 just start what I say 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.349
 the astronaut is not killed is not worth the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.629
 Astronaut does not kill himself so that 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.430
 in high rounds it is still equal 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.810
 soft that if you kill him now it's worth that's 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.470
 super important and the trick that there 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.120
 that go 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.800
 usually people do not always do 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.060
 usually kill let's get out of the way 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.860
 which is very heavy but if later on 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.780
 high rounds you have to remove it from 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.690
 better means it's soft to be 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.540
 hard hard hard to kill him and be done and 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.760
 you have to spend all the ammunition on 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.870
 work to kill it is worth then what 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.870
 said does not kill 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.760
 we count that that's where it is most if 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.080
 perhaps 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.080
 but let's go down 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.790
 until the rats did not kill him until 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.790
 the tall wheels so he's talking 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.870
 dance 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:31.080
 with the little dot but long 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:33.030
 and this support what we're going to leave now 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.160
 well let's count a little bit so 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.330
 are already about to leave 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.330
 it is perfect 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.460
 good nobody so wait, do not come 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.520
 let's go so that I, like me, have money 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.300
 I open my mind 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.300
 I expected 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.529
 open all 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.709
 to go down 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:57.709
 yes 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.630
 this is true and now we put the mp l 

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:09.769
 then now we would hold one in that 

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:12.139
 window and another in this door and in this 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:14.479
 window and we would hold here until we have 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.569
 about 4000 points each worth about 4000 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:20.809
 points I remember then when we have 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:23.959
 4000 points approximately 4 thousand 5000 

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.459
 65 thousand better we leave a trolley and we already 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:26.989
 we go through this door and then 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:29.149
 we will explain the second part of the 

00:05:26.989 --> 00:05:31.009
 strategy is good positions 

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:34.519
 We hope you liked it and now 

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:37.050
 you know subscribe and vote I like 

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:39.830
 come people to road 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.830
 I do not do it
