00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:39.140
 It looks like it was sent from google, so it's your own print. 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.140
 I feel is a fictional group I Gil does not 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.289

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:54.640

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.250
 Hey android 4.1 point 1 Julie needs nice 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.770
 So to be referred to quad-core seam June and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.970
 Operation is also light and very easy to use 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.650
 Is that an advantage of this terminal? 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.720
 9 good motion scroll 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.860
 There is no stopping or stopping until now, and there has been no one forced end, nor has problems occurred 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.860
 There is none 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.800
 So you say it's a very good terminal 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.340
 Keep great 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.770
 It is difficult if the operation is difficult for small people 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:20.080
 I usually go down the task bar and I can source it with his hand 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.400
 For example , it is a terminal which is not suitable for small people to hear it is 4.8 inches 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.299
 I think 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.280
 If you even buy this, you won't regret it on your smartphone anymore 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:32.230
