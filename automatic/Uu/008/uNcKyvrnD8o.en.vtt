00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 all beaver dear friends with you wendy 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.970
 This is an addition to my previous video. 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.649
 if you have not watched it then it is desirable 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.990
 watch it before watching it 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.929
 video so here often people ask 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.000
 question if we have no energy and 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 the door on the idea of ​​energy do not eat but because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.109
 that they are wooden, what's stopping us 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.490
 just take a close and two doors and not 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.619
 bathe I have this 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 the intended and this is it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 Essentially, plus the grass , the fact is that if 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.590
 look at the picture with plushin 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 the trailer then we see that we are 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.669
 near plushtrap directly 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.430
 physically that is you somehow 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.829
 we leave our room and get into 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.270
 room is a plush at option as we can 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.280
 get to the plush u2 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.960
 or we have somewhere in the room 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.850
 additional door that we do not 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.950
 seen in the trailer and through it we 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.469
 We fall either directly into the room 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.600
 to plushtrap or we climb into the attic on 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.960
 the attic sits plushtrap in general like that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.000
 So 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.890
 I will call it option a and be it 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.449
 so send a swarm option that we have in 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 room and from no extra 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.010
 doors and to get to the path + us 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.960
 will have to go to the hall where they can 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.880
 be nightmarish animatronics and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.040
 quickly run to the plushy 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.979
 shine on him and go back 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 this option I'll call option b, and will 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.950
 to him so respond 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.990
 I personally prefer option b 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.060
 because running between the rooms this 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.280
 you know that you can sleep 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.530
 some nightmare so yes you can 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.450
 close both doors and they will not either 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 open the idea nightmarish 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 animatronics will not get to you and you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.829
 seemed like a security dish but no 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 plyushtrap remains one of this, 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.570
 can safely move a dagger 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.170
 after the dagger he will break to you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.329
 the room 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.579
 either through ventilation which seems to be 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.680
 closed it can be opened with a plushtrap 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.110
 either behind you he will suddenly be 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 if he is really in the attic either he 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.770
 somehow it will open the door but it's some kind 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 strange then if option option you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.310
 will prove to be true to the room with 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.500
 need to get through the hall 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.689
 then you will have to open up first 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.909
 door and shine a flashlight check 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.280
 is there a nightmarish animatronic 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.990
 and as we saw in the trailer it was in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.640
 moment of flashlight if 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.130
 animatronic will get too close 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 and he will shout at you like that 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.640
 constantly have to keep an eye on the doors and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.709
 halls to keep out 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.720
 animatronics too close and shine 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.550
 they flashlight after all sooner or later 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 through this haul you have to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.140
 go over to the most plushtrap otherwise 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.330
 plushpine will kill you but if we 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.750
 Consider option a and some kind of door 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.940
 in the room leads to plushtrap then yes you 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.070
 you can close both doors and through the hall to 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.140
 you don't have to run on likely 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.910
 as soon as you leave the room 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
 plushtrap to devote to it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.590
 flashlight and return to his room 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.780
 you will see that the doors are open and some 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.200
 for not motronic of already snuck up to you in 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.820
 room as you see both options 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.980
 make you keep the door 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.440
 open and one way or another checks 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 the presence of animatronics behind them without giving 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.200
 they are close to you 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.150
 you will immediately find yourself and so summing up 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.739
 if you are suddenly lost in my words 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.930
 constantly have to check 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.760
 animatronic plushtrap because if 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.950
 will you check him then he will come to 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.930
 godson will attack you and kill you 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.910
 if plushtrap you have to get 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.769
 through the hall then you have to constantly 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.230
 open the door and check is not 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.239
 whether animatronics next to you so 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.280
 you had the opportunity to run a whooping cough 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.530
 trail and at the same time do not get caught by anyone 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.670
 if any of the doors lead the plushtrap 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.410
 in your room 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.299
 then you should still check 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.280
 doors for the presence of animatronics because 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.500
 what ever go another room 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.570
 plushtrap u come back to your office you 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.480
 you will see that animatronic standing next to 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.239
 you already entered the room and after that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.310
 you immediately lose well, that's all 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.470
 hope you like hope you 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.280
 I realized that this one has been telling everyone so far. 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.280
 bye, good luck
