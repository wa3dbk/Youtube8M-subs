00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.510
 shrimp on the barbecue always exciting 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.160
 they are obviously so overcooked but only 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.570
 a shrimp is so boring 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 what I do then I grab a leaf 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.800
 basil some bacon 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.470
 wrap it around the shrimp and then we go 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.080
 they are moderate on a reasonable mail 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.160
 temperature of about 160 to 170 degrees 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 we are grilling 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.480
 that will feast so I have one 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.550
 basil leaf 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.750
 I take my channel do that leaf there 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.059
 basil over 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.309
 grab half a slice of bacon and then 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.370
 I just simply wrap around it 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.350
 kick nice and creative and I have the bamboo 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.059
 I already have chopsticks in it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 water so that they do not immediately 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.750
 to burn 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.700
 look at that I poke through it so through it 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.770
 bacon and the shrimp 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 of course, can always course soon 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.590
 when they are done, a little bit 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.870
 chili powder over it 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.210
 that gives an extra bite to it nicely 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.210
 your lips and so effective 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.610
 of the baton and it's done 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 barbecue is at a hundred and 70 degrees 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.810
 180 degrees so for the shrimp I want 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 they are short and powerful 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.049
 so well cooked for a while 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.180
 180 degrees is allowed 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 those are the most barbecues while I am 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.390
 place them indirectly in the middle of the barbecue 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 so next to the coal 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.080
 mind you, the hot air now ensures that 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.540
 my shrimp would be cooked one 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.439
 bucket that there and they can taste good 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.900
 Bake for 10 minutes 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.960
 oh yeah and i still have what i still have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.119
 trays with ready-made minis these 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.549
 shrimps are already strung on a skewer 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.700
 are already wonderfully covered with 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.110
 olive oil and some tasty herbs you 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.340
 just mean to put up 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.110
 well i think they are 10 minutes away 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.110
 his child can also do the laundry 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.720
 Looking back 10 minutes further as dad 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.050
 that can't be missed 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.490
 take a look so the place is nicely crispy 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.160
 just look this for me 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.380
 all the way out 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.479
 channel that are just as cooked as i want 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.370
 I also quite what they are overcooked than 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.140
 they also get so dry and that bacon and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.490
 that basil makes it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.530
 is tasty on taste 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.670
 bacon make it nice and crispy 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.590
 finals 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.960
 nicely cooked and then I do a small one 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.820
 little chili powder over it 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.890

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.060

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.990
