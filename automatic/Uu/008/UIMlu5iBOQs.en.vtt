of a chi channel ATD converter but

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.670 
of a chi channel ATD converter but
there's<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> little<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:21.990> more<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.560> than

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
there's a little bit more to it than

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.679 
there's a little bit more to it than
that<00:00:22.740> how<00:00:23.490> long<00:00:23.699> first<00:00:24.029> off<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.449> front

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
that how long first off on the front

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.470 
that how long first off on the front
panel<00:00:24.949> you'll<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.760> touchscreen

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.800 

we

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
we

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
we
number<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.199> things<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.680> can<00:00:31.859> do<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
number of things we can do with that

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.130 
number of things we can do with that
there's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.090> couple<00:00:33.360> different<00:00:33.600> meters

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there's a couple different meters

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.370 
there's a couple different meters
available

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 

also<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.220> the<00:00:38.250> routing<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.150> so<00:00:39.330> forth<00:00:39.630> can<00:00:39.870> be

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
also all the routing and so forth can be

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.320 
also all the routing and so forth can be
done<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.560> we<00:00:40.740> can<00:00:40.770> literally<00:00:41.340> take<00:00:41.610> any

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
done from here we can literally take any

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.750 
done from here we can literally take any
combination<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.260> sources<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.190> any<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
combination of sources to any of the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.480 
combination of sources to any of the
outputs<00:00:45.240> so<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.720> can<00:00:46.020> choose<00:00:46.230> let's<00:00:46.620> say<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:47.490 
outputs so I can choose let's say the

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.850 
outputs so I can choose let's say the
headphone<00:00:47.910> output<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.380> make<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.650> line

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
headphone output and I can make the line

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.980 
headphone output and I can make the line
in<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.310> there<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.580> can<00:00:50.970> make<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> digital<00:00:51.600> am<00:00:51.780> no

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990 
in go there I can make the digital am no

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.920 
in go there I can make the digital am no
longer<00:00:52.290> go<00:00:52.740> there<00:00:52.980> now<00:00:53.700> anything<00:00:54.390> into

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
longer go there now anything into

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
longer go there now anything into
anything<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.470> basically<00:00:56.040> it's<00:00:56.280> extremely

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
anything out basically it's extremely

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.120 
anything out basically it's extremely
flexible<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.810> terms<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.140> routing<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
flexible in terms of routing now the

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.890 
flexible in terms of routing now the
reason<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.880> not<00:01:00.060> really<00:01:00.450> just<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.750> two

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
reason it's not really just the two

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.080 
reason it's not really just the two
channel<00:01:01.260> converters<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.130> is<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.310> lot<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.760> i/o

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
channel converters there is a lot of i/o

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.340 
channel converters there is a lot of i/o
on<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:03.780> we've<00:01:04.470> got<00:01:04.530> line-in<00:01:05.190> lineout

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
on here we've got line-in lineout

switchable and software between spit up
in<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.540> nap<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.320> actually<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> eight

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
in a nap so can actually do eight

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
in a nap so can actually do eight

computer<00:01:23.369> connectivity<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.360> has<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> USB<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
computer connectivity it has a USB to

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
computer connectivity it has a USB to
interface<00:01:26.190> and<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.330> these<00:01:27.479> channels<00:01:28.050> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
interface and all of these channels can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.320

and controls the level between source to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.359 
and controls the level between source to
output<00:02:04.200> but<00:02:05.200> also<00:02:05.380> it<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.890> increment
