welcome everyone to a texture pack
update<00:00:02.280> and<00:00:02.780> if<00:00:03.780> you<00:00:03.929> remember<00:00:04.770> last<00:00:05.400> time<00:00:05.870> my

update and if you remember last time my
last<00:00:07.080> text<00:00:07.410> back<00:00:07.560> i<00:00:07.740> said<00:00:07.980> water<00:00:08.700> was<00:00:08.970> broken

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
last text back i said water was broken

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.140 
last text back i said water was broken
as<00:00:09.540> in<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:10.410> wouldn't<00:00:10.710> show<00:00:10.860> my<00:00:11.130> water<00:00:11.580> but<00:00:12.000> it

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
as in it wouldn't show my water but it

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330 
as in it wouldn't show my water but it
would<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:13.049> default<00:00:13.679> even<00:00:13.980> though<00:00:14.099> although

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
would do default even though although

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.630 
would do default even though although
there's<00:00:14.700> textures<00:00:15.179> changed<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.470> if<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.490> look

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
there's textures changed so if you look

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.390 
there's textures changed so if you look
down<00:00:17.880> there<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.660> can<00:00:18.810> see<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:20.070> regular

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
down there you can see that the regular

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.179 
down there you can see that the regular
water<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.060> there<00:00:21.420> well<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:22.050> regular<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.740> my

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is basically what it looks like and how

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.799 
is basically what it looks like and how
I<00:00:39.809> got<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> work<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.829> seems<00:00:41.550> kind<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> strange

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
I got to work it seems kind of strange

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.770 
I got to work it seems kind of strange
okay<00:00:43.590> it's<00:00:43.739> not<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.129> um<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.539> kind<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
okay it's not like um it was kind of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
okay it's not like um it was kind of
unexpected<00:00:46.039> but<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.129> worked<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.940> was

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
unexpected but it worked so I was

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.959 
unexpected but it worked so I was
installing<00:00:48.390> Optifine<00:00:49.350> mod<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.980> after<00:00:50.940> i

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
installing Optifine mod and after i

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.680 
installing Optifine mod and after i
installed<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:52.879> you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.180> works<00:00:54.449> now

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
installed it you can see it works now

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.240 
installed it you can see it works now
and<00:00:55.020> that's<00:00:55.260> basically<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.739> so<00:00:55.980> i<00:00:56.010> haven't

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and that's basically it so i haven't

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.369 
and that's basically it so i haven't
been<00:00:56.309> able<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.760> figure<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.149> out

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
been able to really figure it out

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.330 
been able to really figure it out
anyways<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.590> what<00:00:58.859> looks<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.070> when

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
anyways this is what looks like when

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.650 
anyways this is what looks like when
it's<00:00:59.430> moving<00:00:59.789> just<00:01:00.120> giving<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> guys<00:01:00.629> a

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
it's moving just giving you guys a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.850 
it's moving just giving you guys a
little<00:01:00.840> bit<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.140> idea<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:03.830> anyways<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:06.860> my

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
little bit of idea and anyways so my

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
little bit of idea and anyways so my
guess<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.610> I'll<00:01:08.790> be<00:01:09.000> fine<00:01:09.270> doesn't

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
guess is is that I'll be fine doesn't

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
guess is is that I'll be fine doesn't
load<00:01:10.380> ever<00:01:10.710> from<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> default<00:01:11.960> default

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
load ever from the default default

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.770 
load ever from the default default
textures<00:01:13.680> when<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> texture<00:01:15.330> pack<00:01:15.540> on

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
textures when it has a texture pack on

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.109 
textures when it has a texture pack on
and<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.320> that's<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.680> why<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.520> correct

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
and so that's probably why it's correct

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.719 
and so that's probably why it's correct
so<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.110> keep<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> mind<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> install

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
so just keep that in mind if you install

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.030 
so just keep that in mind if you install
my<00:01:20.909> texture<00:01:21.270> pack<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.409> installed<00:01:22.830> but

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
my texture pack not really installed but

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.980 
my texture pack not really installed but
you<00:01:23.159> know<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.610> texture<00:01:23.939> pack<00:01:24.409> then<00:01:25.409> um<00:01:26.990> use

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
you know use my texture pack then um use

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.990 
you know use my texture pack then um use
Optifine<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> regular<00:01:29.250> water<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
Optifine to get the regular water if you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.580 
Optifine to get the regular water if you
want<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.500> now<00:01:31.500> i<00:01:32.900> will<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.049> links<00:01:34.350> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
want it now i will put links in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.749 
want it now i will put links in
description<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.759> Optifine<00:01:37.759> mod<00:01:38.759> also<00:01:40.759> um

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
description to the Optifine mod also um

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.970 
description to the Optifine mod also um
let's<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.049> anything<00:01:43.229> else<00:01:43.590> oh<00:01:44.720> yes

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.660 

also<00:01:48.970> since<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:49.900> fixed<00:01:50.410> I<00:01:51.010> don't<00:01:51.580> think

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
also since this is fixed I don't think

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.480 
also since this is fixed I don't think
there's<00:01:52.120> a<00:01:52.210> way<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.870> do<00:01:53.260> it<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:53.680> you<00:01:53.740> can't<00:01:54.400> use

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
there's a way to do it so you can't use

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.730 
there's a way to do it so you can't use
off<00:01:54.730> be<00:01:54.880> fine<00:01:55.090> because<00:01:55.300> I<00:01:55.480> think<00:01:55.750> if<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.560> not

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
off be fine because I think if it's not

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.490 
off be fine because I think if it's not
an<00:01:56.890> HD<00:01:57.430> texture<00:01:57.930> minecraft<00:01:58.930> just<00:01:59.110> won't<00:01:59.290> load

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
an HD texture minecraft just won't load

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.350 
an HD texture minecraft just won't load
the<00:01:59.800> regular<00:02:00.190> water<00:02:00.400> which<00:02:00.670> doesn't<00:02:01.090> make<00:02:01.150> any

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
the regular water which doesn't make any

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.080 
the regular water which doesn't make any
sense<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:01.720> me<00:02:02.130> but<00:02:03.130> I<00:02:03.430> guess<00:02:03.640> that's<00:02:03.850> just<00:02:03.910> how

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
sense to me but I guess that's just how

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.260 
sense to me but I guess that's just how
how<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.720> does<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.790> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:09.670> really<00:02:09.700> know<00:02:09.910> I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
how it does it so I don't really know I

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.450 
how it does it so I don't really know I
don't<00:02:11.020> know<00:02:11.230> how<00:02:11.380> it<00:02:11.440> all<00:02:11.530> works<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.280> know

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
don't know how it all works if you know

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.130 
don't know how it all works if you know
you<00:02:12.790> can<00:02:12.970> explain<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.630> me<00:02:14.700> yeah<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:16.570> that's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
you can explain it to me yeah so that's

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.780 
you can explain it to me yeah so that's
about<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:20.050> remember<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.710> you<00:02:21.610> got
