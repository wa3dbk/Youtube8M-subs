light without no goal of the PASOK logo
which<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.100> just<00:00:50.100> nice<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.309> me<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.879> I'm

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
which is just nice for me because I'm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.600 
which is just nice for me because I'm
not<00:00:51.210> riding<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.780> bicycle<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.219> does<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
not riding a bicycle but it does have

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.310 
not riding a bicycle but it does have
the<00:00:53.760> laser<00:00:54.000> light<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> see<00:00:55.140> from

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the laser light that you can see from

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.180 
the laser light that you can see from
here<00:00:55.829> from<00:00:56.219> behind<00:00:56.670> me<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> most<00:00:58.379> amazing

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
here from behind me the most amazing

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060 
here from behind me the most amazing
thing<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> I<00:00:59.609> like<00:01:00.000> about<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:00.800> tail<00:01:01.800> light

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
thing that I like about this tail light

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
thing that I like about this tail light
which<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> wireless<00:01:03.030> braking<00:01:03.600> warning

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
which is the wireless braking warning

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310 
which is the wireless braking warning
where<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.949> will<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.760> braking<00:01:06.510> in<00:01:06.840> real

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
where you will see the braking in real

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.469 
where you will see the braking in real
time<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:08.070> means<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:09.150> you're<00:01:09.330> actually

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
time that means when you're actually

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.920 
time that means when you're actually
slowing<00:01:09.869> now<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.920> detects<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.520> deceleration<00:01:12.210> by

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
slowing now it detects a deceleration by

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
slowing now it detects a deceleration by
whatever<00:01:13.229> means<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.979> sensor<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.760> they<00:01:14.939> have

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
whatever means of sensor that they have

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.649 
whatever means of sensor that they have
inside<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.890> very<00:01:16.890> fantastic<00:01:17.549> product<00:01:17.939> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
inside this very fantastic product you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.530 
inside this very fantastic product you
actually<00:01:18.990> shine<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.070> maximum<00:01:20.729> brightness<00:01:20.970> when

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
actually shine a maximum brightness when

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.320 
actually shine a maximum brightness when
eg<00:01:22.049> celery<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.610> this<00:01:23.820> product<00:01:24.180> because

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
eg celery so I like this product because

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.289 
eg celery so I like this product because
of<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.350> that's<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.009> cannot<00:01:27.000> really

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
of that because that's I cannot really

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.359 
of that because that's I cannot really
find<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:28.049> product<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.829> market<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.310> now

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
find a product on the market right now

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.999 
find a product on the market right now
that<00:01:29.670> actually<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:30.920> sends<00:01:31.920> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that actually really sends a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
that actually really sends a
deceleration<00:01:32.670> wirelessly<00:01:33.390> without<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
deceleration wirelessly without so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.830 
deceleration wirelessly without so
connecting<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.799> brakes<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.369> etc<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
connecting to brakes and etc so it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.039 
connecting to brakes and etc so it's
very<00:01:37.020> very<00:01:37.470> suitable<00:01:38.400> for<00:01:38.720> electric<00:01:39.720> unicycle

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
very very suitable for electric unicycle

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.850 
very very suitable for electric unicycle
or<00:01:40.710> any<00:01:41.310> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:42.079> product<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.229> does<00:01:43.619> not

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
or any kind of product that does not

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
or any kind of product that does not
have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.399> braking<00:01:44.909> mechanism<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have a braking mechanism like the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
have a braking mechanism like the
electric<00:01:46.950> unicycle<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.840> actually

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
electric unicycle so you can actually

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
electric unicycle so you can actually
utilize<00:01:49.439> this<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.430> actually<00:01:50.909> detect<00:01:51.299> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
utilize this to actually detect a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.469 
utilize this to actually detect a
braking<00:01:51.960> motion<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:53.100> shown<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
braking motion and you shown the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.670 
braking motion and you shown the
brightness<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.070> full<00:01:56.340> LEDs<00:01:57.270> contrast<00:01:57.990> but

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
brightness in in full LEDs contrast but

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
brightness in in full LEDs contrast but
the<00:01:58.829> downside<00:01:59.070> for<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.759> product<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.390> very

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the downside for this product is very

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.950 
the downside for this product is very
obvious<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:02.280> lumen<00:02:02.759> brightness<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.689> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
obvious the lumen brightness of this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.740 
obvious the lumen brightness of this
tail<00:02:04.590> light<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.369> as<00:02:05.579> bright<00:02:05.640> as<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
tail light is not as bright as the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.499 
tail light is not as bright as the
comparator<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.759> more<00:02:08.759> recent<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
comparator that is a more recent in the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.220 
comparator that is a more recent in the
market<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:11.060> unfortunately<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:13.020> battery

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
market and unfortunately the battery

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.090 
market and unfortunately the battery
compartment<00:02:13.770> is

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
compartment is

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.190 
compartment is
not<00:02:14.220> rechargeable<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.750> need<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.050> actually

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
not rechargeable you need to actually

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.500 
not rechargeable you need to actually
replace<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.760> know<00:02:17.880> when<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.210> battery

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
replace it you know when the battery

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.170 
replace it you know when the battery
runs<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.960> but<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.920> can<00:02:20.070> always<00:02:20.310> replace<00:02:20.730> it

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
runs out but you can always replace it

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.080 
runs out but you can always replace it
as<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:21.900> when<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.080> want<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.100> a<00:02:23.130> downside<00:02:23.850> is

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
as and when you want but a downside is

just break off anytime if you fall down

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.630

it might just break off so I do not

with wireless breaking I use the the

with wireless breaking I use the the
mounting<00:02:46.260> instead<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.280> this<00:02:47.490> because<00:02:47.850> this<00:02:48.000> is

mounting instead of this because this is

you get a you know alternative mounting

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.350 
you get a you know alternative mounting
mechanism<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.980> cost<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.580> it<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:08.970> pretty
