00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
I think special Tom with this being a

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:41.400 
I think special Tom with this being a
little<00:02:12.450> bit<00:02:12.540> thinner<00:02:12.780> body

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.880 

you<00:02:42.190> know<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.459> for<00:02:42.700> 349<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.680> plays

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
you know like for 349 and it plays

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.470 
you know like for 349 and it plays
really<00:02:45.250> good<00:02:45.430> it's<00:02:45.610> got<00:02:45.730> great<00:02:46.000> tone<00:02:46.270> you<00:02:46.450> can

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
really good it's got great tone you can

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.090 
really good it's got great tone you can
see<00:02:46.600> that<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.110> pickup<00:02:47.440> system<00:02:47.830> there

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
see that the pickup system there

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.590 
see that the pickup system there
probably<00:02:48.910> could<00:02:49.030> use<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.180> little<00:02:49.390> bit<00:02:49.510> of

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600
