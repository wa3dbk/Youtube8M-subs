00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.300
 Hi, I'm Javier from your reviews and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 then I'm going to show you a 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.840
 boxing of the mix m 5 the way you see the box 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.600
 it's open because I've seen it before 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.289
 do the unboxing but good is this and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.289
 how i found it 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.550
 in the box 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.800
 as you see we have plastics of these 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.960
 little bubbles so you do not hit 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.720
 a converter to plug in 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.160
 current the charger 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.160
 and here we have the phone 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.980
 As you can see, the box does not look like 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.680
 decent you had a month 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.400
 although you can read I do not know if you can 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.200
 see here put xiaomi I do not know if the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.680
 internal components all be yao ming 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.480
 or it's just an impression that they put 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.810
 here in the box because if sometimes you're 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.020
 things of the Chinese we already know how they go 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.070
 as you see here we have the terminal what 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070
 I leave a moment aside 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.119
 I take out the box 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.080
 we see in 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.470
 in the typical bookcase cover 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.770
 It has much secret leatherette this 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.140
 microusb 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.420
 the charger 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.680
 As you can see the pegs here, these are not us 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.320
 serving 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.370
 Thus 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.810
 and we need the converter 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.620
 the truth is that it is quite seedy and 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.860
 that the charger is white could put 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.720
 the white converter but good are these 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.420
 things that the Chinese have 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.860
 in two batteries we do not have two here 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.660
 because one is inside the mobile that I 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.430
 I put it before but this is the 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.660
 second and substitution when it is very 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.090
 well because you can always take it 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.649
 loaded with which you will never stay in 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.390
 drums 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.539
 there is also a protector of 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.539
 screen 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:20.280
 a headphones 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.280
 and honestly I have not even tried them 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.680
 on your site 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.280
 I'm going to show you a little the terminal 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.520
 comes with a stress bubble paper 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.520
 and then another protective plastic 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.340
 it's quite spectacular a camera 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.730
 12 megapixels is a quad core with a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.730
 giga de ram 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.520
 They are pretty good 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.870
