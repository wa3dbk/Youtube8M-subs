00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.210 
now you have a little bit of a field
change<00:04:36.419> going<00:04:36.720> into<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.110> second<00:04:37.620> ending<00:04:38.069> so

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
change going into the second ending so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.800 
change going into the second ending so
you<00:04:38.310> just<00:04:38.490> hold<00:04:38.639> out<00:04:38.880> half<00:04:40.099> 3/4<00:04:41.099> C<00:04:42.030> 2<00:04:42.360> 3<00:04:43.110> 4<00:04:43.740> s<00:04:44.400> 2<00:04:44.849> 3

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
you just hold out half 3/4 C 2 3 4 s 2 3

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.870 
you just hold out half 3/4 C 2 3 4 s 2 3
4<00:04:46.500> and<00:04:46.770> then<00:04:46.889> 3<00:04:47.099> 2<00:04:48.030> 3<00:04:48.360> 4<00:04:49.080> and<00:04:49.949> then<00:04:50.069> I<00:04:50.130> think<00:04:50.610> we

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
4 and then 3 2 3 4 and then I think we

00:04:50.880 --> 00:05:03.260 
4 and then 3 2 3 4 and then I think we
go<00:04:51.090> back<00:04:51.360> into<00:04:51.599> the<00:04:51.900> verse<00:04:52.199> right<00:05:01.789> all<00:05:02.789> about

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
go back into the verse right all about

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.689 
go back into the verse right all about
the<00:05:03.449> anticipation<00:05:03.930> in<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:04.830> song<00:05:05.070> if<00:05:05.430> that's

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699
