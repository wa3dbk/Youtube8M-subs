00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.130
 I will teach you how to modify 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.830
 the writing under ios is this tutorial 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.050
 will be valid for iphone ipod touch and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.090
 ipad of course so if you do not have a 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.260
 jailbroken device under ios is it ne 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.990
 will not work since I'm going 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.290
 use software only to be done 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.340
 available for ios is is more so I 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.460
 you say right now it'll be a 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 really easy tutorial because actually 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.739
 change the writing font on your 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.239
 idevice it's not very complicated so 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.879
 to start you are going to have to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.870
 download a tweet view mme bitat 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 founds so by tf1 nt1 2 and that is 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.300
 available of course for free on the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.640
 my mode source which is of course 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.370
 add automatically when you 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.010
 install cydia so the second step 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 will be to download the writing of your 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.390
 choice the font of your writing 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.090
 choice directly on cydia to be able to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 then apply it with the software that 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.200
 I made you download just before 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.520
 so what are you going to do is you 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.400
 render in category 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.250
 and there you go down to the letter f 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.890
 where will it be marked food beat face 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.080
 two so here it's all the scriptures 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.040
 there are hundreds or even 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 thousands so to show the example one 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.110
 will download 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 well why not write annie pours 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.159
 so you have to click on 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:46.229
 install confirmed is there and well it's going 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.060
 quickly download and we find ourselves 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.649
 just after downloading 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.540
 so here's my writing is good 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.810
 download we can now left 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.149
 cydia and we will go directly 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.570
 in bitat so the icon is 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.430
 this one so a white circle with in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.240
 we mark in uppercase is a 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.959
 tiny surrounded by a blue 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.399
 you have to click on it and here 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.280
 you will be able to adjust the parameters 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.120
 of writing so there for example 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.819
 camera and well I have a writing 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.300
 basic called neuro poehl and ben 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.470
 I will modify it by upgrading 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.190
 you do the same thing for all of you 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.920
 select birthday here is where 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.980
 you change the writing of ebooks the 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.050
 keyboard and system so every 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.030
 settings etc 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.280
 once you have selected that 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.989
 you can click on basic she has 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.600
 once again you put annie verse 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.319
 to be sure and well that everything is 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.790
 transformed 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.510
 with the writing you have set 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.030
 then you click on yes and that makes 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.040
 1 pring before explaining to the holidays 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 to apply writing settings 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.959
 and that's my mind is over and you 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.670
 can see that already right there up is 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.400
 well the writing has changed so that's fine 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.880
 to the universe what was fixed just before 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.400
 then you type your code is there 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.910
 you observe once again that everything has 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970
 exchange 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.090
 we can already see that the writing of 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.090
 labels of icons has changed so if we 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.470
 look for example the app store name eh 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.590
 well it's no longer basic writing 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.570
 but it's the handwriting annie woerth 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.430
 we also have in the settings and well 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.739
 a write change you can the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.190
 really see everything changed if we go 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.730
 in general eh ben again everything 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.549
 changed 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.859
 writing has refreshed drying 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.750
 modified and of course to finish you 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.060
 can also see that the keyboard 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.410
 updated with the new 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.319
 gold level writing what we have 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.970
 selected just before so here you 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.400
 have noticed that it is really 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.920
 very easy to edit the writing under 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.959
 ios so if you still want one 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.980
 once changed writing you only have to 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.450
 go ball to download on cydia is 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.889
 once she was loaded you 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.150
 apply it just as we did 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.620
 before then it's the same thing to do 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.230
 for all scriptures 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.120
