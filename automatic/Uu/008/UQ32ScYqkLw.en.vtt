00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 thanks.july andrew it's already time 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.100
 to go to the details of the forecast 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.440
 of time we're going to go straight to 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.469
 the pacific where it has been precisely 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.150
 the hurricane of yesterday beatriz has been 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.610
 turned for this morning into a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.590
 tropical storm the news and that is that 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.539
 caused some havoc towards the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.060
 Pacific coasts specifically in 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.769
 the states of both Oaxaca de Guerrero 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.750
 extending even to our 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 friends of nayarit and especially leaving 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 havoc also for colima and part of the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.050
 south of jalisco and is that he was 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.960
 very close to the coasts and although not 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
 touched precisely land in the country if 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.309
 reached to touch or have some 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 very important indeed 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 important with torrential rain many 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 cloudy a lot of electrical activity 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.129
 equally the wind quite important 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.870
 today it becomes a 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.610
 tropical storm and also happens to be 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.250
 a low pressure for this afternoon or 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.230
 early morning moving away completely from 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 our country is not even going to cause 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 some problem for our friends 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.539
 from baja california south since the day 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.280
 yesterday we have a forecast that 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.589
 this at least zoom in a bit causing 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.480
 also some good high waves 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 today the address has changed 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.320
 this has been completely degraded it has 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000
 broken and no longer causes major problem for 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 the country is only going to leave some 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.300
 cloudy or some increase in terms of 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.980
 precipitation refers but 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.230
 we just see that today is 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.730
 it moves away completely from the territory 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.430
 national in the satellite image 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.620
 we can see how this training 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.750
 tropical phenomenon is degraded by 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.970
 complete breaks and only remains 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.380
 cloudiness varies in much of the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.550
 national territory is in fact the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.860
 interior of the mexican republic 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.750
 It also caused some havoc due to 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.850
 that the arms of this hurricane were 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.590
 quite broad and caused therefore some 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.660
 rain also into the interior of the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.490
 Mexican republic should be mentioned and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.900
 talking to the precipitation 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.370
 our region also today 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 we estimate some rain and this we 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.420
 would fall quite well indeed in greater 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.860
 way to our friends from the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.990
 shores of the Gulf of Mexico we are 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.700
 speaking both as veracruz 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.860
 our friends from Tamaulipas where good 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.600
 part of this entity per aiba goes to 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.520
 have the presence of precipitation 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.470
 I argue also for good 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.990
 part of the territory of new lÃ©on where 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 esteem we estimate at least that the rain 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.619
 attack good part of this and especially 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.540
 towards the south of our state where 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.819
 we had had some periods 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.469
 important shortages of rain and over 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.000
 everything for the friends of doctor arroyo la 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.010
 good news is that the rain 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.510
 we expect attack today and about 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.099
 all towards the afternoon with activity 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.469
 electrical although it is not ruled out the 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.060
 presence of the sun towards the time of 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.040
 late also the cloudy variable 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.900
 will prevail and a good part of our 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.280
 been with the same tendency towards 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.260
 humidity towards the rain and towards the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.000
 electrical activity good part also 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.829
 from the coasts of the Pacific we can 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.959
 observe in this purple spot presents 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.969
 the rain and this the ravages that leaves 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.579
 to the passage precisely the storm 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.409
 tropical beatriz at the moment we can 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.639
 observe in the satellite image the 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:49.200
 cloudy variables that have been 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.239
 dominating in the last hours and that 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.409
 they cause moisture to be 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.540
 elevated at this time of the morning 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.069
 we estimate in cloudy variables 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.900
 precisely for today 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.629
 temperatures so to speak not the 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.639
 we see so high reaching some 35 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.500
 36 degrees Celsius in a good part of 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.299
 our state which at least 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.919
 it would come quite well and for our 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.450
 friends who see us in houston les 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.489
 forecast that today we hope 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.409
 the precipitation at least for those who 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.669
 they are going to attend the game precisely 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.109
 of today that is going to take place 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:18.390
 in this city the cloudy ones are estimated 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.120
 variables and also some rain 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.350
 for the next three days we can 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.150
 observe on our screen that the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.100
 cloudy average the trend will prevail 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.480
 it's at very high temperatures it's going to 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.340
 see present for this day and 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.110
 talking about dallas is predicted what 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.490
 same the cloudy medium prevailing the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.650
 next saturday heaven completely 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.250
 cleared the maxims will go on the rise 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.959
 between 95 99 and 97 degrees fahrenheit 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.910
 argued we have here to the south of the 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.100
 City of Monterrey 7 degrees Celsius 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.380
 a rather wet condition in the 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.120
 environment and also some cloudy medium 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.280
 it's just estimated throughout the entire 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.870
 day since for the afternoon although if 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.000
 will increase the thermometer we estimate the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.320
 precipitation the maxims at least 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.350
 reaching 36 degrees Celsius 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.390
 for the night we estimate some 26 and 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.220
 also the cloudy medium will prevail or 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.720
 cloudy variable but without the rain 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.430
 for today's night tomorrow 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.110
 Thursday also extends to the forecast 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.150
 of precipitation and temperatures 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.070
 they are going to keep very stable that yes no 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.900
 we see that the heat goes down the maximum 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.000
 between 36 to 37 degrees Celsius 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.310
 tomorrow also to take care of the rain 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.079
 Friday, Saturday and Sunday, only some 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.480
 Partly cloudy or scarce cloudiness is what 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.610
 that is predicted so to take care of ourselves already 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.110
 prepare us from the precipitation we 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.120
 let's quickly go strong 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.009
 but we will come back here in 7 with much more 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.009
 we continue with live
