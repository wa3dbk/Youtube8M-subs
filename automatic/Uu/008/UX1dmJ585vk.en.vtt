00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
go ahead and look at the board right in

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.170 
go ahead and look at the board right in
there<00:00:55.410> there's<00:00:56.010> two<00:00:56.100> blue<00:00:56.640> connectors<00:00:57.149> right

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
there there's two blue connectors right

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.830 
there there's two blue connectors right
down<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:59.039> hopefully<00:00:59.670> can<00:01:00.090> semi<00:01:00.390> focus

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
down here that hopefully can semi focus

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.319 
down here that hopefully can semi focus
on<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.640> just<00:01:03.120> take<00:01:03.300> my

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on there they are and I just take my

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.649 
on there they are and I just take my
connector<00:01:04.070> which<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.100> labeled<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.630> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
connector which is labeled if you have a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.780 
connector which is labeled if you have a
hopefully<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> have<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> decent<00:01:08.010> case<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
hopefully you have a decent case the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
hopefully you have a decent case the
front<00:01:09.000> panel<00:01:09.240> connectors<00:01:09.570> labeled<00:01:09.930> USB<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
front panel connectors labeled USB and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
front panel connectors labeled USB and
there's<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.280> empty<00:01:11.670> slot<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> ten

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
there's an empty slot on one of the ten

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.530 
there's an empty slot on one of the ten
pins<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.860> that<00:01:14.460> empty<00:01:14.790> slot<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.390> has

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
pins on there that empty slot just has

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.390 
pins on there that empty slot just has
to<00:01:15.689> match<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.140> empty<00:01:16.439> slot<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> connector

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
to match the empty slot on the connector

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.630 
to match the empty slot on the connector
you're<00:01:17.549> plugging<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> I'll<00:01:20.460> look

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you're plugging it into so I'll look

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.270 
you're plugging it into so I'll look
down<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> I'll<00:01:22.110> slide<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
down here and I'll slide it right in

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.109 
down here and I'll slide it right in
that<00:01:23.400> connector<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:26.430> front<00:01:26.700> panel<00:01:26.850> USB

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that connector and your front panel USB

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.630 
that connector and your front panel USB
is<00:01:27.479> installed<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> same<00:01:28.799> concept<00:01:29.400> goes

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
is installed now the same concept goes

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.940 
is installed now the same concept goes
for<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:30.000> front<00:01:30.180> panel<00:01:30.390> audio<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.530> flip<00:01:31.770> to

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the exact same connector a lot of people

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.030 
the exact same connector a lot of people
confuse<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:49.530> HD

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
confuse that so I'm going to take my HD

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
confuse that so I'm going to take my HD
a<00:01:50.070> connector<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.030> there's<00:01:51.840> another<00:01:52.079> blank

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
a connector here there's another blank

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
a connector here there's another blank
slot<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.100> one<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> match<00:01:54.570> that

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
slot on this one and I got to match that

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
slot on this one and I got to match that
blank<00:01:55.110> slot<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.649> connector<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
blank slot with the connector in the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.649 
blank slot with the connector in the
motherboard<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:58.170> one<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.649> up<00:01:59.009> here<00:01:59.659> closer

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
motherboard this one is up here closer

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.240 
motherboard this one is up here closer
to<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.140> processor

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.960 

let's<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.369> ahead<00:02:06.430> and<00:02:06.609> get<00:02:06.670> it<00:02:06.820> in<00:02:06.909> there<00:02:08.970> and

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
let's go ahead and get it in there and

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.680 
let's go ahead and get it in there and
that<00:02:10.899> one's<00:02:11.050> in<00:02:11.170> there

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that one's in there

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.570 
that one's in there
we<00:02:13.690> have<00:02:13.840> successfully<00:02:14.500> configured<00:02:15.099> our

lot<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.069> people<00:02:18.370> are<00:02:18.550> lazy<00:02:18.819> about<00:02:19.209> this<00:02:19.420> and

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
lot of people are lazy about this and

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.970 
lot of people are lazy about this and
they<00:02:19.660> don't<00:02:19.780> even<00:02:19.840> connect<00:02:20.200> them<00:02:20.349> if<00:02:20.860> your

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
they don't even connect them if your

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.140 
they don't even connect them if your

front panel USB and your front panel
audio<00:02:22.510> aren't<00:02:22.720> working<00:02:23.080> that's<00:02:23.860> probably<00:02:24.129> why

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
audio aren't working that's probably why

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.360 
audio aren't working that's probably why
whoever<00:02:25.180> built<00:02:25.569> your<00:02:25.720> computer<00:02:26.230> or<00:02:26.440> when<00:02:27.340> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
whoever built your computer or when I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.800 
whoever built your computer or when I
first<00:02:27.670> built<00:02:27.849> my<00:02:27.940> computers<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.450> was<00:02:28.599> too

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
first built my computers I was too

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.050 
first built my computers I was too
nervous<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:30.099> mess<00:02:30.280> with<00:02:30.400> connectors<00:02:30.849> so<00:02:31.030> I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
nervous to mess with connectors so I

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.390 
nervous to mess with connectors so I
didn't<00:02:31.450> connect<00:02:31.690> them<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.220> usually<00:02:33.220> nine

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
didn't connect them so usually nine

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.740 
didn't connect them so usually nine
times<00:02:33.610> out<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.760> ten<00:02:33.970> that's<00:02:34.090> why<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:34.690> you

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
times out of ten that's why so if you

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.059 
times out of ten that's why so if you
just<00:02:34.930> open<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.230> up<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.500> just<00:02:35.590> see<00:02:35.799> if<00:02:35.860> there's

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
just open it up and just see if there's

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.890 
just open it up and just see if there's
anything<00:02:36.280> connected<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.849> it<00:02:36.970> am<00:02:37.450> i<00:02:37.540> solving<00:02:37.720> a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
anything connected to it am i solving a

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.390 
anything connected to it am i solving a
problem<00:02:38.049> so<00:02:38.739> that's<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:39.010> there<00:02:39.160> is<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.310> this

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
problem so that's all there is to this

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.920
