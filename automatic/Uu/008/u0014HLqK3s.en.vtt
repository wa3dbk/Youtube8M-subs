00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.080
 presented in the form of the lrx concept in 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.090
 2008 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.610
 the range rover evokes the debut 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.920
 career at the Paris World Cup in 2010 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.530
 since its marketing in the fall 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.960
 next success does not leave him anymore 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.120
 with more than 200,000 copies sold 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.219
 why do you describe her majestic 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.719
 form while just admire this 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.430
 is not a simple flu that was going 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.260
 keep me from trying the new range 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.850
 rover then evokes why I'm here 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.100
 doctors the man because I love this 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.560
 totally atypical vehicle at the lines 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.690
 totally futuristic also a grille 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.390
 really who stands out with respect to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.880
 his competitors a cash line which 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.970
 is really amazing with this roof that 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.559
 goes down the bitton color between the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.410
 roof and body is very nice 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.140
 also huge rims in 19 inches and 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.939
 and especially when you have a view of 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.490
 the back with this group béké this 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.899
 small antenna this diffuser with the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.639
 double exhaust 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.920
 I feel like I'm going to see the pq 

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:16.130
 turn into transformers and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.509
 frankly I find it nice with this 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.969
 vintage 2014 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.549
 the boks by new retro plus 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.979
 small new rims of a logo 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.049
 modernized at the site of the six 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.289
 previous finally on the seesaw 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.319
 the evokes appears below 1700 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.209
 kg inside improvements 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.490
 relate to the presence of a console 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.779
 sliding central and a door 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.849
 glasses in the pavilion 

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:43.219
 not to mention the evolution of the screen 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:45.499
 Touch the onboard computer and 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.779
 new colors the model of this essay 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.240
 has 4-cylinder turbo engine 

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:53.060
 Diesel two thousand one hundred and seventy 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:57.109
 nine cubic centimeters sd4 he develops 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.380
 190 horsepower 3500 rpm maximum speed 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:04.069
 reaches 195 km hour on circuit and 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:08.109
 goes from 0 to 100 km time in 8 seconds 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.109
 so what do you think about gerona 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.790
 well to use some details 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.220
 very practical will compare example the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.340
 storage here for the phone the 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.020
 keys or the portal remote control to 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.270
 note also different 4-4-1 modes that 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.190
 we can settle here with his commandos 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.340
 and so we have the mode to roll 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.890
 the rebels and gravel or snow 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:36.050
 the mud the ruts again the sand 1 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.670
 which also shows that before that it is 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
 evoke versatile and that it is done 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.830
 to get out of the roads and 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.870
 downtown the commodo here for the the 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.030
 robotic box very well placed and 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.170
 especially handy with those like 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.550
 oddo who turns to spend the 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.160
 speeds finally it's nice 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.230
 so use that is perfect 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.630
 here is the real novelty of this 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.960
 era the 9-speed automatic 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.570
 this automatic transmission zf 9hp 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.730
 is one of the first units to 9 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.010
 reports mounted on a standard vehicle 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.730
 this in the greatest respect of 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.010
 the environment 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.590
 because with the automatic transmission to 9 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.900
 reports and the active driveline system 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.090
 consumption record a decline 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.030
 according to the motorization 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.120
 reach 11.4 percent and 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.220
 co2 emissions reduced by 9.5 for 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.060
 hundred the mixed consumption of the range 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.600
 2014 starts at 4 liters nine to 100 km 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.230
 with co2 emissions of only 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.230
 129 grams per kilometer 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.420
 for the engine gearbox 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.220
 so it's a set that is very 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.660
 nice to use the diesel engine 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.250
 very torquey well come back 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.220
 staged also at the box level 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.110
 speeds that nine reports on this model 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.700
 so I can also choose the mode 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.590
 sport in this case I can also 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.730
 use the paddles while driving is worth 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.300
 clearly it is true that I have more 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:10.050
 use the automatic drive on 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.950
 this test of good times and this 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.960
 gearbox also allows 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.390
 to save quite a lot of 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.209
 boys so that's good and welcome 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.670
 also by the times that are running on this 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.610
 2014 model the driving aids of 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.230
 the time is strongly reinforced at 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.660
 seven new programs on 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.640
 perpendicular park allows to park the 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.700
 car well in the center of a square 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.530
 parking in battle the adaptive cloud 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.830
 control or cruise control 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.900
 adaptive includes the whoever attends the 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.270
 forward alert and intelligence 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.950
 emergency braking assistance 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.530
 traffic jams and braking 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.140
 smart emergency plus closing 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.690
 vehicles sensing and rivals this traffic 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.130
 detection to alert the driver in 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.370
 case of vehicles at the near 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.740
 finally the lane departure warning or 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.060
 the lane departure warning to 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.730
 conclude on security 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.050
 traffic sign recognition or 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.870
 sign recognition 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:10.050
 more original signage still the 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.230
 sensual wade depth detection of 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.230
 gay 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.820
 regarding the chassis part so I 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.460
 was very surprised by the direction of 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.860
 the time that allows to register very 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.930
 quickly the vehicle of hong kong 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.150
 ie that he finally there 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.060
 no rolling there are not two we did not 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.590
 no impression that tires work 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.640
 that he goes to bed as we say in the 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.890
 jargon which makes it very 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.330
 very precise directive is a little 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.070
 surprising at first because we have and we 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.570
 feels a bit abrupt 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.890
 but in the end it's almost like a 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.370
 sports car so it's more of a 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.050
 good point 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.420
 there is no roll 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:52.190
 untimely and the chassis then on 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.080
 his rims plus a 19 inch with a 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.640
 good ground connection behaves 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.270
 really well it fits very well 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.400
 super braking road and all that in the 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.620
 absolute comfort so I sign I 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.950
 valid and this one too I think I 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.210
 will keep it in my garage 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:08.750
 available as an option is present on this 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:11.630
 vehicle 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:13.880
 the active gear driveline is the 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.390
 first 4-wheel drive system at the 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.910
 request 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.770
 able to improve the dynamism of the 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.100
 vehicle and its consumption 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.470
 in addition the torque vectoring system the 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.290
 torque splitter strengthens the 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.360
 dynamism and security by redirecting 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.950
 the torque between each of the four wheels 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.740
 in case of understeer 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:38.330
 it's part of the active driveline is 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.550
 delivered in series on si4 and sd 4 with 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.070
 the pleasant automatic transmission option 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.630
 comfortable dynamic it becomes more 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.820
 respectful of the environment 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:49.190
 the evoke demonstrates today that it is 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.630
 not that a beautiful case he will put in 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.630
 four to satisfy you 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.310
 Range Rover range evokes from 33 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.310
 1200 euros
