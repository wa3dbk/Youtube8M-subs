00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.340
 general hello beer are such glasses with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.900
 magnifying glass for small 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.750
 repair for watch repair basically in 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.810
 principle 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.179
 let's say so type points are claimed as 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.510
 binocular for but also steppe on focal 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.140
 distance absolutely will not allow 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:42.180
 look at you through both glasses and say 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.520
 so through both glasses you are led to 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.520
 Sharpness are such cars 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.070
 ling fidelity moving 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.230
 just as well move here settled in 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:03.090
 principle without problems but have to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.000
 look of course at some one exactly 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:14.210
 backlit here is the second too naturally 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.650
 shines increase stated 20-fold 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.650
 I remember at the 20th multiple here does not smell 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:33.380
 plastic glass something is visible there 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:41.289
 now say ucs catch now 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.289
 still focus and will watch 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:54.380
 see something yes you can see 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.360
 something can be seen in principle to use 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.829
 can 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:04.569
 No problems arise with 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:10.780
 to use and not the price of course focal 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 the distance is minimal and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.620
 overpay for a second special lens 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.400
 it makes no sense so you can take it 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.920
 one 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.750
 well so for work for a smaller table not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.560
 will go all the more allow those who 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.970
 repairing a watch i would tell me very 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.920
 convenient yes grip it 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.220
 magnifying glass to hold like this 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.250
 here 's a girl and you look no 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.250
 problems all thanks to you all
