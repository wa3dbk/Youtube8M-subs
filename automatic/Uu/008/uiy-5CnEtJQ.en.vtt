00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.280 
little bit right I had to come in are a
little<00:04:01.790> bit<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> wide<00:04:02.329> side<00:04:02.629> but<00:04:03.079> it

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
little bit to the wide side but it

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.580 
little bit to the wide side but it
really<00:04:03.709> didn't<00:04:04.040> take<00:04:04.069> much<00:04:04.699> effort<00:04:04.940> at<00:04:05.239> all

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
really didn't take much effort at all
