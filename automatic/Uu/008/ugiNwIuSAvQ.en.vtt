00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119

over to the Floyd Rose tremolo standard
Floyd<00:02:00.329> Rose<00:02:00.479> tremolo<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.529> only<00:02:01.740> reason<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
Floyd Rose tremolo and the only reason I

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.559 
Floyd Rose tremolo and the only reason I
did<00:02:02.279> that<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.939> tremolo<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.420> had

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
did that was because this tremolo I had

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.179 
did that was because this tremolo I had
sitting<00:02:03.810> around<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.200> already<00:02:04.289> had<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.009> D
