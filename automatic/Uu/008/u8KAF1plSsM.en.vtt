um<00:00:50.960> from<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.320> minute<00:00:52.739> lead<00:00:53.160> I'd<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
um from the minute lead I'd to the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.130 
um from the minute lead I'd to the
minute<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.090> thought<00:00:57.660> in<00:00:57.809> my<00:00:57.930> head<00:00:58.079> was

please God don't make Clementine the
main<00:01:00.719> character<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.559> just<00:01:02.010> ruins<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.579> aspect

main character it just ruins the aspect
of<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> game<00:01:03.210> because<00:01:03.570> there<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.049> something

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of the game because there was something

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.010 
of the game because there was something
about<00:01:04.559> being<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.670> like<00:01:05.909> badass<00:01:06.510> character

all cuz of Lee's help she would have

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
all cuz of Lee's help she would have

been dead if it wasn't for Lee and Lee
was<00:01:20.729> already<00:01:21.060> half<00:01:21.299> dead<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.869> he<00:01:22.320> say<00:01:22.740> he<00:01:22.890> was

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
was already half dead I he say he was

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.149 
was already half dead I he say he was
undead<00:01:23.430> but<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.390> know<00:01:24.509> what<00:01:24.799> I'm<00:01:25.799> just<00:01:26.070> gonna

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
undead but you know what I'm just gonna

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.469 
undead but you know what I'm just gonna
move<00:01:26.340> past<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.970> still<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
move past that and I still think this

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
move past that and I still think this
game<00:01:27.659> could<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.990> potential<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.340> of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
game could have potential I think one of

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
game could have potential I think one of
the<00:01:29.490> keys<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:30.090> need<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.600> bring<00:01:30.900> somebody

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the keys is they need to bring somebody

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.319 
the keys is they need to bring somebody
besides<00:01:31.860> climb<00:01:32.280> back<00:01:32.520> into<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.939> game<00:01:33.150> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
besides climb back into this game and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
besides climb back into this game and
one<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> may<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.530> noticed<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.950> if<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
one thing you may have noticed is if you

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.560 
one thing you may have noticed is if you
look<00:01:35.400> at<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> screen<00:01:35.970> shots<00:01:36.240> I'll<00:01:36.540> have

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
type of cap and now this is where I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.710 
type of cap and now this is where I
think<00:01:49.259> what<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.520> was<00:01:50.520> thinking<00:01:50.970> was<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> little

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
think what I was thinking was a little

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.819 
think what I was thinking was a little
bit<00:01:51.810> different<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.140> everybody<00:01:52.380> else<00:01:52.649> is

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
bit different from everybody else is

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.590 
bit different from everybody else is
thinking<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.340> posting<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> think<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
thinking and posting you think in the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.109 
thinking and posting you think in the
comments<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.619> saw<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:55.950> screenshot<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
comments when I saw that screenshot I

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.880 
comments when I saw that screenshot I
almost<00:01:57.509> thought<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> hair<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.530> little<00:01:58.590> bit

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
almost thought the hair was a little bit

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.399 
almost thought the hair was a little bit
too<00:01:59.100> long<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.640> Glenn<00:02:00.149> who<00:02:00.750> everybody<00:02:01.259> would

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
too long to be Glenn who everybody would

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
too long to be Glenn who everybody would
say<00:02:01.530> aughts<00:02:01.770> clin<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.430> guess<00:02:02.610> Glenn's<00:02:02.909> coming

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
say aughts clin I guess Glenn's coming

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
say aughts clin I guess Glenn's coming
back<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.770> think<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.009> this<00:02:05.219> time<00:02:05.700> range

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
back I think with this time range

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.150 
back I think with this time range
Glenn's<00:02:06.899> obviously<00:02:07.590> already<00:02:07.740> back<00:02:08.129> in

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Glenn's obviously already back in

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.430 
Glenn's obviously already back in
Atlanta<00:02:08.789> he's<00:02:09.149> already<00:02:09.479> met<00:02:09.810> Rick<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> all

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
Atlanta he's already met Rick and all

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.170 
Atlanta he's already met Rick and all
that<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.009> don't<00:02:11.400> think<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.790> even<00:02:11.940> has

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
that and I don't think that even has

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.730 
that and I don't think that even has
potential<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.840> true

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
potential to be true

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.370 
potential to be true
so<00:02:13.860> i'm<00:02:14.190> gonna<00:02:14.460> say<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:14.760> kenny<00:02:15.240> honestly<00:02:15.900> if

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
so i'm gonna say it's kenny honestly if

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.290 
so i'm gonna say it's kenny honestly if
you<00:02:16.620> guys<00:02:16.830> saw<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.490> end<00:02:17.760> by<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.910> way<00:02:18.060> before

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
feeling this be one of those huge turns

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.550 
feeling this be one of those huge turns
I<00:02:47.850> anybody<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> saw<00:02:48.930> last<00:02:49.170> week<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
I anybody you saw last week in the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.590 
I anybody you saw last week in the
walking<00:02:49.950> dead<00:02:50.130> with<00:02:50.310> tyrese<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.450> was<00:02:51.570> a

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
walking dead with tyrese like that was a

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.070 
walking dead with tyrese like that was a
huge<00:02:52.110> turn<00:02:52.410> nobody<00:02:52.830> expected<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.490> so<00:02:53.700> I

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
huge turn nobody expected that so I

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.110 
huge turn nobody expected that so I
think<00:02:55.080> that's<00:02:55.730> something<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.910> they're

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
think that's something that they're

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.910 
think that's something that they're
gonna<00:02:57.270> try<00:02:57.630> to<00:02:57.690> do<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:57.990> don't<00:02:58.380> know<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.710> it

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
gonna try to do I don't know but it

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.730 
gonna try to do I don't know but it
seems<00:02:59.400> like<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.610> very<00:03:00.080> very<00:03:01.080> good<00:03:01.350> idea<00:03:01.500> to

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
seems like a very very good idea to

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.560 
seems like a very very good idea to
bring<00:03:01.860> Kenny<00:03:02.130> back<00:03:02.340> because<00:03:02.640> I<00:03:02.730> think<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.300> do

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
bring Kenny back because I think we do

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.560 
bring Kenny back because I think we do
need<00:03:03.600> another<00:03:04.490> kind<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.610> character<00:03:06.150> from<00:03:06.330> last

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
need another kind of character from last

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.590 
need another kind of character from last
season<00:03:06.960> to<00:03:07.430> bring<00:03:08.430> back<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:09.000> feeling<00:03:09.510> of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
season to bring back the feeling of

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.570 
season to bring back the feeling of
season<00:03:09.990> one<00:03:10.170> because<00:03:10.380> honestly<00:03:10.860> right<00:03:11.550> now

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
season one because honestly right now

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.640 
season one because honestly right now
they<00:03:12.060> have<00:03:12.210> very<00:03:12.540> little<00:03:12.780> potential<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.440> top

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
they have very little potential a top

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.340 
they have very little potential a top
season<00:03:14.130> one<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.600> know<00:03:15.690> what<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:15.960> still

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
season one but you know what I still

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.710 
season one but you know what I still
have<00:03:16.560> faith<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.100> them<00:03:17.280> because<00:03:17.880> season<00:03:18.510> one

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
have faith in them because season one

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.140 
have faith in them because season one
was<00:03:19.140> great<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.740> they<00:03:19.920> have<00:03:20.520> left<00:03:20.880> themselves

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
was great but they have left themselves

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.330 
was great but they have left themselves
a<00:03:21.480> lot<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.840> work<00:03:21.990> with<00:03:22.020> I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.070> killing

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
a lot to work with I think killing

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
a lot to work with I think killing
awfully<00:03:23.790> definitely<00:03:24.360> took<00:03:24.720> away<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> lot<00:03:25.470> of

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
awfully definitely took away a lot of

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.270 
awfully definitely took away a lot of
what<00:03:25.800> they<00:03:25.920> could<00:03:26.100> work<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:26.490> but<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.630> mean

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
what they could work with but I mean

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.420 
what they could work with but I mean
hopefully<00:03:30.590> they're<00:03:31.590> gonna<00:03:31.680> find<00:03:31.980> signed<00:03:32.280> a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
hopefully they're gonna find signed a

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.190 
hopefully they're gonna find signed a
deal<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.880> right<00:03:33.030> now<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.270> was<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.750> was<00:03:33.960> very

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
deal with it right now I was I was very

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.440 
deal with it right now I was I was very
disappointed<00:03:34.380> I<00:03:34.980> was<00:03:35.550> extremely<00:03:35.880> disciplined

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
disappointed I was extremely disciplined

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.310 
disappointed I was extremely disciplined
with<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.720> fact<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.930> we're<00:03:37.080> going<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> be

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
with the fact that we're going to be

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.490 
with the fact that we're going to be
controlling<00:03:37.890> Clementine<00:03:38.990> they're<00:03:39.990> talking<00:03:40.410> a

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
controlling Clementine they're talking a

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.980 
controlling Clementine they're talking a
little<00:03:40.620> bit<00:03:40.770> about<00:03:41.070> how<00:03:41.310> it's<00:03:41.580> going<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> be

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
little bit about how it's going to be

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.140 
little bit about how it's going to be
versus<00:03:42.990> man<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.980> Walker<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.850> I<00:03:44.910> think<00:03:45.030> there's

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
versus man and Walker so I think there's

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.780 
versus man and Walker so I think there's
gonna<00:03:45.210> be<00:03:45.360> a<00:03:45.420> lot<00:03:45.660> more<00:03:46.340> person<00:03:47.340> interaction

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
gonna be a lot more person interaction

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.160 
gonna be a lot more person interaction
which<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.120> kind<00:03:48.300> of<00:03:48.360> like<00:03:48.420> season<00:03:48.780> two<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.960> The

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
which is kind of like season two of The

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.570 
which is kind of like season two of The
Walking<00:03:49.320> day<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.650> noticed<00:03:49.890> there<00:03:50.070> was<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.250> lot<00:03:50.550> of

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
Walking day I noticed there was a lot of

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.730

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.250 
with that wouldn't be as happy but I'd
be<00:04:15.600> fine<00:04:16.049> with<00:04:16.080> that<00:04:16.320> I'm<00:04:16.859> still<00:04:17.670> just<00:04:18.260> going

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
easy telltale wouldn't make something

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.719 
easy telltale wouldn't make something
that<00:04:35.550> easy<00:04:35.880> for<00:04:36.479> you<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.660> figure<00:04:36.840> out<00:04:37.020> so

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
that easy for you to figure out so

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.249 
that easy for you to figure out so
there's<00:04:38.729> a<00:04:38.789> lot<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.479> different<00:04:39.570> things<00:04:39.960> that

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
there's a lot of different things that

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.900 
there's a lot of different things that
it<00:04:40.380> could<00:04:40.620> be<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.130> I'm<00:04:41.430> really<00:04:41.699> looking

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
it could be and I'm really looking

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.189 
it could be and I'm really looking
forward<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.810> seeing<00:04:43.100> who<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.310> it<00:04:44.580> is<00:04:44.759> i<00:04:45.060> don't

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
forward to seeing who that it is i don't

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.450 
forward to seeing who that it is i don't
i'm<00:04:46.199> not<00:04:46.229> sure<00:04:46.650> if<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.860> gonna<00:04:46.949> be<00:04:47.070> tied<00:04:47.280> in

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
i'm not sure if it's gonna be tied in

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.879 
i'm not sure if it's gonna be tied in
with<00:04:47.490> 400<00:04:48.030> days<00:04:48.180> because<00:04:49.080> i<00:04:49.110> did<00:04:49.470> in<00:04:49.620> my<00:04:49.710> last

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
with 400 days because i did in my last

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.650 
with 400 days because i did in my last
video<00:04:50.100> say<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.460> may<00:04:50.639> have<00:04:50.759> been<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.300> just

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
video say it may have been in that just

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.960 
video say it may have been in that just
I<00:04:51.840> don't<00:04:52.199> see<00:04:52.380> how<00:04:52.500> they<00:04:52.650> could<00:04:52.710> maybe<00:04:53.130> but

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
I don't see how they could maybe but

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.520 
I don't see how they could maybe but
maybe<00:04:54.240> not<00:04:54.389> because<00:04:54.750> I<00:04:54.900> think<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.199> they<00:04:55.320> put

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
maybe not because I think if they put
