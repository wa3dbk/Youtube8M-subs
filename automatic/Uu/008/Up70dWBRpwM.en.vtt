before an ultimate team only if I got

before an ultimate team only if I got
them<00:00:24.630> in<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> pack<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.289> quickly<00:00:25.500> threw

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
them in a pack and then quickly threw

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.290 
them in a pack and then quickly threw
them<00:00:26.039> on<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> player<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.820> never<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
them on a player but never on a

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.720 
them on a player but never on a
game-to-game<00:00:27.960> basis<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> want<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
game-to-game basis and what I want to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.820 
game-to-game basis and what I want to
test<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.359> if<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.929> actually<00:00:31.170> does<00:00:31.590> work

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
test out is if it actually does work

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.830 
test out is if it actually does work
well<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.430> player<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.450> fall<00:00:33.660> behind

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
well on a player and the fall behind

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.630 
well on a player and the fall behind
this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.320> basically<00:00:34.770> instead<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.550> out

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
this is basically instead of going out

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.549 
this is basically instead of going out
and<00:00:35.910> picking<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.390> very<00:00:36.630> expensive<00:00:36.930> inform

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
and picking up a very expensive inform

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.580 
and picking up a very expensive inform
you<00:00:38.070> can<00:00:38.100> maybe<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:38.820> 20k<00:00:39.540> over<00:00:39.840> 100<00:00:40.200> games<00:00:40.379> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
you can maybe use 20k over 100 games to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.229 
you can maybe use 20k over 100 games to
have<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.980> player<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.879> standout

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
have one player that is just a standout

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930 
have one player that is just a standout
player<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.379> mean<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:44.100> probably<00:00:44.730> not<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
player and I mean it's probably not the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.130 
player and I mean it's probably not the
best<00:00:45.059> idea<00:00:45.270> if<00:00:45.480> you're<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.899> cheap

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
best idea if you're going for cheap

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.619 
best idea if you're going for cheap
inform<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:46.829> let's<00:00:47.610> say<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:47.940> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.360> play<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
inform but let's say I want to play a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
inform but let's say I want to play a
352<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> have<00:00:49.649> two<00:00:49.860> strikers<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.370> five-star

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
352 and have two strikers with five-star

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
352 and have two strikers with five-star
skills<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.719> only<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.289> few<00:00:52.379> strikers<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
skills I do only see a few strikers that

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760 
skills I do only see a few strikers that
are<00:00:53.340> able<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> striker<00:00:55.289> position

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
are able to use on the striker position

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
name I could work as well but they were

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
name I could work as well but they were
none<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.350> link<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.739> apart<00:01:05.159> from

none of them would link up apart from

i'm<00:01:07.590> picking<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.070> forum<00:01:08.280> nema<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> very

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
i'm picking up in forum nema is very

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.789 
i'm picking up in forum nema is very
expensive<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.750> you'll<00:01:10.229> probably<00:01:10.530> make<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
expensive and you'll probably make a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.440 
expensive and you'll probably make a
last<00:01:11.130> once<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.490> sell<00:01:11.670> him<00:01:11.820> because<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
last once you sell him because of the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.080 
last once you sell him because of the
tax<00:01:12.750> so<00:01:13.500> instead<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> getting<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.610> loss<00:01:14.850> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
tax so instead of getting that loss on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.510 
tax so instead of getting that loss on
the<00:01:15.180> tax<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.900> which<00:01:16.080> might<00:01:16.409> be<00:01:16.439> 50k<00:01:16.979> something

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
the tax and which might be 50k something

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.390 
the tax and which might be 50k something
like<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.600> use<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> 20k<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.040> play<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
like that you can use the 20k to play a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.850 
like that you can use the 20k to play a
strike<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.850> 100<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.509> 100<00:01:21.960> games<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.799> doubt

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
strike on 100 and 100 games and i doubt

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.160 
strike on 100 and 100 games and i doubt
you<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.520> use<00:01:23.759> an<00:01:23.939> in-form<00:01:24.210> name<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> 100

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
you will use an in-form name of a 100

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.649 
you will use an in-form name of a 100
games<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.460> idea<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.000> test<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.479> out

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
games so the idea is to test this out

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.210 
games so the idea is to test this out
and<00:01:27.900> see<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> works<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.860> doesn't

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
and see if it works and if it doesn't

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
and see if it works and if it doesn't
all<00:01:29.369> right<00:01:29.670> but<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.420> works<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.869> might<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.320> a

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
all right but if it works it might be a

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.289 
all right but if it works it might be a
pretty<00:01:31.560> cool<00:01:31.829> idea<00:01:31.979> 20<00:01:32.340> mob<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> spots

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
pretty cool idea 20 mob a lot of spots

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
pretty cool idea 20 mob a lot of spots
when<00:01:33.540> spots<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.439> squad<00:01:34.740> when<00:01:34.920> you're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
when spots in your squad when you're

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.219 
when spots in your squad when you're
you're<00:01:35.369> building<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:35.729> squad<00:01:35.970> because

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
you're building a squad because

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.300 
you're building a squad because
sometimes<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.439> have<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.829> weak<00:01:38.040> player

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
sometimes you have that weak player

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
sometimes you have that weak player
which<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.670> think<00:01:38.790> he<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.509> fit<00:01:39.720> into<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
which you think he will not fit into the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
which you think he will not fit into the
squad<00:01:40.350> but<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.829> use<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.159> technique<00:01:41.490> you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
squad but if you use this technique you

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
squad but if you use this technique you
might<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.090> able<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> use<00:01:42.659> him<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.409> at<00:01:43.590> the

some all one good stats but I always

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.890 
some all one good stats but I always
feel<00:02:09.810> he's<00:02:10.129> whenever<00:02:11.129> he's<00:02:11.310> up<00:02:11.489> against<00:02:11.790> those

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
feel he's whenever he's up against those

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.800 
feel he's whenever he's up against those
your<00:02:13.439> typical<00:02:13.769> centre-backs<00:02:14.519> with<00:02:14.849> a<00:02:14.879> Kabul

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
your typical centre-backs with a Kabul

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.679 
your typical centre-backs with a Kabul
w/e<00:02:16.739> stuff<00:02:17.040> like<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.250> he's<00:02:17.879> just<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.299> quick

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
w/e stuff like that he's just not quick

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.449 
w/e stuff like that he's just not quick
enough<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:19.590> past<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:20.069> are<00:02:20.189> strong

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
enough to get past them are strong

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.940 
enough to get past them are strong
enough<00:02:20.730> so<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.079> thing<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.349> think<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.739> if

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
enough so the the thing I think is if

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.350 
enough so the the thing I think is if
you<00:02:23.069> apply<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.430> card<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.939> will<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.209> some
