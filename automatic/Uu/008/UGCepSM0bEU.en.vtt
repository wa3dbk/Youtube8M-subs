00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
I review but I don't know just does for

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.669 
I review but I don't know just does for
me

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
me

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.509 
me
and<00:02:09.009> if<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.879> press<00:02:10.119> B<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:10.720> then<00:02:10.929> down<00:02:11.680> you'll

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
and if you press B and then down you'll

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.030 
and if you press B and then down you'll
kind<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:12.970> do<00:02:13.599> like<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> mid-air<00:02:14.409> kick<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
kind of do like a mid-air kick and

kind of do like a mid-air kick and
you'll<00:02:15.689> stomp<00:02:16.689> on<00:02:16.870> stuff<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.319> can<00:02:17.500> crush

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
you'll stomp on stuff and you can crush

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.220 
you'll stomp on stuff and you can crush
some<00:02:17.950> stuff<00:02:19.110> here<00:02:20.110> the<00:02:20.260> magician<00:02:20.739> appears

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
some stuff here the magician appears

crouch<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.530> maybe<00:02:23.799> you'll<00:02:24.010> find<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
crouch and maybe you'll find the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.429 
crouch and maybe you'll find the
solution<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.030> I'll<00:02:25.209> show<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.540> shows<00:02:26.200> down

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
solution and I'll show is shows down

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:26.819 
solution and I'll show is shows down
there

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
Hunter we already have hunter but it's

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.070 
Hunter we already have hunter but it's
good<00:03:53.270> to<00:03:53.390> have<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:53.540> a<00:03:53.720> piece<00:03:53.930> of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
good to have like a piece of

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.580 
good to have like a piece of
construction<00:03:54.770> paper<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:55.520> piece<00:03:55.790> of<00:03:55.940> fabric

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
construction paper a piece of fabric

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.960 
construction paper a piece of fabric
because<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.620> doesn't<00:03:58.010> always<00:03:58.130> work<00:03:58.340> out<00:03:58.670> just

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
because it doesn't always work out just

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:59.380 
because it doesn't always work out just
fine

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
fine

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.050 
fine
but<00:03:59.959> anyway<00:04:00.200> I<00:04:00.230> guess<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:00.830> my<00:04:01.370> background<00:04:01.670> it

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
but anyway I guess that my background it

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.590 
but anyway I guess that my background it
takes<00:04:02.239> is<00:04:02.390> blue<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:03.080> let's<00:04:03.350> do<00:04:03.980> that<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:08.239> there

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
takes is blue so let's do that and there

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.690 
takes is blue so let's do that and there
we<00:04:08.690> go<00:04:08.810> 100%<00:04:09.260> blue<00:04:09.890> we<00:04:10.370> get<00:04:10.520> a<00:04:10.550> one-off<00:04:12.700> that's

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
we go 100% blue we get a one-off that's

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.400 
we go 100% blue we get a one-off that's
nice<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:16.329> generally<00:04:17.329> the<00:04:17.450> first<00:04:17.600> two<00:04:17.900> levels

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
nice and generally the first two levels

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.380 
nice and generally the first two levels
in<00:04:18.590> world<00:04:18.829> are<00:04:19.130> you<00:04:19.760> know<00:04:19.850> like<00:04:20.000> regular
