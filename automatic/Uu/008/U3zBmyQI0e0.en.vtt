00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.299
 and hello to all that has it all here on there 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:14.619
 always live from london to 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.840
 the European finals of the call of duty 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.640
 stubble the chipset fast company 2 in 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.169
 there a player of the team 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.689
 Unfortunately, this was unfortunately 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:24.880
 on the score of 3-0 against hyper games 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.500
 introduce yourself and present team so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.180
 it's the all of me it's in there plays 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.130
 for the orks team so that makes 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.779
 now a month that I have for them my 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 team is composed of picsou or warren 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.520
 and for these qualities zip 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.780
 so that's you then as I said 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.450
 previously you lost on the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.649
 score of 3 to 0 you played on the alfa 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.510
 it's not on the merry-go-round 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.379
 do you think that has benefited you 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.670
 or not so we basic we said 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.559
 a station face to face as at the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.629
 normal samoans avatange and we know 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.339
 that he is old they are not necessarily 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.379
 confident when he starts to lose so 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.489
 also dedicate a trash talk here and there 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.480
 it'll put them even deeper on 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.159
 will have the opportunity to hear that 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.629
 in the boxes we hear not so 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.769
 we are in Tangier but 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.879
 unfortunately we did not manage to 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.810
 take the adventure of the blow we had 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.040
 not the normal shock contract then you 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.780
 played with zip you took it 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.420
 two days ago is what you can 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.070
 back a bit on this episode then 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 in fact we did a qual with love 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.829
 you so a basic manager who plays at 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.439
 the time hÃ´ptal time we managed to 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.980
 qualify by a miracle in the end he had 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.780
 Frau and medical grains 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.880
 and in the hospital a week they result 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.470
 unfortunately we already have xix 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.180
 since last minute he had 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.340
 stopped about two months ago the end 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.720
 of the assault is there and that's the he has 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.070
 arrested we did it back three 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.150
 days my unfortunately it's not good 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 very well spent poor thing it's not 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.040
 necessarily his fault but here's what 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.900
 it's the game so now for you 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.400
 is over is what your team has 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.630
 the will to continue together or is 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.080
 what now everyone to do his 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.790
 road on his side so finally must 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.180
 know that we in full roster we have 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.740
 colors 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.320
 so he's a young player he's 17 years old 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.390
 it's super hot at the cost of continuing 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.040
 with the t4 warren piqthiu month or 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.080
 alliance so we'll do it and that's the 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.100
 goal can be upset we know 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.820
 we can do it and give it to them 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.530
 a very big level 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.810
 the other age artwork and we lost a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.740
 point 36 work so with katie moore that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.600
 I think we could have won star 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.430
 game on will see let it be 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.140
 other revenge we hope and we will 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.550
 give everything what in any case thank you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.780
 a lot to you I'm just going to put a 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.880
 last check we do not have 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.200
 still asked you who for the first 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.280
 times on a European-type event 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.470
 what did you spend a little bit 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.850
 of the relative management mood 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.740
 to the French lan who are we going to say a 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.910
 little more artisanal even if it's not 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.190
 necessarily the term but here it is 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.180
 dylan that are less structured than 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.510
 what did you think about this 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.150
 event it's just crazy that just 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.570
 see the mainstage leave his scarves 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.870
 and it's amazing not to have 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.690
 noted country and age paid for me 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.300
 it lucid but even if we lost against 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.370
 age and I say good to go it's the 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.810
 top of the European level here is the 24 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.950
 best teams so it seems to me 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 that's nothing to see one of them 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.400
 French completely to have in all 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.810
 case thank you very much to you illzach it was 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.870
 go there for decerto france at any 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.870
 hour
