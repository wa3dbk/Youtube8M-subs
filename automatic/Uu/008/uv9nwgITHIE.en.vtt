00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.940 
inexpensive and you get quite a few of
them<00:05:03.550> so<00:05:04.510> what<00:05:04.660> we're<00:05:04.780> going<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.020> do<00:05:05.169> first<00:05:05.200> is

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
them so what we're going to do first is

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.030 
them so what we're going to do first is
place<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.480> dry<00:05:07.720> surface<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:08.530> then

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
place it on the dry surface and then

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.430 
place it on the dry surface and then
we're<00:05:09.160> going<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.310> take<00:05:09.550> a<00:05:09.730> teaspoon<00:05:10.240> of<00:05:10.660> our

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
we're going to take a teaspoon of our

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.350 
we're going to take a teaspoon of our
shrimp<00:05:11.830> mixture<00:05:12.010> that<00:05:12.550> we<00:05:12.700> just<00:05:12.880> fry<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.240> up

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
shrimp mixture that we just fry it up

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.150 
shrimp mixture that we just fry it up
and<00:05:13.630> allow<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.900> cool<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.500> the<00:05:14.620> fridge<00:05:14.650> for<00:05:15.100> a

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
and allow to cool in the fridge for a

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.250 
and allow to cool in the fridge for a
few<00:05:15.220> minutes<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:15.970> then<00:05:16.030> we're<00:05:17.020> going<00:05:17.140> to

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
few minutes and then we're going to

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.740 
few minutes and then we're going to
place<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.490> and<00:05:18.490> about<00:05:18.820> the<00:05:19.030> center

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
place it and about the center

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.710 
place it and about the center
and<00:05:19.980> either<00:05:20.980> use<00:05:21.340> your<00:05:21.520> fingers<00:05:21.880> or<00:05:22.210> pastry

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
and either use your fingers or pastry

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.550 
and either use your fingers or pastry
brush<00:05:22.900> brush<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.980> moisten<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.640> edges<00:05:25.060> and

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
brush brush to moisten the edges and

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.240 
brush brush to moisten the edges and
then<00:05:26.560> we'll<00:05:26.740> just<00:05:26.920> fold<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.400> over<00:05:29.130> keeping<00:05:30.130> all

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
then we'll just fold it over keeping all

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.180 
then we'll just fold it over keeping all
of<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.610> filling<00:05:30.970> in<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.180> center<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:32.190> push

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
of the filling in the center and push

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.440 
of the filling in the center and push
the<00:05:33.400> edges<00:05:33.550> together<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.970> then<00:05:36.970> what<00:05:37.120> I<00:05:37.150> did

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
the edges together and then what I did

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.810 
the edges together and then what I did
with<00:05:37.660> the<00:05:37.690> last<00:05:37.960> ones<00:05:38.290> as<00:05:38.470> I<00:05:38.590> just<00:05:38.860> stood<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.700> up

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
with the last ones as I just stood it up

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.050 
with the last ones as I just stood it up
like<00:05:40.030> this<00:05:40.240> and<00:05:40.540> then<00:05:40.900> kind<00:05:41.830> of<00:05:42.070> folded<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:42.850> and

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
like this and then kind of folded it and

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.480 
like this and then kind of folded it and
scrunched<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.140> so<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.830> looks<00:05:45.070> like<00:05:45.280> a

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
scrunched it so that it looks like a

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.360 
scrunched it so that it looks like a
professional<00:05:46.000> dumpling<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:47.340> after<00:05:48.340> I

just bought this stuff it also the
recipe<00:06:54.380> calls<00:06:55.040> for<00:06:55.220> some<00:06:55.670> japanese<00:06:56.330> form<00:06:56.720> but

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
recipe calls for some japanese form but

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.880 
recipe calls for some japanese form but
at<00:06:57.680> an<00:06:57.830> orphanage<00:06:58.250> a<00:06:59.230> little<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.470> the<00:07:00.500> bottom

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
at an orphanage a little to the bottom

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.120 
at an orphanage a little to the bottom
and<00:07:01.870> then<00:07:02.870> just<00:07:03.170> give<00:07:03.380> it<00:07:03.560> a<00:07:03.620> little<00:07:03.770> bit<00:07:04.010> of

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:04.130 
and then just give it a little bit of

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.310 
and then just give it a little bit of
added<00:07:04.340> flavor<00:07:04.760> coming<00:07:05.690> cover<00:07:05.990> it<00:07:06.140> for

probably about a couple minutes and then

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.910 
probably about a couple minutes and then
maybe<00:07:09.800> wait<00:07:10.100> for<00:07:10.520> the<00:07:11.270> liquid<00:07:11.570> resolve<00:07:12.200> and<00:07:12.770> I

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:12.920 
maybe wait for the liquid resolve and I

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.320 
maybe wait for the liquid resolve and I
will<00:07:13.070> pull<00:07:13.250> them<00:07:13.370> off<00:07:13.490> so<00:07:14.030> now<00:07:14.150> we're<00:07:14.300> just
