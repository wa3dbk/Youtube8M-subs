00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.740
 today's girls will be on this blush 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 loren the lute bb magik e come 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.000
 to put the two of them everywhere I can't hear 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.469
 nothing with my minicars though 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.420
 they put up a written live because 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:24.000
 now it's so fashionable it's a blush in 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.090
 silicone bar gel that presents itself already 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.760
 pink 3 sparite only exists in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.520
 this color is in fact a type of 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.739
 class however is already present in 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.719
 trade for example in the next 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.850
 review I also talk to you in this other one not 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.920
 I show that the smashbox is like 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.680
 it is a universal color precisely because 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.079
 all girls are fine 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.300
 both the very light and the dark ones 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.300
 profazio to see or on the left cheek 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:59.160
 applies from this color will be it 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.260
 will never be 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.369
 and very easy because he applied it 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.740
 however, their error proof is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.810
 possible to err 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.939
 we see us now I see it all 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.100
 face but less bad is really easy 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.659
 you don't have to run you know very often 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 like the whole ones the dear one must 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.080
 run a little where they dry up 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.490
 this is some time before 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.189
 then get the idea in time for 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.420
 work it obviously if you don't have to 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.880
 create a shape that I like you can 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.119
 always take your brush e 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.570
 work it better and from there more shape more 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.850
 dimension inside there are here ie 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.049
 beautiful of those products indeed 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.030
 universal and the price of 14 euros 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.220
 result is actually quite light 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.909
 curiously one thing I've noticed 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.110
 these blush with these products see 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 see written about the cuts that schools that 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 not too bright ones is something that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.939
 I never explained why though 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.210
 on several the octave not too much indeed 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.490
 regarding the duration and half 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 enough however only on the 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.250
 in the mid-afternoon, he still knows later 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.679
 in the evening they begin to put more of mine 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 so vote for this is the result of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.140
 drums six and a half from six old 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.610
 because it's always nice to see me 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.900
 liked the arms a little bit though 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.270
 in the end it is not that I have ever remained 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.770
 enthusiastic that you still don't notice them 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.459
 many but above all of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.800
 white complexion is seen or just a little 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.560
 of rose however it is not this bouquet of 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.810
 chihuaha u20 chapter, however, is not bad 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.810
 it's not worth girls
