00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 nobody expected the movie but how 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.759
 ant a filming has two cells 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.770
 absurd post-credits but you 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.990
 maybe I did not understand then stay there 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.860
 that I'll explain the post-credit scene 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.860
 of ant man 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.130
 I want to ask you to help the club up. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.390
 the fish will reach to April patron 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 you still keep the club 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.629
 live cinema and also to enjoy a 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.670
 Follow me on twitter 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.989
 finally everything appears on the screen 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.640
 to be my friend did not shoot for 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.230
 follow firsthand what I think 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.820
 that the movies, let's talk about the scene 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.019
 post-credits ant man 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.519
 the first happy scene that has stayed 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.500
 very clear to everyone in the comics 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.739
 we basically follow the king 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.420
 team and at night it is the turn of the original that 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.820
 are in the movie disappears in a flashback 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.070
 but in the comics the requiem uses that 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.809
 clothes and adnet wears that yellow wave 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.150
 that we see at the end of the movie 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.710
 basically they did was the magpie 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.390
 rank same characteristics 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.250
 transfer to scotland that we 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.320
 comics is also one and family is the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.880
 secondly, if I am not mistaken, the third 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.130
 ant correct me in the comments by 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.590
 favor and transfer the wasp to or 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.939
 bandai who is the daughter of the ranking then 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.280
 basically the second post-credit scene 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.560
 It's something I've always wanted and I 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.119
 I 've always been a big fan of the movie and the wasp 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.220
 and one thing I wanted sales from 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.530
 mark long time I got all over him 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.299
 wonderful and on the same time 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.400
 the talin disk completely faithful to 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.980
 comics and I was very happy 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.900
 the second scene is already a program connection 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.700
 which will probably work 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.040
 basically as avengers 3 will have 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.930
 everyone he basically Captain 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.300
 america has found a book and he is with 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.860
 hawk and they need someone there who 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.110
 I do not remember exactly what it is. 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.670
 strong is not that he appeared he needs to 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 someone who understands technology or something 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 of the type they can not rely on one of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.490
 iron then we already notice a 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.320
 conflict between the captain and the 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.420
 iron and then the hawk spoke I know a 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.340
 another guy and that's why at the end of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.560
 himself, he's looking for a 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.320
 ant man and that's why the galley 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.299
 passes from mouth to mouth to get the gold 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.659
 black the hawk looking for 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.489
 he 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:12.349
 and it is precisely because of this then 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.970
 I hope you have understood that 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.110
 If you have any doubt, leave it. 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.879
