with<00:00:32.630> this<00:00:32.810> urban<00:00:33.230> art<00:00:33.350> concept<00:00:33.890> one<00:00:34.190> of<00:00:34.340> the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
with this urban art concept one of the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.420 
with this urban art concept one of the
concepts<00:00:35.210> was<00:00:35.470> outdoor<00:00:36.470> spaces<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.100> Gardens

concepts was outdoor spaces and Gardens
and<00:00:37.580> what<00:00:37.700> I<00:00:37.730> loved<00:00:38.000> about<00:00:38.150> it<00:00:38.300> was<00:00:38.450> they<00:00:39.170> were

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
and what I loved about it was they were

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.290 
and what I loved about it was they were
crocheting<00:00:39.830> things<00:00:40.250> in<00:00:40.520> public<00:00:40.910> spaces<00:00:41.120> to

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
crocheting things in public spaces to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.750 
crocheting things in public spaces to
make<00:00:41.480> it<00:00:41.600> look<00:00:41.720> like<00:00:41.810> flowers<00:00:42.080> to<00:00:43.010> cover<00:00:43.250> trees

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
make it look like flowers to cover trees

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.600 
make it look like flowers to cover trees
to<00:00:44.330> cover<00:00:44.570> buses<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:45.650> a<00:00:46.010> whole<00:00:46.190> new<00:00:46.340> kind<00:00:46.520> of

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
to cover buses it's a whole new kind of

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.920 
to cover buses it's a whole new kind of
art<00:00:46.850> that's<00:00:47.030> out

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.020 

especially<00:00:54.930> disruptive

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
especially disruptive

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.330 
especially disruptive
constructions

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
constructions

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.509 
constructions
you<00:00:59.550> do<00:00:59.700> basically

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
you do basically

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:09.219 
you do basically
disruption

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.459 

the<00:01:10.070> idea<00:01:10.369> of<00:01:10.430> punk<00:01:10.789> graffiti<00:01:11.390> structure<00:01:12.200> it's

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:12.469 
the idea of punk graffiti structure it's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.620 
the idea of punk graffiti structure it's
really<00:01:12.710> about<00:01:12.860> having<00:01:13.159> form<00:01:13.640> shape<00:01:13.969> function

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
really about having form shape function

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.539 
really about having form shape function
something<00:01:15.259> that<00:01:15.380> has<00:01:15.469> a<00:01:15.500> raw<00:01:15.740> energy<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.430> as

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
something that has a raw energy to it as

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.779 
something that has a raw energy to it as
well

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.359 

we<00:01:25.789> got<00:01:26.000> inspiration<00:01:26.869> from<00:01:27.369> architecture

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
we got inspiration from architecture

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.249 
we got inspiration from architecture
because<00:01:28.880> all<00:01:29.060> these<00:01:29.179> different<00:01:29.630> angles

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
because all these different angles

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.399 
because all these different angles
I<00:01:30.289> loved<00:01:31.060> reflection<00:01:32.060> from<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> buildings<00:01:32.929> so

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
I loved reflection from the buildings so

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.590 
I loved reflection from the buildings so
when<00:01:33.679> the<00:01:33.799> sunlight<00:01:34.189> hitting<00:01:34.579> or<00:01:35.210> when<00:01:35.509> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
when the sunlight hitting or when the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.690 
when the sunlight hitting or when the
Sun<00:01:35.840> is<00:01:35.990> going<00:01:36.200> down<00:01:36.319> you<00:01:36.950> see<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.490> lot<00:01:37.670> of

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
Sun is going down you see a lot of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.980 
Sun is going down you see a lot of
reflections<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.450> just<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:38.750> totally

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
reflections and that just like totally

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
reflections and that just like totally
inspired<00:01:39.530> me<00:01:39.649> with<00:01:39.710> color

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.850 

the<00:01:48.090> idea<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> cityscapes<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.409> building's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the idea of cityscapes the building's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440 
the idea of cityscapes the building's
actually<00:01:50.040> kind<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.549> fade<00:01:50.790> away<00:01:51.090> they<00:01:51.299> don't

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
actually kind of fade away they don't

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
actually kind of fade away they don't
end<00:01:51.689> they<00:01:51.930> created<00:01:52.320> multiple<00:01:52.530> reflux<00:01:53.310> of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
end they created multiple reflux of

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.690 
end they created multiple reflux of
tones<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.630> gradations<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.500> colors<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.580> we

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tones and gradations of colors and so we

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
tones and gradations of colors and so we
took<00:01:56.880> those<00:01:57.090> ideas<00:01:57.149> into<00:01:58.110> creating<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> looks

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
took those ideas into creating the looks

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.740 
took those ideas into creating the looks
that<00:01:59.220> we<00:01:59.430> created<00:01:59.790> both<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.210> color<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that we created both in color and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.570 
that we created both in color and
texture<00:02:06.439> using<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.500> stencil<00:02:07.710> art<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.220> salon

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
texture using a stencil art in the salon

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.850 
texture using a stencil art in the salon
is<00:02:08.940> something<00:02:09.720> created<00:02:10.110> from<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> urban

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
is something created from the urban

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.979 
is something created from the urban
cities<00:02:11.220> where<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.849> kids<00:02:12.120> are<00:02:12.239> like<00:02:12.450> sketching

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
cities where the kids are like sketching

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.290 
cities where the kids are like sketching
images<00:02:13.890> or<00:02:14.099> patterns<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.819> their<00:02:14.970> side<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.239> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
images or patterns on their side of the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.750 
images or patterns on their side of the
head<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> salon<00:02:17.040> what<00:02:17.430> we've<00:02:17.580> been

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
head and in the salon what we've been

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.850 
head and in the salon what we've been
doing<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.120> using<00:02:18.150> hair<00:02:18.660> color<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.500> it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
doing is using hair color I think it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.440 
doing is using hair color I think it's
something<00:02:20.040> cool<00:02:20.519> I<00:02:20.760> think<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.150> something

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
something cool I think is something

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.790 
something cool I think is something
that's<00:02:21.630> happening<00:02:22.019> it's<00:02:22.890> happening<00:02:23.190> now

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.270 

light<00:02:31.800> writing<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.459> a<00:02:32.760> form<00:02:32.819> of<00:02:33.330> art<00:02:33.930> where<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
light writing is a form of art where the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.550 
light writing is a form of art where the
photography<00:02:35.910> is<00:02:36.060> capturing<00:02:36.600> traces<00:02:37.260> and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
photography is capturing traces and

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.970 
photography is capturing traces and
trails<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.370> light<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.540> photo<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.900> taken

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
trails of light as the photo is taken

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.559 
trails of light as the photo is taken
light<00:02:40.980> writing<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:41.700> fun<00:02:42.000> for<00:02:42.030> somebody

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
light writing can be fun for somebody

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:43.790 
light writing can be fun for somebody
working<00:02:42.780> behind<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.170> chair<00:02:43.380> every<00:02:43.590> day

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
working behind the chair every day

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.070 
working behind the chair every day
because<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:45.000> can<00:02:45.180> take<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.569> inspiration

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
because they can take the inspiration

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.330 
because they can take the inspiration
from<00:02:46.200> these<00:02:46.350> bold<00:02:46.590> vivid<00:02:46.920> colors<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
from these bold vivid colors and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.920 
from these bold vivid colors and
depending<00:02:47.819> on<00:02:47.910> how<00:02:48.030> they<00:02:48.180> place<00:02:48.450> it<00:02:48.660> on<00:02:48.810> their

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
depending on how they place it on their

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.150 
depending on how they place it on their
clients<00:02:49.290> hair<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.650> can<00:02:49.770> actually<00:02:49.950> be

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
clients hair it can actually be

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.209 
clients hair it can actually be
something<00:02:50.370> that's<00:02:50.580> very<00:02:50.730> wearable
