00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.330
 Psst 3100 SG 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.419
 the award-winning plates which system from MÃ¶rfelden 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:14.419
 for the cost-saving panels cut in the 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.650
 the total weight is approx 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.949
 17 kilograms including the two seemed halves of the 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:22.390
 basic equipment 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.109
 This achieves an intersection of 3100 millimeters 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.970
 the rail is fast in the middle and no one was easy 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.429
 for better transport 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.700
 or airplane cuts 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.970
 an absolutely straight cut is guaranteed over the entire distance 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.500
 Christoph the material 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.640
 even with dusty Robert 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.310
 a festive thrill is not dead 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.890
 Moscow's facilities on the underside of the rails ensure a secure hold 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.890
 The complete package also includes a vacuum cleaner from Merfeld 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.290
 the speed of 2600 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.310
 up to 5200 revolutions per minute 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.550
 is set directly on the engine for the same sheet 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.080
 the adjustment range for the cutting depth is 2 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.890
 up to 45 millimeters 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 at the stationary with 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050
 Now device lets you adjust the feed speed world 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 the rest of the work is at the touch of a button 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.710
 the consequences electronics ensures the gentle start and keeps the bird life 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.300
 and speed 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.300
 which is constant from the load 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.530
 Thanks to the notorious drive, the operator does not have to leave his place 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.870
 the saw works by itself 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.700
 The TSS 3100 St has an innovative saw blade full cover 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.530
 This safety measure also favors the highly effective extraction system 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.360
 A large part of the material costs incurred is covered by the extraction 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.920
 Plant removed 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 this is completely integrated into the rail 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 the fast passage Erfurt also on button 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.139
 faster are bursting change 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.139
 thanks to playful locking 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.610
 The fields of application for this universal plate sawing system are so 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.219
 as diverse as the processed materials 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.569
 Layer fabric panels Gibbs was saying Bathen Plexiglas composites 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:29.669
 plastics 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.479
 this high flexibility and mobility 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:36.199
 comes the carpenter and carpenter but also the facades and exhibition builders 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.199
 opposite 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.519
 the PSS is also ideal for mineral plates 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.579
 as they occur in drywall or facade construction 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.599
 right here, a well-functioning suction is important 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.769
 for a wide range of applications Otmar cases a new one 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.769
 Diamond saw square with gate stand time developed 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.129
 the energy chain adapts very well to the respective conditions of use 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.069
 on 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.849
 if the entire line at length of 3300 meters for special sizes not 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:15.709
 sufficient 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.709
 is simply set after 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:23.869
 the aftermath attack secures a transitional home in the extension 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:24.959
 Followed 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.459
 as an optional accessory but also rail essays are available 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:30.849
 along with the divisible base element 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:34.769
 Total length of less than 3000 to 100 mm result 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.219
 to the safety standards Sommerfeld circular saws belongs Dr 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.409
 he is first pushed back when immersing in the material 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:48.029
 Then with the beginning of feed immediately after the saw blade in the cut 

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:51.029
 immerse 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.619
 the 4 x 1 position secures with a slightly offset starting point 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:04.739
 from the first millimeter to a clean cut edge 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.409
 the cut is continuous breakout free 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:33.409
 As an accessory, there are various different saw blades and newcomers 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.559
 available 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.559
 so the accessory list is quite short 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:46.800
 the PSS 3100 si is already conceptually universal 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.680
 applications 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.419
