00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
do is we can take the p2000 and lay it

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.869 
do is we can take the p2000 and lay it
on<00:04:13.390> top<00:04:13.450> of<00:04:13.870> the<00:04:14.019> gravel<00:04:14.230> the<00:04:14.709> wpr<00:04:15.400> is<00:04:15.519> perfect

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
on top of the gravel the wpr is perfect

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.789 
on top of the gravel the wpr is perfect
for<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.150> because<00:04:16.180> of<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:16.989> nice<00:04:17.139> white<00:04:17.410> woven

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
for that because of a nice white woven

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.879 
for that because of a nice white woven
fabric<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.729> is<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.150> skin<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.079> p2000<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.739> very

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
fabric that is the skin of p2000 is very

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:22.650 
fabric that is the skin of p2000 is very
tough<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.280> durable<00:04:21.489> so<00:04:22.240> if<00:04:22.360> you're<00:04:22.510> down

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
tough and durable so if you're down

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.990 
tough and durable so if you're down
there<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.470> can<00:04:23.650> crawl<00:04:23.889> over<00:04:24.220> top<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:24.849> you

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
there you can crawl over top but you

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.390 
there you can crawl over top but you
walk<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.539> it<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.780> won't<00:04:25.960> damage<00:04:26.139> p2000<00:04:27.160> and

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
walk on it you won't damage p2000 and

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.969 
walk on it you won't damage p2000 and
it's<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.700> perfect<00:04:28.060> insulator<00:04:28.360> for<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.800> crawl

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
it's a perfect insulator for the crawl

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.160 
it's a perfect insulator for the crawl
