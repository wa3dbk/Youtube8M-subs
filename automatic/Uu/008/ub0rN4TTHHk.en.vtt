00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 welcome to the tutorials for that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 quick rye ice cream is the ingredients imaginable 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.519
 easy here is my fast and easy 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
 with it also his version and therefore also 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.250
 not so easy a liter less 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.949
 as a choice and whether I think 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.029
 measure about three tablespoons much 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.680
 april about that one can still 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 readjust for color and taste 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.039
 You should test it like that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.180
 would like to 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.519
 and yes we just try it 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.650
 remains for this we also give equal that 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.900
 we are protected there now 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.700
 then I have this festive 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.989
 market top 4 off the market 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.090
 not have to see because the buy 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.379
 should what you want at the same time 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.850
 Down oh that a little bit 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 can watch then is nice and soft 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.899
 and creamy you see this here and me 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.340
 think that is also a good consistency 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.530
 It should never be melted 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 but be a bit on the weight 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.090
 so that afterwards on the matchup 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.680
 exuberantly mixed with the world 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.260
 we make optimism 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.160
 Just a little something on it and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 stir the whole thing with the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.950
 kitchen machine and max pay afterwards 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.479
 still scarce in delhi 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.799
 that's what the whole thing could look like 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.570
 have now a spoon master 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.840
 a tablespoon more is done 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.460
 So now about four to four and a half me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580
 believe her four tablespoons of matscher in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.619
 the tenant vanillaeis in it that the 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.210
 all a bit creamy now 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.680
 softened and therefore you should 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 it in front of the patient again briefly in the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.460
 Freezer just make it so 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.930
 again a little tighter is on 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.759
 if it has become too fluid for you 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
 while listening or thawing 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.700
 and then it could not be too long again 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.180
 One go again ricocheting 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 is or ball which makes moderate 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.070
 work properly feed 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.570
 I can not say anything because I am 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.600
 The whole thing would like to have us right away 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.729

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.909
