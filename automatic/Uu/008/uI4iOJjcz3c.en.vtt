like the nicest packaging I've ever seen

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.850 
like the nicest packaging I've ever seen
for<00:02:45.440> a<00:02:45.500> sample<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.130> looks<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:47.390> then

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
for a sample it looks like this and then

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.920 
for a sample it looks like this and then
inside<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.550> actual<00:02:50.150> product<00:02:50.510> itself<00:02:50.750> it

pronounce it I took French for five
years<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.050> should<00:03:03.320> be<00:03:03.440> able<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.680> pronounce<00:03:03.860> it

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
years I should be able to pronounce it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.310

guard<00:04:50.630> these<00:04:51.200> were<00:04:51.380> actually<00:04:51.710> really

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
guard these were actually really

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.000 
guard these were actually really
expensive<00:04:52.400> I've<00:04:52.700> seen<00:04:52.940> these<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.979> Amazon<00:04:54.979> for

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
expensive I've seen these on Amazon for

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.560 
expensive I've seen these on Amazon for
a<00:04:55.280> lot<00:04:55.430> cheaper<00:04:55.669> like<00:04:55.940> from<00:04:56.120> Coastal<00:04:56.540> Scents

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
a lot cheaper like from Coastal Scents

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.409 
a lot cheaper like from Coastal Scents
but<00:04:57.560> I<00:04:58.130> decided<00:04:58.700> to<00:04:58.880> pick<00:04:59.000> one<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.270> these<00:04:59.360> up

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
but I decided to pick one of these up

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.440 
but I decided to pick one of these up
because<00:04:59.900> I<00:05:00.229> hate<00:05:00.740> having<00:05:01.340> my<00:05:01.550> brushes<00:05:01.940> free

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
because I hate having my brushes free

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.450 
because I hate having my brushes free
after<00:05:02.840> I<00:05:02.870> wash<00:05:03.169> them<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:04.010> finally<00:05:04.280> decided

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
after I wash them so I finally decided

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.700 
after I wash them so I finally decided
to<00:05:04.910> invest<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.870> brush<00:05:06.169> guards

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
to invest in brush guards

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.860 
to invest in brush guards
and<00:05:08.229> like<00:05:09.400> this<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:10.669> what<00:05:10.789> you<00:05:10.910> do<00:05:11.090> is<00:05:11.390> after

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
and like this so what you do is after

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.420 
and like this so what you do is after
you<00:05:12.140> wash<00:05:12.470> your<00:05:12.590> brushes<00:05:12.800> or<00:05:13.100> if<00:05:13.280> you're

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
you wash your brushes or if you're

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.040 
you wash your brushes or if you're
traveling<00:05:13.669> I<00:05:14.150> mean<00:05:14.570> you<00:05:14.660> don't<00:05:14.780> want<00:05:14.990> your

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
traveling I mean you don't want your

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.320 
traveling I mean you don't want your
brushes<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.740> frayed<00:05:15.979> or<00:05:16.010> whatever<00:05:16.460> you<00:05:16.729> use

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
brushes to be frayed or whatever you use

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.930 
brushes to be frayed or whatever you use
one<00:05:17.510> of<00:05:17.539> these<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:17.990> put<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.890> end<00:05:19.100> of<00:05:19.669> the

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
one of these and put the end of the

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.930 
one of these and put the end of the
handle<00:05:20.270> into<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:21.680> brush<00:05:21.950> guard<00:05:22.220> and<00:05:22.490> then<00:05:22.700> it

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
handle into the brush guard and then it

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.110 
handle into the brush guard and then it
just<00:05:23.150> holds<00:05:23.510> this<00:05:23.690> thing<00:05:23.900> in<00:05:24.020> place<00:05:24.729> so<00:05:25.729> when

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
just holds this thing in place so when

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.969 
just holds this thing in place so when
it<00:05:26.240> dries<00:05:26.479> or<00:05:26.870> you<00:05:27.260> know<00:05:27.350> if<00:05:27.440> you're<00:05:27.560> traveling

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
it dries or you know if you're traveling

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.100 
it dries or you know if you're traveling
you<00:05:28.010> don't<00:05:28.310> want<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.700> be<00:05:28.820> messed<00:05:29.810> up<00:05:29.960> or

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.890 
you don't want it to be messed up or
whatever<00:05:30.350> so<00:05:30.770> there's<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.310> and<00:05:31.910> then<00:05:32.210> the

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
whatever so there's this and then the

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.770 
whatever so there's this and then the
last<00:05:33.410> thing<00:05:33.800> that<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:34.070> got<00:05:34.400> was<00:05:34.430> a<00:05:35.060> foundation

I don't know you guys until but my body
color<00:05:45.470> is<00:05:45.770> a<00:05:45.800> lot<00:05:46.130> darker<00:05:46.490> than<00:05:46.700> my<00:05:47.510> face<00:05:47.720> color

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
color is a lot darker than my face color

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.500 
color is a lot darker than my face color
just<00:05:48.320> because<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.710> use<00:05:49.010> a<00:05:49.460> lot<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.850> skincare<00:05:50.090> and

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
just because I use a lot of skincare and

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
just because I use a lot of skincare and
it<00:05:51.110> lightens<00:05:51.650> my<00:05:51.830> face<00:05:52.190> apparently<00:05:52.850> I<00:05:53.090> guess

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
foundation as the name suggests and it's

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.690 
foundation as the name suggests and it's
supposed<00:06:18.170> to<00:06:18.260> be<00:06:18.440> really<00:06:18.650> long<00:06:18.920> wearing<00:06:19.490> it

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
supposed to be really long wearing it

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.170 
supposed to be really long wearing it
says<00:06:20.000> it's<00:06:20.270> waterproof<00:06:20.720> on<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:22.550> description

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
says it's waterproof on the description

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.180 
says it's waterproof on the description
so<00:06:23.660> it<00:06:23.780> looks<00:06:23.960> like<00:06:24.020> this<00:06:24.260> and<00:06:24.500> it<00:06:24.620> comes<00:06:24.770> with

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
so it looks like this and it comes with

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.220 
so it looks like this and it comes with
a<00:06:25.400> pump<00:06:25.670> I've<00:06:25.970> never<00:06:26.180> seen<00:06:26.420> this<00:06:26.570> before<00:06:26.900> this

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:27.230 
a pump I've never seen this before this

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.000 
a pump I've never seen this before this
is<00:06:27.290> really<00:06:27.440> cool

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
is really cool

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.500 
is really cool
I'm<00:06:28.220> hoping<00:06:28.460> this<00:06:28.640> really<00:06:28.910> works<00:06:29.090> out<00:06:29.210> because

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
I'm hoping this really works out because

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.570 
I'm hoping this really works out because
it<00:06:29.690> was<00:06:29.870> pretty<00:06:30.320> expensive<00:06:30.770> I<00:06:31.220> think<00:06:31.400> it<00:06:31.460> was

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 
it was pretty expensive I think it was

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.280 
it was pretty expensive I think it was
like<00:06:31.790> fifty<00:06:32.180> five<00:06:32.360> dollars<00:06:32.540> without<00:06:32.990> the

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
like fifty five dollars without the
