00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.209
 such moments here we are a new 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.680
 video and finally guys finally I bring you 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:09.320
 example with the osprey artilleryman a 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.500
 gameplay I think you have asked me everything 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:18.859
 the channel had never climbed a temple and 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:25.150
 I think many agreements but good here 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.150
 you have the fast step 130 of the camera 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.230
 happening to fast camera because it bores 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.740
 pretty but let's go since it's a 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.840
 gameplay 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.579
 that is special because I take out the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.219
 2 play article because I wanted that well 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.450
 6 the normal gunner so wanted 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.760
 comment a few things kids 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.140
 especially because I do not use the article 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.670
 of osprey, you ask me a lot because 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.500
 you do not use the gunner because you never 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.350
 I always knew if I do not want it seems like a 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.110
 march that is too risky as 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.800
 delfino too high because if you want 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.629
 kill sack with the predator missile with 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.800
 the ax and with the ac 130 you can 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.560
 erase is much easier in the chat 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.510
 in the gusts and the truth is that I 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.040
 seems to take a lot of risk since you have 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.080
 to kill the battery to get you 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.750
 what but good here you see I already have the hy 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.070
 the truth is a pretty fast h and what 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.290
 that is being told the truth 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.750
 and the first seems a bit risky because 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.360
 if you want to link quite a bit 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 fast then with the predator hy the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.470
 accident is much easier and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.350
 You can do some killings just like 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.729
 fat than with a gunner osprey 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.470
 honestly is to gamble too much 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.790
 obviously they lead gunner in 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.320
 some games you say I'm going to put on the 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030
 gunner I'm going to destroy these 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 I think I can get it out pretty 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.880
 easy here is that I move away I'm screwed 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.020
 because I see that there is none of my 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.750
 equipment and well the radar that come out by 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.210
 there I say is worth seeing here if there is someone 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.320
 I have above I say it's worth the game and 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.640
 suddenly one of the team here is born 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.890
 play here we have the backup so 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.950
 I'm more calm I have a break 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.479
 but what is being discussed 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.289
 it's much harder to get the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.660
 gunner but as he was saying in 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.950
 some games you can put the 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.050
 artillery I'm going to blow up all the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.280
 I'm going to hit this world with this 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.399
 simply with this I'm going to press 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.860
 but that these people eat it they eat 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.940
 my gunner and here I am swollen but in the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.680
 Most games if you want to play 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.480
 normal departures so the people then 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 when you have a pretty high streak 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.470
 for the most normal thing is that they kill us not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.580
 always always the same happens 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.959
 usually the same happens whenever we 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940
 missing one I think that even in this 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 gameplay I take out the hya lack of one 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.260
 the next time it is today the following 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.090
 and when they kill me at the first time 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 one was missing for 130 again and from 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.530
 suddenly catch and they kill me so that's 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.329
 what I do not want to happen, not if I 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.709
 He took out a missile but the safest thing is that 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.690
 more than one or even two 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.060
 then I have almost linked the hache 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.459
 and having it h then practically 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.750
 You do have the grace 130 130 if you do not 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.060
 you have seen it many of mlk in place 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.500
 can do quite powerful killings 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.299
 obviously an osprey gunner is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.040
 better than a c 130 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.540
 hence, it costs much more but at a 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.390
 series of 130 ago can do quite 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.690
 it's pretty killing I do not prefer that 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.459
 simply by the fact that it is 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.230
 easier not to take off the many you will tell me 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.970
 that as you might prefer a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.410
 c-130 before but let's see things every 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.420
 streak has its good things and things 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.069
 bad obviously a thyroid premium is 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.609
 much more than 130 ago but 130 is very 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.670
 to take it out so I prefer c-130 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.109
 but in some specific items by 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.120
 varela loses the awards is wrong so 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.280
 I put it on I was not going for the gameplay and 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.659
 I was about not going up, not since 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.519
 ended 59 4 I think and I do not say no what 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:37.409
 good enough to upload 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.930
 the gameplay is not going to upload it until 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.010
 Attic end good when using the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.169
 activities because it is what everyone 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.060
 want to see I'm going to upload the gameplay and has 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:53.310
 been 20 59 4 kids 59 4 I've already been 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:58.650
 I posted uploaded to my channel 39 59 49 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.010
 again 39 59 I can not get to the number 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.239
 decimal is impossible is impossible 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.470
 I always arrive and I will try to get out 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.200
 cough 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.030
 he took us around here you see how I have another 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.790
 time it was hy I think now I kill some 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.660
 around here and before I got the 630 right 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.450
 they kill me 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.489
 here I play it too thank you see 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.720
 killed two and I was missing an entity kill me 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.760
 he played too much look at that position of 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.650
 Suddenly killing one would already have the condition 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.240
 We will not have things that happen, he played me 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550
 always going that position is very easy 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.190
 kill from that position but people 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.810
 there since it has hunted is not always the 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.820
 typical place where you put to catch 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.350
 the rest of the long corridor fell the 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.960
 left or those that are born inside the 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.610
 cave and the people there swell pineapples 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.280
 but let's throw you na of grenades that you 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.910
 you can be fine in addition to something else that 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.580
 I wanted to comment 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.550
 look at the state 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.000
 that's how we are like this we are in when I 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.030
 pass this 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.330
 I can not promise I can not but good 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.330
 kids 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.520
 by the way we beat them up I think 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.890
 which is a 240 if I'm not wrong I think that 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.990
 I reach 40 points we are dominating 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.150
 everything that you have fixed almost 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.850
 it does not have a flag and now it's good 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.560
 the drone that I wanted to speak yesterday go up 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.680
 as many of you know the road to commander 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.350
 of call of duty 4 the truth was the 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.930
 infant of the reception he had in the 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.190
 channel I did not expect them good 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.230
 bother so much the truth is not one is a 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.540
 series that had more than nothing apart no 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.780
 I expected him to fly so much at least 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:33.350
 two that did not have so many comments 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.880
 saying I love myself more more more not since 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.950
 when you usually upload a new series or 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.590
 as in this case, to take up a series that 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.030
 I had started four years ago 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.500
 months that did not upload a video and I think that 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.140
 has up to eight months when it went up 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880
 first episode did not wait so long 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.650
 welcome not even though it usually happens in 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:50.570
 the first episodes and then it's already 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.850
 decaying I hope it does not happen with this 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:55.729
 with this commander time but good a lot 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:57.169
 He told me to cut out you command not anymore 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:59.300
 I followed since obviously 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.499
 Many, it's not been long since you followed me 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.969
 in the channel and as I said four years ago 

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:04.729
 months that an episode of this did not raise 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:07.159
 so I'm going to comment 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.199
 just in case for a while commander wants 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:12.589
 say go up from the first level up 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.809
 the last of a game number of the call of 

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:16.009
 duty in this case the bald and four yes 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:19.129
 that I have is a from level 1 up 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.259
 level 55 to be in the the 

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.569
 last level and that is what you will try 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:25.430
 do in the video not good in the video 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.960
 I say in the series at commander time 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.009
 so that's what I wrote many 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.419
 comments asking so that more 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:31.039
 good kids just and tell you that 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.110
 thank you very much everyone for the 

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.279
 welcome you have had if you do not know 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.779
 some of you saw me yesterday's video 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:37.759
 the time I commented I'll have it fixed 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:40.219
 annotation do not think about the channel what 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.479
 you will have safe there assignments 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.789
 just thank you again 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.020
 for all the support you are giving me 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:47.180
 lately in the videos is 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.520
 impressive nothing you know has 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:51.110
 liked the video I like favorites and not 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.499
 we see in another example and return shot and 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.499
 stories
