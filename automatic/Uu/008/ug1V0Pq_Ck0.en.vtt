00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.430 
of the four pistols now it's it's good
in<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.199> respect<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.340> its<00:00:53.969> accuracy<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.989> well

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
in that respect but its accuracy as well

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.729

it's reload speed is very slow so the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
unlock this at level 13 this is a three

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
unlock this at level 13 this is a three
burst<00:01:07.500> pistol<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.549> good<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.939> medium<00:01:09.270> range

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
burst pistol it's good for medium range

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.530 
burst pistol it's good for medium range
however<00:01:10.320> its<00:01:10.890> accuracy<00:01:11.549> isn't<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.330> best

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
however its accuracy isn't the best

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.570 
however its accuracy isn't the best
because<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> really<00:01:13.710> small<00:01:14.040> gun<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
because it's like a really small gun and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.550 
because it's like a really small gun and
it's<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.909> annoying<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.380> own

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
it's just annoying to use in my own

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
it's just annoying to use in my own
opinion<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.759> three<00:01:17.970> burst<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.540> think

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
opinion and the three burst you think

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.179 
opinion and the three burst you think
would<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.380> powerful<00:01:19.710> than<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> actually

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
would be more powerful than it actually

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.370 
would be more powerful than it actually
is<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.360> however<00:01:21.810> despite<00:01:22.350> all

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
is but it's not however despite all

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.260 
is but it's not however despite all
these<00:01:22.619> things<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.189> does<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> decent<00:01:23.850> rate

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
these things it does have a decent rate

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.380 
these things it does have a decent rate
of<00:01:24.420> fire<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.950> does<00:01:26.490> make<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.270> of

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
of fire so it does make up for some of

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
of fire so it does make up for some of
the<00:01:27.509> things<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> lacks<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.439> like

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the things that it lacks in like

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.760 
the things that it lacks in like
accuracy<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.030> damage<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.229> fourth<00:01:31.530> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
accuracy and damage so the fourth and
