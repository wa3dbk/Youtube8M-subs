couldn't<00:02:44.600> if<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.140> have<00:02:45.970> if<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.150> clued<00:02:47.480> audio

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.470 
couldn't if you have if you clued audio
like<00:02:48.350> if<00:02:48.530> you<00:02:48.680> render<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.250> for<00:02:49.760> using<00:02:50.090> audio

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
like if you render it for using audio

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.390 
like if you render it for using audio
and<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.110> don't<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.440> audio<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:52.100> would<00:02:52.220> just

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
and you don't have audio it would just

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.420 
and you don't have audio it would just
increase<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.790> time<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:54.020> injury<00:02:54.560> so

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
which is a bad thing so in this case I

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.910 
which is a bad thing so in this case I
don't<00:02:58.550> have<00:02:58.730> audio<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.890> doesn't<00:03:00.890> matter
