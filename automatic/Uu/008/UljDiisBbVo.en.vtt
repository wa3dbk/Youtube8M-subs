take a 2004 2005 or 2006 Jeep Liberty
engine<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.840> convert<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.559> can

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
engine and convert that so that you can

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.529 
engine and convert that so that you can
stick<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.219> your<00:00:14.480> 2002<00:00:15.480> or<00:00:15.830> 2003<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:18.150> reason

stick it in your 2002 or 2003 the reason

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599 
stick it in your 2002 or 2003 the reason
they<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:18.750> interchange<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.160> two

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
they don't interchange is because of two

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.590 
they don't interchange is because of two
reasons<00:00:21.320> from<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.439> factory<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.600> right

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
reasons from the factory one is right

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.130 
reasons from the factory one is right
here

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
here

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.000 
here
this<00:00:25.320> ring<00:00:27.420> that's<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.080> reluctor<00:00:28.560> ring<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
this ring that's a reluctor ring on the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.830 
this ring that's a reluctor ring on the
crankshaft<00:00:29.840> only<00:00:30.840> has<00:00:31.109> 16<00:00:32.009> to

crankshaft only has 16 to

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.350 
crankshaft only has 16 to
on<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:35.000> 2002<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.180> 2003<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:38.070> tone<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:39.090> tone

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
on the 2002 and 2003 the tone the tone

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.790 
on the 2002 and 2003 the tone the tone
wheel<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:41.280> crankshaft<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:42.930> has

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
wheel on the crankshaft up here also has

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.430 
wheel on the crankshaft up here also has
a<00:00:43.829> different<00:00:44.309> number<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.610> holes<00:00:45.140> punched<00:00:46.140> in

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a different number of holes punched in

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.729 
a different number of holes punched in
the<00:00:46.590> side<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.550> what<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.270> mean<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.200> as

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the side and what I mean by that is as

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.340 
the side and what I mean by that is as
you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> see<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:51.120> counts<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.809> as<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.079> spins

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you can see they counts that as it spins

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.130 
you can see they counts that as it spins
around<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.399> different<00:00:53.730> number<00:00:54.050> for<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
around it's a different number for the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
around it's a different number for the
2002<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.129> 2003<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.100> do<00:00:59.309> is<00:01:00.140> what

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
2002 and 2003 so what you can do is what

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
2002 and 2003 so what you can do is what
comes<00:01:01.379> on<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> 2002<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.609> 2003<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:04.309> this<00:01:05.309> one

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
comes on the 2002 and 2003 is this one

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:28.370 
comes on the 2002 and 2003 is this one
right<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.170> which<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.200> basically<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:08.250> 16<00:01:27.229> mm<00:01:28.229> oh

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
right here which is basically a 16 mm oh

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.510 
right here which is basically a 16 mm oh
one<00:01:28.860> two<00:01:29.759> three<00:01:30.659> one<00:01:32.000> three<00:01:33.229> two<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.520> that's

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
one two three one three two and that's

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.780 
one two three one three two and that's
what<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> counts<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.570> spinning<00:01:36.960> around<00:01:37.790> so

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
what it counts is it spinning around so

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.090 
what it counts is it spinning around so
if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.329> want<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.659> put<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.040> to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
take a newer engine and put it in these

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.020 
take a newer engine and put it in these

engine down but you're going to have to
take<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:10.670> bolt<00:03:10.880> out<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.120> the<00:03:11.269> can<00:03:11.510> you're

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
take the bolt out of the can you're

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.500 
take the bolt out of the can you're
going<00:03:12.470> to<00:03:12.560> pull<00:03:12.769> this<00:03:12.920> off<00:03:13.299> you're<00:03:14.299> going<00:03:14.450> to

going to pull this off you're going to

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.009 
going to pull this off you're going to
put<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.780> one<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.049> comes<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.500> kit<00:03:15.680> on

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
put the one that comes in the kit on

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.449 
put the one that comes in the kit on
then<00:03:18.019> you're<00:03:18.109> going<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.260> take<00:03:18.440> these<00:03:18.650> three

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
then you're going to take these three

ring on there you can mix putting the

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.740 
ring on there you can mix putting the
ring<00:03:27.889> up<00:03:28.040> ring<00:03:28.519> on<00:03:28.669> it<00:03:28.819> only<00:03:28.940> goes<00:03:29.239> out<00:03:29.419> in<00:03:29.569> one

ring up ring on it only goes out in one

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.920 
ring up ring on it only goes out in one
way<00:03:29.959> and<00:03:30.910> after<00:03:31.910> you've<00:03:32.209> done<00:03:32.419> that<00:03:32.690> when

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
way and after you've done that when

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.140 
way and after you've done that when
you've<00:03:33.049> taken<00:03:33.260> oh<00:03:33.530> four<00:03:33.889> oh<00:03:33.919> five<00:03:34.430> or<00:03:34.489> no<00:03:34.760> six

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
you've taken oh four oh five or no six

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.720 
you've taken oh four oh five or no six
has<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.480> long<00:03:35.780> block<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:37.069> stick<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.489> in

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
has a long block and you stick it in

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.409 
has a long block and you stick it in
your<00:03:37.940> o2<00:03:38.690> or<00:03:39.109> o3<00:03:39.730> then<00:03:40.730> you<00:03:40.880> won't<00:03:41.060> have<00:03:41.209> any

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:41.419 
your o2 or o3 then you won't have any

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.120 
your o2 or o3 then you won't have any
problems<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:41.959> engine<00:03:42.290> will<00:03:42.470> start<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:42.980> run

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
problems the engine will start and run

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.699 
problems the engine will start and run
it<00:03:43.910> won't<00:03:44.180> set<00:03:44.389> off<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.720> computers<00:03:45.290> and

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
it won't set off the computers and

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.530 
it won't set off the computers and
that's<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.430> only<00:03:46.760> difference<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:47.359> you<00:03:47.510> have

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
that's the only difference that you have

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.559 
that's the only difference that you have
as<00:03:47.959> far<00:03:48.139> as<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.410> long<00:03:48.769> block<00:03:49.190> goes<00:03:49.720> so<00:03:51.160> that<00:03:52.569> we

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
as far as a long block goes so that we

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.870 
as far as a long block goes so that we
do<00:03:53.720> Selleck<00:03:54.079> it<00:03:54.260> in<00:03:54.349> two<00:03:54.560> ways<00:03:54.799> you<00:03:55.519> can<00:03:55.700> buy

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
do Selleck it in two ways you can buy

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.240 
do Selleck it in two ways you can buy
the<00:03:55.940> kit<00:03:56.269> with<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:57.859> buy<00:03:57.980> it<00:03:58.040> with

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the kit with just you can buy it with

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.960 
the kit with just you can buy it with
just<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:59.180> ring<00:03:59.450> or<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:01.280> can<00:04:01.430> buy<00:04:01.579> it<00:04:01.639> with<00:04:01.819> the

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
just the ring or you can buy it with the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.759 
just the ring or you can buy it with the
ring<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.840> goes<00:04:03.019> on<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.260> crankshaft<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:04.389> the

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
ring that goes on the crankshaft and the

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:08.229 
ring that goes on the crankshaft and the
tone<00:04:06.769> wheel<00:04:07.040> that<00:04:07.250> goes<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:07.730> the<00:04:07.879> end<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
tone wheel that goes on the end of the

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:11.409 
tone wheel that goes on the end of the
camshaft<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:10.280> reason<00:04:10.669> we<00:04:10.730> saw<00:04:10.940> them<00:04:11.030> separate

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
camshaft the reason we saw them separate

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.640 
camshaft the reason we saw them separate
is<00:04:11.539> because<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.079> you<00:04:12.199> want<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.410> give<00:04:12.590> them

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
is because if you want to give them

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.740 
is because if you want to give them
separate<00:04:13.070> is<00:04:13.190> because<00:04:13.579> if<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.150> get<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.299> timing

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
separate is because if you get a timing

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.930 
separate is because if you get a timing
chain<00:04:14.780> set<00:04:15.350> this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
chain set this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.370 
chain set this
is<00:04:16.030> going<00:04:16.180> to<00:04:16.239> come<00:04:16.450> in<00:04:16.600> your<00:04:16.720> timing<00:04:17.140> chain

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
is going to come in your timing chain

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.490 
is going to come in your timing chain
set<00:04:17.769> so<00:04:18.519> you<00:04:18.610> could<00:04:18.940> order<00:04:19.420> your<00:04:19.840> timing<00:04:20.260> chain

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
set so you could order your timing chain

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.560 
set so you could order your timing chain
set<00:04:20.890> for<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.310> you<00:04:21.970> can<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.150> buy<00:04:22.390> their

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
set for a you can just buy their

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.720 
set for a you can just buy their
Electric<00:04:23.020> crankshaft<00:04:23.590> and<00:04:23.860> then<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.580> your

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
Electric crankshaft and then in your

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.430 
Electric crankshaft and then in your
timing<00:04:25.150> chain<00:04:25.420> set<00:04:25.810> you're<00:04:26.020> going<00:04:26.140> to<00:04:26.290> have

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
timing chain set you're going to have

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.980 
timing chain set you're going to have
your<00:04:26.650> new<00:04:26.770> wheel<00:04:27.640> you<00:04:28.360> would<00:04:28.510> just<00:04:28.660> have<00:04:28.870> to

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
your new wheel you would just have to

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.380 
your new wheel you would just have to
order<00:04:29.170> for<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.590> 2002<00:04:30.490> but<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.940> timing<00:04:31.360> chain

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
order for a 2002 but the timing chain

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.090 
order for a 2002 but the timing chain
sets<00:04:31.870> are<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.170> same<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.650> how<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.860> do

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
sets are the same so that is how you do

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.310 
sets are the same so that is how you do
that

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
that

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.540 
that
