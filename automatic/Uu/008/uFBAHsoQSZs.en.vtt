00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay guys now it's the final two stages

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.509 
okay guys now it's the final two stages
of<00:00:04.730> the<00:00:05.730> reassembly<00:00:06.690> here<00:00:07.340> now<00:00:08.340> my

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
of the reassembly here now my

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.350 
of the reassembly here now my
decompression<00:00:09.120> cable<00:00:09.480> runs<00:00:10.380> under<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.360> and

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
decompression cable runs under this and

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.419 
decompression cable runs under this and
I<00:00:12.420> notice<00:00:12.719> while<00:00:12.870> back<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:13.950> really

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
I notice while back that it was really

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.939 
I notice while back that it was really
hard<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> start<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> I've<00:00:15.420> figured<00:00:16.170> out<00:00:16.379> it

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
hard to start and I've figured out it

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.790 
hard to start and I've figured out it
had<00:00:17.100> stretched<00:00:17.630> so<00:00:18.630> by<00:00:18.750> adding<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.199> spacer

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
had stretched so by adding this spacer

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.420 
had stretched so by adding this spacer
on<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.330> tip<00:00:21.650> of<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:23.930> right<00:00:24.930> here<00:00:25.340> where<00:00:26.340> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
on the tip of it right here where it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.609 
on the tip of it right here where it
meets<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.730> head

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
meets the head

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.980 
meets the head

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
to do is you just turn it and once you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.100 
to do is you just turn it and once you
start<00:02:11.730> turning<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.480> tension<00:02:12.870> on<00:02:12.990> the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
start turning it the tension on the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.470 
start turning it the tension on the
spring<00:02:13.230> is<00:02:13.530> going<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.709> cause<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.100> pulley<00:02:14.310> just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
spring is going to cause the pulley just

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.540 
spring is going to cause the pulley just
close<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:18.800> see<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:19.980> it's<00:02:20.100> already<00:02:20.370> written

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
close up see and it's already written

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.930 
close up see and it's already written
pretty<00:02:20.790> much<00:02:21.000> back<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.540> maximum<00:02:22.140> tension

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
pretty much back to the maximum tension

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.360 
pretty much back to the maximum tension
so<00:02:23.940> now<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.120> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> do<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.900> test<00:02:25.230> start<00:02:25.560> what

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
so now I'm going to do a test start what

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.340 
so now I'm going to do a test start what
I'm<00:02:26.430> going<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.580> do<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.850> I'm<00:02:26.940> going<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.150> hold<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.340 
I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the
decompression<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> hear<00:02:30.000> some<00:02:30.180> puffing<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
decompression so I hear some puffing and
