questions<00:03:53.000> so<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.209> basically<00:03:53.389> create<00:03:53.810> a

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
questions so you basically create a

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.039 
questions so you basically create a
category<00:03:54.230> like<00:03:54.769> let's<00:03:55.700> say<00:03:55.790> mobile<00:03:56.450> mania<00:03:56.870> and

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
category like let's say mobile mania and

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.979 
category like let's say mobile mania and
then<00:03:57.709> include<00:03:58.639> four<00:03:58.970> questions<00:03:59.510> for<00:03:59.810> that

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
then include four questions for that

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.860 
then include four questions for that
category<00:04:00.260> ranging<00:04:01.100> from<00:04:01.220> easy<00:04:01.549> too<00:04:01.760> hard<00:04:02.030> so

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
category ranging from easy too hard so

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.479 
category ranging from easy too hard so
the<00:04:03.139> first<00:04:03.380> question<00:04:03.500> would<00:04:03.829> be<00:04:03.920> kind<00:04:04.190> of<00:04:04.250> easy

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
the first question would be kind of easy

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.289 
the first question would be kind of easy
like<00:04:04.940> what<00:04:05.840> was<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.109> original<00:04:06.970> MOBA<00:04:07.970> game

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
like what was the original MOBA game

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.360 
like what was the original MOBA game
multiplayer<00:04:08.720> online<00:04:09.079> battle<00:04:09.290> arena<00:04:09.650> game<00:04:10.100> and

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
multiplayer online battle arena game and

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.240 
multiplayer online battle arena game and
that<00:04:10.760> would<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:10.940> dota<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.139> then<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.889> hardest

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
that would be dota and then the hardest

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.430 
that would be dota and then the hardest
question<00:04:13.609> could<00:04:13.880> be<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.959> fourth<00:04:15.230> question

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
question could be the fourth question
