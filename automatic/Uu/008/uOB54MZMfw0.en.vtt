00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.200

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.219

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.780
 the cinema start most joy in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 An actor is incredibly happy 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.410
 I have never had them together in one 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.520

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.520
 broken city 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.940
 When I became mayor why should 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.370
 I also like to tell broken city 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.330
 she did not change anything for me 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.730
 You know, you're crazy, step by step 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.820
 is already well set up again 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.400
 down as if they did not have me 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.680
 Altered is our hero mayor 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:56.800
 she is a hero in my eyes 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:00.150
 Thank you very much if you want to hunt 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.290
 they try to become a natural 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.540
 I am not sure if I follow him 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.500
 they may need to find the stone 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.180
 that my wife is not ok for berlin you 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.570

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.590
 You have an envelope with photos of me 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.850
 I paid for it 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.159
 I did not think when they call it 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.280
 something like that would happen very soon 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.860
 Do you understand the big picture ? 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.920
 now willy i have the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.770
 Photos delivered and picture gone again 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 This is not about what they are 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.420
 ever thought why I have chosen 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.840
 100 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.580
 He is a dangerous man with her 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.580
 you could kill people the other one 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.000
 You will be the deal 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.000

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.080

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.480
 Unfortunate circumstance that causes 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.170
 but that he is fired still had 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.040
 Good luck he did not go to prison 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.350

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.150

 New York in four years 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.730
 later, berlin between 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.590
 private detective that more bad than 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.290
 right because his core business is that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.820
 spouse in the event of adultery in the end too 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.860
 catch more pay like already the 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.750
 bill of a detective of the once 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.100
 one has destroyed life as one 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.320
 suddenly the mayor returned 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.510
 my says I ey have something good in 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 because of you then and asks him his 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.290
 wife to shadow that for 50,000 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.120
 dollar billy absolutely needs and 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.220
 to catch or catch them 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.380
 if she goes strange and if they have 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.850
 who does that billy must realize that 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.800
 maybe it's more than just one 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.240
 affair and a corruption scandal up 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.130
 in the highest circles and then 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.140
 The movie turns him into one 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.420
 thriller at the highest level and is very 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.130
 very exciting that promises us 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.260
 At least the trailer is unfortunately 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.209
 block incity that's not it's a lot 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.430
 the exciting chase goes on 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.440
 film is very dialogue-heavy what not 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.700
 bad must be really good movies 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.470
 have on very good scripts the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.910
 underlies but unfortunately the blog is 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.769
 the very predictable in the place 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.780
 except to the point where finally sits 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.670
 comes to the showdown and it will and that 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.470
 is the big weak point in everyone 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.150
 talk with so many names around 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.620
 thrown political circles that one 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.930
 as a spectator hardly comes after who 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.580
 is worth now and why did what 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.320
 and that's why it's all too 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.910
 easy that at broken city the 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.350
 red thread loses when you watch the movie 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.390
 sees and there is a spring 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.160
 nothing worse than if the audience 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.720
 no longer behind and what 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.239
 now just thing is actually 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.340
 is the film from the core good because mark 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.660
 Wahlberg and water play great in 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.310
 the moment she is playing together 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.450
 it really exciting 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.010
 also get jeffrey wright and 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.930
 catherine zeta-jones and that too 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.370
 one or the other known face the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.140
 all very neat go the whole 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.790
 film and great look new york is great 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.250
 captured and especially the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.109
 Themes of politics intrigues and the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.359
 makes the media very very exciting and 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.289
 only at this little mistake 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.789
 but finally one 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.800
 big mistake becomes that these dialogues 

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:24.659
 so incredibly difficult to understand 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.789
 are taking the movie very much power 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.099
 and strengthen out what a pity 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.719
 That's why he wants more than he wants 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.159
 four out of ten possible points 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:34.110
 Overall , I would even get him 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.270
 much better than this genre 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.560
 Overall, he gets from me five and a half 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.180
 out of 10 possible points 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.879
 it is a pity because you feel right 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.710
 Looking at how the potential flutes 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.870
 goes and that's a shame tors 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.069
 the still mark wahlberg macro mark and 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.870
 especially both in this quite 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.310
 serious film he wants to see first 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.509
 then tunnel on the canvas has 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.430
 the film has a certain effect of 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.560
 effect and look is great though 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.060
 really really closely and 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.949
 Just watch out ok friends 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.330
 who turned yesterday yesterday 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.800
 there was a raffle to block 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.479
 maybe the five fan packages should 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.550
 turn back there because you can 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.229

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.509
