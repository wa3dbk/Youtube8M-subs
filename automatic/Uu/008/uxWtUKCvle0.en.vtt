like<00:01:36.999> that<00:01:37.060> and<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:38.560> Dunlop<00:01:39.009> especially<00:01:39.819> it

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
like that and with Dunlop especially it

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:41.580 
like that and with Dunlop especially it
was<00:01:40.090> very<00:01:40.329> good<00:01:40.569> we<00:01:41.170> had<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.319> very<00:01:41.530> good

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
was very good we had a very good

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.959 
was very good we had a very good
relationship<00:01:41.859> and<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:42.639> were<00:01:42.789> always

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.760 
developing the tires throughout the
season<00:01:46.569> I<00:01:46.659> mean<00:01:46.810> it's<00:01:46.959> not<00:01:47.079> like<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.619> do

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
season I mean it's not like you do

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.289 
season I mean it's not like you do
something<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.249> winter<00:01:48.549> and<00:01:48.789> then<00:01:48.909> you<00:01:48.939> have<00:01:49.149> to

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
something in winter and then you have to

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.239 
something in winter and then you have to
live<00:01:49.509> with<00:01:49.659> it<00:01:49.810> for<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.049> rest<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.499> year<00:01:50.709> we

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
live with it for the rest of the year we

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.309 
live with it for the rest of the year we
were<00:01:51.429> always<00:01:51.609> testing<00:01:52.299> testing<00:01:52.749> a<00:01:52.840> lot<00:01:52.990> trying

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319
