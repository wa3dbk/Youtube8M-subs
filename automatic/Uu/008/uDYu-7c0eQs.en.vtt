00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 hello with you apple fall into this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.950
 video we'll talk about gopro hero3 if 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.219
 who doesn't know is a portable camera for 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.540
 athletes or video bloggers drove 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.540
 like never before 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 for starters, as always, I would like to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.400
 talk about the box herself she is very 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.679
 succinctly and beautiful from her top you 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.690
 will find in the camera itself which immediately 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.940
 worth waterproof casey 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.370
 further in the box are a pair of anyone 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.960
 unnecessary pieces of paper 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.600
 after we get them in the box 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.460
 There will be a pair of kripke varnish and cable for 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 charging and connecting the device to 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 computer as well as the back cap 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.710
 spare 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.110
 which penetrates the sound of the case i camera 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.329
 I will not get it and about the design of the camera 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.609
 you can say nothing 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.879
 mark only what is on the device 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:06.570
 There are two buttons and the screen itself 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.890
 the main information is still there alone 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.580
 button but on 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 not considered important as it includes 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900
 only wi-fi module 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.750
 still comes with several different 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.540
 allowances for fixing the camera for example 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.159
 on bicycle handlebars or somewhere else 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:29.220
 that is, their use is very much like 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.070
 I said I will not get it like me 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.500
 I do not see the point 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.259
 I can only say that on this picture in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.159
 corner of the screen you can see the connector this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.250
 miniusb mini hdmi and card slot 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.369
 micro sd first class another chip 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.979
 is that you can view 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.220
 what the camera sees live in its 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.280
 iPhone, in principle, it works well 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.860
 but he gets up from separate accessories i 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 just bought a rope leg is me 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.380
 I like it very much as I sometimes lead 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.299
 blogs 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.490
 and since the camera is also in 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.740
 waterproof case you can 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 for example, shoot as you drive down a hill 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.370
 the water park at the camera has a very large overview 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.980
 when shooting which helps a lot when shooting 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.489
 from the head but the video turns out as if 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.920
 the camera shoots with your eyes but i think 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.580
 you can not wait to see how this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.040
 the camera shoots video and takes pictures on 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.510
 while you look I have something else for you 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:36.269
 I'll tell you and tell you what I got 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.010
 precisely silva edishen because she 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.800
 average in class she of course 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:47.730
 much more powerful than enter deshin well and 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.519
 weaker than super cool apple write but 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.340
 not much because the blockade of tires is 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.040
 professional and there is a little bit 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.370
 changed the menu x and inside everything too 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.409
 most well and in conclusion I would like to 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.830
 say that the camera is suitable for bloggers 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:08.099
 or do any athletes thanks 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.330
 that looked review put huskies and bye 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.330
 see you soon
