00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
that has been added our sea forts now I

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.150 
that has been added our sea forts now I
think<00:02:21.870> these<00:02:21.989> are<00:02:22.050> meant<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.349> be<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.800> I've

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
think these are meant to be like I've

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.240 
think these are meant to be like I've
oil<00:02:23.940> rigs<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.599> hold<00:02:25.260> military<00:02:26.750> marine<00:02:27.750> forts

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
oil rigs or hold military marine forts

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.380 
oil rigs or hold military marine forts
basically<00:02:29.250> you'll<00:02:29.489> find<00:02:29.790> them<00:02:29.880> in<00:02:29.970> sets<00:02:30.239> of

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
basically you'll find them in sets of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.760 
basically you'll find them in sets of
three<00:02:30.720> throughout<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.260> ocean<00:02:31.590> they're

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
three throughout the ocean they're

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.680 
three throughout the ocean they're
pretty<00:02:32.100> easy<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.700> find<00:02:32.940> from<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> looks

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
pretty easy to find from the looks

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.800 
pretty easy to find from the looks
things<00:02:33.989> I<00:02:34.260> found<00:02:35.130> two<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.760> far<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.630> is<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
loot fest like I'm not even kidding

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.860 
loot fest like I'm not even kidding
there's<00:02:43.800> there's<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:44.700> much<00:02:44.970> loot<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.660> these

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
there's there's so much loot in these

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.309 
there's there's so much loot in these
and<00:02:46.200> there's<00:02:46.500> three<00:02:46.890> so<00:02:47.489> when<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.300> go<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.870> them

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
and there's three so when you go to them

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.210 
and there's three so when you go to them
make<00:02:49.709> sure<00:02:49.739> you<00:02:50.459> have<00:02:52.040> nothing<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.190> your

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
make sure you have nothing in your

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.400 
make sure you have nothing in your
inventory<00:02:53.850> besides<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.360> paddle<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.930> possibly

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
inventory besides a paddle and possibly

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.860 
inventory besides a paddle and possibly
an<00:02:55.590> oxygen<00:02:56.069> tank<00:02:56.280> if<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.640> have<00:02:56.819> one<00:02:57.030> so

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
an oxygen tank if you have one so

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.229 
an oxygen tank if you have one so
basically<00:02:58.440> think<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.980> that<00:02:59.790> there's<00:03:00.030> about

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
basically think of that there's about

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.490 
basically think of that there's about
four<00:03:00.780> different<00:03:01.350> Luke<00:03:01.980> crates<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.900> each<00:03:03.900> story

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
four different Luke crates in each story

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.559 
four different Luke crates in each story
on<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.090> each<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.630> them<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:07.560> double<00:03:07.890> storied<00:03:08.569> so

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
on and each of them a double storied so

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.570 
on and each of them a double storied so
you<00:03:10.019> have<00:03:10.200> eight<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.830> then<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.100> tons<00:03:11.310> up<00:03:11.459> by

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you have eight and then you tons up by

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.210 
you have eight and then you tons up by
three<00:03:11.819> there's<00:03:12.030> 24<00:03:12.540> things<00:03:12.870> in<00:03:13.140> just<00:03:13.890> as<00:03:14.100> an

example I found like two buckets two of
the<00:03:18.180> ship<00:03:18.390> parts<00:03:18.930> I've<00:03:19.380> found<00:03:20.340> three<00:03:20.910> hammers

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
the ship parts I've found three hammers

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.259 
the ship parts I've found three hammers
and<00:03:21.540> apps<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:23.070> ton<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.340> other<00:03:23.579> things<00:03:23.940> while

and apps and a ton of other things while

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.090 
and apps and a ton of other things while
searching<00:03:24.660> through<00:03:25.079> these<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:25.829> look

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
searching through these and they look

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.630 
searching through these and they look
really<00:03:26.370> cool<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.910> sound<00:03:27.269> really<00:03:27.600> cool<00:03:27.780> now

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
really cool and sound really cool now

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.120 
really cool and sound really cool now
these<00:03:29.640> you<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:31.200> may<00:03:31.380> think<00:03:31.440> you'll<00:03:31.799> fall

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
these you you may think you'll fall

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.490 
these you you may think you'll fall
through<00:03:32.430> but<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.810> fallen<00:03:33.989> through<00:03:34.140> once

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
through but I have fallen through once

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.030 
through but I have fallen through once
basically<00:03:35.070> you<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.340> run<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.090> jump<00:03:36.630> across

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
basically you just run and jump across

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.039 
basically you just run and jump across
as<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.549> see<00:03:38.730> i<00:03:38.760> was<00:03:38.940> i<00:03:39.090> was<00:03:39.180> highly

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
as you can see i was i was highly

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.170 
as you can see i was i was highly
debating<00:03:40.530> whether<00:03:41.070> i<00:03:41.160> should<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:42.060> this

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
debating whether i should do it in this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
debating whether i should do it in this
clip<00:03:42.859> perhaps<00:03:43.859> as<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:44.459> you<00:03:44.549> just<00:03:44.730> run

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
clip perhaps as you can see you just run

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720 
clip perhaps as you can see you just run
and<00:03:45.359> then<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.690> jump<00:03:46.079> across<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.739> you'll<00:03:47.489> make

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
and then you jump across and you'll make

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.449 
and then you jump across and you'll make
it<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.120> next<00:03:48.269> one<00:03:48.950> if<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.220> fall<00:03:50.400> through

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
it to the next one if you fall through

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.610 
it to the next one if you fall through
just<00:03:51.120> make<00:03:51.329> sure<00:03:51.359> your<00:03:51.780> life<00:03:51.959> raft<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:52.410> nearby

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
just make sure your life raft is nearby

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.729 
just make sure your life raft is nearby
so<00:03:52.769> you<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.220> swim<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.820> and<00:03:53.970> my<00:03:54.870> pro<00:03:55.470> tip

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
so you can swim it to it and my pro tip

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.610 
so you can swim it to it and my pro tip
is<00:03:56.010> don't<00:03:56.040> run<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.180> jump<00:03:57.420> when<00:03:58.170> there<00:03:58.410> is

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
is don't run and jump when there is
