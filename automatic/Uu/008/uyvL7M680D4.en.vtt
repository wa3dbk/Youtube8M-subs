00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.890 

two<00:00:17.279> rolls<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.180> each<00:00:18.240> side<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
two rolls one for each side of the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
two rolls one for each side of the
handlebar<00:00:20.300> a<00:00:21.300> small<00:00:21.840> piece<00:00:22.109> right<00:00:23.039> for<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
handlebar a small piece right for the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:41.060 
handlebar a small piece right for the
break<00:00:23.580> over<00:00:23.850> here

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.380 

generally<00:00:42.070> when<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.250> take<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.940> handlebars

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
generally when I take the handlebars

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.050 
generally when I take the handlebars
I'll<00:00:43.600> start<00:00:44.040> from<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.130> ends<00:00:45.430> of<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.610> bars<00:00:45.820> and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
I'll start from the ends of the bars and

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.820 
I'll start from the ends of the bars and
wrap<00:00:46.210> towards<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.690> center<00:00:46.990> the<00:00:47.380> reason<00:00:47.740> that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
wrap towards the center the reason that

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.000 
wrap towards the center the reason that
I<00:00:47.950> wrap<00:00:48.190> from<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.550> bottom<00:00:48.880> up<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.480> because<00:00:50.020> if

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
I wrap from the bottom up is because if

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.000 
I wrap from the bottom up is because if
you<00:00:51.190> look<00:00:51.220> along<00:00:51.489> here<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:53.110> cork<00:00:53.710> tape

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
you look along here with cork tape

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.880 
you look along here with cork tape
mostly<00:00:55.000> and<00:00:55.180> some<00:00:55.510> of<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.720> thicker<00:00:55.930> tapes<00:00:56.260> you

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
mostly and some of the thicker tapes you

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.000 
mostly and some of the thicker tapes you
want<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.610> layers<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:58.059> be<00:00:58.090> overlapping

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
want the the layers to be overlapping

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.549 
want the the layers to be overlapping
like<00:01:00.010> shingles<00:01:00.400> on<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:00.940> roof<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:02.170> that<00:01:02.379> because

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
like shingles on a roof so that because

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.530 
like shingles on a roof so that because
people<00:01:02.800> put<00:01:03.070> their<00:01:03.250> hands<00:01:03.489> here<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.119> they'll

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
people put their hands here and they'll

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.030 
people put their hands here and they'll
tend<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:04.900> push<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.140> tape<00:01:05.530> in<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:05.860> direction

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
tend to push the tape in this direction

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.750 
tend to push the tape in this direction
and<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.960> thicker<00:01:08.170> tape<00:01:08.500> if<00:01:08.740> you<00:01:08.770> if<00:01:09.610> you

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
and with the thicker tape if you if you

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.760 
and with the thicker tape if you if you
have<00:01:09.940> two<00:01:10.090> layers<00:01:10.290> overlapping<00:01:11.290> in<00:01:11.560> the<00:01:11.650> other

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
have two layers overlapping in the other

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.219 
have two layers overlapping in the other
direction<00:01:12.160> then<00:01:12.850> it'll<00:01:13.180> tend<00:01:13.390> to<00:01:13.509> unravel<00:01:14.110> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
direction then it'll tend to unravel the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.469 
direction then it'll tend to unravel the
tape<00:01:14.440> a<00:01:14.590> little<00:01:14.619> bit<00:01:14.979> it'll<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.180> will<00:01:16.300> wear

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
tape a little bit it'll and it will wear

00:01:16.479 --> 00:02:09.510 
tape a little bit it'll and it will wear
out<00:01:16.660> the<00:01:16.840> edges<00:01:17.200> more

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.120 

I<00:02:10.200> notice<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.440> push<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:12.190> brake<00:02:12.670> hood<00:02:13.090> forward

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I notice you push the brake hood forward

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.550 
I notice you push the brake hood forward
yeah<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:17.260> where<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:17.530> cast<00:02:17.920> this<00:02:18.250> part

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
yeah so that's where I cast this part

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:36.990 
yeah so that's where I cast this part
they'll<00:02:20.560> be<00:02:20.740> able<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.190> see<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:22.320> yeah<00:02:36.000> I'm

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
they'll be able to see that yeah I'm

00:02:37.000 --> 00:03:03.369 
they'll be able to see that yeah I'm
gonna<00:02:37.720> do<00:02:37.930> one<00:02:38.080> more<00:02:38.260> wrap<00:02:38.410> here

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:11.630 

this<00:03:04.379> white<00:03:04.950> electrical<00:03:05.580> tape<00:03:10.160> this<00:03:11.160> needs<00:03:11.459> to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
this white electrical tape this needs to

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.910 
this white electrical tape this needs to
finish<00:03:11.849> off<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.360> end<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.569> it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.340 

some<00:03:19.670> people<00:03:20.000> also<00:03:20.330> would<00:03:20.570> like<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.900> use<00:03:21.050> hemp

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
some people also would like to use hemp

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.980 
some people also would like to use hemp
twine<00:03:22.090> at<00:03:23.090> this<00:03:23.270> point<00:03:25.480> probably<00:03:26.480> harder<00:03:26.810> for

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
twine at this point probably harder for

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:41.440 
twine at this point probably harder for
a<00:03:27.080> beginner<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.530> write

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.310
