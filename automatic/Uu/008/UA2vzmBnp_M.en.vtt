00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
it's all tough to somehow to ya to get

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.460 
it's all tough to somehow to ya to get
to<00:01:59.070> them<00:01:59.280> or<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.550> just<00:01:59.970> nearly<00:02:00.300> get<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.780> them<00:02:00.960> to

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
to them or to just nearly get to them to

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.560 
to them or to just nearly get to them to
what<00:02:01.619> they<00:02:01.830> achieved<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
what they achieved and so the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
what they achieved and so the
expectations<00:02:04.170> are<00:02:04.290> quite<00:02:04.530> high<00:02:04.800> and<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.130> feel

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.520 
expectations are quite high and I feel
the<00:02:05.460> pressure<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.420> i<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.200> it's<00:02:07.229> a

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
