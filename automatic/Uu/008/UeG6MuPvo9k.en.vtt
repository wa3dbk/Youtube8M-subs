00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 this no of the second stage of the turn 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.910
 de france 2013 makes bastia ajaccio 153 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.820
 km with the first climbs of this tour 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.360
 to climb the pass of the hut green 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 arrow the pass of serra and you will end km 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.770
 from the arrival the scenario pass for 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.390
 finally go to ajaccio a step 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.710
 drawn rather for the punchers it is 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.720
 true that it's pretty complicated but the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 fighters may also be able to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.580
 see the man told us in such a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
 course a pretty cool step that risk 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.239
 to be very nervous the favorites of the day 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.710
 lips there peter sagan valverde and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 rodriguez moreno and philippe gilbert 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.379
 are among the biggest favorites of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.640
 this step voeckler martin and from 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.940
 especially may have a shot at 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 to play 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.090
 vandenbroucke gasparotto games are to be 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.500
 not underestimate also tourists getting 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.760
 play in the last rib nevertheless 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
 So fishermen loans may have 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.190
 to be that several benefits directly 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.239
 rich of 3 constitutes with frohlinger 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.960
 Hesjedal 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.879
 Pagesjaunes has forgiveness and fares of lars 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.270
 boom so that's two minutes ago 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.420
 delay 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.100
 at this moment it's the race aho we are 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.030
 just at the foot of the first difficulty 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.710
 of the day 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.760
 the three leading men who is this 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.990
 we start climbing 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.240
 courageously this difficulty 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.770
 complicated and who will execute the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 the player's first mountain sprint 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.950
 greipel won this intermediate prize 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 a few kilometers earlier boom that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.189
 their are and ford has gone too far 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 frohlinger who are trying to react but el 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.320
 fares is very inventive overflows the whole 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.450
 world 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.729
 look at him he'll go win this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.780
 first mountain sprint by putting himself 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.869
 powerful on his machine 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.220
 baum finished second so it's frohlinger 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.720
 which will have no point seen that this is the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.150
 first and second with points 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
 during this difficulty frohlinger who 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.540
 will then let go directly into 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 the beginning the second son you are of the day 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.290
 he was not up to par with 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.579
 his two companions escape bommel 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.590
 fares content their little walk in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.180
 front behind are the lotos of the jersey 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.640
 andré greipel's yellow who lead the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.409
 train to the second fight for the big 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.700
 price of the mountain so and even more 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 of points awarded four points for the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.540
 first one must also then while behind 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.490
 chavanel attack with martin in his 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.630
 wheel must watch the fight where this 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.340
 included in montanes are not too many 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.200
 time he gets caught lars boom and 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.619
 el farès who passes again at the head of 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.650
 this difficulty while behind that has 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.720
 moved we will see it quickly 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.400
 it moved pretty badly even a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.379
 group formed with chavanel 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.390
 martin and andy schleck squarely and 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:24.019
 big sizes like one of the big 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.819
 moreno gadret runners are also there and 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.260
 cadel evans the old yellow jersey and 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.819
 winner at the Tour de France is almost 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.980
 at the beach that go together 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.799
 so we have a race or 3 and was 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.930
 steps even if directly boom and the 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.560
 brother are overtaken by the three 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.060
 men behind there have been others too 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.260
 four riders trying to come back 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.260
 but the pack is never far 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.000
 so we see andy schleck 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.040
 baum el fares chavanel and martin in the lead 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920
 unfortunately directly in the 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.989
 climb right after el fares is in 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.239
 difficulty and is going to be eating a 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.069
 German soil by the second group 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.450
 and even let loose pretty quickly by the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.049
 following the grenelle that really pushes 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.230
 source 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.849
 it is pedal quite strongly the group 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.040
 evans brajkovic who is right behind 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.810
 and who a few kilometers later in the 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.280
 descent will succeed in taking over the 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.810
 group with a whittom dock in the lead 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.239
 with gadret moreno martin brajkovic 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.169
 schleck evans is beautiful but the most 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.000
 tonic and about thirty seconds 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:35.150
 it's very very tight we're probably going 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.629
 tomorrow see it in general but at this 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.579
 moment there 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.980
 evans does not agree and gives a 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.209
 little brajkovic moreno and gadret his 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.109
 old escape companions is trying to 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.000
 follow him also 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.019
 and you try to file and company at 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.790
 platoon as we approach the 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.510
 last difficulty of the day where maybe 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.069
 everything will be played 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.389
 there are about twenty seconds the 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.799
 group evans and the peloton always 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:53.680
 led by andré's teammates 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.790
 Greipel 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.260
 we see in the effort is enough 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.500
 powerful but the tone is really not 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.409
 far 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.280
 gadret takes this group to a fortnight 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.220
 of seconds advanced on the pack 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.229
 always taken away by lars ytting bak and 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.409
 also the saxo bank that they go 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:10.549
 also tackled m of the finish 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:13.540
 and so a couple of seconds before 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.540
 that this group of head 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.510
 we arrive at the top of the 3rd dan and colt 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.830
 re category of the day almost to the goal there 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.120
 will take the group that has always 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.100
 second class of advanced the gap does not 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.520
 ask not do not diminish it's how 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.419
 manage them 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.010
 yes I go in the lead but it's 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.900
 anecdotal the polka dot jersey this will be 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.980
 on the shoulders of julien el fares from 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.270
 Tomorrow 10 km from the finish as always 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.200
 seconds of advanced it's going to be very 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.970
 complicated for the whim 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.110
 thanks to 5 km from the arrival they have 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.910
 always their 15 20 seconds advanced 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.680
 but the peloton still led by the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.210
 crew of andré greipel but we aim 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.010
 well, have a massive sprint for 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.360
 sewing culture and this step one step 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.250
 who saw that a pale runners dropped 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.630
 in the difficulties of the day Crépeau 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.490
 completely lonely all teammates are 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.720
 tired they worked really if he 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.500
 wants to take his sprint he'll have to 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.850
 that he finds is a wheel 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.410
 quickly andré greipel because he is 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.910
 really alone 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.100
 chagall and boasson hagen also this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.750
 are not too far from flu that launches 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.310
 his sprint where only very far from 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.530
 head is going to be recaptured it's obvious 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.740
 rodriguez see greipl with both in eigen 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.229
 also be left of the road 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.700
 hesjedal who is beaten but we find 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.380
 every year incredible russia has preceded 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.300
 boasson hagen what a victory caster 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.900
 chagan be last meters he was the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.910
 faster 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.380
 so he ends up in front of boasson hagen 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.600
 greipl the money beat the ace country and 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.950
 strong of the day passed the school the 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.020
 peace the ribs earlier was not 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.030
 easy for him we will see seen from the front 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.930
 with the first bike the last 5 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.400
 kilometers of the race 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.440
 with always this group boskovic evans 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.820
 and gadret and moreno who believed until 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.560
 bout that will compete for victory 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.640
 step 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.900
 nevertheless 3 km from the arrival of the 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.419
 second it's not enough to a little 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.740
 the water with a platoon taken away 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.240
 incredibly by the saxo bank team 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.590
 you see him who worked for 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.900
 contador who do not want to answer you 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.910
 already take time in this step 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.560
 the sprint is launched very good fertilizer 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:57.169
 paul who is going to lead in the lead 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.910
 kilometer we will see it is very very 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:00.200
 powerful from andré greipel but 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.220
 rodriguez who will overflow it and all these 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.140
 fish in the middle of the road 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.000
 who makes a crazy effort but since 2am 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.950
 to gan tso last meters overtakes him and 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.080
 wins the victory step so the 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.310
 Slovak peter sagan who to make a 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.640
 stone two more shots because he's going 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.960
 win the yellow jersey at the end of 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.039
 this step can be seen it tidy 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.220
 besides, during these details you 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.110
 see a little bug the chagan nut 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.580
 parade past hagen and valverde stage 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.500
 from 4 against 5 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.580
 greipl will still make a beautiful 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.040
 sixth place in a hilly stage 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.250
 it's not that bad 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.990
 and the classification of the yellow jersey is 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.240
 peter sagan ahead of andre greipel 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.460
 from is behind and is already in 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:41.390
 maybe why not for the chrono 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.010
 nice this is it step I hope 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.240
 that you liked it we are very 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.470
 quickly for the rest of this tour de France 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.470
 with everyone lease
