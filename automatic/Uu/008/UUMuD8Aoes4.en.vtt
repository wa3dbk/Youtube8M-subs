sequence and the Cephalon suitor

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.570 
sequence and the Cephalon suitor
syndicates<00:00:38.090> if<00:00:38.600> he<00:00:39.020> wants<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.379> know<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.340> let's

syndicates if he wants to know but let's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.610 
syndicates if he wants to know but let's
take<00:00:40.820> a<00:00:40.879> look<00:00:41.180> at<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.660> build<00:00:41.900> itself<00:00:42.350> of

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
take a look at the build itself of

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.560 
take a look at the build itself of
course<00:00:42.920> I<00:00:43.190> wanted<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.850> lot<00:00:44.090> of<00:00:44.239> strength

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
course I wanted a lot of strength

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.540 
course I wanted a lot of strength
because<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.199> Tesla<00:00:45.620> balls<00:00:45.860> the<00:00:46.100> grenades

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
because the Tesla balls the grenades

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.890 
because the Tesla balls the grenades
themself<00:00:47.830> deal<00:00:49.239> electricity<00:00:50.239> damage<00:00:50.720> and

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 
themself deal electricity damage and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.640 
themself deal electricity damage and
they<00:00:51.110> can<00:00:51.350> deal<00:00:51.559> up<00:00:51.830> to<00:00:52.120> 1500<00:00:53.120> damage<00:00:53.510> but<00:00:53.809> this

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
they can deal up to 1500 damage but this

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.670 
they can deal up to 1500 damage but this
bill<00:00:54.890> does<00:00:55.250> not<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.670> build<00:00:55.940> only<00:00:56.420> does<00:00:56.680> 850

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
bill does not this build only does 850

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.360 
bill does not this build only does 850
damage<00:00:58.040> but<00:00:58.250> still<00:00:58.519> that's<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.479> lot<00:00:59.949> also<00:01:00.949> I<00:01:00.979> got

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
Tesla's at once now and let's check it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.219 
Tesla's at once now and let's check it
out<00:01:32.329> right<00:01:32.390> now

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229

out right now
here<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.219> a<00:01:34.250> defense<00:01:34.880> mission<00:01:35.359> and<00:01:35.539> here<00:01:36.469> is

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
here is a defense mission and here is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.319 
here is a defense mission and here is
the<00:01:36.859> thing<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:37.100> need<00:01:37.369> to<00:01:37.399> defend<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.210> of

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
course all my Tesla balls are going on

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:43.179 
course all my Tesla balls are going on
the<00:01:41.420> ground<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.049> can<00:01:42.289> see<00:01:42.530> the<00:01:42.740> Tesla

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
the ground and you can see the Tesla

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.389 
the ground and you can see the Tesla
links<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:45.170> people<00:01:45.500> walk<00:01:45.859> over<00:01:46.250> them

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
links and when people walk over them

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.989 
links and when people walk over them
they<00:01:46.969> immediately<00:01:47.509> die<00:01:47.929> and<00:01:48.579> that<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:49.789> the

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
they immediately die and that is the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.410 
they immediately die and that is the
point<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.630> build<00:01:51.189> did<00:01:52.189> is<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> perfect

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
point of this build did is a perfect

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.370 
point of this build did is a perfect
defense<00:01:54.039> mechanism<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:56.240> it<00:01:56.719> works<00:01:57.109> perfectly

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
defense mechanism but it works perfectly

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.800 
defense mechanism but it works perfectly
against<00:01:58.159> enemies<00:01:58.579> walk<00:01:58.969> over<00:01:59.390> them<00:01:59.600> like

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
against enemies walk over them like

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:10.749 
against enemies walk over them like
enemies<00:02:00.710> who<00:02:00.859> are<00:02:00.950> disarmed<00:02:01.520> or<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.030> affected

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.180 

now<00:02:11.330> let's<00:02:11.659> see<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:11.989> kind<00:02:12.230> of<00:02:12.349> damage<00:02:12.650> these

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
now let's see what kind of damage these

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.089 
now let's see what kind of damage these
balls<00:02:13.519> do<00:02:13.790> even<00:02:14.540> when<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.200> enemy<00:02:15.650> does<00:02:15.890> not

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
balls do even when the enemy does not

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.680 
balls do even when the enemy does not
walk<00:02:16.340> over<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:18.700> look<00:02:19.700> at<00:02:19.819> all<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> damage<00:02:20.330> look

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
walk over it look at all the damage look

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.020 
walk over it look at all the damage look
at<00:02:20.810> those<00:02:20.959> numbers<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:22.159> must<00:02:22.459> be<00:02:22.549> not<00:02:22.819> doing

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
at those numbers that must be not doing

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.430 
at those numbers that must be not doing
something<00:02:23.450> right<00:02:23.629> right<00:02:25.870> here<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.019> can<00:02:27.230> see

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.949 
something right right here you can see
an<00:02:27.590> exodus<00:02:28.099> taking<00:02:28.640> all<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:29.060> damage<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
an exodus taking all the damage of the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:54.390 
an exodus taking all the damage of the
Tesla<00:02:30.440> link<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:30.980> died<00:02:31.700> immediately

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.030

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
and here you can see the Tesla link

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.000 
and here you can see the Tesla link
working<00:02:57.549> perfectly<00:02:58.120> but<00:02:58.269> the<00:02:59.140> electricity

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
working perfectly but the electricity
