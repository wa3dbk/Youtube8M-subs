00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 friends from youtube I'm from time and 4 and today 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.340
 I bring you a video where you will be taught 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.430
 make another hidden door more but that to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.410
 I loved it and that we are going to proceed 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.439
 see it is worth how you see this would be the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.449
 inside a normal house current 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.779
 where there is a hole with some 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.430
 stairs to go downstairs 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.900
 this is not very worked is good the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.780
 lower floor where there is a room 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.210
 spells the typical room a booklet 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.030
 in shelves on the sides a lamp 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.600
 to illuminate but if we take a 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.000
 reston torch we put it there we are 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 open a passage 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.550
 and we close it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.820
 is already perfect we have entered into a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.510
 hidden room that nobody sees we left 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.740
 we close with our key 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.990
 and as if nothing had happened 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.140
 now I'm going to teach you how to 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.990
 make 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.770
 well now I will show you how to build 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.270
 the door well as you see I have already done 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.729
 that would be the typical room 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.530
 enchantments but I'm missing the table 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.680
 spells that good is not 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.720
 important for the tutorial 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.830
 here is going to be where we are going to put the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.050
 torch then we take and put in 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.050
 this piston team there we two 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.170
 then 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.790
 We put the shelf that will cover the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.330
 hole 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.900
 a block there 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.900
 a torch 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.720
 repeater 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.720
 now we upload the reston signal 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.730
 the rest 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.550
 there we put another one of rest 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.970
 we have this 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.460
 and we put a repeater well to finish 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 we have to put a block there and remove 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 this from there as you see this has already come out 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.130
 and here it would be normal to put on putting 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.819
 a torch 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.660
 gets inside that 's active 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.110
 by putting another one takes off well 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.530
 now to make the door hidden 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.460
 to make the door 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.110
 the pistons here 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.670
 the two shelves that will trap him 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.840
 as you will see I am doing it in the 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:38.010
 corner because it's so much easier than 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.010
 what to do in the middle 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.000
 so 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.010
 we take here and put a block here 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.400
 another block and this will be to activate those 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.040
 pistons 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.909
 and we raise the signal of the rest as 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.909
 in a healthy way 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.910
 we got out of here 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.090
 and we unite it 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.080
 with any type of block 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.150
 we got this right here but 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.720
 this we want that when I'm in this 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.150
 position 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 this is also closed then here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.880
 what we do is put a door is not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.700
 say a block 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.030
 one of the rest 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:25.269
 so this has been closed and this 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.520
 I'm also going to put a torch 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.490
 will open 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.410
 on the other it will close 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.690
 now how do we make the mechanism 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.590
 so that when we enter we can 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.590
 also close and open we go this 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.760
 normal 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.510
 and we put here two of two blocks and one 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.510
 lever 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.579
 and the red stone and we carry the network 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.579
 lever stand 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.970
 the light 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.330
 until 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.030
 here 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.090
 here we put a sticky piston 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.990
 and any one block is worth then 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.700
 the lever will come out and it will rise activate 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:21.340
 that and this will open 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.180
 and we can close it like that to enter 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.610
 get in 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.350
 and we close and the good thing is that you can 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.850
 do it on a multiplayer server because 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.039
 you are with another player and go back to 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.199
 enter while you are inside 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.729
 you can keep going back in and 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.710
 close 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.400
 followed inside exit 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.400
 they close 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.820
 come back out 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:50.630
 and I close again 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:53.420
 and this is super useful 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.020
 but if you want to do it with the door in 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.500
 medium 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.129
 the system would be a little more complicated 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.129
 what would this be 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.740
 repeaters in this way the external network 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.669
 if you work here and a repeater 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.750
 there and you need four stick and pistons 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.750
 two stick and pistons here 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.060
 shelves as you see this would be the 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.320
 system 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:29.870
 the result is very similar 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.360
 had happened that is the means 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.880
 but the truth that is not worth it is 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.670
 better that system 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.160
 I hope you liked serve him 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.520
 to like favorites and subscribe to what is 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.300
 all free and see you in another video 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.300
 until another
