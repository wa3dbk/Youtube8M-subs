00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
they might be okay but that the wheels

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.420 
they might be okay but that the wheels
are<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.030> let

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430

in<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> back<00:03:35.799> now<00:03:36.459> if<00:03:36.549> you<00:03:36.669> notice<00:03:36.939> on<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
in the back now if you notice on the

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.289 
in the back now if you notice on the
mice<00:03:38.379> tow<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.769> does<00:03:39.069> have<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.340> really<00:03:39.729> defined

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
mice tow this does have a really defined

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.479 
mice tow this does have a really defined
seam<00:03:40.689> right<00:03:40.989> here<00:03:41.049> I<00:03:41.470> first<00:03:42.069> thought<00:03:42.310> that

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
seam right here I first thought that

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:45.420 
seam right here I first thought that
this<00:03:42.579> may<00:03:42.909> open<00:03:43.329> up<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:44.680> seam<00:03:44.979> did<00:03:45.280> not

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
this may open up but the seam did not

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.610 
this may open up but the seam did not
extend<00:03:45.669> up<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.269> hatch<00:03:46.449> up<00:03:46.840> here<00:03:47.259> to<00:03:47.470> where

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
extend up to the hatch up here to where

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.770 
extend up to the hatch up here to where
it<00:03:47.650> would<00:03:47.859> open<00:03:47.979> its<00:03:48.970> just<00:03:49.150> how<00:03:49.329> the<00:03:49.389> vehicle

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
it would open its just how the vehicle

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.300 
it would open its just how the vehicle
is<00:03:49.840> put<00:03:50.019> together<00:03:50.139> I<00:03:50.560> guess<00:03:50.769> how<00:03:50.919> their<00:03:51.069> mold

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
is put together I guess how their mold

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.909 
is put together I guess how their mold
is<00:03:51.579> but<00:03:52.359> at<00:03:52.449> some<00:03:52.689> nice<00:03:52.780> touch<00:03:53.109> to<00:03:53.319> me<00:03:53.439> gives<00:03:53.769> it

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:53.919 
is but at some nice touch to me gives it

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.280 
is but at some nice touch to me gives it
more<00:03:54.069> character

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
more character

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.740 
more character
Hot<00:03:56.290> Wheels<00:03:56.340> not<00:03:57.340> much<00:03:57.579> definition<00:03:58.120> on<00:03:58.479> any<00:03:58.659> of

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
Hot Wheels not much definition on any of

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.249 
Hot Wheels not much definition on any of
the<00:03:58.810> body<00:03:58.989> lines<00:04:00.689> alright<00:04:01.689> let's<00:04:01.870> take<00:04:02.019> a<00:04:02.079> look

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:02.259 
the body lines alright let's take a look

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.960 
the body lines alright let's take a look
at<00:04:02.379> the<00:04:02.470> underside<00:04:02.919> of<00:04:02.949> each<00:04:03.189> vehicle

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.729 

underside<00:04:06.970> as<00:04:07.900> you<00:04:08.139> would<00:04:08.259> expect<00:04:08.349> on<00:04:08.709> a

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
underside as you would expect on a

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.409 
underside as you would expect on a
Corvette<00:04:09.159> there<00:04:09.310> really<00:04:09.430> isn't<00:04:09.669> a<00:04:09.849> lot<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:10.060> see

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
Corvette there really isn't a lot to see

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:11.879 
Corvette there really isn't a lot to see
under<00:04:10.659> a<00:04:10.689> Corvette<00:04:11.109> if<00:04:11.229> you<00:04:11.319> looked<00:04:11.530> under<00:04:11.650> one

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
under a Corvette if you looked under one

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:14.189 
under a Corvette if you looked under one
in<00:04:11.979> real<00:04:12.129> life<00:04:12.189> and<00:04:12.669> see<00:04:12.959> its<00:04:13.959> very

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
in real life and see its very

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.740 
in real life and see its very
aerodynamic<00:04:14.560> underneath<00:04:15.340> you<00:04:16.299> can<00:04:16.449> see<00:04:16.630> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
aerodynamic underneath you can see the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.399 
aerodynamic underneath you can see the
suspension<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.470> both<00:04:18.659> and<00:04:19.659> this<00:04:19.989> this

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:20.409 
suspension on both and this this

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:24.629 
suspension on both and this this
normally<00:04:20.829> is<00:04:21.479> flat<00:04:23.250> everything<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.340> encased

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
normally is flat everything is encased

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.380 
normally is flat everything is encased
underneath

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.390 

so<00:04:28.390> there's<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:28.660> look<00:04:28.840> at<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.400> underneath

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
so there's a look at the underneath

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800 
so there's a look at the underneath
let's<00:04:30.880> take<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> look<00:04:31.300> at<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.480> rear<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.720> the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
let's take a look at the rear of the

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.200 
let's take a look at the rear of the
vehicle<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:33.190> rear<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.640> think<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:34.120> is

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
vehicle and the rear I think this is

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.610 
vehicle and the rear I think this is
where<00:04:34.360> the<00:04:34.450> mind<00:04:34.630> still<00:04:34.840> shines<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.260> little<00:04:35.380> bit

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
where the mind still shines a little bit

say this is just a bad tampo printing on
this<00:05:12.880> even<00:05:13.660> if<00:05:13.750> you<00:05:13.870> move<00:05:14.110> these<00:05:14.350> over<00:05:14.770> if<00:05:14.860> you

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
this even if you move these over if you

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.240 
this even if you move these over if you
imagine<00:05:15.280> these<00:05:15.610> being<00:05:15.910> moved<00:05:16.120> over<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:18.130> would

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
imagine these being moved over it would

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.810 
imagine these being moved over it would
be<00:05:18.400> silver<00:05:18.820> taillights<00:05:20.160> with<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.190> little<00:05:21.670> black

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
be silver taillights with a little black

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.750 
be silver taillights with a little black
trim<00:05:22.180> on<00:05:23.020> either<00:05:23.230> side<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.890> do<00:05:24.130> like<00:05:24.520> the

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
trim on either side I do like the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.030 
trim on either side I do like the
Corvette<00:05:25.630> emblem<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.140> little<00:05:26.350> bit<00:05:26.470> better<00:05:26.620> this

bigger<00:05:27.370> portion<00:05:27.820> here<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.030> think<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.420> would

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
bigger portion here I think that would

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.080 
bigger portion here I think that would
look<00:05:28.570> good<00:05:28.870> over<00:05:29.140> here<00:05:29.170> and<00:05:30.010> it<00:05:30.640> doesn't<00:05:30.970> it's
