we're<00:00:00.329> gonna<00:00:00.450> air<00:00:01.319> check<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:02.510> fitting<00:00:03.510> right

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
we're gonna air check this fitting right

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.480 
we're gonna air check this fitting right
here<00:00:03.929> they<00:00:04.110> call<00:00:04.290> it<00:00:04.410> an<00:00:04.529> STC<00:00:04.980> finning<00:00:07.490> by

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
here they call it an STC finning by

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.660 
using pressurized air OOP let's throw
some<00:00:14.759> air<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.269> it

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
some air to it

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:26.930 
some air to it
let's<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.060> we<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.360> now<00:00:25.610> about<00:00:26.610> putting

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:26.940 
let's see what we got now about putting

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.720 
let's see what we got now about putting
air<00:00:28.580> into<00:00:29.580> G<00:00:30.030> high<00:00:30.210> pressure<00:00:30.510> oil<00:00:30.840> insist

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
air into G high pressure oil insist

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.170 
air into G high pressure oil insist
high-pressure<00:00:32.900> injection<00:00:33.900> oiling<00:00:34.890> system<00:00:35.180> we

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
high-pressure injection oiling system we

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.240 
high-pressure injection oiling system we
can<00:00:36.300> determine<00:00:36.630> where<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.320> leak<00:00:37.650> is<00:00:39.980> like<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
can determine where the leak is like so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.000 
can determine where the leak is like so
this<00:00:41.580> particular<00:00:42.270> vehicle<00:00:42.750> has<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.620> common

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this particular vehicle has that common

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.910 
this particular vehicle has that common
problem<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.630> style<00:00:46.050> fitting

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.100 

okay<00:00:50.920> well<00:00:51.160> we<00:00:51.309> have<00:00:51.340> here

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.230 

you<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.200> here<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.550> old<00:00:56.700> connector

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
you have here is the the old connector

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.760 
you have here is the the old connector
I've<00:00:57.450> unscrewed<00:00:57.990> out<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.290> the<00:00:58.380> high-pressure

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
I've unscrewed out of the high-pressure

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.620 
I've unscrewed out of the high-pressure
pump<00:00:59.780> goes<00:01:00.780> right<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.200> hole<00:01:01.470> right<00:01:01.830> here<00:01:02.630> okay

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
pump goes right now hole right here okay

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.810 
pump goes right now hole right here okay
I've<00:01:03.870> unscrewed<00:01:04.380> that<00:01:04.460> after<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.550> moving

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
I've unscrewed that after we're moving

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.080 
I've unscrewed that after we're moving
it<00:01:05.910> out<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> vehicle<00:01:07.340> I'm<00:01:08.340> bolted<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.850> from

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
it out of the vehicle I'm bolted it from

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.530 
it out of the vehicle I'm bolted it from
the<00:01:09.180> branch<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:10.640> okay<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.020> snap<00:01:14.010> together

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
the branch to okay this is snap together

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.170 
the branch to okay this is snap together
STC<00:01:15.540> fitting<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.020> call<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.490> very<00:01:17.490> loose<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
STC fitting they call it very loose and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.000 
STC fitting they call it very loose and
if<00:01:18.330> we<00:01:18.480> look<00:01:18.660> right

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.310 

okay<00:01:23.550> you<00:01:23.610> can<00:01:23.790> see<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.120> blown<00:01:24.450> out<00:01:24.690> what

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
okay you can see it's blown out what

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
okay you can see it's blown out what
happens<00:01:25.620> this<00:01:25.800> is<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.130> o-ring<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.910> clip

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
happens this is the o-ring and the clip

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.540 
happens this is the o-ring and the clip
break<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:28.620> then<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.860> lose<00:01:29.040> pressure<00:01:29.750> ok<00:01:31.550> now

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
break and then we lose pressure ok now

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.710 
break and then we lose pressure ok now
the<00:01:33.330> updated<00:01:33.990> version<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> latest

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the updated version this the latest

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.160 
the updated version this the latest
updated<00:01:37.290> version<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.040> one-piece<00:01:38.490> unit

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.170 

and<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.950> works<00:01:44.220> pretty<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.030> doesn't

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and this works pretty good it doesn't

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.429 
and this works pretty good it doesn't
come<00:01:45.420> apart<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> international<00:01:49.170> peace

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
come apart is the international peace

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.480 
come apart is the international peace
that<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:49.860> finally<00:01:50.159> brought<00:01:50.520> over<00:01:51.530> so<00:01:52.530> it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that they finally brought over so it's

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
that they finally brought over so it's
what<00:01:54.090> we're<00:01:54.180> gonna<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.479> we're<00:01:54.600> gonna<00:01:54.720> install

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
what we're gonna do we're gonna install

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.610 
what we're gonna do we're gonna install
this<00:01:55.590> into<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> pump<00:01:56.220> right<00:01:57.210> here

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.130 

put<00:02:00.920> it<00:02:01.010> together

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.810 

that<00:02:03.350> should<00:02:03.590> do<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:04.330> that's<00:02:05.330> where<00:02:05.540> we're<00:02:05.720> at
