Namaskar.
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:11.927
Today we will prepare Banana Cutlets which are very delicious.

00:00:12.194 --> 00:00:22.938
You can make these as a tea time snack, for any party or during fasts.

00:00:23.618 --> 00:00:26.413
Banana Cutlets can be made in 2 ways :

00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:29.384
a)by only using bananas

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.541
b)by adding potatoes.

00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:39.490
Ingredients required :

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:42.695
Bananas - 5

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:46.905
Potato - 1 if small in size then we can also use 2 of them.

00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:50.464
Corn flour - 2 tbsp

00:00:50.936 --> 00:00:59.259
Ginger - 1" long piece(grated or 1 tsp ginger paste)

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.976
Green chillies - 2(finely chopped)

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.748
Green coriander - 2 to 3 tbsp (finely chopped)

00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:07.643
Oil - 1/4 cup

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.361
Salt - 1/2 tsp or add to taste

00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:15.078
Black pepper - 1/4 tsp

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:20.575
First of all we will boil bananas to prepare the cutlets.

00:01:20.857 --> 00:01:23.658
Potato has already been boiled.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:28.313
Put bananas in a cooker

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.480
bananas and potatoes should not be boiled together as bananas boil very quickly while potato takes a little longer.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:44.983
If you are using a big cooker then put bananas separately in a utensil and pour water below.

00:01:45.176 --> 00:01:49.505
Close the cooker and boil bananas till 1 whistle goes off.

00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:52.420
If cooker is small then we can not keep a utensil in it

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:55.978
so the bananas must be put in directly along with some water.

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:02.587
If we put excess amount of water then the bananas soak it.

00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:04.846
Hence we will add 1/4 cup of water.

00:02:11.092 --> 00:02:13.807
Boil bananas till 1 whistle goes off.

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:17.810
Now that the whistle has gone off turn off the gas.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:24.990
Remove half of the cooker's pressure as this amount is sufficient for the bananas.

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:30.305
As the remaining pressure is released take out bananas from the cooker.

00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:32.525
Check bananas after the pressure escapes

00:02:41.108 --> 00:02:44.831
they are boiled so remove them from the cooker and set aside to cool.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.697
Till then let us peel the potato

00:02:57.737 --> 00:03:00.911
potatoes and bananas can also be cooked in the microwave.

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:13.578
Set microwave for 4 1/2-5 minutes and potatoes will be cooked and ready while bananas take almost 3 minutes.

00:03:14.158 --> 00:03:16.119
Mash the potato thoroughly

00:03:19.578 --> 00:03:43.242
Also peel and finely mash the bananas.

00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.771
Now add corn flour

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:57.788
if you are making cutlets for a fast then use kuttu or singhada flour instead of corn flour.

00:03:58.983 --> 00:04:04.764
use saindha salt in place of plain salt.

00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:26.659
Add green chillies, ginger, green coriander, black pepper and mix all the ingredients thoroughly.

00:04:27.403 --> 00:04:30.252
Mixture required for cutlets is ready.

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:33.493
Now we will begin making the cutlets.

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.069
Turn on the gas allow pan to heat.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:49.033
Apply some oil on your hands making them smooth and take mixture according to the desired size of cutlet.

00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:57.287
Round mixture into a round shape, press with your hand to make the cutlet round.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:10.474
We have prepared all the cutlets and the pan is also sufficiently heated.

00:05:10.878 --> 00:05:12.402
Pour oil in pan

00:05:12.737 --> 00:05:15.896
cutlets can be fried in two ways

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:18.812
a)shallow fry cutlets with less oil

00:05:19.466 --> 00:05:24.283
or b)deep fry in much oil.

00:05:24.471 --> 00:05:28.003
Here we are frying cutlets using less oil.

00:05:28.143 --> 00:05:40.237
Place cutlets in the pan and fry on a low flame till they turn golden brown.

00:05:48.704 --> 00:05:53.331
Turn cutlets over after they turn brown on the lower surface.

00:05:55.957 --> 00:06:00.410
Fry cutlets till they turn brown on both sides.

00:06:01.097 --> 00:06:05.137
Now that the cutlets have turned brown take them out and keep aside.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:24.786
Similarly fry the remaining cutlets in the pan which still has some oil.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:31.691
The cutlets are fried and prepared.

00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:34.226
Banana Cutlets are ready

00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:38.046
these cutlets have been shallow fried.

00:06:38.486 --> 00:06:44.256
If you want to deep fry the cutlets then be a bit cautious while doing so.

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.636
Cutlets should not break open while frying.

00:06:47.384 --> 00:06:57.431
If we have added less corn starch or corn flour to the bananas then cutlets may break open in oil while frying.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.892
If your cutlets are breaking then add some more corn starch to the mixture.

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:11.444
Put cutlets in pan only after oil is sufficiently heated.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:17.784
If oil is cool then cutlets tend to absorb a lot of oil themselves.

00:07:18.179 --> 00:07:21.623
Just stay a bit cautious and cutlets will turn out very nice.

00:07:22.048 --> 00:07:27.429
Serve Banana Cutlets with tomato sauce or green coriander chutney.

00:07:27.593 --> 00:07:34.568
