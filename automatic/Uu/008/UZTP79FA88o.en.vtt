you<00:02:15.470> like<00:02:15.530> it<00:02:15.830> I<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.100> kind<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.760> medium<00:02:17.090> to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
you like it I like it kind of medium to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.640 
you like it I like it kind of medium to
medium-high<00:02:17.569> heat<00:02:17.720> so<00:02:18.080> I'm<00:02:18.170> using<00:02:18.350> three

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
medium-high heat so I'm using three

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.490 
medium-high heat so I'm using three
tablespoons<00:02:19.310> and<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:20.930> using<00:02:21.140> this

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
tablespoons and I like using this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.380 
tablespoons and I like using this
because<00:02:21.980> traditionally<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.030> least<00:02:23.270> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
because traditionally that least the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.840 
because traditionally that least the
kung<00:02:23.630> pao<00:02:23.660> tofu<00:02:23.900> always<00:02:24.709> had<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.340> red<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
kung pao tofu always had the red the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.610 
kung pao tofu always had the red the
whole<00:02:26.060> red<00:02:26.240> chili<00:02:26.510> peppers<00:02:26.930> in<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.470> had

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
whole red chili peppers in it but I had

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.650 
whole red chili peppers in it but I had
an<00:02:27.740> experience<00:02:28.250> where<00:02:28.459> once<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.240> bite<00:02:29.450> into

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
an experience where once you bite into

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.059 
an experience where once you bite into
one<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.989> never<00:02:30.350> want<00:02:30.590> to<00:02:30.680> bite<00:02:30.800> into<00:02:30.920> one

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
one you never want to bite into one

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.710 
one you never want to bite into one
again<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.610> at<00:02:31.730> least<00:02:31.880> this<00:02:32.120> gets<00:02:32.360> incorporated

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
again so at least this gets incorporated

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.150 
again so at least this gets incorporated
in<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.140> sauce<00:02:33.410> and<00:02:33.650> it<00:02:33.739> makes<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.069> little

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
in the sauce and it makes it a little

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.760 
in the sauce and it makes it a little
bit<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:34.459> uniform<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.480> actually<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:36.080> lot

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
bit more uniform and it's actually a lot

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.830 
bit more uniform and it's actually a lot
easier
