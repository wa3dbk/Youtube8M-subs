00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.209
 Hi, I'm a liner and this time I 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.799
 I would like to give you some ideas about 

00:00:05.209 --> 00:00:08.719
 games you can do with your 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.210
 small so that he learns to master the 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.400
 use of his hands although at three or 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.340
 four years children are already capable of 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:19.070
 manipulate small objects to classify 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.050
 to paint they still have a lot to do 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.390
 learn from using pencils 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.720
 fasten a button to tie yourself 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.090
 shoelaces and so on playing will learn 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.740
 much faster the hands are the 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.110
 parts of the body that help us 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.180
 explore the world and the more you practice 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.320
 in the children with them more agile they go to 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.480
 be 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.460
 These are some of the activities that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.770
 we can encourage our children at home 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:47.440
 to help them master the skill 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.440
 manual is like this always without forcing them 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.420
 which helps in homework that helps you 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.780
 to tend the clothes giving the tweezers to 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.820
 set the table to pick up your order plate 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.010
 the books in your room by size or 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.159
 well the threads by colors in the box 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.690
 sewing that plays with marbles always and 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.479
 when there is an adult supervision 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.820
 that pushes them to make them go up 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.520
 make them lower by unevenness that enter 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.410
 by tubes that leave another activity that 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.750
 you can do is to help you in the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.390
 kitchen decorating maybe a pay to a 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.750
 cake with pieces of fruit with 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 chocolate or with legs 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.850
 a very father activity is to guess 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.370
 touching that they put in a bag objects 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.200
 varied for example a sponge a 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.540
 cotton a sock they have 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.520
 Different textures invite your child 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.670
 Put your hand in the bag and try to 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.619
 guess what it is without seeing of course 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.470
 make a collage at this age they love 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.330
 collect from stones mugs prints 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.430
 and can print some pictures 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.440
 family and together make a nice 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.840
 mural that serves to decorate your room 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.270
 forget about the colored markers 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.610
 Astra I would like them and let your son paint with 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.190
 his fingers that he dedicates to paint with 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.260
 his little hands that if he puts a shirt 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.750
 old woman on top of her clothes so she would notice 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.000
 a gold stain you can also give 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.830
 tools to screw or 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
 unscrew pieces of a size of 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.970
 Ferrari frames that are toy or 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.940
 make towers or some structures 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.130
 easy to assemble and disassemble modeling with 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.860
 plasticine with clay love 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.080
 You can also do a theater with 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.880
 puppets at home with some socks 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.010
 old or if you have some animals 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.540
 together they can put together a play and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.090
 that helps them move a lot their 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.610
 little fingers or just something very simple 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.050
 play with a yoyo these are some 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.060
 activities you can do with your 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.070
 son at home and that is definitely going to 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.380
 help to manipulate their 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.750
 I'm a lucky nerd and remember 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.560
 The best way to educate is always to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.560
 through the example
