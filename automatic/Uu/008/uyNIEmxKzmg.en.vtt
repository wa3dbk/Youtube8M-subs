under<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:10.980> lot<00:00:11.190> of<00:00:11.219> pressure<00:00:11.519> as<00:00:11.790> you'd<00:00:12.000> expect

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
under a lot of pressure as you'd expect

under a lot of pressure as you'd expect
the<00:00:13.080> pitch<00:00:13.259> wasn't<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.219> best<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.670> terms<00:00:14.820> of

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
the pitch wasn't the best in terms of

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630 
the pitch wasn't the best in terms of
flowing<00:00:15.389> football<00:00:15.570> but<00:00:16.320> we<00:00:17.220> played<00:00:17.430> quite

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
flowing football but we played quite

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.029 
flowing football but we played quite
narrow<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.180> forced<00:00:18.960> them<00:00:19.050> white<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.529> then<00:00:19.920> we

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
narrow we forced them white and then we

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.849 
narrow we forced them white and then we
dealt<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.400> crosses<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.769> with<00:00:22.769> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
dealt with a crosses and with the

dealt with a crosses and with the
frontier<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.850> we<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.390> always

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
frontier with that we have we always

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.599 
frontier with that we have we always
felt<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> threat<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.519> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
was a tough one and now for us anyway 75

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.559 
was a tough one and now for us anyway 75
points<00:02:17.980> with<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.190> game<00:02:19.370> left<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.850> home<00:02:20.030> game<00:02:20.300> we

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
points with one game left a home game we

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.540 
points with one game left a home game we
want<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.840> finish<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.290> strong<00:02:21.500> as<00:02:21.620> we<00:02:21.740> can<00:02:21.950> get

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
want to finish as strong as we can get

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.420 
want to finish as strong as we can get
on<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.819> 78<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.600> then<00:02:23.750> overall<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:25.010> think<00:02:25.250> will

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
on to 78 and then overall I think will

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.979 
on to 78 and then overall I think will
be<00:02:25.520> very<00:02:25.550> unlucky<00:02:26.090> if<00:02:26.330> that<00:02:26.450> doesn't<00:02:26.750> get<00:02:26.840> us<00:02:26.900> a

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
be very unlucky if that doesn't get us a

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:35.910 
be very unlucky if that doesn't get us a
playoff<00:02:27.290> spot

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.980
