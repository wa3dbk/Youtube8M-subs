bit<00:02:35.459> more<00:02:35.640> interesting<00:02:36.180> make<00:02:36.690> it<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> bit<00:02:36.989> more

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
bit more interesting make it a bit more

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.550 
bit more interesting make it a bit more

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
know the 60 seconds the 90 seconds 120

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.560 
know the 60 seconds the 90 seconds 120
seconds<00:02:43.980> which<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.370> may<00:02:44.520> be<00:02:44.580> getting<00:02:44.850> on<00:02:45.510> a

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
normal side plank it just makes the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.130 
normal side plank it just makes the
exercise<00:02:50.010> more<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.450> know<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.020> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
exercise more of a you know more of a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:04.370 
exercise more of a you know more of a
set<00:02:52.380> really<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:52.920> terms<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.250> reps<00:03:03.170> another<00:03:04.170> key

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
set really in terms of reps another key

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.440 
set really in terms of reps another key
thing<00:03:04.590> for<00:03:04.650> core<00:03:04.950> strength<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.450> rotation

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
thing for core strength is rotation

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.160 
thing for core strength is rotation
movements<00:03:07.580> we've<00:03:08.580> hit<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.030> ABS<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.930> lower

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
movements we've hit the ABS the lower

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.170 
movements we've hit the ABS the lower
back<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:11.040> sides<00:03:11.670> which<00:03:11.940> are<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
back and the sides which are the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.300 
back and the sides which are the
obliques<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.320> now<00:03:13.500> we're<00:03:13.709> hitting<00:03:13.799> them<00:03:14.190> all

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
obliques so now we're hitting them all

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.670 
obliques so now we're hitting them all
pretty<00:03:14.640> much<00:03:14.760> together<00:03:15.470> we're<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.650> make

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
pretty much together we're going to make

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.319 
pretty much together we're going to make
sure<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.070> the<00:03:17.190> gluts<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:17.670> heels<00:03:17.910> are

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
sure that the gluts and the heels are

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.060 
sure that the gluts and the heels are
the<00:03:18.570> only<00:03:18.720> kind<00:03:19.079> of<00:03:19.110> contact<00:03:19.590> point<00:03:19.799> to<00:03:19.950> the

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
the only kind of contact point to the

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.340 
the only kind of contact point to the
floor<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.600> what<00:03:21.600> you're<00:03:21.720> simply<00:03:21.989> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> do

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
floor and what you're simply going to do

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.370 
floor and what you're simply going to do
is<00:03:22.470> get<00:03:22.620> a<00:03:22.850> comfortable<00:03:23.850> medicine<00:03:24.630> ball<00:03:24.780> the

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
is get a comfortable medicine ball the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.100 
is get a comfortable medicine ball the
one<00:03:25.500> I'm<00:03:25.620> holding<00:03:25.769> weighs<00:03:26.070> 5<00:03:26.370> kilos<00:03:26.760> and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
one I'm holding weighs 5 kilos and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.940 
one I'm holding weighs 5 kilos and
you're<00:03:28.110> basically<00:03:28.350> going<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> swing<00:03:28.769> from

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
you're basically going to swing from

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.210 
you're basically going to swing from
side<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.220> side<00:03:30.709> it's<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.799> good<00:03:31.920> idea<00:03:32.040> to

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
side to side it's a good idea to

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.580 
side to side it's a good idea to
experiment<00:03:33.180> with<00:03:33.510> your<00:03:33.570> feet<00:03:33.810> as<00:03:34.049> you'll<00:03:34.350> see

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
experiment with your feet as you'll see

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.569 
experiment with your feet as you'll see
me<00:03:34.769> do<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.489> moment<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:38.220> was<00:03:38.430> really

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
me do in one moment so it was really

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.039 
me do in one moment so it was really
uncomfortable<00:03:38.880> for<00:03:39.239> me<00:03:39.329> to<00:03:39.450> put<00:03:39.570> my<00:03:39.660> feet<00:03:39.870> flat

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
uncomfortable for me to put my feet flat

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.390 
uncomfortable for me to put my feet flat
on<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.200> floor<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:41.130> was<00:03:41.220> quite

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
on the floor and it was quite

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.949 
on the floor and it was quite
uncomfortable<00:03:41.700> for<00:03:42.030> me<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.180> my<00:03:42.450> feet<00:03:42.600> straight

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
uncomfortable for me to my feet straight

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:51.750 
uncomfortable for me to my feet straight
so<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.380> found<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.769> neutral

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.980 

the<00:03:52.760> final<00:03:53.150> exercise<00:03:53.360> I'm<00:03:53.660> going<00:03:53.780> to<00:03:53.840> show<00:03:53.959> you

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
the final exercise I'm going to show you

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.790 
the final exercise I'm going to show you
guys<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.530> an<00:03:54.650> adaptation<00:03:54.920> of<00:03:55.459> knee<00:03:55.880> raises

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
guys is an adaptation of knee raises

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.080 
guys is an adaptation of knee raises
they<00:03:57.800> are<00:03:57.920> called<00:03:58.130> hanging<00:03:58.490> hurdles<00:03:58.880> and

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
they are called hanging hurdles and

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.449 
they are called hanging hurdles and
basically<00:03:59.660> again<00:04:00.230> make<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.040> exercise<00:04:01.430> a

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
basically again make the exercise a

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.100 
basically again make the exercise a
little<00:04:01.640> bit<00:04:01.790> more<00:04:01.880> advanced<00:04:02.360> but<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.930> little

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
little bit more advanced but a little

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.290 
little bit more advanced but a little
bit<00:04:03.200> more<00:04:03.320> fun<00:04:03.500> to<00:04:03.650> do<00:04:03.770> as<00:04:03.890> well<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.250> instead<00:04:05.240> of

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
bit more fun to do as well so instead of

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.330 
bit more fun to do as well so instead of
taking<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.690> knees<00:04:05.870> directly<00:04:06.170> up<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.740> down<00:04:06.920> up

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
taking the knees directly up and down up

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.610 
taking the knees directly up and down up
and<00:04:07.700> down<00:04:07.730> what<00:04:08.630> we're<00:04:08.750> doing<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.080> taking<00:04:09.290> it

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and down what we're doing is taking it

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.280 
and down what we're doing is taking it
up<00:04:09.920> and<00:04:10.310> to<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.760> other<00:04:10.850> side<00:04:11.180> up<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.080> to<00:04:12.260> the

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
up and to the other side up and to the

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.160 
up and to the other side up and to the
other<00:04:12.500> side<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:14.060> essentially<00:04:14.810> we're<00:04:15.020> using

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
other side so essentially we're using

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.130 
other side so essentially we're using
the<00:04:15.380> bench<00:04:15.650> as<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.980> hurdle<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:17.049> we're<00:04:18.049> actually

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
the bench as a hurdle and we're actually

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.530 
the bench as a hurdle and we're actually
holding<00:04:18.530> onto<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:19.880> bar<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.269> pull<00:04:20.450> up

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
holding onto the bar in a pull up

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.080 
holding onto the bar in a pull up
position<00:04:20.930> which<00:04:21.410> will<00:04:21.590> actually<00:04:21.940> benefit<00:04:22.940> our

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
position which will actually benefit our

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.750 
position which will actually benefit our
pull<00:04:23.360> up<00:04:23.450> strength<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.990> luck<00:04:24.200> strength

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
pull up strength and luck strength

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.060 
pull up strength and luck strength
instead<00:04:25.760> of<00:04:26.169> using<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.440> actual<00:04:27.560> machines

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
instead of using the actual machines

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.270 
instead of using the actual machines
which<00:04:28.310> are<00:04:28.430> made<00:04:28.640> for<00:04:28.910> leg<00:04:29.150> raises<00:04:29.680> which<00:04:30.680> you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
which are made for leg raises which you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.830 
which are made for leg raises which you
know<00:04:31.400> you're<00:04:31.730> resting<00:04:32.060> on<00:04:32.090> your<00:04:32.240> elbows<00:04:32.570> it's

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
know you're resting on your elbows it's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.900 
know you're resting on your elbows it's
a<00:04:32.900> bit<00:04:33.020> easier<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:34.100> engages<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.669> core<00:04:34.850> a

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
a bit easier this engages the core a

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.120 
a bit easier this engages the core a
little<00:04:35.180> bit<00:04:35.270> more<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.660> you<00:04:36.560> know<00:04:36.650> we'll<00:04:36.980> give

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
little bit more and you know we'll give

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.730 
little bit more and you know we'll give
you<00:04:37.250> overall<00:04:37.820> better<00:04:38.000> results<00:04:38.510> which<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.620> what
