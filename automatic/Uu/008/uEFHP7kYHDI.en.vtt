 I want as you are welcome again to 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.360
 my channel through the streets we could 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.570
 do a tutorial on how to change the 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.010
 balatas un solo 3/2004 and so it is that if 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.590
 they like the video forward 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.570
 let's start losing before we wanted 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.710
 tell them that he is the fan of the 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.710
 yankees de new york 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.740
 Check my hat just before and before 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 to begin they reacted the turns also 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.399
 play my daughter so let's start bands 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.870
 well let's start this tutorial 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.239
 we're going to need a hydraulic jack 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.930
 we are also going to occupy a cross wrench 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.570
 to loosen the nuts 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.520
 equally if we are going to need a 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.710
 big screwdriver to leverage 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.149
 to return the cylinder of the balatas 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 this also deals with a key number 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.460
 14 to loosen the screw on the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.560
 turtle to remove the ballatas 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.330
 also his ballads can buy what 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.740
 I want you to buy what 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 There are different cheaper prices 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.270
 more expensive different brands but you 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 decide which one you like 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.280
 we are also going to start we remove the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280
 plug 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.509
 then we loose the nuts 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.790
 supporting us with the foot in case they are very 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.939
 very hard with the piercing would be more 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.939
 strong 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.780
 when loosening them for what 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.780
 to remove the tire 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.150
 so now if we put the cat to 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.820
 lift the car and be able to remove the 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.729
 rim the nuts loose them because 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.130
 so when it 's up it's more 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.380
 difficult to loosen things up and before 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.990
 get up we loosen them so that 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.040
 later it will be easier already later now 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.720
 if this 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.729
 already when the car is lifted 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.899
 completely that people are in the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.140
 air 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.629
 now we are going to grab the key to 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.519
 cross again to loosen now yes 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.480
 Completely completely remove the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.480
 nut 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.510
 because as you loosen and 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.770
 previously now yes completely 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.770
 now you can remove it 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.480
 this is why everything is going 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.790
 gathering there in the studs they go 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.879
 oxidizing and they get like they get stuck 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.269
 well yazira now yes we already removed the 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:46.269
 tire 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.120
 we're going to put it down the car 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.300
 anything that could fail 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.970
 cat already falls on the rim 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.300
 now if we occupy the key number 14 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.670
 to loosen the turtle 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.310
 you can take anything a tube 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.770
 something to leverage so that by itself 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.230
 it's very hard do not make this difficult 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.319
 remove it or be it a rattle with a 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.230
 given number 14 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.599
 if we remove the screw we raise the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.910
 turtle now so where are the 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.560
 balatas 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.910
 and now it is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.910
 let's open the chest 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.400
 and uncover the deposit where the 1 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.280
 in the brake fluid we uncover it 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.150
 after there now if we go to 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.150
 again at 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.720
 the ballads again you know 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.400
 the balatas carefully because then 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.860
 It has some plates that reach you 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.940
 cut must be removed with caution 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.940
 so as not to hurt us 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.630
 now we are going to 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.060
 let's put this one bullet is like 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.160
 a cup to make the lever for 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.690
 return the cylinder either put it by 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.110
 inside or outside as you are 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.110
 accommodate 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.020
 the can and now if we put the screwdriver 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.530
 to return the cylinder and do 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.600
 lever 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.820
 we go back until I stop until 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.920
 they feel that it arrived butted 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.630
 return on the return 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.710
 that returns well because if not 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.710
 enter the new ballatas 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.740
 now yes since it came back well we removed the 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.740
 bullet is that we occupy for the lever 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.980
 the cylinder has been well returned 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.980
 funny 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.129
 the new balatas 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.230
 the plastic 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:55.080
 where we look well the way they are going 

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:56.879
 it has a lane and everything where they enter and 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.150
 solita all bad and they get put 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.280
 push if already alone 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.889
 solitaires are going to enter there is no need to 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.879
 make a lot of strength 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.879
 2 cheap 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.000
 after hours and we're going to close the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.820
 torture 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.820
 the nut again back 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.160
 to be well alright well for what 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.139
 I will not see any incident that 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.760
 go to pull a bullet is something good 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.680
 tight 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.960
 that is, the most important thing about the car that 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.849
 the brakes are fine that all good that 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.889
 stay tight 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:39.889
 Now if we come back with the tire 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.220
 he came back 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.050
 nuts 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.529
 so there is a chair with brakes 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:56.539
 new cheap new 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.279
 let's tighten the nuts well 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:00.889
 I arrived because afterwards as we went down to 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:03.660
 car hours and we tighten them well today 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.980
 let's have that come 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.410
 yes because with the I say we can 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.470
 squeeze or loosen up like this when this car 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.270
 is raising we are going to arrive are for 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.880
 When you lower the cat, it will not move 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.100
 the tire or go to bend the studs and 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.300
 they are going to break 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.110
 now if we lower the 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.340
 the kart for 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.340
 tighten the nuts 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:32.389
 and we help ourselves again with the foot to 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.389
 that are tight and 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:41.130
 the tours we wanted to do 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.130
 chin 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.550
 and that was all that is done for the 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.470
 balatas is the same procedure with the 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.450
 On the other hand I hope you like it 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.910
 what is good for, this is all for the 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:02.740
 today's tutorial I hope it serves as your 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.080
 help for when they change their cheap 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.610
 I forgot to tell you one thing that 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:10.630
 when they have finished changing the 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:13.540
 balatas in the deposit this when I 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.150
 both in the fire department 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.490
 waiting for the percent brake if the 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.050
 without portfolio and get back now 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.600
 you to brake well to the bottom 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.430
 of the pear tree then then before 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.770
 hit the road pump him two or 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:29.200
 three times taxi put hard and now yes 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:30.970
 so that you leave with confidence and this and 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.770
 that was all for today's video if you 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.900
 like a German and it's up shares 

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:37.200
 the scribes and see you for the next 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.200
 video
