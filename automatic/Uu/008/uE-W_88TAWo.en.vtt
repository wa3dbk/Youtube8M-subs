00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
I'd give myself a nice clean line and

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.879 
I'd give myself a nice clean line and
then<00:05:11.800> gently<00:05:12.800> push<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.639> all<00:05:14.259> the<00:05:15.259> product<00:05:15.740> on

then gently push up all the product on

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:56.770 
then gently push up all the product on
there

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.680 

and<00:05:57.140> I'm<00:05:57.650> just<00:05:57.890> doing<00:05:58.160> it<00:05:58.280> how<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.970> like<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.390> fill

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
and I'm just doing it how I like to fill

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.730 
and I'm just doing it how I like to fill
in<00:05:59.810> my<00:05:59.930> eyebrows<00:06:00.320> I<00:06:00.560> really<00:06:00.950> don't<00:06:02.440> get<00:06:03.440> too

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
in my eyebrows I really don't get too

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.730 
in my eyebrows I really don't get too
carried<00:06:04.070> away<00:06:04.310> I<00:06:05.000> don't<00:06:05.660> like<00:06:05.900> them<00:06:06.050> too<00:06:06.320> bold

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
carried away I don't like them too bold

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.900 
carried away I don't like them too bold
I<00:06:08.140> like<00:06:09.140> them<00:06:09.320> very<00:06:09.350> natural<00:06:10.070> and<00:06:10.250> just<00:06:10.460> enough

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:10.910 
I like them very natural and just enough

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.650 
I like them very natural and just enough
so<00:06:11.150> they<00:06:11.510> are<00:06:11.720> filled<00:06:12.170> and<00:06:12.440> completely<00:06:13.040> and

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
so they are filled and completely and

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.220 
so they are filled and completely and
that's<00:06:14.660> about<00:06:14.840> it

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:15.230 
that's about it

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.560 
that's about it
as<00:06:15.470> you<00:06:15.740> can<00:06:15.890> tell<00:06:16.100> it's<00:06:16.370> now<00:06:16.610> filled<00:06:17.180> all

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
as you can tell it's now filled all

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.290 
as you can tell it's now filled all
along<00:06:17.990> and<00:06:19.540> this<00:06:20.540> is<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:20.960> difference<00:06:21.440> between

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
along and this is the difference between

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.180 
along and this is the difference between
the<00:06:23.300> powder<00:06:23.570> 1<00:06:23.930> and<00:06:25.480> the<00:06:26.480> pomade<00:06:26.900> 1<00:06:27.140> so<00:06:27.800> if<00:06:28.040> you

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
the powder 1 and the pomade 1 so if you

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:34.360 
the powder 1 and the pomade 1 so if you
can<00:06:28.430> tell<00:06:28.790> let<00:06:29.270> me<00:06:29.419> know<00:06:30.100> powder<00:06:31.360> pomade
