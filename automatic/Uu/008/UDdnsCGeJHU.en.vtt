00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.970 

all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:02.270> this<00:00:03.270> system<00:00:03.720> requires<00:00:03.980> a

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
all right so this system requires a

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.950 
all right so this system requires a
different<00:00:05.549> version<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:06.060> software<00:00:06.359> that

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
different version of software that

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.549 
different version of software that
allows<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.830> calibrate<00:00:08.400> two<00:00:08.910> different

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
allows you to calibrate two different

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.400 
allows you to calibrate two different
sensors<00:00:10.559> I'm<00:00:11.490> going<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.790> show<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.410> try

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
sensors I'm going to show you that try

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.930 
sensors I'm going to show you that try
to<00:00:13.440> show<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.830> simultaneously<00:00:14.429> while

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to show you that simultaneously while

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.070 
to show you that simultaneously while
we're<00:00:15.870> calibrating<00:00:16.340> the<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.550> sensors<00:00:18.090> so

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
we're calibrating the two sensors so

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.390 
we're calibrating the two sensors so
we're<00:00:19.230> doing<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.650> screen<00:00:19.890> capture<00:00:20.100> on<00:00:20.310> this

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
we're doing a screen capture on this

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
we're doing a screen capture on this
computer<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.820> now<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> no<00:00:23.640> battery<00:00:24.060> plugged

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
computer right now so no battery plugged

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.310 
computer right now so no battery plugged
in<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:25.410> did<00:00:25.890> solder<00:00:26.640> my<00:00:27.119> connections<00:00:27.779> back<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
in I did solder my connections back here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.700 
in I did solder my connections back here
and<00:00:28.500> you'll<00:00:29.400> see<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.510> back<00:00:30.689> where<00:00:31.650> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and you'll see that in the back where it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889 
and you'll see that in the back where it
has<00:00:31.830> battery<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.460> ground<00:00:32.759> that's<00:00:33.570> where<00:00:33.809> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
has battery or ground that's where you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.750 
has battery or ground that's where you
want<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.140> solder<00:00:34.380> these<00:00:34.590> things<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.160> you're

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
want to solder these things if you're

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
want to solder these things if you're
not<00:00:35.790> comfortable<00:00:36.239> soldering<00:00:36.950> get<00:00:37.950> someone<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
not comfortable soldering get someone to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.740 
not comfortable soldering get someone to
do<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.360> last<00:00:39.480> thing<00:00:39.600> you

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
do it for you because the last thing you

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.630 
do it for you because the last thing you
want<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:40.050> is<00:00:40.140> heat<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.070> board<00:00:41.370> too

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
want to do is heat up this board too

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.799 
want to do is heat up this board too
long<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.090> you're<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> fry<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
long or you're just going to fry the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.350 
long or you're just going to fry the
whole<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.260> all<00:00:43.920> right<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.180> have

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
whole thing all right so we don't have

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
whole thing all right so we don't have
the<00:00:45.570> battery<00:00:45.719> connected<00:00:46.309> what<00:00:47.309> we're<00:00:47.430> going

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the battery connected what we're going

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.900 
the battery connected what we're going
to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.000> we're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.539> plug<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> USB

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
to do is we're going to plug in the USB

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.889 
to do is we're going to plug in the USB
we're<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> connect<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
we're going to connect it to the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.590 
we're going to connect it to the
computer<00:00:52.340> now<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.399> computer<00:00:53.910> typically<00:00:54.329> has

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
computer now the computer typically has

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600 
computer now the computer typically has
to<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.140> driver<00:00:55.590> installed<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.460> using

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
to have a driver installed we're using

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.130 
to have a driver installed we're using
Mac<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.210> then<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.050> downloaded<00:00:58.590> the<00:01:00.140> 2.4

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
Mac and then we downloaded the 2.4

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.789 
Mac and then we downloaded the 2.4
version<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> software<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> once<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
version of the software and once you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.670 
version of the software and once you
launch<00:01:04.979> launch<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> software<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:07.110> choose<00:01:07.650> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
launch launch the software you choose a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
launch launch the software you choose a
connection<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.640> uh<00:01:08.850> typically<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
connection which is uh typically on the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.570 
connection which is uh typically on the
last<00:01:10.380> one<00:01:10.560> on<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> list<00:01:10.950> will<00:01:11.189> show<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
last one on the list will show you that

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.600 
last one on the list will show you that
and<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.320> hit<00:01:13.409> connect

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and then you would hit connect

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.050 
and then you would hit connect
so<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.990> new<00:01:16.200> version<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> software

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
so in the new version of the software

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.030 
so in the new version of the software
we're<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> calibrate<00:01:18.630> these<00:01:18.900> sensors

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
we're going to calibrate these sensors

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.920 
we're going to calibrate these sensors
individually<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.549> right<00:01:20.759> now<00:01:20.939> we'll

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
individually so right now we'll

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.530 
individually so right now we'll
calibrate

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
calibrate

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.460 
calibrate
let's<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.049> we're<00:01:25.200> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.380> do

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
let's see which one we're going to do

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.999 
let's see which one we're going to do
here<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:26.070> one<00:01:26.280> okay<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> one

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
here this one okay so this is the one

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
here this one okay so this is the one
that<00:01:29.070> sits<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.340> top<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> camera<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that sits on top of the camera and so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
that sits on top of the camera and so
we're<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> calibrate<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.450> first

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
we're going to calibrate this one first

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
we're going to calibrate this one first
so<00:01:34.740> what<00:01:35.100> we'll<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.460> we'll<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:35.729> through<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
so what we'll do is we'll go through the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.569 
so what we'll do is we'll go through the
six<00:01:36.240> step<00:01:36.420> calibration<00:01:37.049> similar<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
six step calibration similar to the

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
six step calibration similar to the
8-bit<00:01:39.450> version<00:01:39.900> now<00:01:40.320> if<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.740> know<00:01:40.799> how

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
8-bit version now if you don't know how

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.800 
8-bit version now if you don't know how
to<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.579> do<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.270> another<00:01:42.570> video

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
to do this I do have another video

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.149 
to do this I do have another video
showing<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.530> we're<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
showing you that we're just going to do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.800 
showing you that we're just going to do
the<00:01:44.250> same<00:01:44.399> steps<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.450> time<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.780> two

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the same steps but this time with two

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
the same steps but this time with two
different<00:01:46.079> sensors<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.579> want<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.360> make<00:01:48.479> sure

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
different sensors so I want to make sure

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.389 
different sensors so I want to make sure
that<00:01:48.750> my<00:01:49.079> table<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:49.890> level

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that my table is level

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.910 
that my table is level
place<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> sensor<00:01:51.689> here<00:01:52.020> we're<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.860> to

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
place the sensor here we're going to

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:02.990 
place the sensor here we're going to
calibrate<00:01:59.630> okay<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.140> that's<00:02:01.439> up<00:02:01.649> we<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.790> do

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
calibrate okay so that's up we will do

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.149 
calibrate okay so that's up we will do
upside-down<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.009> off<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
upside-down I'm going to do it off the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:17.570 
upside-down I'm going to do it off the
table<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.090> make<00:02:07.079> sure<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.439> level<00:02:09.410> okay

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.630 

all<00:02:18.580> right<00:02:18.780> we<00:02:19.780> will<00:02:19.900> do<00:02:20.110> left<00:02:21.010> side<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.519> I'm

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
all right we will do left side so I'm

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.589 
all right we will do left side so I'm
going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.879> do<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.269> way

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:38.699 

and<00:02:25.599> good<00:02:34.650> then<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.860> will<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:38.200> opposite

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and good then we will do it the opposite

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:52.289 
and good then we will do it the opposite
side<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:42.370> go<00:02:42.849> ahead<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.340> will<00:02:51.519> do<00:02:51.670> up<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
side and go ahead and we will do up and

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.210 
side and go ahead and we will do up and
down<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:52.900> I'm<00:02:53.109> going<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.290> point<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.680> down<00:02:53.920> on

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
down so I'm going to point it down on

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.020 
down so I'm going to point it down on
this<00:02:54.370> cube<00:02:54.760> make<00:02:55.569> sure<00:02:55.750> I'm<00:02:55.870> level<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:57.310> go

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
this cube make sure I'm level and go

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:07.740 
this cube make sure I'm level and go
ahead<00:02:58.150> and<00:02:58.239> calibrate<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:07.030> need<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.540> point

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
ahead and calibrate and we need to point

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.360 
ahead and calibrate and we need to point
this<00:03:07.959> up<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:08.709> I'm<00:03:08.799> going<00:03:08.950> to<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.129> it<00:03:09.220> off

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
this up now so I'm going to do it off

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:23.260 
this up now so I'm going to do it off
the<00:03:09.400> edge<00:03:10.290> point<00:03:11.290> up<00:03:11.470> this<00:03:11.680> way<00:03:13.230> okay

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.560 

all<00:03:23.840> right<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.700> one<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.090> all<00:03:26.210> calibrated

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
all right so this one is all calibrated

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.000 
all right so this one is all calibrated
now<00:03:27.020> we're<00:03:27.200> going<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.380> go<00:03:27.500> through<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.860> steps

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
now we're going to go through the steps

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.150 
now we're going to go through the steps
of<00:03:28.250> this<00:03:28.880> one<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:30.470> called<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.800> frame

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
of this one and this is called the frame

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.230 
of this one and this is called the frame
IMU<00:03:31.910> so<00:03:32.360> this<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:33.050> is<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:33.230> camera<00:03:33.590> IMU

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
IMU so this one here is the camera IMU

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.610 
IMU so this one here is the camera IMU
the<00:03:35.240> one<00:03:35.450> with<00:03:35.600> two<00:03:35.720> connections<00:03:36.170> is<00:03:36.380> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
the one with two connections is the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.110 
the one with two connections is the
frame<00:03:36.980> IMU<00:03:37.520> so<00:03:37.670> we're<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:37.880> going<00:03:38.000> to<00:03:38.030> go

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
frame IMU so we're just going to go

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.450 
frame IMU so we're just going to go
through<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.330> same<00:03:38.630> steps<00:03:39.220> first<00:03:40.220> we'll<00:03:40.340> start

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
through the same steps first we'll start

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.820 
through the same steps first we'll start
with<00:03:40.670> it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
with it

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:54.970 
with it
horizontal<00:03:45.580> okay<00:03:53.500> now<00:03:54.500> we're<00:03:54.650> going<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.800> do

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
horizontal okay now we're going to do

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.210 
horizontal okay now we're going to do
this<00:03:55.190> upside<00:03:55.730> down

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
this upside down

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.500 
this upside down
we'll<00:03:58.220> use<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.490> edge<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> table<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.420> get

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
we'll use the edge of the table to get

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.970 
we'll use the edge of the table to get
that

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:25.320 

okay<00:04:06.760> calibrate<00:04:14.790> one<00:04:15.790> side<00:04:16.530> okay<00:04:17.530> now<00:04:24.330> we're

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
okay calibrate one side okay now we're

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.700 
okay calibrate one side okay now we're
going<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.510> just<00:04:25.720> roll<00:04:25.990> this<00:04:26.139> over<00:04:26.290> to<00:04:26.590> the

going to just roll this over to the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:38.129 
going to just roll this over to the
other<00:04:26.860> side<00:04:27.870> and<00:04:29.520> calibrate<00:04:36.960> now<00:04:37.960> we're<00:04:38.050> going

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139
