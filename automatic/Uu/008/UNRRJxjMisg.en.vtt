highway it really is sort of a great
combination<00:01:44.720> as<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:46.049> some<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> other

combination as for some of the other
major<00:01:46.590> improvements<00:01:47.430> especially<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.240> the

major improvements especially with the

major improvements especially with the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
chassis and suspension the car is a bit

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.730 
chassis and suspension the car is a bit
smoother<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.360> drive<00:01:51.750> although<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.560> not<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
smoother a drive although it's not a

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.039 
smoother a drive although it's not a
huge<00:01:53.280> difference<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.759> most<00:01:54.149> notable<00:01:54.570> we<00:01:54.750> found

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
huge difference a most notable we found

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.840 
huge difference a most notable we found
is<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.649> tighter<00:01:55.890> steering<00:01:56.369> ratio<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.759> it

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
is the tighter steering ratio and it

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
is the tighter steering ratio and it
really<00:01:57.119> makes<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.600> difference<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:58.350> don't<00:01:58.530> have

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
really makes a difference you don't have

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.139 
really makes a difference you don't have
to<00:01:58.770> input<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.310> kinds<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.640> steering<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> get

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
to input all kinds of steering to get

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.819 
to input all kinds of steering to get
the<00:02:00.240> result<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> want<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.350> has<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.500> sort<00:02:01.799> of

the result you want and it has a sort of

the result you want and it has a sort of

also get a chance to test out the

six-speed manual and it really is a

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.790

great<00:02:12.120> unit

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
great unit

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.250

when I'm using the left hand which is
pretty<00:02:18.650> unusual<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:20.240> also<00:02:20.450> had<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.750> chance

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
pretty unusual we also had a chance

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
we even had a chance to compare it to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.440 
we even had a chance to compare it to
the<00:02:34.040> previous<00:02:34.400> diesel<00:02:34.940> engine<00:02:35.210> that<00:02:35.240> they

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
the previous diesel engine that they

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.170 
the previous diesel engine that they
offered<00:02:35.840> only<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.260> Europe<00:02:36.610> now<00:02:37.610> Madge's<00:02:38.060> new

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
drawbacks and we're not talking about

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.580 
drawbacks and we're not talking about
just<00:02:43.580> emissions<00:02:44.090> either<00:02:44.330> it<00:02:45.020> really<00:02:45.350> sort<00:02:45.530> of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
just emissions either it really sort of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.620 
just emissions either it really sort of
operates<00:02:46.010> more<00:02:46.370> like<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.910> gasoline<00:02:47.480> engine

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
operates more like a gasoline engine

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.760 
operates more like a gasoline engine
than<00:02:47.990> you'd<00:02:48.170> expect

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
than you'd expect

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790 
than you'd expect
especially<00:02:49.430> with<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.640> 5200<00:02:50.450> rpm<00:02:50.870> redline<00:02:51.110> so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
especially with a 5200 rpm redline so

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.040 
especially with a 5200 rpm redline so
it's<00:02:51.950> really<00:02:52.070> got<00:02:52.250> a<00:02:52.280> lot<00:02:52.460> of<00:02:52.490> power<00:02:53.150> up<00:02:53.450> top<00:02:53.810> as

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
it's really got a lot of power up top as

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's really got a lot of power up top as
well<00:02:54.260> which<00:02:54.440> is<00:02:54.560> different<00:02:54.830> so<00:02:54.890> you've<00:02:55.010> got

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
well which is different so you've got

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.340 
well which is different so you've got
that<00:02:55.310> great<00:02:55.700> diesel<00:02:56.150> thrust<00:02:56.450> but<00:02:57.050> up<00:02:57.140> at<00:02:57.260> the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
that great diesel thrust but up at the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.720 
that great diesel thrust but up at the
higher<00:02:57.530> rpm<00:02:57.950> range<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.250> really<00:02:58.490> just<00:02:58.610> feels

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
higher rpm range it really just feels

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.850 
higher rpm range it really just feels
more<00:02:59.090> like<00:02:59.240> a<00:02:59.300> powerful<00:03:00.020> gasoline<00:03:00.590> engine

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
more like a powerful gasoline engine

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.060 
more like a powerful gasoline engine
which<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.130> great<00:03:01.870> up<00:03:02.870> first<00:03:03.290> is<00:03:03.500> NASA's<00:03:03.950> new

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
helped make it more stable at high

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.900 
helped make it more stable at high

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
comfortable but it also has a big

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.780

improvement<00:05:54.050> for<00:05:54.380> braking<00:05:54.800> distances<00:05:55.250> which

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
improvement for braking distances which

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.910 
improvement for braking distances which
may<00:05:56.000> sound<00:05:56.150> surprising<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:57.290> way<00:05:57.410> it<00:05:57.500> works<00:05:57.740> is

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 
may sound surprising the way it works is

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.440 
may sound surprising the way it works is
that<00:05:57.950> because<00:05:58.340> of<00:05:58.460> the<00:05:58.520> new<00:05:58.640> layout<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.270> car

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
that because of the new layout the car

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.540 
that because of the new layout the car
actually<00:05:59.600> pitches<00:06:00.200> less<00:06:00.440> so<00:06:01.070> there's<00:06:01.280> not<00:06:01.400> as

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
actually pitches less so there's not as
