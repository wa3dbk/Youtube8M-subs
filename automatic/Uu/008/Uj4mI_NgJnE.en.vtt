00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.850
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.950
 I am Alexey and today to your attention I would 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.350
 I wanted to present my new video 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.180
 on the spintires game this time it again 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.040
 review mods and today komi on review 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.600
 got quite an interesting mod under 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.600
 name kraz 6322 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 again go to the banal so 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.010
 there is this mod replaces the default kraz 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.420
 which we have in the game is not 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.030
 does not work multiplayer 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.350
 achievements do not work saving well what 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 let's take it right away 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.880
 we will proceed we will not put it off 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 longbox 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.200
 let's see what addon we have 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.370
 here are available so we have installed 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 this is an onboard platform 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 let's take pictures and see what kind of 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.870
 off-road wheels like that we have on 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.969
 ordinary Ural same thing so have a trailer 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.559
 dissolution naturally need to be there 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 pre-deliver something 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.289
 there is such a so-called technical 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 let's move the camera and where do u 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.729
 we have 400 repair points but she 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.940
 looks pretty bad if 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.440
 honestly admit that is all this 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.980
 looks very cool not just there 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.830
 some 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.980
 so to speak will be when it is not known what 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:26.290
 but here you can see that we are carrying something 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.620
 further because we still have ha 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.900
 different parts it usually 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.210
 bortovik yes with some bricks 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.100
 maybe there sand coils of some sort 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.320
 I do not understand well, in general, too, all this 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.930
 looks pretty interesting so shoot 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.790
 the onboard platform was already there 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.920
 also the truck platform on which 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.130
 you can arrange everything just all this without 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.290
 problems we will work like this 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.310
 we are all there it is hanging loose 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.940
 okay see what we have here yet 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.190
 let's remove the trailer-dissolution platform 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.590
 the truck will also remove the fuel tanks 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.590
 and not being considered but this is the usual default 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.560
 the object is nothing new here in principle 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.140
 no there is also a garage part too 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.670
 absolutely default object we can 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.620
 using them would unlock them either 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.370
 garage and but coupling and repair parts 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.170
 need as usual ok let's try 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.800
 drive it somewhere sense you have 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.800
 it will work out 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.470
 before we see 100 represents itself 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:37.220
 immediately married 26 points at home 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.370
 incomprehensible than me 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.370
 face 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760
 lighting 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.100
 so growth as we see the dirt on the wheels 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.430
 we completely sticks here no 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.700
 wipe try to get through this 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.700
 small river 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.420
 here we also have no problems 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:17.300
 there was a body as you see with us 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:17.300
 getting wet board also gets wet traces of water 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.870
 there will be knitted 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.719
 how we have fun throwing all the dirt 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.310
 super great review completion i want 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.580
 say from one of us the opportunity 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.200
 see what we have hidden under the bottom 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.110
 that is, to see how we have worked 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.569
 the whole suspension basically get up and on 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 the wheels here are pretty easy 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.880
 let's do it and finish the review for 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.310
 this we just cling to 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.920
 any tree and pull yourself up 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.680
 love neatly neat bam 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.720
 and put yourself on the wheels 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.459
 Well, that's all I wanted 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.560
 tell about this truck here 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.010
 thereâ€™s nothing to talk about 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.500
 In principle, everything is all about the subject here. 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.100
 all you need here is that is how 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.020
 wheels and various choices so to speak 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.419
 onboard fuel tank platforms 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.800
 there is also a trailer dissolution in order 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.080
 so that we can carry Yelets then 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.729
 garage parts and stuff other stuff 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.400
 there is a pretty pretty mod definitely 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.780
 its worth to download play out 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.600
 which again does not work multiplayer 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.979
 achievement and preservation and replaces it 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.289
 standard beauty 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.020
 but that's all I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.289
 this video if you think it is 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.510
 true so to speak if something to put 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.660
 like him subscribe to the channel share 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.380
 im with my friends but this is all sandu 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.600
 Alexey 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.070
