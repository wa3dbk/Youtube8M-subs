the pocket we need to press that down

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
the pocket we need to press that down
and<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:57.090> can<00:00:57.239> also<00:00:57.360> stitch<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> that's

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
and you can also stitch it and that's

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.700 
and you can also stitch it and that's
roughly<00:00:58.739> about<00:00:58.980> 6<00:00:59.730> millimeters<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.590> then<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
roughly about 6 millimeters and then the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.230 
roughly about 6 millimeters and then the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
next stage will be to fold to the crease

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.170 
next stage will be to fold to the crease
line<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> fold<00:01:08.189> line<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.430> should<00:01:08.670> say<00:01:08.880> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
line or the fold line I should say of

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.710 
line or the fold line I should say of
the<00:01:09.540> pocket<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.140> then<00:01:10.590> press<00:01:11.360> that<00:01:12.360> into

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.039 
the pocket and then press that into
place<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.260> then<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> case<00:01:14.430> of

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
place and then it will be a case of

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.530 
place and then it will be a case of
pressing<00:01:16.049> all<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.460> other<00:01:17.610> three<00:01:18.409> edges<00:01:20.540> and

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
pressing all the other three edges and

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.289 
pressing all the other three edges and
once<00:01:21.840> you've<00:01:22.020> done<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.430> you'll<00:01:23.430> end<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:24.030> with

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
once you've done that you'll end up with

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.179 
once you've done that you'll end up with
something<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:27.200> still<00:01:28.200> working<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
something like this still working on the

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
something like this still working on the
wrong<00:01:29.970> side<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.509> pocket<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.619> need<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
wrong side of your pocket we need to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
wrong side of your pocket we need to
make<00:01:32.159> these<00:01:32.400> corners<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:33.329> nice<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.810> neat

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
make these corners really nice and neat

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.030 
make these corners really nice and neat
and<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.860> best<00:01:35.159> way<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:37.009> use<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and the best way to do that is to use a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.890 
and the best way to do that is to use a
technique<00:01:38.549> where<00:01:38.909> you<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.450> my<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
technique where you actually my to the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.830 
technique where you actually my to the
corners<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.439> you'll<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.740> using<00:01:41.040> your<00:01:41.220> iron<00:01:42.000> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
corners but you'll be using your iron so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.280 
corners but you'll be using your iron so
open<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> out<00:01:44.000> find<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.149> point<00:01:45.509> at<00:01:45.869> which<00:01:46.079> all

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
open it out find the point at which all

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.600 
open it out find the point at which all
the<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.979> crease<00:01:47.970> lines<00:01:48.299> meet<00:01:49.009> fold<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.310> corner

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
the a crease lines meet fold this corner

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.120 
the a crease lines meet fold this corner
it<00:01:50.939> down<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.340> then<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:54.000> follow<00:01:54.210> those<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it down and then you follow those in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.850 
it down and then you follow those in
I'll<00:01:56.130> show<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.430> on<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:56.969> well<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> now

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
I'll show you on this one well so now

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.149 
I'll show you on this one well so now
that<00:01:59.460> point<00:01:59.729> there<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.649> folded

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
that point there it's going to be folded

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.959 
that point there it's going to be folded
in<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.619> angle<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.610> you're<00:02:05.880> going

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
in to that angle and then you're going

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.700 
in to that angle and then you're going
to<00:02:06.060> match<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.630> crease<00:02:06.960> line<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.619> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
to match that crease line with the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.880 
to match that crease line with the
crease<00:02:07.979> line<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.550> this<00:02:09.000> edge

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
crease line of this edge

pocket<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.410> be<00:04:29.680> a<00:04:29.979> little<00:04:30.460> bit<00:04:30.900> unstable

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
pocket it can be a little bit unstable

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020 
pocket it can be a little bit unstable
and<00:04:32.320> doing<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:32.919> this<00:04:33.070> way<00:04:33.130> makes<00:04:33.760> it<00:04:33.910> a<00:04:33.940> little

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
and doing it this way makes it a little

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.000 
and doing it this way makes it a little
bit<00:04:34.300> more<00:04:34.449> stable<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:35.410> also<00:04:35.710> do<00:04:36.040> it<00:04:36.190> by

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
bit more stable you can also do it by

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.500 
bit more stable you can also do it by
starting<00:04:39.010> at<00:04:39.520> a<00:04:39.580> different<00:04:39.790> point<00:04:40.000> in<00:04:40.449> the

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
starting at a different point in the

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:41.939 
starting at a different point in the
pocket<00:04:40.900> if<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.080> wish<00:04:41.229> if<00:04:41.380> you<00:04:41.410> wanted<00:04:41.740> to<00:04:41.860> have

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
pocket if you wish if you wanted to have

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.969 
pocket if you wish if you wanted to have
a<00:04:42.010> bit<00:04:42.220> more<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.729> decorative<00:04:43.650> feel<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:44.889> your

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
a bit more of a decorative feel to your

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.640 
a bit more of a decorative feel to your
pocket<00:04:48.720> you're<00:04:49.720> going<00:04:49.870> to<00:04:49.930> do<00:04:50.020> an<00:04:50.110> edge<00:04:50.260> stitch

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
pocket you're going to do an edge stitch

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.650 
pocket you're going to do an edge stitch
so<00:04:51.310> we're<00:04:51.430> going<00:04:51.550> to<00:04:51.610> get<00:04:51.699> quite<00:04:51.970> close<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.539> the

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
so we're going to get quite close to the

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.390 
so we're going to get quite close to the
edge<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:53.800> too<00:04:54.160> close<00:04:56.880> needle<00:04:57.880> down<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:59.400> come

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
bit too far there so that's a pop up

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.990 
bit too far there so that's a pop up
needle<00:05:29.270> now<00:05:30.020> pull<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:30.860> up<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.490> then<00:05:31.730> turn

pivot your work all the way around and

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
then you're going to do edge stitching

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.570 
then you're going to do edge stitching
all<00:05:37.010> the<00:05:37.730> way<00:05:38.060> around<00:05:38.240> it<00:05:39.080> again<00:05:39.400> and<00:05:40.400> I'll

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.800 
all the way around it again and I'll
continue<00:05:40.850> doing<00:05:41.030> that<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.360> I'll<00:05:41.570> show<00:05:41.780> you

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
what it looks like once I've done here

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.110 
what it looks like once I've done here

what I've actually done when I've gone
all<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.700> way<00:05:49.730> around<00:05:49.880> I've<00:05:50.810> given<00:05:51.410> an<00:05:51.590> option

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
all the way around I've given an option

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.260 
all the way around I've given an option
here<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.340> could<00:05:52.490> have<00:05:52.610> actually<00:05:52.940> started

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
here so you could have actually started

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.410 
here so you could have actually started
the<00:05:54.230> way<00:05:54.350> I<00:05:54.380> have<00:05:55.070> done<00:05:55.310> to<00:05:55.670> begin<00:05:55.940> with<00:05:56.180> and

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:56.420 
the way I have done to begin with and

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.450 
the way I have done to begin with and
I've<00:05:56.960> ended<00:05:57.410> up<00:05:57.500> doing<00:05:57.890> it<00:05:57.980> a<00:05:58.010> little<00:05:58.190> bit

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
I've ended up doing it a little bit

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.330 
I've ended up doing it a little bit
different<00:05:58.850> on<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.570> opposite<00:06:00.200> side<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:01.310> is

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:01.340 
different on the opposite side and it is

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.220 
different on the opposite side and it is
really<00:06:01.730> all<00:06:01.970> about<00:06:02.000> choice<00:06:02.630> because<00:06:03.050> you<00:06:03.080> can

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:03.230 
really all about choice because you can

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.830 
really all about choice because you can
actually<00:06:03.350> start<00:06:03.800> here<00:06:04.220> and<00:06:04.550> you<00:06:05.450> know<00:06:05.570> it's

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
actually start here and you know it's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.180

you're actually doing and also what I've
done<00:06:10.430> here<00:06:10.760> is<00:06:11.030> I've<00:06:11.330> gone<00:06:11.510> quite<00:06:11.930> close<00:06:12.410> to

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
done here is I've gone quite close to

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.060 
done here is I've gone quite close to
the<00:06:12.920> edge<00:06:13.130> of<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:14.510> pocket<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.920> edge

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
the edge of the pocket the edge

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.430 
the edge of the pocket the edge
stitching<00:06:16.700> and<00:06:16.880> I<00:06:17.000> haven't<00:06:17.420> so<00:06:17.780> much<00:06:17.960> on<00:06:18.200> this

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
stitching and I haven't so much on this

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.820 
stitching and I haven't so much on this
side<00:06:18.740> so<00:06:19.280> as<00:06:19.400> you<00:06:19.490> can<00:06:19.610> see<00:06:19.670> there<00:06:20.480> is<00:06:20.630> a<00:06:20.900> choice

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
side so as you can see there is a choice

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.550 
side so as you can see there is a choice
of<00:06:22.190> how<00:06:22.580> close<00:06:22.850> you<00:06:23.060> want<00:06:23.240> to<00:06:23.330> get<00:06:23.480> and<00:06:23.840> also

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
of how close you want to get and also

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.290 
of how close you want to get and also
the<00:06:24.890> effect<00:06:25.220> that<00:06:25.250> you<00:06:25.460> want<00:06:25.670> to<00:06:25.790> achieve<00:06:25.910> with

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
the effect that you want to achieve with

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
do a patch pocket and also before I go

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.670 
do a patch pocket and also before I go
let<00:06:32.510> me<00:06:32.540> just<00:06:32.630> mention<00:06:32.900> you<00:06:33.320> could<00:06:33.560> have

actually top stitch this as well and as
I<00:06:36.560> said<00:06:36.890> it<00:06:37.040> really<00:06:37.250> is<00:06:37.490> about<00:06:37.630> impersonal

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
I said it really is about impersonal
