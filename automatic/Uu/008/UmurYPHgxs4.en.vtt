00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.610 
the university and my program offer very
interesting<00:02:29.730> subjects<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:31.020> lectures

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
interesting subjects and the lectures

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.390 
interesting subjects and the lectures
are<00:02:32.450> experienced<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:34.940> they<00:02:37.190> bring<00:02:38.190> up

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
are experienced and they bring up

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880 
are experienced and they bring up
interesting<00:02:39.120> topics<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.230> really<00:02:40.860> enjoy

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
interesting topics that I really enjoy

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.610 
interesting topics that I really enjoy
and<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.850> think<00:02:42.360> they<00:02:42.480> will<00:02:42.720> be<00:02:42.900> useful<00:02:43.410> in<00:02:43.500> the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
and I think they will be useful in the

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.640 
and I think they will be useful in the
future<00:02:43.800> when<00:02:44.250> when<00:02:44.730> we<00:02:45.540> start<00:02:45.900> searching<00:02:46.440> for

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
future when when we start searching for

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.690 
future when when we start searching for
jobs<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:49.080> beginning<00:02:49.590> due<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.190> work<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
jobs and the beginning due to work and

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880 
jobs and the beginning due to work and
what<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.090> really<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:52.080> can<00:02:52.380> discuss

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
what I really like that I can discuss

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.449 
what I really like that I can discuss
any<00:02:53.810> questions<00:02:54.810> any<00:02:55.050> problems<00:02:55.590> which<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.190> have

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
any questions any problems which I have

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.220 
any questions any problems which I have
in<00:02:57.500> my<00:02:58.500> country<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.160> would<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.730> as<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.750> mentioned

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
in my country it would be as I mentioned

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.920 
in my country it would be as I mentioned
we<00:03:01.410> have<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:02.160> bigger<00:03:03.030> distance<00:03:03.510> between

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
we have a bigger distance between

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.699 
we have a bigger distance between
students<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:05.010> lecture<00:03:05.450> so<00:03:06.450> sometimes<00:03:07.230> it

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
students and the lecture so sometimes it

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.370 
students and the lecture so sometimes it
was<00:03:07.890> quite<00:03:08.489> difficult<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:09.060> communicate<00:03:09.480> here

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
was quite difficult to communicate here

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.489 
was quite difficult to communicate here
I<00:03:10.620> feel<00:03:11.430> free<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:13.020> ask<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.800> any<00:03:13.980> questions
