with<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.370> video<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.970> will<00:01:41.180> take<00:01:41.330> much<00:01:41.570> longer

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
with the video it will take much longer

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.630

time<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.230> create<00:01:42.470> and<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.220> video<00:01:43.520> will

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
time to create and the video will

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.520 
time to create and the video will
probably<00:01:43.880> end<00:01:44.300> up<00:01:44.450> being<00:01:44.659> confusing<00:01:45.380> and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
probably end up being confusing and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.460

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769 
you need to create a conflict if you

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.860 
you need to create a conflict if you
make<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> video<00:02:13.340> without<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.790> conflict<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.510> will

become<00:02:15.170> pretty<00:02:15.470> boring<00:02:15.769> the<00:02:16.760> conflict

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
become pretty boring the conflict

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.970 
become pretty boring the conflict
doesn't<00:02:17.330> have<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.629> be<00:02:17.750> big<00:02:18.019> something<00:02:18.739> small
