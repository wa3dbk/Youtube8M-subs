beyond the end of the runway so it

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.960 
beyond the end of the runway so it

doesn't<00:03:54.250> look<00:03:54.340> as<00:03:54.459> realistic<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.090> me<00:03:55.209> I<00:03:55.359> don't

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
doesn't look as realistic to me I don't

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.900 
doesn't look as realistic to me I don't
know<00:03:55.660> I'm<00:03:56.650> kind<00:03:56.950> of<00:03:56.980> picky<00:03:57.310> about<00:03:57.340> my<00:03:57.669> flight

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
know I'm kind of picky about my flight

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.659 
know I'm kind of picky about my flight
simulation<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.750> I'm<00:03:59.079> hoping<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.769> one<00:04:00.579> of

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
simulation but I'm hoping that one of

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.629 
simulation but I'm hoping that one of
the<00:04:00.760> big-name<00:04:00.970> companies<00:04:02.250> one<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.400> bigger

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
the big-name companies one of the bigger

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.000 
the big-name companies one of the bigger
name<00:04:04.000> companies<00:04:04.540> like<00:04:04.870> a<00:04:05.049> 2a<00:04:05.319> or<00:04:07.739> Kara<00:04:08.739> not<00:04:08.980> oh

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
name companies like a 2a or Kara not oh

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.589 
name companies like a 2a or Kara not oh
I<00:04:09.310> believe<00:04:09.700> that's<00:04:09.879> how<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.000> pronounce<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
I believe that's how you pronounce that

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.809 
I believe that's how you pronounce that
I'm<00:04:10.810> hoping<00:04:11.530> that<00:04:11.739> they'll<00:04:11.950> make<00:04:12.129> a<00:04:12.459> sky

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
I'm hoping that they'll make a sky

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.970 
I'm hoping that they'll make a sky
catcher<00:04:13.090> because<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:14.019> love<00:04:14.530> all<00:04:14.709> their<00:04:14.859> other

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
catcher because I love all their other

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.310 
catcher because I love all their other
models<00:04:15.459> but<00:04:15.669> I<00:04:15.730> just<00:04:16.000> wish<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.359> I<00:04:16.449> had<00:04:16.630> my<00:04:17.289> own

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
models but I just wish that I had my own

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.310 
models but I just wish that I had my own
plane<00:04:17.829> that<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.489> trained<00:04:18.849> in<00:04:18.970> here<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:20.169> fly

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
plane that I trained in here to to fly

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.370 
plane that I trained in here to to fly
so<00:04:21.190> our<00:04:21.699> flaps<00:04:22.000> are<00:04:22.210> down<00:04:22.240> we're<00:04:22.870> gonna<00:04:23.020> turn

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
so our flaps are down we're gonna turn

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.910 
so our flaps are down we're gonna turn
the<00:04:23.500> master<00:04:23.620> switch<00:04:23.889> off

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
the master switch off

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.590 
the master switch off
and<00:04:26.010> then<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.790> can<00:04:26.970> make<00:04:27.120> sure<00:04:27.150> that<00:04:27.480> our

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
and then we can make sure that our

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.650 
and then we can make sure that our
elevator<00:04:27.960> trim<00:04:28.200> is<00:04:28.440> set<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:28.770> takeoff<00:04:29.660> which

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
elevator trim is set for takeoff which

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.620 
elevator trim is set for takeoff which
it<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:31.790> so<00:04:32.790> at<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.000> point<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.390> would<00:04:33.540> go

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
it is so at this point you would go

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
it is so at this point you would go
outside<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:34.140> would<00:04:34.230> do<00:04:34.320> your<00:04:34.440> walk-around

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
outside you would do your walk-around

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.310 
outside you would do your walk-around
check<00:04:35.160> make<00:04:35.610> sure<00:04:35.760> everything's<00:04:36.180> off<00:04:36.420> so<00:04:37.260> to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
check make sure everything's off so to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.960 
check make sure everything's off so to
make<00:04:37.500> sure<00:04:37.650> everything<00:04:38.040> is<00:04:38.130> off<00:04:38.400> we're<00:04:38.730> going

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
make sure everything is off we're going

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.870 
make sure everything is off we're going
to<00:04:39.180> go<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.540> our<00:04:39.630> mini<00:04:39.810> controls<00:04:40.290> and<00:04:40.880> it

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
to go to our mini controls and it

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.490 
to go to our mini controls and it
becomes<00:04:42.210> apparent<00:04:42.360> that<00:04:42.660> our<00:04:42.780> tie<00:04:43.020> downs<00:04:43.260> are

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
becomes apparent that our tie downs are

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.680 
becomes apparent that our tie downs are
still<00:04:43.770> engaged<00:04:44.100> we<00:04:44.640> can<00:04:44.790> take<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.240> can<00:04:45.300> untie

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
still engaged we can take you can untie

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.040 
still engaged we can take you can untie
those<00:04:45.930> take<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.680> wheel<00:04:46.800> chocks<00:04:47.130> out<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:48.050> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
those take the wheel chocks out and the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.720 
those take the wheel chocks out and the
PIO<00:04:49.290> cover<00:04:49.650> that's<00:04:49.920> important<00:04:50.370> to<00:04:50.460> remove

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
PIO cover that's important to remove

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.520 
PIO cover that's important to remove
because<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.150> provides<00:04:51.510> us<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.900> our<00:04:52.050> airspeed

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
because it provides us with our airspeed

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.870 
because it provides us with our airspeed
and<00:04:54.530> our<00:04:55.530> vertical<00:04:56.100> speed<00:04:56.670> as<00:04:56.940> well<00:04:57.120> as<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.480> I

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
and our vertical speed as well as the I

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.810 
and our vertical speed as well as the I
believe<00:05:00.710> altitude<00:05:01.710> correct<00:05:02.370> me<00:05:02.520> on<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.640> if

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
believe altitude correct me on that if

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.130 
believe altitude correct me on that if
I'm<00:05:03.060> wrong<00:05:03.710> but<00:05:05.090> after<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.210> they<00:05:06.990> walk

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
I'm wrong but after that they walk

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.020 
I'm wrong but after that they walk
around<00:05:07.380> check<00:05:07.410> we<00:05:07.710> can<00:05:07.740> go<00:05:08.370> inside<00:05:08.580> the<00:05:08.850> cab

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
around check we can go inside the cab

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.400 
around check we can go inside the cab
into<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.300> engine<00:05:09.570> starting<00:05:09.930> checklist<00:05:10.320> so

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
into the engine starting checklist so

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.050 
into the engine starting checklist so
we're<00:05:10.530> gonna<00:05:10.620> crack<00:05:10.890> our<00:05:11.040> throttle<00:05:11.250> about<00:05:12.030> a

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
we're gonna crack our throttle about a

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.090 
we're gonna crack our throttle about a
quarter<00:05:12.390> inches<00:05:12.660> all<00:05:12.840> you<00:05:12.960> need<00:05:13.140> make<00:05:13.800> sure<00:05:13.830> is

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
quarter inches all you need make sure is

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.560 
quarter inches all you need make sure is
idle<00:05:14.430> we're<00:05:14.700> gonna<00:05:14.820> turn<00:05:14.970> our<00:05:15.000> master<00:05:15.390> switch

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
idle we're gonna turn our master switch

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.260 
idle we're gonna turn our master switch
back<00:05:15.810> on<00:05:18.380> beacon<00:05:19.380> on<00:05:19.680> that<00:05:20.670> lets<00:05:20.940> people<00:05:21.090> know

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
back on beacon on that lets people know

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.880 
back on beacon on that lets people know
we're<00:05:21.450> gonna<00:05:21.540> be<00:05:21.690> starting<00:05:21.930> up<00:05:22.140> this<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.830> a

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
we're gonna be starting up this is a

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.920 
we're gonna be starting up this is a
cold<00:05:23.160> engine<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:23.640> we're<00:05:23.790> gonna<00:05:23.880> do<00:05:24.060> step<00:05:24.390> 5

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
cold engine so we're gonna do step 5

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.440 
cold engine so we're gonna do step 5
next<00:05:25.410> turn<00:05:25.560> our<00:05:25.680> fuel<00:05:25.890> pump<00:05:25.950> on<00:05:26.340> increase<00:05:27.240> our

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
next turn our fuel pump on increase our

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.860 
next turn our fuel pump on increase our
mixture<00:05:28.850> check<00:05:29.850> on<00:05:30.000> that<00:05:30.150> fuel<00:05:30.420> flow<00:05:30.660> right

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
mixture check on that fuel flow right

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.840 
mixture check on that fuel flow right
there<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:31.320> about<00:05:31.440> 3<00:05:31.800> gallons<00:05:31.980> per<00:05:32.340> hour<00:05:32.490> for

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:32.850 
there it's about 3 gallons per hour for

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.210 
there it's about 3 gallons per hour for
3<00:05:33.030> to<00:05:33.120> 5<00:05:33.270> seconds<00:05:33.690> that<00:05:34.560> looks<00:05:34.770> good

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
3 to 5 seconds that looks good

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:37.810 
3 to 5 seconds that looks good
we<00:05:35.430> can<00:05:35.610> pull<00:05:35.790> back<00:05:35.820> our<00:05:36.210> mixture<00:05:36.600> to<00:05:36.690> idle<00:05:37.020> and

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
we can pull back our mixture to idle and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.460 
we can pull back our mixture to idle and
turn<00:05:38.820> our<00:05:38.970> fuel<00:05:39.180> pump<00:05:39.210> off

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.540 

next<00:05:44.470> we're<00:05:44.560> gonna<00:05:44.650> make<00:05:44.860> sure<00:05:45.040> the<00:05:45.130> propeller

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
next we're gonna make sure the propeller

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.820 
next we're gonna make sure the propeller
area<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.060> clear<00:05:46.390> in<00:05:46.600> this<00:05:46.690> case<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.680> real

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
area is clear in this case in the real

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.860 
area is clear in this case in the real
case<00:05:48.100> you<00:05:48.820> would<00:05:48.970> yell<00:05:49.120> clear<00:05:49.450> outside<00:05:49.750> the

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
case you would yell clear outside the

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.060 
case you would yell clear outside the
window<00:05:50.140> I'm<00:05:50.260> not<00:05:50.410> gonna<00:05:50.560> do<00:05:50.710> that

could<00:07:08.139> say<00:07:08.590> the<00:07:09.250> panel<00:07:09.669> could<00:07:09.850> use<00:07:10.030> a<00:07:10.060> little

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:10.479 
could say the panel could use a little

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:12.529 
could say the panel could use a little
bit<00:07:10.660> where<00:07:10.900> it<00:07:10.990> just<00:07:11.289> looks<00:07:11.530> a<00:07:11.650> little<00:07:11.680> too<00:07:12.070> a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.540 
you know 2d I guess is the good way to
say<00:07:18.430> it<00:07:18.460> for<00:07:18.699> my<00:07:18.820> liking<00:07:20.190> compared<00:07:21.190> to<00:07:21.280> their
