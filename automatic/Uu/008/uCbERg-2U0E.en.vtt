00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:09.230
 let's calculate the integral x party x 

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:11.519
 25 the first thing we notice that we have a 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.070
 fraction 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.070
 and we think about the denominator because it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.490
 think immediately about this formula 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.770
 have a fraction 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.770
 this is neperian logarithm of t 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.950
 what is the derivative of this denominator 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.710
 with the telepath of x 425 is 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:37.570
 we put here be appraised x squared 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 which is 2 x + derivative 25 0 the drift of 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.490
 these x and above we have an x â€‹â€‹then 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.840
 to have the derivative up as in the 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.150
 formula of the denominator 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.809
 here you need to display a 2 what 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.440
 we need that here we copy everything 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.039
 appear 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.039
 12 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.540
 to start we put a means and this in 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.540
 half of here we got it out 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:16.230
 and now let's look 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.620
 that here this would make the role of the tea 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.540
 of the formula and its derivative is 2x 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.490
 derivative 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.350
 What do we have here? 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 we have everything we have from above and from 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.850
 down then we can apply the formula 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.000
 in the middle of here in front is subtracted 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.910
 all the time and this would fit us 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.100
 neperian logarithm of the denominator in 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.979
 absolute value the absolute value of the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.630
 denominator that is x block plus 25 and 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.259
 this more d 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.600
 t varying in r if we want a detail 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.700
 although you could leave so it's 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.430
 square plus 25 and that will be the square 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.619
 it's good to be a box and 25 too 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.420
 the sum of two amounts is positive 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.280
 that are positive positive we can 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.700
 omit if we want the absolute value 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.369
 but nothing would happen if we left it 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.240
 this would be the result of the integral 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.240
 raised
