00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.860
 by the way the newest intro thanks sau not 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.199
 forget to go to his channel there are many 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.710
 all sorts of interesting about the game and not 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.079
 only 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.560
 hi everybody with you a plate after 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.779
 as in the distant 1986 atomic exploded 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.609
 station in Chernobyl and after that 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.040
 terrible incident became known 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.960
 public the topic of the danger of nuclear 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.210
 reactors and the consequences of their problems 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.650
 has become very popular and still 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.839
 creates a work on a similar 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.210
 the theme is well the same famous 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.030
 stalker for example naturally japanese by 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.070
 such a tasty topic was not passed in 2008 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.800
 manga was born in the year 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.020
 and Tokyo survived a terrible catastrophe 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.640
 after three years the Japanese themselves have 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.140
 there was an accident on its nuclear 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.500
 fukushima reactor 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.899
 and already in 2013 manga kopecks was 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.479
 filmed the action of this anime 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.759
 going on the uncertain future of japan 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.590
 fifteen to sixteen years before the start 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.390
 a terrible thing happened in tokyo 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.000
 extinguishing disaster 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.560
 nuclear power plant which turned 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.780
 and the capital of the country abandoned 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.759
 the radioactive city is basically almost 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.280
 all people evacuated from there but 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.500
 Help signals are still originating 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.200
 send there in search of ordinary people 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.720
 there is no possibility therefore Japanese scientists 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.229
 created cappelles 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.840
 genetically modified children are not 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.869
 susceptible to radiation and our main 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.090
 heroes 3 teen girl well of course who 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.849
 but Japan will save us except, as it were, or 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.099
 schoolgirls short skirts and so three 

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:44.720
 schoolgirl immune to radiation 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:47.420
 walking on deadly 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.020
 radioactive to the city and are looking for the latter 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.050
 survivors 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.599
 the main thing they have on the Russian bar elder 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.280
 possessing an incredibly strong and yet 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.560
 who likes to help people 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.020
 it turns out she is true through time 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.539
 What she very often ready 2 ottayka 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.030
 Fuku Mura a spectacleman who stands 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.290
 a team like everyone who knows a nerd very 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.500
 loves animals and possess taormina 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.780
 too often rewind 3 alive bites 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.210
 generally useless creation zero without 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.660
 reasons likes to eat and too often 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.880
 review 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.370
 In general , such a team of girls turned out 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.310
 in these like roaring 1 2 series hall will 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930
 crap the question arises and cooked at all 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.850
 these drops and she is in such a responsible 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.040
 missions like saving people in an abandoned 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.680
 city or they just went to a special 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.350
 the school although the currents of the city ​​are radioactive 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.550
 countries and there are not only thirsty for salvation 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.160
 unfortunate townspeople 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.680
 but also aggressive people or already 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.040
 not people in general, look understand 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.709
 yourself 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.600
 once the action we are not nearly at 99 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.580
 percent happens abandoned tokyo 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.170
 we can not say what it looks like 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.500
 everyone is very beautiful 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.190
 all the streets of the ruined house floor 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.959
 overgrown shops look mysterious and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.630
 attractive and want to take a walk there 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.130
 Scales to, too, deserves praise although I 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.250
 usually did not pay her any 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
 attention colors juicy and saturated 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.620
 and this gradient also played its role 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.510
 if you take a closer look at the colors here and 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.269
 they will be so smoothly flowing out 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.730
 one to the other in general it does everything 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.640
 a drop of real pleasure for the eyes 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.280
 But if we talk about the plot, it does not 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.200
 so ideally he has a lot of mistakes and blunders 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.670
 especially related to characters 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.980
 technical side 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.709
 an example of life itself in the past 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.310
 radioactive in the city but about the second I'm 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.830
 keep silent 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.959
 Won for example metro 2033 consists entirely 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.690
 From blunders and generally tin metro after 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.180
 nuclear strike is impossible but it turned out 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.880
 that is interesting and people like it 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.560
 what about the second character is that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.640
 spoils its presence network 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.070
 beautiful landscape 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.630
 girls forever whine some passion 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.760
 foam characters the brain is visible 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.470
 atrophied living plants in the midst 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.780
 Tokyo about enemies 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.670
 it is generally a day in history as noted 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.130
 my familiar villain in this anime 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.799
 suffers from naruto healing well 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.200
 how do you go there naruto fights learn with 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.990
 the enemy several series that hates him 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.120
 all that and then burrow 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.490
 yes cop from a critical moment with me 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.980
 to let the enemy die helps him and 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.840
 make wonderful talk about friendship and more 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.820
 do something special enemy immediately 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.680
 inflamed owning a check in the clean half 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.870
 love begins to swear eternal 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.390
 friendship and they become the best frends 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.180
 fucking in general in the chapel they are here too 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.640
 the very thing i eat their characters and then two times and 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.070
 miscalculated and in the frame they are not too 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.950
 often appear and so the result of my review 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.670
 them anime drops is good and 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.260
 interesting 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.390
 but yes really chic but not 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.790
 falls short but galya pav much 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.710
 illogic i am the main problem of this 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.870
 anime I'm too childish over 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.930
 those who watched think will understand me 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.650
 but it is worth looking especially for a fan 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.810
 this genre 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.070
