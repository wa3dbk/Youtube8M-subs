00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.940
 Today is for you he of rules 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.269
 video to the witcher is a sting 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.639
 card game of nokia but there are some 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.740
 in this game so he's going to say 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.400
 have to guess how many stitches too 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:26.220
 get and how the whole thing works 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.080
 no video I told say as 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.019
 plays in brussels 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.270
 with us it is so there is included 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.280
 a little block on this blog 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.890
 can you name your name up here 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.899
 register from the respective players and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.760
 has to see right here as well 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.969
 many will be played down the see 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.329
 one appeared here three players 20 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.399
 round play four players would 15 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.820
 playing five players would be twelve 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.570
 six players play us ten down 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
 play 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.030
 what does it mean the whole will be in 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.399
 every round at every player, so many 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.870
 cards dealt like this under straight 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.479
 that means a first round 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.520
 then you get a card in the 11th 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.810
 every 1120 eg every 20 cards 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.229
 It is now played the follow the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.450
 ie it will go and split 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 First would like to state 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 that means she will be a left right 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.350
 and in the middle of me so then the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.979
 next step 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.380
 I think the trump color on the case 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.720
 it applies here now everyone looks 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.500
 player still has his cable connection open 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.659
 and the player to the left of the dealer 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.430
 would have to announce first as well 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.920
 get this stitch or not 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.479
 one becomes the scribe who stays 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.619
 I changed the scribe scribe 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.369
 do not try anything for too 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.880
 complicated 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.580
 he has the names here now 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.850
 small column 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.460
 a big column in the small column 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.370
 always write you in 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.390
 how many stitches each player has 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.970
 has announced so later 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.190
 Compare but be on time or 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.930
 Not 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.680
 would would say in this fall 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.690
 maybe say okay I have it myself 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.790
 to create meat you have to consider 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:25.000
 There are four colors 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:28.510
 that is red green yellow and blue 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.670
 four names and 14 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.740
 the numbers from 1 to 13 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.820
 mostly a conversation continued bad 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.530
 and no trump and that would actually 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.170
 that would be for some rounds 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:47.660
 Now we come to the points award 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:51.800
 and there are 20 per won stitch 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.840
 points and ten per correct bid 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.440
 points that is the first round can 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.300
 I will make a maximum of 30 points 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.250
 kill him and he will get him too 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.010
 he would rather get 30 points for that 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.570
 20 for the engraving and c for the right one 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:11.570
 announcement how to win a sting now 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.610
 the left of the donor always gives 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.310
 first the first card in the stitch 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.910
 into it and the others have to remember it 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.530
 hold 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.650
 that means if I have this card now 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.310
 would play all the players 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.410
 mandatory 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.620
 so one can not play rome 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.019
 he could also play laptop games 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.410
 or other color live 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.370
 Mind you, wins here always the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.500
 highest number in the ice when I go 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.770
 benefit now 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.380
 played with some twelve I was 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.910
 but none have not the 13 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.610
 yellow where money is not a trump card 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.770
 this card the 13 money the 12 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.050
 defeat red because the highest number 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.120
 wins the sting not the highest 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.260
 the number served should be the highest number 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.420
 third let it be trump 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.670
 played when there is a trump here 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.380
 would be played here as well 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.350
 even the only trump are enough 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.780
 12 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.930
 it needs to be served it's magic 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:26.260
 or after the magic and fools can 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.840
 always be played no matter serve 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.919
 can or not 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:39.630
 important in the name and in the 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:41.890
 magic that you since it's fourth child 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.690
 it is also the possibility with the 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.630
 winning names because the first one after 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.430
 wins in prank, so to speak 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.490
 unloading counts for nothing 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.750
 the magic walked all the magicians 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.300
 may always throw 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:01.180
 he also has the highest 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:03.760
 hit number over the one of the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.700
 random won hand takes the sting before 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.250
 sit down and put that in front of you and 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.200
 the new stab wound starts naturally 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.930
 only because he later only one each 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.169
 but who would be a 20 now 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.860
 won the second round sting I would 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.280
 start when the creepy all distributed 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.320
 are 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.930
 then the training is done it will 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.449
 by counting the cards give change 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.600
 and also the announcer grows that is 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:36.930
 the next one would be to the left of the caliber 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:41.530
 changing so what now happens if at 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.270
 trump on which a magician lies at 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.720
 step on deck a wizard is lying too 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.620
 the one who has split the color 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.599
 determine 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.759
 that is the cash register card office 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.639
 look at it and say okay after all 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.580
 a lot of red red is now printing what would be 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:01.150
 However, if one is up with 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:04.000
 1 is up then there is no 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.400
 despite probably noticed no matter which 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.320
 stations the last round will be there 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.550
 the data will be completely distributed 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.380
 There is no trump it is important in there 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:16.840
 really the highest number wins and 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.520
 then you can do it with five or six 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.710
 It's important to win already 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.990
 what happens if somebody once 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.539
 very first card in the stich purely throws 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.659
 he does not know what you serve 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:34.240
 then it will be like this then 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.940
 next ride is also played 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.580
 for example red would be red now 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.979
 color to serve the driver that is 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.630
 each additional games need these colors 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:45.490
 play 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.849
 what happens when a magician starts 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:51.220
 being played by a magician is gone 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.720
 no matter we can feed what you like 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.470
 will you have to have to use anything 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.599
 note 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.729
 you can go also so ne high cards 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.560
 Maybe I'll trade with those 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.450
 win 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.550
 but maybe not anymore 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.860
 that does not need a wizarding game 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.000
 that over can be good for the over 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.950
 other or bad 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.810
 that offer until the end of the 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.350
 table off and the one with the most 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:21.419
 win points so that's it 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:24.030
 back fun and so that 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:27.680
 Conclusion always follows until then I would 

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.680
 say you have got yourselves
