00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
Jack 35 vibrating one and yes it still
works<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.460> pretty<00:00:44.820> much<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> water<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.690> is

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
works so pretty much the water is is

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.720 
works so pretty much the water is is
that<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.250> vibrating<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:47.940> or<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
that the the vibrating one or is that

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
that the the vibrating one or is that
the<00:00:50.730> focusing<00:00:51.329> glass<00:00:51.809> at<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.140> camera<00:00:52.739> focuses

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the focusing glass at the camera focuses

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.580 
the focusing glass at the camera focuses
on<00:00:53.280> when<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.030> turn<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.570> vibrates<00:00:55.140> back<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
on when you turn on it vibrates back and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.350 
on when you turn on it vibrates back and
forth<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.070> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:56.550> any<00:00:56.670> debris<00:00:57.120> or
