lower league but I couldn't quite work
out<00:00:16.440> out<00:00:16.590> today<00:00:16.859> I'm<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.100> sure<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.340> they've

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
out out today I'm not sure if they've

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.950 
out out today I'm not sure if they've
taken<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.910> option<00:00:18.210> out<00:00:18.330> I've<00:00:18.510> noticed

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
taken the option out I've noticed

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.080 
taken the option out I've noticed
actually<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.220> career<00:00:20.550> mode<00:00:20.699> does<00:00:20.880> seem

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
actually that the career mode does seem

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.519 
actually that the career mode does seem
quite<00:00:21.240> bare-bones<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.230> they've<00:00:22.350> taken

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
quite bare-bones it's like they've taken

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.290 
quite bare-bones it's like they've taken
everything<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.160> made<00:00:23.310> 14<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.000> great
