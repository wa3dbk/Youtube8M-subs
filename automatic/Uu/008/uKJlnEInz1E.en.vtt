most popular from what I could read and
make<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.210> ally<00:00:36.510> with<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.050> sky<00:00:37.320> it's<00:00:37.559> called

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
circular and I do think that this is a

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
circular and I do think that this is a
great<00:00:47.219> brush<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.760> three<00:00:48.030> dollars<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.780> sure

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the one I do have to compare it to is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
the one I do have to compare it to is
Kevin<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.989> Quan<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.160> looks<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> as

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
Kevin a Quan and it looks like this as

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.000 
Kevin a Quan and it looks like this as
you<00:00:53.879> can<00:00:53.910> tell<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.920> know

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you can tell it's a lot more you know

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.930 
you can tell it's a lot more you know
this<00:00:56.780> versus<00:00:57.780> less<00:00:58.070> so<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.340> benefit<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.910> that

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
this versus less so the benefit to that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
this versus less so the benefit to that
is<00:01:00.329> there's<00:01:00.570> way<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:00.899> bristles<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.100> feel

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
is there's way more bristles and I feel

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
is there's way more bristles and I feel

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
have similar to this might shoot me more

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.380 
have similar to this might shoot me more
are<00:05:26.950> more<00:05:27.250> like<00:05:27.520> these<00:05:27.760> shapes<00:05:28.120> like

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390 
are more like these shapes like

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.330 
are more like these shapes like
eyeshadow<00:05:28.870> brushes<00:05:29.140> here<00:05:29.590> this<00:05:30.010> one's<00:05:30.220> a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
eyeshadow brushes here this one's a

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400 
eyeshadow brushes here this one's a
little<00:05:30.580> bit<00:05:30.850> shorter<00:05:31.360> for<00:05:31.390> blending<00:05:32.170> but<00:05:32.350> I

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
little bit shorter for blending but I

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.030 
little bit shorter for blending but I
don't<00:05:32.620> have<00:05:32.770> anything<00:05:33.040> entirely<00:05:34.710> similar<00:05:35.710> to

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
don't have anything entirely similar to

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.790 
don't have anything entirely similar to
compare<00:05:36.430> it<00:05:36.580> to<00:05:36.790> but<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.480> feel<00:05:37.870> like<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:38.530> size

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
compare it to but I feel like the size

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.659 
compare it to but I feel like the size
of<00:05:39.160> this<00:05:39.520> guy<00:05:40.360> here<00:05:40.840> is<00:05:41.110> way<00:05:41.770> wider<00:05:42.100> like<00:05:42.520> they

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
of this guy here is way wider like they

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.250 
of this guy here is way wider like they
can<00:05:42.790> really<00:05:43.090> pinch<00:05:43.510> that<00:05:43.780> in<00:05:43.900> or<00:05:44.050> something

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
can really pinch that in or something

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.780 
can really pinch that in or something
because<00:05:44.530> there's<00:05:44.770> not<00:05:44.919> enough<00:05:45.160> than<00:05:45.340> bristles

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
because there's not enough than bristles

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.370 
because there's not enough than bristles
to<00:05:46.000> kind<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.240> fill<00:05:46.450> this<00:05:46.630> space<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:47.110> feel<00:05:47.260> like

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
to kind of fill this space I feel like

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.380 
to kind of fill this space I feel like
it's<00:05:47.530> a<00:05:47.590> little<00:05:47.860> weak<00:05:48.040> in<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.250> area<00:05:48.760> so<00:05:49.270> it

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
it's a little weak in that area so it

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.610 
it's a little weak in that area so it
could<00:05:49.540> be<00:05:49.570> a<00:05:49.750> lifetime's<00:05:50.200> there<00:05:50.380> especially

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
could be a lifetime's there especially

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.230 
could be a lifetime's there especially
for<00:05:51.010> brush<00:05:51.190> like<00:05:51.370> this<00:05:51.580> where<00:05:52.120> it's

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
for brush like this where it's

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.120 
for brush like this where it's
technically<00:05:52.660> kind<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.020> like<00:05:53.200> first<00:05:53.470> smudging

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
technically kind of like first smudging

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:56.070 
technically kind of like first smudging
or<00:05:54.310> like<00:05:54.490> really<00:05:54.760> working<00:05:55.180> coloring<00:05:55.840> since

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
it was a little bit denser but they're

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:27.220 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.290

okay so the Kabuki brush looks like this

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.890 
okay so the Kabuki brush looks like this
very<00:06:32.300> very<00:06:32.870> soft<00:06:34.060> kind<00:06:35.060> of<00:06:35.240> an<00:06:35.330> it<00:06:35.480> I<00:06:35.510> don't

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
very very soft kind of an it I don't

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.660 
very very soft kind of an it I don't
know<00:06:35.990> it's<00:06:36.140> hard<00:06:36.320> to<00:06:36.440> explain<00:06:36.710> how<00:06:36.830> odd<00:06:37.280> it<00:06:37.520> is

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670 
know it's hard to explain how odd it is

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.700 
know it's hard to explain how odd it is
how<00:06:37.940> soft<00:06:38.210> I<00:06:38.480> don't<00:06:38.660> know<00:06:38.720> it's<00:06:38.870> like<00:06:38.960> it's

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:39.710 
how soft I don't know it's like it's

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.040 
how soft I don't know it's like it's
like<00:06:39.740> a<00:06:39.890> bunny<00:06:40.160> only<00:06:41.120> not<00:06:41.300> a<00:06:41.330> bunny<00:06:41.630> because<00:06:41.930> I

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
like a bunny only not a bunny because I

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.470 
like a bunny only not a bunny because I
would<00:06:42.200> be<00:06:42.320> sad<00:06:42.560> but<00:06:42.820> looks<00:06:43.820> like<00:06:44.000> that

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:44.480 
would be sad but looks like that

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.780 
would be sad but looks like that
so<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.900> two-tone<00:06:45.320> hair<00:06:45.620> which<00:06:45.890> suggests<00:06:46.460> it

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:46.790 
so the two-tone hair which suggests it

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.280 
so the two-tone hair which suggests it
would<00:06:46.910> be<00:06:47.060> like<00:06:47.240> hair<00:06:47.510> and<00:06:47.720> you<00:06:47.990> know<00:06:48.110> it's

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
would be like hair and you know it's

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.320 
would be like hair and you know it's
synthetic<00:06:48.550> but<00:06:49.550> it's<00:06:49.700> not<00:06:49.910> it's<00:06:50.210> all

of on a stick this is what I use

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.159 
of on a stick this is what I use
normally<00:07:10.430> this<00:07:10.580> is<00:07:10.730> Kevin<00:07:11.060> F<00:07:11.150> on<00:07:11.330> and<00:07:11.840> so<00:07:12.050> it's
