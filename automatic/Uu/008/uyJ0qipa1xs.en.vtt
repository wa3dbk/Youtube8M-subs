00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 To make money in the foreign exchange market, you must buy low and then sell high. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.500
 Very simple, let's take a look at this example: 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 In theory, how much do you need to buy and sell currency? 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.000
 Let us assume that you have $1,000 in your trading account. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.000
 The current exchange rate of the euro against the dollar is 1.25. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.500
 In other words, for 1 euro 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 You can redeem it to $1.25. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 You predict that the euro will appreciate against the dollar. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.800
 Based on this forecast, you bought 800 Euros for $1,000. 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
 It turns out that your prediction is correct! 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.700
 The euro exchange rate rose from 1.25 to 1.26. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 You decide to close the trade, get the profit, and settle down. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Your 800 Euros are exchanged for $1008. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.500
 The profit for this deal is $8. Not too much? 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800
 You ask a question: Can you increase your profits? 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 To maximize your profit potential, you can use leverage. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 Leverage is a loan that is provided to you by Tickmill. 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.000
 The size of the foreign exchange loan can be different. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
 But Tickmill offers you up to 500 times more than your initial capital. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.800
 This will increase your potential profit by 500 times. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800
 Big? However, please remember... 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.800
 Increasing leverage means not only more profit potential 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.100
 It also magnifies the risk! Managing your risk is very important! 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 Let's look at an example of how to use leverage 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 1 Zoom in 500 times (1:500). Now you have the same $1000 in your account 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.000
 You expect the euro to appreciate against the dollar 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.800
 Therefore, you decide the maximum possible loan from your broker for $499,000. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 Now, the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar is 1.25. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 You bought 400,000 euros for all the $500,000. 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.000
 Your judgment is correct, the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar subsequently rose to 1.26 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 You return to $504,000 for 400,000 euros 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.300
 This way, you now have $5,000 in your account 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.900
 The loan is returned to your broker. So your net profit is $4,000. 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Just one day of trading, an incredible result! 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.800
 In this example, your predictions prove to be correct. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 But if the price is not rising 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 If the euro fell against the dollar 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.400
 Your trade will be held until your loss equals your initial margin 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.100
 That is $1,000. At this point your transaction will be 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.000
 Automatically close the position and the broker recovers the loan. 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.300
 Therefore, the situation of your loss broker loan is almost impossible. 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.000
 Taking into account all the factors, you have now seen how to use leverage. 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 If you make the right decision, leverage can increase your profit. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.000
 If you make a wrong judgment, leverage will not limit your losses. 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.200
 Let us tell you why Tickmill likes to see successful transactions with customers. 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.100
