00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 hello i'm from tamgho sanrio milk 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.880
 photograph I promised you this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.800
 episode I wait for it since very 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.300
 a long time honestly I'm happy 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.360
 to do it then 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.640
 Ben saw the title the role of the shutter 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.530
 in flash photography 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.690
 so it's true that when I did 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.500
 the first episodes on youtube I 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.820
 you talked about the basics of 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 photograph we had started with the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.059
 triangle of exposure to the speaking of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.330
 three factors that was let's say 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 the shutter and the opening your 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.580
 diaphragm actually but as soon as 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.830
 you introduce a flash back in and 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.530
 it changes all that does not really change 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.390
 everything and ultimately you add 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.710
 powers to his actors and that's 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.659
 exactly what are we going to do then at 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.460
 instead of making a single video that can 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.350
 all I decided to do to you three 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 videos do not worry I'm going 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 let out just about every two 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 days so this week you go 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 have three videos instead of one after 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.310
 I'm going on vacation so that's why 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.560
 I wanted to make a small gift 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.210
 here it then I'm not alone 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.710
 today I am with the beautiful megan 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.420
 which is refrigerated your new one is going 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.070
 save the English version and the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.509
 poor and b it is very cold 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.780
 we are in a tunnel and if you 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.969
 have to think about the shoots I made 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.829
 on orange mechanically the written jav 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.960
 here in fact we had made a fall to 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.920
 outside earlier in the day there 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.060
 there were too many gaps as often 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.920
 the causes is so we decided to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.999
 take shelter in this tunnel which there is 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.890
 maybe a little bit of classes and I 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.859
 I'll try to fix that in production 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.649
 if I can then today we will 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.090
 talk about the role of the shutter in the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.399
 flash photography so what is this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.759
 we have as a parameter our hands 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.329
 box baupin strip west of my box in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.539
 upstream flash cobra inside that has a 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.639
 trigger and it's already set to mode 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.560
 manual and at the power level the 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.140
 I've already measured all that's going to be 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.770
 half 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.560
 half power so 2000 power of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 pebbles already exposed correctly and to 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.530
 level of my settings here so I 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.810
 my bag of brands 3g shows eager on 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.310
 on the level of the settings and well 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.260
 I'm at synchro speed this is at 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.930
 say 1 1 2 hundredths of a second to 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.610
 level of the diaphragm I am at 6.3 and at 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.720
 level of the iso I'm at 400 then you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.700
 can you ask why I'm at 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.860
 400 well it's just for you 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.989
 illustrate the concept I had cover 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.580
 today I needed a little more 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:41.390
 of light because it is quite dark 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.790
 so alone to have as certain as 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.459
 you wonder what is the value 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:52.670
 of my zoom in my brush and well my 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 or my flash it set to 28 m 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.230
 why because I need to have 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.970
 a beam of light wide enough to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.959
 that it bounces in all my box sound 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.190
 rather than one and are ready finally here 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.320
 so what I'm going to do is I 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.090
 take an exhibition so with half 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.320
 power at the flash 1 2 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:15.340
 hundredths of a second 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.340
 an opening at 6.3 and an iso at 400 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.650
 when you see the dry except 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.540
 lights on the ceiling here from 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.579
 tunnel actually born win is 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.350
 enlightened only by massively there is 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.320
 absolutely no ambient light 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.380
 apart from these few spots there that I'm going 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.870
 to do now is that I'm going 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.390
 slow down my speed of 5 years this is at 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.400
 say that I was to stir 2 to 201 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.299
 hundredths well I'll cut 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.220
 ah but yes to 25 and because I fall to 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:51.079
 1 to 24 mm so here I am going down 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.019
 so at 1 25th and we'll see what that 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.489
 give then I will not change my 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:01.340
 flash i will not change my level i 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.690
 did not change my opening questions 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.650
 remarks and if we put the two pictures 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.459
 one next to the other you notice 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.720
 that actually slowing down the speed of 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:14.980
 my operator actually I lit 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:17.230
 moment my 5g world admires ambient who 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.400
 appears in the video you saw well 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.350
 that we were in a tunnel but on the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.850
 first picture you do not see because 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.800
 that we had only the light emitted from 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 the sandbox there is always the light 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.770
 emit the flavor if you zoom in 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.080
 we can see that the two photos 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.790
 the exhibition on megan has absolutely no 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.290
 not changed by what has changed 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.420
 is that now you need more than 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.100
 details on the tunnel you have more than 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.770
 details on the stage about 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.420
 information around 1 megan here 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 so that's the role actually due to 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.520
 the shutter of the operators' opinion 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.060
 when you're doing photography in 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.620
 flash 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:53.260
 yes you go 8the night the exhibition 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.780
 will only come from your flash where 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.210
 you 're gently going to actually over to 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.640
 catches and ambient light 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.630
 that's it for today in 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.820
 the next episode we'll talk 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.140
 the role of denisot in photography 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.850
 with matches waiting for the next 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:11.220
 times it's a butt who say love this 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.220
 that sailboat captured the barrel
