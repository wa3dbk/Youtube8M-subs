the most important feature on

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.240 
the most important feature on
think-tanks<00:00:06.480> belt<00:00:06.930> system<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.919> ability

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
think-tanks belt system is the ability

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.240 
think-tanks belt system is the ability
to<00:00:08.670> rotate<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.660> modular<00:00:10.110> components<00:00:10.860> all<00:00:11.040> the

wedding sports or concerts really what

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.080 
wedding sports or concerts really what
you're<00:00:19.740> doing<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> you're<00:00:20.369> changing<00:00:20.880> lenses

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
you're doing is you're changing lenses

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.840 
you're doing is you're changing lenses
during<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.900> event<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.100> example<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.670> just

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
during the event so for example I just

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.179 
during the event so for example I just
took<00:00:24.000> off<00:00:24.180> my<00:00:24.210> 72<00:00:24.810> 200<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.470> I'm<00:00:25.560> replacing<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
took off my 72 200 and I'm replacing it

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.429 
took off my 72 200 and I'm replacing it
with<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> wide<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> big<00:00:27.150> hood<00:00:27.390> so<00:00:28.289> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
with a wide with the big hood so this

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.550 
with a wide with the big hood so this
ability<00:00:28.699> to<00:00:29.699> rotate<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.480> pieces<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.289> belt

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
lens cases to the back again is really

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.060 
lens cases to the back again is really
essential<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.900> fourth<00:01:19.170> feature<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.680> consider

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
essential the fourth feature to consider

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.190 
essential the fourth feature to consider
is<00:01:20.220> compressibility<00:01:21.030> when<00:01:21.450> you're<00:01:21.600> traveling

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
is compressibility when you're traveling

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.960 
is compressibility when you're traveling
and<00:01:22.350> you're<00:01:22.439> shooting<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:22.920> event<00:01:23.220> you're

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and you're shooting an event you're

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.179 
and you're shooting an event you're
constantly<00:01:24.750> packing<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.380> repacking<00:01:25.950> things

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
constantly packing and repacking things

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.609 
constantly packing and repacking things
so<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.119> example<00:01:27.540> our<00:01:27.630> skin<00:01:27.960> pouches<00:01:28.409> don't

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so for example our skin pouches don't

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.190 
so for example our skin pouches don't
have<00:01:28.770> any<00:01:28.920> foam<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.729> they<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.060> entirely<00:01:30.630> flat

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
have any foam so they go entirely flat

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
have any foam so they go entirely flat
once<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.890> take<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> lens<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.640> which<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
once you take the lens out which is

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.719 
once you take the lens out which is
perfect<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.659> travel<00:01:34.079> our<00:01:34.770> modular<00:01:35.310> cases

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
perfect for travel our modular cases

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
perfect for travel our modular cases
have<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.150> millimeters<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> foam<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.680> has

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
have three millimeters of foam so it has

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
have three millimeters of foam so it has
some<00:01:38.040> protection<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:38.640> it's<00:01:38.939> not<00:01:39.090> overly

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
some protection but it's not overly

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.960 
some protection but it's not overly
padded<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.500> even<00:01:40.799> these<00:01:40.890> pouches<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.700> fold

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
padded so even these pouches can fold

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370 
padded so even these pouches can fold
flat<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> put<00:01:42.960> them<00:01:43.110> into

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
flat and when you put them into

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.480 
flat and when you put them into
something<00:01:43.649> else<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.220> you're<00:01:44.340> actually

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
something else when you're actually

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.819 
something else when you're actually
traveling<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.899> fifth<00:01:46.140> feature<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.649> consider

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
traveling the fifth feature to consider

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.609 
traveling the fifth feature to consider
is<00:01:47.310> streamlining<00:01:48.119> your<00:01:48.450> body<00:01:48.720> profile<00:01:49.380> when

is streamlining your body profile when

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
is streamlining your body profile when
you're<00:01:49.740> actually<00:01:49.979> working<00:01:50.549> if<00:01:51.210> you're

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
you're actually working if you're

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.210 
you're actually working if you're
working<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.960> crowd<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.290> don't<00:01:52.680> want<00:01:52.950> things

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
working in a crowd you don't want things

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.889 
working in a crowd you don't want things
sticking<00:01:53.670> off<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.210> hip<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.689> can

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
sticking off of your hip which can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.440 
sticking off of your hip which can
potentially<00:01:55.380> hit<00:01:55.979> people<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> crowd<00:01:56.670> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
potentially hit people in the crowd so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.060 
potentially hit people in the crowd so
what<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> think-tank<00:01:58.469> system

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
what you can do with a think-tank system

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
what you can do with a think-tank system
again<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.729> can<00:01:59.850> rotate<00:02:00.060> these<00:02:00.479> pieces<00:02:00.540> all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
again you can rotate these pieces all

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.289 
again you can rotate these pieces all
the<00:02:01.259> way<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> back<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.430> your<00:02:02.520> body<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:03.149> now

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
the way to the back of your body so now

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
the way to the back of your body so now
the<00:02:03.360> sides<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.079> body<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.500> clear<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the sides of your body is clear and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.570 
the sides of your body is clear and
because<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> pieces<00:02:06.420> rotate<00:02:07.079> 360<00:02:07.920> degrees<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
because the pieces rotate 360 degrees I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.150 
because the pieces rotate 360 degrees I
can<00:02:08.849> move<00:02:09.000> everything<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.929> back<00:02:10.200> my<00:02:10.830> sides

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
can move everything to the back my sides

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.710 
can move everything to the back my sides
are<00:02:11.370> clear<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.390> now<00:02:12.540> when<00:02:12.690> I<00:02:12.720> bend<00:02:13.020> down<00:02:13.140> in<00:02:13.440> ice

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
are clear so now when I bend down in ice

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.210 
are clear so now when I bend down in ice
shoot<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:14.140> don't<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.470> anything<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.160> area

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
shoot I don't have anything in this area

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220 
shoot I don't have anything in this area
that's<00:02:15.790> getting<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.240> way<00:02:16.420> or<00:02:16.660> blocking<00:02:17.110> my

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
that's getting in the way or blocking my

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.010 
that's getting in the way or blocking my
ability<00:02:17.710> to<00:02:17.890> kneel<00:02:18.070> down<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.450> sixth<00:02:19.840> feature

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
ability to kneel down the sixth feature

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.010 
ability to kneel down the sixth feature
to<00:02:20.410> consider<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.100> noise<00:02:21.700> reduction<00:02:22.150> when<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
to consider is noise reduction when you

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.330 
to consider is noise reduction when you
shoot<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.410> an<00:02:23.500> event<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:23.920> really<00:02:24.100> want<00:02:24.250> to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
shoot in an event you really want to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.270 
shoot in an event you really want to
minimize<00:02:24.490> or<00:02:25.120> dampen<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.140> audio<00:02:26.560> impact<00:02:27.070> that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
minimize or dampen the audio impact that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.730 
minimize or dampen the audio impact that
you<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.400> at<00:02:27.760> other<00:02:27.910> people<00:02:28.300> at<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> event

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
you have at other people at the event

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.640 
you have at other people at the event
and<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:29.770> hook<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.250> loop<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.520> nice<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.560> it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
and so hook and loop is nice but it

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.220 
and so hook and loop is nice but it
makes<00:02:32.830> that<00:02:32.980> sound<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:34.570> what<00:02:34.720> we've<00:02:34.870> done<00:02:35.080> on

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
makes that sound so what we've done on

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.020 
makes that sound so what we've done on
the<00:02:35.320> skin<00:02:35.590> pouches<00:02:36.130> is<00:02:36.610> we've<00:02:36.820> actually

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the skin pouches is we've actually

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.270 
the skin pouches is we've actually
created<00:02:37.420> a<00:02:37.690> feature<00:02:37.960> where<00:02:38.350> you<00:02:38.500> can<00:02:38.530> turn<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
created a feature where you can turn the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.220 
created a feature where you can turn the
hook<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.640> loop<00:02:39.820> on<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.420> off<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:40.960> when<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
hook and loop on and off so now when the

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.350 
hook and loop on and off so now when the
flap<00:02:41.470> comes<00:02:41.830> down<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.760> doesn't<00:02:43.090> make<00:02:43.210> any

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
flap comes down it doesn't make any

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.510 
flap comes down it doesn't make any
sound

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
sound

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.670 
sound
vii<00:02:45.520> feature<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> stability<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.410> belt

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
vii feature is the stability of the belt

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.880 
the last thing that you want to happen
is<00:02:51.730> for<00:02:51.790> your<00:02:52.180> belt<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.600> loosen<00:02:52.930> up<00:02:53.050> so<00:02:53.709> we've

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
is for your belt to loosen up so we've

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.190 
is for your belt to loosen up so we've
invented<00:02:54.220> this<00:02:54.640> special<00:02:55.150> metal<00:02:55.750> buckle

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
invented this special metal buckle

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.720 
invented this special metal buckle
stopper<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.740> what<00:02:56.920> this<00:02:57.100> does<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.580> it

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
stopper and what this does is it

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.790 
stopper and what this does is it
prevents<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.420> belt<00:02:58.660> from<00:02:58.870> loosening<00:02:59.380> when

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
prevents the belt from loosening when

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.830 
prevents the belt from loosening when

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.020 
you're actually wearing the belt you can
tighten<00:03:02.260> it<00:03:02.350> but<00:03:02.830> it<00:03:02.920> won't<00:03:03.130> loosen<00:03:03.430> past<00:03:03.850> a

tighten it but it won't loosen past a
certain<00:03:04.240> point<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:05.380> other<00:03:05.500> thing<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.800> allows

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
certain point the other thing it allows
