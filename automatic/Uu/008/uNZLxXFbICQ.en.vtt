that's really not what your body is
after<00:01:02.620> especially<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> warmer<00:01:03.790> months<00:01:03.820> it

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
after especially in the warmer months it

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:07.080 
after especially in the warmer months it
really<00:01:05.049> wants<00:01:05.379> a<00:01:05.500> slow<00:01:05.890> release<00:01:06.189> of<00:01:06.700> a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
really wants a slow release of a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.170 
really wants a slow release of a
consistent<00:01:07.659> amount<00:01:07.780> of<00:01:08.079> water<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.939> main

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
consistent amount of water so the main

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.779 
consistent amount of water so the main
way<00:01:10.990> that<00:01:11.020> I<00:01:11.229> enable<00:01:11.710> myself<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.280> do<00:01:12.429> that<00:01:12.640> is

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
way that I enable myself to do that is

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.520 
way that I enable myself to do that is
by<00:01:12.969> carrying<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.600> water<00:01:13.869> bottle<00:01:14.109> with<00:01:14.350> me

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
water bottle I found it took me a little

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.800 
water bottle I found it took me a little
bit<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.269> time<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.780> learn<00:03:26.579> it<00:03:27.579> can<00:03:27.849> actually

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
bit of time to learn it can actually

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.479 
bit of time to learn it can actually
knock<00:03:29.019> into<00:03:29.349> your<00:03:29.470> teeth<00:03:29.799> if<00:03:30.099> you're<00:03:30.280> not

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
knock into your teeth if you're not

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.550 
knock into your teeth if you're not
careful<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.209> I<00:03:31.690> found<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.260> if<00:03:32.410> you're

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
careful and I found that if you're

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.039 
careful and I found that if you're
drinking<00:03:32.889> from<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.180> water<00:03:34.450> bottle<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:34.900> you're

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
drinking from the water bottle as you're

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.229 
drinking from the water bottle as you're
driving<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:36.250> can<00:03:36.489> be<00:03:36.639> a<00:03:36.669> little<00:03:37.030> bit

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
driving that can be a little bit

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:39.449 
driving that can be a little bit
difficult<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.900> well<00:03:38.139> so<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.590> tend<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.040> pull<00:03:39.280> over

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
difficult as well so I tend to pull over

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.379 
difficult as well so I tend to pull over
and<00:03:39.910> sip<00:03:40.299> from<00:03:40.660> my<00:03:40.780> water<00:03:41.019> bottle<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.430> you

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
and sip from my water bottle and you

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.000 
and sip from my water bottle and you
obviously<00:03:43.840> have<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.109> be<00:03:44.169> quite<00:03:44.410> careful<00:03:44.440> about

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
obviously have to be quite careful about

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.059 
obviously have to be quite careful about
your<00:03:45.160> teeth<00:03:45.519> around<00:03:45.819> the<00:03:46.209> rim<00:03:46.419> as<00:03:46.660> well<00:03:47.069> but

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
your teeth around the rim as well but

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:50.699 
your teeth around the rim as well but
besides<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:49.030> think<00:03:49.750> it's<00:03:50.109> a<00:03:50.200> wonderful

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
besides that I think it's a wonderful

besides that I think it's a wonderful
product<00:03:51.419> personally<00:03:52.419> I<00:03:52.450> will<00:03:52.780> not<00:03:52.959> be<00:03:53.079> using

that's<00:04:31.419> another<00:04:31.690> thing<00:04:31.810> to<00:04:32.020> keep<00:04:32.289> in<00:04:32.470> mind<00:04:32.770> but

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
that's another thing to keep in mind but

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.189 
that's another thing to keep in mind but
as<00:04:33.699> I<00:04:33.820> said<00:04:34.090> if<00:04:34.210> you're<00:04:34.330> interested<00:04:34.960> in

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 
as I said if you're interested in

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.100 
as I said if you're interested in
conserving<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.979> environment<00:04:36.210> in<00:04:37.210> you<00:04:37.990> know

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
conserving the environment in you know

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.350 
conserving the environment in you know
helping<00:04:38.470> your<00:04:38.650> your<00:04:38.919> own<00:04:39.220> health<00:04:39.580> as<00:04:39.850> well<00:04:40.060> I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
helping your your own health as well I

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.360 
helping your your own health as well I
think<00:04:40.570> this<00:04:40.990> is<00:04:41.050> really<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.470> only<00:04:41.740> way<00:04:42.039> to<00:04:42.070> go

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
think this is really the only way to go

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.969 
think this is really the only way to go
so<00:04:43.270> when<00:04:43.449> you<00:04:43.570> compare<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.320> live<00:04:44.500> factory

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
so when you compare the live factory

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.620 
so when you compare the live factory
bottle<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:45.639> other<00:04:45.789> options<00:04:46.360> which

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
include using plastic cups around the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.430 
include using plastic cups around the
water<00:04:49.360> cooler<00:04:49.419> if<00:04:49.900> you're<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.169> a<00:04:50.229> work

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
water cooler if you're in a work

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.860 
water cooler if you're in a work
situation<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.880> can<00:04:52.090> add<00:04:52.210> up<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.389> lots<00:04:52.720> of

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
situation that can add up to lots of

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.020 
situation that can add up to lots of
landfill<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:53.680> not<00:04:53.860> easy<00:04:54.100> to<00:04:54.370> recycle<00:04:54.669> those

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
landfill it's not easy to recycle those

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.600 
landfill it's not easy to recycle those
cups<00:04:55.419> your<00:04:56.169> other<00:04:56.289> option<00:04:56.680> might<00:04:56.889> be<00:04:56.919> to<00:04:57.160> have

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
cups your other option might be to have

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.090 
cups your other option might be to have
a<00:04:57.850> large<00:04:58.240> plastic<00:04:58.780> water<00:04:59.500> bottle<00:04:59.889> which<00:05:00.070> you

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
a large plastic water bottle which you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.340 
a large plastic water bottle which you
reuse<00:05:00.699> but<00:05:01.389> again<00:05:01.660> you're<00:05:01.840> getting<00:05:01.960> all<00:05:02.229> the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
reuse but again you're getting all the

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.800 
reuse but again you're getting all the
chemicals<00:05:02.830> seeping<00:05:03.250> into<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.550> water<00:05:03.850> and

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
chemicals seeping into the water and

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.390 
chemicals seeping into the water and
your<00:05:04.960> other<00:05:05.110> option<00:05:05.560> might<00:05:05.740> be<00:05:05.889> just<00:05:06.070> to<00:05:06.190> use<00:05:06.370> a

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
your other option might be just to use a

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.219 
your other option might be just to use a
regular<00:05:06.699> glass<00:05:07.240> but<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:07.720> all<00:05:07.870> know<00:05:08.050> that

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
regular glass but we all know that

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.779 
regular glass but we all know that
they're<00:05:08.380> not<00:05:08.560> particularly<00:05:09.010> portable<00:05:09.610> I

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:09.789 
they're not particularly portable I

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.240 
they're not particularly portable I
think<00:05:10.360> the<00:05:10.630> light<00:05:10.870> factory<00:05:11.530> water<00:05:11.919> bottle

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
think the light factory water bottle

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.550 
think the light factory water bottle
really<00:05:12.580> comes<00:05:12.820> out<00:05:13.030> ahead<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:14.169> is<00:05:14.320> the

really comes out ahead and it is the

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.980 
really comes out ahead and it is the
most<00:05:14.770> convenient<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:15.820> best<00:05:16.270> product<00:05:16.780> out

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990
