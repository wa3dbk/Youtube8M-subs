00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
cycle heart goes right liquori of course

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.510 
cycle heart goes right liquori of course
I<00:02:14.540> wish<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.900> was<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.650> know<00:02:15.770> our<00:02:15.980> man<00:02:16.370> it

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
I wish it was like you know our man it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.390 
I wish it was like you know our man it
could<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.700> been<00:02:16.790> real<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.230> wasn't<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.370> I

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
could have been real but it wasn't so I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.450 
could have been real but it wasn't so I
believe<00:02:20.150> they've<00:02:20.660> tried<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:20.990> make<00:02:21.320> this<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.800> a

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
believe they've tried to make this one a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.730 
believe they've tried to make this one a
hollow<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.870> it<00:02:23.990> seems<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.410> have<00:02:24.530> some

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
hollow because it seems to have some

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.640 
hollow because it seems to have some
sort<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.070> glitter<00:02:25.940> effects<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.380> picture

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
sort of glitter effects in the picture

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.320 
sort of glitter effects in the picture
of<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:27.800> backgrounds<00:02:28.340> still<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:28.940> can<00:02:29.150> see

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
of the backgrounds still if you can see

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.690 
of the backgrounds still if you can see
that<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:30.380> doesn't<00:02:30.500> seem<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.830> work<00:02:31.340> it

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
that but it doesn't seem to work it

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.530 
that but it doesn't seem to work it
works<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:33.340> basically<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:35.060> probably<00:02:35.330> can't

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
works and basically you probably can't

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.440 
works and basically you probably can't
see<00:02:35.630> because<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.050> camera<00:02:36.320> quality<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:37.450> it's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
see because the camera quality but it's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.100 
see because the camera quality but it's
a<00:02:39.130> not<00:02:40.130> very<00:02:40.160> good<00:02:40.520> quality<00:02:40.670> quality<00:02:41.390> at<00:02:41.840> all

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
a not very good quality quality at all

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.760 
a not very good quality quality at all
it's<00:02:42.590> all<00:02:42.770> blurred<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.550> pixelated<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:45.410> if

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
it's all blurred and pixelated and if

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.910 
it's all blurred and pixelated and if
you<00:02:45.860> turn<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.130> over<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.459> back<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:48.590> colors

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
you turn it over to the back the colors

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.090 
you turn it over to the back the colors
off<00:02:49.130> and<00:02:50.140> first<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.350> all<00:02:51.440> one<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.770> things<00:02:51.950> I

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
off and first of all one of the things I

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.949 
off and first of all one of the things I
noticed<00:02:52.550> was<00:02:52.670> the<00:02:53.660> border<00:02:54.370> now<00:02:55.370> when<00:02:55.959> the

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
noticed was the border now when the

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.410 
noticed was the border now when the
borders<00:02:57.320> are<00:02:57.470> uneven<00:02:58.070> on<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.310> back<00:02:58.489> if<00:02:59.300> you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
borders are uneven on the back if you

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.580 
borders are uneven on the back if you
look<00:02:59.540> here<00:03:00.040> bring<00:03:01.040> up<00:03:01.190> close<00:03:02.260> right<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.410> see

uneven as well as got some black line
it's<00:03:10.580> really<00:03:10.940> uneven<00:03:12.160> so<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.340> sided<00:03:13.550> sticker

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
one side it's close to the edge and i'll

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.410 
one side it's close to the edge and i'll
show<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.310> difference<00:03:16.640> between<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:17.090> real

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
card and a fake card so here's the edge

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.650 
card and a fake card so here's the edge
real<00:03:22.489> cards<00:03:22.760> at<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:22.940> front<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:23.450> how

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
real cards at the front so you how

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.720 
real cards at the front so you how
darker<00:03:24.260> much<00:03:24.500> darker<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.040> real<00:03:25.220> one<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.519> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
darker much darker the real one is and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.890 
darker much darker the real one is and
the<00:03:26.720> border<00:03:26.989> line<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.260> perfectly<00:03:28.000> even<00:03:29.000> fake

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
the border line is perfectly even fake

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.009 
the border line is perfectly even fake
one<00:03:31.000> uneven<00:03:33.130> through<00:03:34.130> one<00:03:34.310> even<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.780> you<00:03:35.870> can

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
one uneven through one even so you can

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.070 
one uneven through one even so you can
tell<00:03:36.200> by<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.380> first<00:03:36.769> of<00:03:36.980> all<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.780> they<00:03:38.780> quite

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
tell by that first of all and they quite

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.590 
tell by that first of all and they quite
often<00:03:39.340> mess<00:03:40.340> up<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.610> borders<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.150> fake<00:03:41.330> cards

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
often mess up the borders and fake cards

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.590 
often mess up the borders and fake cards
and<00:03:42.370> second<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.400> all<00:03:43.489> something<00:03:44.269> i<00:03:44.450> noticed

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
and second of all something i noticed

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.140 
and second of all something i noticed
was<00:03:44.989> real<00:03:45.620> cards<00:03:45.980> aren't<00:03:46.190> they<00:03:46.610> aren't<00:03:46.820> strong

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
was real cards aren't they aren't strong

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.520 
was real cards aren't they aren't strong
so<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.450> obviously<00:03:47.600> still<00:03:47.959> piece<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.290> card

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
so this obviously still piece of card

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.960 
so this obviously still piece of card
but<00:03:49.340> they're<00:03:50.200> not<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.260> bendy<00:03:51.890> no<00:03:52.640> you<00:03:52.700> won't

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
but they're not that bendy no you won't

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.190 
but they're not that bendy no you won't
hold<00:03:53.090> them<00:03:53.239> i<00:03:53.329> think<00:03:53.510> are<00:03:53.630> these<00:03:53.840> are<00:03:53.959> so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
hold them i think are these are so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.450 
hold them i think are these are so
flimsy

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
flimsy

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.190 
flimsy
then<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.700> got<00:03:55.880> the<00:03:55.970> fake<00:03:56.180> ones<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.810> I<00:03:56.870> wasn't<00:03:57.140> on

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
then I got the fake ones and I wasn't on

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.010 
then I got the fake ones and I wasn't on
