00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
voice I don't know if my voice is very
sibilant<00:01:47.399> but<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.729> was<00:01:48.119> doing<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.360> corporate

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
sibilant but I was doing a corporate

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
sibilant but I was doing a corporate
interview<00:01:49.079> or<00:01:49.290> corporate<00:01:50.220> video<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:51.180> this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
interview or corporate video with this

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.499 
interview or corporate video with this
green<00:01:51.540> screen<00:01:51.860> last<00:01:52.860> few<00:01:53.130> days<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:54.119> noticed

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
green screen last few days and I noticed

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.450 
green screen last few days and I noticed
his<00:01:54.600> voice<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:55.049> very<00:01:55.110> sublet<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
his voice was very sublet on this

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
his voice was very sublet on this
particular<00:01:56.729> microphone<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.659> basically<00:02:00.659> I'm

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
particular microphone so basically I'm

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
particular microphone so basically I'm
just<00:02:01.049> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> test<00:02:01.619> these<00:02:01.799> out<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.189> don't

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
just going to test these out I don't

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.399 
just going to test these out I don't
know<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.759> results<00:02:03.119> are

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
know what the results are

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.690 
know what the results are
I'm<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> guess<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.430> one's<00:02:05.640> going

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
I'm going to guess that this one's going

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
I'm going to guess that this one's going
to<00:02:05.850> sound<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.000> little<00:02:06.060> bit<00:02:06.240> better<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.049> too

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
to sound a little bit better I'm not too

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.690 
to sound a little bit better I'm not too
sure<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> things<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
sure because one of the things the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
sure because one of the things the
options<00:02:09.090> I'm<00:02:09.239> looking<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> I'm<00:02:10.590> thinking

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
options I'm looking at is I'm thinking

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.860 
options I'm looking at is I'm thinking
about<00:02:11.099> getting<00:02:11.430> something<00:02:11.819> similar<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.720> this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
about getting something similar to this

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.490 
about getting something similar to this
but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.130 
but
maybe<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> road<00:02:14.160> video<00:02:14.880> is<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.570> road<00:02:15.810> Mike

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
maybe the road video is the road Mike

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.190 
maybe the road video is the road Mike
that<00:02:16.410> has<00:02:16.560> built-in<00:02:17.300> audio<00:02:18.300> recorder<00:02:18.750> that's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that has built-in audio recorder that's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.260 
that has built-in audio recorder that's
similar<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.150> can

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
similar to this one and that you can

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.940 
similar to this one and that you can
just<00:02:21.510> attach<00:02:21.960> right<00:02:22.380> on<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> top<00:02:22.770> of<00:02:22.800> your

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
just attach right on the top of your

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.670 
just attach right on the top of your
camera<00:02:23.810> that's<00:02:24.810> kind<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.230> an<00:02:25.320> option<00:02:25.590> I'm

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
camera that's kind of an option I'm

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.860 
camera that's kind of an option I'm
looking<00:02:25.950> at<00:02:26.070> next<00:02:26.480> because<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.540> don't<00:02:27.690> know<00:02:27.750> if

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
looking at next because I don't know if

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.350 
looking at next because I don't know if
I'm<00:02:27.960> happy<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.410> this<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.740> yet

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
I'm happy with this one yet

test<00:02:59.310> and<00:03:01.250> maybe<00:03:02.250> in<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.580> background<00:03:03.030> don't

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
test and maybe in the background don't

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.280 
test and maybe in the background don't
know<00:03:03.330> if<00:03:03.420> I'm<00:03:03.540> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> do<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.020> or<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.170> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
know if I'm going to do it or not but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.930 
know if I'm going to do it or not but
maybe<00:03:04.620> I'll<00:03:04.830> put<00:03:05.070> some<00:03:05.220> different<00:03:05.580> things<00:03:05.760> in

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
maybe I'll put some different things in

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.630 
maybe I'll put some different things in
the<00:03:06.030> background<00:03:06.480> make<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> little<00:03:07.200> bit<00:03:07.380> more

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
the background make a little bit more

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.590 
the background make a little bit more
compelling

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
compelling

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.760

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.970 
setup that I've been doing for years I
just<00:03:18.390> got<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> whole<00:03:19.470> bunch<00:03:19.680> of<00:03:19.830> different

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
equipment for that and I will do a video

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.530 
equipment for that and I will do a video
on<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.820> using<00:03:24.060> some<00:03:24.390> different
