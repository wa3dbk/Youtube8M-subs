00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.910
 it seems that 2013 is the same as 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.349
 wearable technology after google 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.000
 glass is now the turn of the watches 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.109
 to get closer to the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 final public 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.100
 here in ifa several of them have been released 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.070
 and perhaps the most commented and if here the 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.539
 samsung galaxy guide so indicate the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.099
 The feeling is that the cock gets a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 mixing a lot of things into one 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.779
 Clear Camera Watch Camera 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.090
 record videos and photos music player 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 notification center and even of a certain 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.809
 form a clear cell phone that for these 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.370
 functions it must be connected to 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.420
 some other device that allows you to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.340
 connections 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.550
 in this case it is compatible with note 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.350
 3d not 10.1 also announced here and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 galaxy s 34 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.730
 but before we talk about the functions we're going to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 Commenting on the visual appearance of it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.940
 modern though some have already spoken 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.309
 it looks like the ipod nano 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.980
 A bracelet is attached to his display. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.370
 1.63 inches super-thick and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.710
 resolution of 320 by 320 inside a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.590
 800- core edno 800- core processor 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 megahertz commands everything still has 512 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.830
 megabytes of 4 GB memory 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.540
 internal storage 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.549
 sufficient space for the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.009
 tasks he intends to fulfill has 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.490
 still gyro accelerometer bluetooth 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.920
 4.0 two microphones and one 1.9 camera 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.659
 megapixels 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.700
 the battery able to disappoint in the 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.680
 day to day samsung says it lasts a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.619
 All day long, but we are also in doubt. 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 because she has only 315 million perez here 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.680
 even have a lot of equipment that already 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.930
 is not calling look only 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.939
 will be that the battery is over and since 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.720
 we speak of camera is one of the most 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.729
 cool 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.009
 despite the low resolution the photos are 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.409
 up and with internal storage of 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.600
 4gb and maybe you even prefer to use this 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.310
 camera than on your smartphone to 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.470
 avoid problems with privacy 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.090
 samsung disabled photo function 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.829
 silent so that the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.430
 people do not go limping the spy for 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.770
 there 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.320
 you can also record videos in 720p 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.179
 the watch is sold in various colors and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.079
 design each for the specific type of 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.390
 consumer 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.039
 this vibrant orange for sportsmen and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.629
 this rose for women 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.000
 the bracelet that samsung said to be 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.379
 economy is a bit longer than 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.099
 that watches like the ones we see 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.349
 around 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.360
 and despite being very light the guide is a 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.129
 little bigger than a regular watch it 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.750
 draws a lot of attention to the pulse 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.450
 Another negative point is that the bracelets 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.519
 can not be changed on the functions 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.799
 samsung says there are already more than 70 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.079
 apps optimized for it is also 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.250
 can access the guide by boys and 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.780
 voice command 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.430
 putting clock on the ear you meet 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.780
 and it is also possible to play 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.540
 music on mobile 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.670
 but the volume is very low and oleg too 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.620
 It may bother you, you give the command alone. 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.329
 after some time it responds to 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 interface a bit slow and difficult to 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.110
 control and it is also not so intuitive 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.170
 guide should reach the Brazilian market 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.170
 already next month for $ 299 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.430
 will it catch you would buy leave your 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.290
 opinion in comments 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.760
