awesome concept show you today and what

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.470 
awesome concept show you today and what
it<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:05.069> is<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.400> dry<00:00:05.700> dock<00:00:05.910> for<00:00:05.940> your<00:00:06.330> boat

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
it is is it is a dry dock for your boat

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.810 
it is is it is a dry dock for your boat
it<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.230> based<00:00:07.440> off<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.649> animal<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.309> taz's

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
it is based off of animal and taz's

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.549 
it is based off of animal and taz's
design<00:00:09.120> only<00:00:09.540> it's<00:00:09.660> improved<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> no

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
design only it's improved as it no

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.140 
design only it's improved as it no
longer<00:00:10.620> using<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.160> button<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.969> won't

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
longer using the button and it won't

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.560 
longer using the button and it won't
kill<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.509> due<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.110> glitch<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.769> half<00:00:14.160> spot

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
kill you due to a glitch with half spot

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.330 
kill you due to a glitch with half spot
so<00:00:15.570> let<00:00:15.780> me<00:00:15.809> demonstrate<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.440> basically<00:00:17.220> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
so let me demonstrate it basically you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.890 
so let me demonstrate it basically you
get<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> boat<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.359> slide<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
get in the boat and you just slide it to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.420 
get in the boat and you just slide it to
the<00:00:18.930> right<00:00:19.140> until<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.859> set<00:00:20.010> off<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.220> pressure

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
the right until you set off a pressure

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.820 
the right until you set off a pressure
pad<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.779> instantly<00:00:22.080> launches<00:00:22.680> your

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
pad and that instantly launches your

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.730 
pad and that instantly launches your
boat<00:00:23.010> off<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.369> go<00:00:23.490> do<00:00:23.670> everyone<00:00:24.180> and<00:00:24.740> now

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
boat off to go do everyone and now

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.859 
boat off to go do everyone and now
you're<00:00:25.949> ready<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> come<00:00:26.369> back<00:00:26.480> all<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.689> have

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
you're ready to come back all you have

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.890 
you're ready to come back all you have
to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:29.039> slowly<00:00:29.490> write<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.090> up<00:00:30.240> against<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
to do is slowly write it up against the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.139 
to do is slowly write it up against the
right<00:00:31.080> wall<00:00:31.109> just<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.250> being<00:00:32.820> hot<00:00:32.969> bath

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
right wall just like so being hot bath

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.130 
right wall just like so being hot bath
and<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> how<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.399> works<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:36.630> it's

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and go so how it works is down here it's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.690 
and go so how it works is down here it's
a<00:00:37.290> redstone<00:00:37.590> torch<00:00:37.710> right<00:00:38.160> underneath<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
a redstone torch right underneath the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459 
a redstone torch right underneath the
pressure<00:00:38.940> pad<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.870> when<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.230> over<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
pressure pad so when you go over the

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.020 
pressure pad so when you go over the
pressure<00:00:40.649> pad<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.190> doesn't<00:00:41.430> turn<00:00:41.730> off<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
pressure pad all doesn't turn off the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
pressure pad all doesn't turn off the
torch<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.809> releases<00:00:43.050> invested<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
torch and that releases invested so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
torch and that releases invested so
water<00:00:44.789> under<00:00:45.059> needs<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.420> flow<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
water under needs can flow out and

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.920 
water under needs can flow out and
pushed<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> let's<00:00:48.149> go<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.420> build<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> now

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
pushed you so let's go on build it now

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110 
pushed you so let's go on build it now
so<00:00:49.860> over<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.160> you're<00:00:50.730> gonna<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> few

so over here you're gonna need a few

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.060 
so over here you're gonna need a few
things<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.660> asking<00:00:51.780> me<00:00:52.020> some<00:00:52.260> wooden<00:00:52.890> hand

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
things and asking me some wooden hand

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.150 
things and asking me some wooden hand
slaps<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.670> sticky<00:00:54.000> piston<00:00:54.180> few<00:00:54.809> logs<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.440> stone

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
slaps a sticky piston few logs a stone

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.520 
slaps a sticky piston few logs a stone
pressure<00:00:56.489> pad<00:00:56.730> definitely<00:00:57.510> invoke<00:00:57.840> some

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
pressure pad definitely invoke some

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.490 
pressure pad definitely invoke some
water<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.460> signs<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.120> redstone<00:01:00.420> torch<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.170> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
water to signs a redstone torch and for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.759 
water to signs a redstone torch and for
spoon<00:01:02.129> stumped<00:01:02.719> so<00:01:03.719> let's<00:01:03.750> start<00:01:04.350> by<00:01:04.500> placing

put water in this corner and put a slab

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.390 
put water in this corner and put a slab
over<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.840> put<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.560> slug<00:01:34.799> from<00:01:34.950> outside

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
over here and put a slug from outside

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.120 
over here and put a slug from outside
and<00:01:35.640> cover<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> hole<00:01:36.740> now<00:01:37.740> just<00:01:37.920> place

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and cover up that hole now just place

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.840 
and cover up that hole now just place
your<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:39.119> pad<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.689> you're<00:01:40.079> done<00:01:40.369> so<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.430> load

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
your your pad and you're done so to load

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.999 
your your pad and you're done so to load
it<00:01:42.000> all<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> have<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> do<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.840> place<00:01:43.680> the
