00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hi there, I'm going back to artur 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.049
 main cooking topics 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.560
 different food today I want to show you 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.060
 how to do so here is very interesting 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 a sandwich who has no toaster 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.519
 can do as i did take 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.550
 ordinary old cast iron skillet and without 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:35.070
 anything just to warm her piece 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:40.010
 bread to warm up to such a crisp 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.010
 dryness and on the one and the other 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.399
 then to this oldest pan 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.399
 pour some sunflower oil 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:04.590
 and put the remaining components here 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:16.600
 sandwich pieces or ingredients 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:23.130
 if we will have with the egg we break and 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:35.140
 the river here will go here such a piece 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:40.600
 sausages and here's a tomato 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:52.150
 and fry slightly and fry everything with 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:55.330
 two sides of the egg we salted and tomato 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.520
 a bit too under quarrel not sausage 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.520
 will it be so salty 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:14.000
 so when we have one side sausage 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:24.019
 roasted we turn tomato over 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:30.640
 it is also desirable to use it of course 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:34.550
 the pan where the egg won't stick 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:41.690
 surfaces it should be either 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:46.099
 teflon pan but either 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:50.780
 anything else but just so here 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:54.739
 I do not stick egg is still early 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:57.730
 turns over a bit more 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.730
 roast 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:12.680
 a little bit already passed therefore something is necessary 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.340
 what to do she stubbornly doesn't want 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:20.060
 roll over 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.060
 oh there 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.510
 sorry sweet on the other hand 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.670
 sausage is not ready yet good luck 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:52.060
 And here already on my quite 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:54.340
 and we will pass it on in advance 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:59.920
 prepared bread 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.920
 about like this 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.060
 and there is 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.200
 now take the egg oh 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.240
 and sausage 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:55.209
 Generally yes to be honest the sandwich will 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:58.449
 prettier look prettier 

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:58.449
 probably like this 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.750
 vice versa 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:19.520
 Here is such an interesting sandwich 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.729
