is<00:00:00.480> carne<00:00:00.810> so<00:00:01.170> big<00:00:02.149> it's<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.210> good<00:00:03.360> question

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:05.150 
is carne so big it's a good question

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.890 
is carne so big it's a good question
partially<00:00:06.150> genetics<00:00:06.839> I'm<00:00:07.170> sure<00:00:08.660> because<00:00:09.660> not

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
partially genetics I'm sure because not

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.589 
partially genetics I'm sure because not
all<00:00:10.139> corn<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> created<00:00:11.250> equal<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.570> a

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
all corn is created equal and this is a

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.620 
all corn is created equal and this is a
hundred<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.139> five<00:00:13.410> day<00:00:14.360> relative<00:00:15.360> maturity

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
hundred and five day relative maturity

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.279 
hundred and five day relative maturity
corn<00:00:18.170> which<00:00:19.170> means<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.529> longer<00:00:19.830> season

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
corn which means this longer season

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.349 
corn which means this longer season
longer<00:00:22.289> season<00:00:22.560> corn<00:00:22.980> generally<00:00:23.880> tends<00:00:24.150> have

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
longer season corn generally tends have

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.769 
longer season corn generally tends have
bigger<00:00:24.810> ears<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:26.269> sometimes<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.539> will<00:00:27.660> be

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
bigger ears and sometimes it will be

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.279 
bigger ears and sometimes it will be
taller<00:00:28.640> depending<00:00:29.640> on<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.510> growing<00:00:30.900> season

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
taller depending on the growing season

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.190 
taller depending on the growing season
itself<00:00:32.090> but<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.710> particular<00:00:35.100> corn<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.840> much

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
itself but this particular corn is much

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
itself but this particular corn is much
taller<00:00:37.500> than<00:00:37.680> all<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> other<00:00:38.399> hundred<00:00:38.820> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
taller than all the other hundred and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270 
taller than all the other hundred and
five<00:00:39.120> day<00:00:39.420> corn<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.899> we<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.500> top<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:41.070> any

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
five day corn that we have on top of any

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.979 
five day corn that we have on top of any
other<00:00:41.399> corn<00:00:41.879> varieties<00:00:42.300> we've<00:00:42.480> had<00:00:42.690> here

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
other corn varieties we've had here

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.130 
other corn varieties we've had here
before<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.550> imagine<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.570> partially<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
before so I imagine it's partially the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.410 
before so I imagine it's partially the
genetics<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.950> nutrients<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.850> had<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
genetics the nutrients that it had and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.380 
genetics the nutrients that it had and
the<00:00:48.539> water<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.350> amount<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.590> water<00:00:50.180> it<00:00:51.180> had

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the water the amount of water it had

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
the water the amount of water it had
this<00:00:51.570> summer<00:00:51.870> made<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> grow<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:54.360> tall<00:00:54.949> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
this summer made it grow that tall the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920 
this summer made it grow that tall the
interesting<00:00:56.640> thing<00:00:56.850> about<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.300> corn<00:00:57.629> is<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
interesting thing about this corn is the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.130 
interesting thing about this corn is the
fact<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.710> tip<00:00:58.920> isn't<00:00:59.250> full<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.820> top

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
fact that the tip isn't full to the top

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.640 
fact that the tip isn't full to the top
and<00:01:01.670> what<00:01:02.670> happens<00:01:03.059> with<00:01:03.210> corn<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.439> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and what happens with corn is that the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.710 
and what happens with corn is that the
silks<00:01:05.070> there's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> silk<00:01:05.670> for<00:01:05.880> every<00:01:06.060> kernel<00:01:06.330> on

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
silks there's a silk for every kernel on

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.710 
silks there's a silk for every kernel on
the<00:01:06.960> corn<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:08.340> silks<00:01:08.790> will<00:01:09.030> actually

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the corn and the silks will actually

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.940 
the corn and the silks will actually
emerge<00:01:10.680> from<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.790> top<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.500> call<00:01:13.740> sort

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
emerge from the top of what we call sort

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.179 
emerge from the top of what we call sort
of<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.549> guess<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.000> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> baby<00:01:15.630> ear

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
of the I guess it's kind of the baby ear

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.530 
of the I guess it's kind of the baby ear
so<00:01:17.189> when<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.460> wrapped<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> husk<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
so when it's wrapped up in the husk the

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
so when it's wrapped up in the husk the
corns<00:01:18.900> will<00:01:19.200> emerge<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.070> silks<00:01:20.820> from<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
corns will emerge but the silks from the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.649 
corns will emerge but the silks from the
bottom<00:01:21.990> kernels<00:01:22.610> start<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
bottom kernels start to go first and

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.620 
bottom kernels start to go first and
they<00:01:25.650> come<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.790> top<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> husk

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they come out of the top of the husk

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.140 
they come out of the top of the husk
first<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:29.040> ones<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> emerge<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.939> last

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
first and the ones that emerge the last

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.080 
first and the ones that emerge the last
are<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.450> ones<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.810> tip<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.770> ear<00:01:32.090> so

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
are the ones at the tip of the ear so

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.630 
are the ones at the tip of the ear so
sometimes<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.259> happens<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.460> they're

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
sometimes what happens is if they're

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
sometimes what happens is if they're
emerging<00:01:36.150> very<00:01:36.270> slowly<00:01:36.780> maybe<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
emerging very slowly maybe because of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.980 
emerging very slowly maybe because of
the<00:01:37.890> weather<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.430> tip<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> ear<00:01:39.600> won't

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the weather the tip of the ear won't

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
the weather the tip of the ear won't
always<00:01:40.200> get<00:01:40.439> pollinated<00:01:41.060> because<00:01:42.060> those

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
always get pollinated because those

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.560 
always get pollinated because those
silks<00:01:43.020> will<00:01:43.290> actually<00:01:43.890> emerge<00:01:44.220> last<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.360> by

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
silks will actually emerge last and by

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
silks will actually emerge last and by
the<00:01:45.630> time<00:01:45.899> they<00:01:46.049> emerge<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> pollen

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
the time they emerge to the pollen

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.539 
the time they emerge to the pollen
that's<00:01:47.369> shedding<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.350> tassel<00:01:49.920> may

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
that's shedding from the the tassel may

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.999 
that's shedding from the the tassel may
be<00:01:50.610> finished<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.079> they<00:01:52.560> don't<00:01:52.770> actually

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
be finished so that they don't actually

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.649 
be finished so that they don't actually
get<00:01:53.369> pollinated<00:01:56.000> but<00:01:57.000> there's<00:01:57.180> lots<00:01:57.390> of<00:01:57.540> other

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
get pollinated but there's lots of other

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
get pollinated but there's lots of other
reasons<00:01:57.869> for<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.740> poor<00:01:58.950> tip<00:01:59.219> fill<00:01:59.460> as<00:01:59.610> well

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
reasons for for poor tip fill as well

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.130 
reasons for for poor tip fill as well
and<00:02:00.439> those<00:02:01.439> include<00:02:01.950> potassium<00:02:02.719> deficiency

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and those include potassium deficiency

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.500 
and those include potassium deficiency
and<00:02:04.290> nitrogen<00:02:05.130> deficiency<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.300> see

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
and nitrogen deficiency so you can see

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.260 
and nitrogen deficiency so you can see
this<00:02:06.660> horn<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.260> super<00:02:07.770> healthy<00:02:08.190> it's<00:02:08.880> green

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
this horn is super healthy it's green

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.520 
this horn is super healthy it's green
from<00:02:09.540> the<00:02:09.630> bottom<00:02:10.050> up

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
from the bottom up

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:24.760 
from the bottom up
there's<00:02:10.950> absolutely<00:02:11.220> really<00:02:12.060> no<00:02:18.890> color

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.040 

and<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.920> imagine<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> poor<00:02:26.820> tip<00:02:27.120> Phil<00:02:27.480> was<00:02:27.780> due

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
and I imagine the poor tip Phil was due

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.030 
and I imagine the poor tip Phil was due
to<00:02:28.980> more<00:02:29.610> weather-related<00:02:30.480> issues<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.800> less

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to more weather-related issues and less

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.820 
to more weather-related issues and less
with<00:02:32.850> nutrient<00:02:33.420> deficiencies<00:02:35.270> at<00:02:36.270> every

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
with nutrient deficiencies at every

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.320 
with nutrient deficiencies at every
Junction<00:02:37.830> here<00:02:38.070> with<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> leaf<00:02:38.490> joins<00:02:38.910> there's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
Junction here with a leaf joins there's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.090 
Junction here with a leaf joins there's
a<00:02:39.420> potential<00:02:39.840> for<00:02:40.020> an<00:02:40.230> ear<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.680> develop

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
a potential for an ear to develop

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.610 
a potential for an ear to develop
actually<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.660> corn<00:02:43.050> plant<00:02:43.320> couldn't

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually so this corn plant couldn't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.680 
actually so this corn plant couldn't
have<00:02:43.709> several<00:02:44.100> ears<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.150> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.510> this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
have several ears and you can see this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.670 
have several ears and you can see this
plant<00:02:45.930> actually<00:02:46.200> has<00:02:46.709> one<00:02:47.459> two<00:02:48.080> three<00:02:49.110> ears<00:02:49.380> on

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
plant actually has one two three ears on

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.910 
plant actually has one two three ears on
it<00:02:49.830> which<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.209> fairly<00:02:51.209> abnormal<00:02:52.020> and<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
it which is fairly abnormal and the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.940 
it which is fairly abnormal and the
reason<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.400> plant<00:02:53.730> has<00:02:54.050> three<00:02:55.050> years<00:02:55.350> is

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
reason this plant has three years is

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.430 
reason this plant has three years is
primarily<00:02:56.580> because<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> outside<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
primarily because it's on the outside of

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.140 
primarily because it's on the outside of
the<00:02:58.860> row<00:02:59.040> it<00:02:59.340> doesn't<00:02:59.610> have<00:02:59.700> hardly<00:02:59.940> any

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the row it doesn't have hardly any

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.660 
the row it doesn't have hardly any
competitions<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.680> how<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.310> gets<00:03:02.459> more

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
competitions so how it gets more

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.180 
competitions so how it gets more
sunlight<00:03:03.030> more<00:03:03.990> moisture<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.620> more

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
sunlight more moisture and more

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.430 
sunlight more moisture and more
nutrients<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.060> therefore<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.080> has<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
nutrients and therefore it has the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.740 
nutrients and therefore it has the
ability<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:07.920> actually<00:03:08.610> form<00:03:08.910> some<00:03:09.269> additional

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
ability to actually form some additional

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.509 
ability to actually form some additional
ears<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.350> this<00:03:10.500> plant<00:03:10.769> actually<00:03:11.100> has<00:03:11.220> three

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
ears so this plant actually has three

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.560 
ears so this plant actually has three
ears<00:03:11.820> two<00:03:12.209> ears<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:13.500> will<00:03:13.709> amount<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:17.570> grain

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
ears two ears that will amount to grain

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.870 
ears two ears that will amount to grain
and<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.050> this<00:03:19.290> last<00:03:19.590> year<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.670> won't

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and then this last year here that won't

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.870 
and then this last year here that won't
fill<00:03:21.269> out<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.260> see<00:03:22.470> there's<00:03:22.680> not<00:03:22.860> much<00:03:23.100> on<00:03:23.340> it

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.400 

these<00:03:30.880> things<00:03:31.150> down<00:03:31.390> here<00:03:31.720> this<00:03:31.960> is<00:03:32.140> what<00:03:32.320> we

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
these things down here this is what we

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.700 
these things down here this is what we
call<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> tiller<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.430> corn<00:03:34.470> corn<00:03:35.470> doesn't

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
call a tiller and corn corn doesn't

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.880 
call a tiller and corn corn doesn't
usually<00:03:36.220> tiller<00:03:36.820> too<00:03:37.180> often<00:03:37.660> in<00:03:37.930> hybrid

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
usually tiller too often in hybrid

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.670 
usually tiller too often in hybrid
hybrid<00:03:39.310> corn<00:03:39.580> doesn't<00:03:39.910> tell<00:03:40.180> her<00:03:40.300> that<00:03:40.450> often

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
hybrid corn doesn't tell her that often

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.130 
hybrid corn doesn't tell her that often
because<00:03:41.680> while<00:03:42.160> number<00:03:42.520> one<00:03:42.760> it's<00:03:43.600> bred<00:03:43.870> not

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
because while number one it's bred not

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.290 
because while number one it's bred not
to<00:03:44.380> tiller<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:44.920> number<00:03:45.640> two<00:03:45.880> it's<00:03:46.150> usually

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
to tiller and number two it's usually

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.080 
to tiller and number two it's usually
planted<00:03:46.930> so<00:03:47.170> close<00:03:47.500> together<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:48.370> there's<00:03:48.880> so

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
planted so close together and there's so

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.660 
planted so close together and there's so
much<00:03:49.270> competition<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.830> it<00:03:51.040> doesn't<00:03:51.460> have

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
much competition then it doesn't have

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.840 
much competition then it doesn't have
the<00:03:51.910> extra<00:03:53.040> nutrients<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.250> space<00:03:54.520> to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
the extra nutrients and space to

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.900 
the extra nutrients and space to
actually<00:03:55.240> send<00:03:55.510> out<00:03:55.660> this
