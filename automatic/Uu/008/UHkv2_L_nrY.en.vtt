00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
photography for me is like it was in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:47.070 
photography for me is like it was in
fact<00:03:33.180> making<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.660> glue<00:03:33.810> each<00:03:33.959> eye<00:03:34.110> exactly

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.810 

but<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.200> people<00:03:48.500> you<00:03:48.530> talk<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.700> your

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
but the people you talk to your

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.390 
but the people you talk to your
personage<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.810> always<00:03:51.740> from<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:51.980> city<00:03:52.250> itself

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
personage is always from the city itself

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.030 
personage is always from the city itself
so<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.910> people<00:03:53.060> we<00:03:53.270> see<00:03:53.420> in<00:03:53.540> Berlin<00:03:53.930> Berlin<00:03:54.860> it

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
so the people we see in Berlin Berlin it

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.980
