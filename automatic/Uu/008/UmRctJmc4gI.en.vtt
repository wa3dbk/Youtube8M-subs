I'm<00:00:42.820> surfing<00:00:43.090> for<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.480> biggest<00:00:43.780> place<00:00:43.960> I<00:00:44.140> can

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.390 

strike<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:52.530> well<00:00:53.530> this<00:00:53.680> is<00:00:53.710> this<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.190> biggest

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
strike you well this is this the biggest

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.049 
strike you well this is this the biggest
piece<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.220> can't<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.699> tough<00:00:57.879> work<00:00:58.030> putting

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
piece but I can't the tough work putting

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:00.869 
piece but I can't the tough work putting
in<00:00:58.480> three<00:00:59.410> pieces<00:00:59.620> or<00:01:00.010> two<00:01:00.160> pieces<00:01:00.460> really

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
in three pieces or two pieces really

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.759 
in three pieces or two pieces really
like<00:01:01.120> that<00:01:01.239> because<00:01:01.390> Hudson<00:01:01.720> once<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> waters

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
like that because Hudson once the waters

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:04.859 
like that because Hudson once the waters
reacted<00:01:03.339> it's<00:01:03.610> alkaline<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.540> then<00:01:04.660> the

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
reacted it's alkaline and then the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.980 
reacted it's alkaline and then the
alkalinity<00:01:05.259> prevents<00:01:05.890> it<00:01:05.979> from<00:01:06.100> reacting<00:01:06.990> any

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
alkalinity prevents it from reacting any

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.029 
alkalinity prevents it from reacting any
further<00:01:08.259> so<00:01:08.619> it's<00:01:08.800> good<00:01:08.950> for<00:01:09.160> one<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:14.860> keep

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
further so it's good for one just keep

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.540 
further so it's good for one just keep

it's a problem that the cloud of

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.870 
it's a problem that the cloud of
alkaline<00:01:39.550> hydrogen<00:01:40.300> gas<00:01:41.039> good<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:42.700> all

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
alkaline hydrogen gas good it is all

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:52.170 
alkaline hydrogen gas good it is all
this<00:01:43.090> space<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.540> shame<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.850> men<00:01:51.970> walked
