hello everyone now I've got all the e
change<00:00:03.480> mounted<00:00:03.959> everything<00:00:04.380> went<00:00:04.560> pretty

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
change mounted everything went pretty

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.150 
change mounted everything went pretty
smoothly<00:00:05.130> actually<00:00:06.740> again<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.890> flat

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
smoothly actually again this flat

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.640 
smoothly actually again this flat
bracket<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:08.820> use<00:00:09.000> up<00:00:09.240> here<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.380> did<00:00:10.559> is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
bracket that I use up here what I did is

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.230 
bracket that I use up here what I did is
I<00:00:10.710> actually<00:00:10.800> cut<00:00:11.130> two<00:00:11.309> lengths<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.759> same<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
I actually cut two lengths the same so

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.400 
I actually cut two lengths the same so
we<00:00:12.300> double<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.929> give<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.139> little<00:00:13.230> bit

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
we double it up to give it a little bit

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.790 
we double it up to give it a little bit
more<00:00:13.530> rigidity<00:00:14.370> I<00:00:14.960> left<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.590> holes

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
more rigidity I left the some holes

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.230 
more rigidity I left the some holes
sticking<00:00:17.130> out<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.250> side<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.880> ends

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
sticking out the side in the ends

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.750 
sticking out the side in the ends
because<00:00:18.330> i'm<00:00:18.510> going<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.690> use<00:00:18.840> them<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> make

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
because i'm going to use them to make

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.179 
because i'm going to use them to make
attachments<00:00:21.080> to<00:00:22.080> some<00:00:22.260> other<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.680> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
attachments to some other things the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.490 
attachments to some other things the
nice<00:00:23.369> thing<00:00:23.400> about<00:00:23.609> this<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.990> course<00:00:25.050> i<00:00:25.320> can

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
nice thing about this is of course i can

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.529 
nice thing about this is of course i can
just<00:00:25.650> loosen<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.580> i<00:00:26.670> need<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> look<00:00:27.119> raise

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
just loosen this if i need to look raise

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.599 
just loosen this if i need to look raise
it<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.840> lower<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.320> whatever<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.710> at<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.460> high

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
it or lower or whatever it's at the high

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.260 
it or lower or whatever it's at the high
position<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.359> now<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:31.669> then<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
position right now and then the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.680 
position right now and then the
transition<00:00:34.460> like<00:00:35.460> i<00:00:35.610> showed<00:00:35.820> earlier<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.600> used

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
transition like i showed earlier I used

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
transition like i showed earlier I used
a<00:00:37.020> piece<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.320> angle<00:00:37.620> bracket<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:39.300> go<00:00:39.420> back

a piece and angle bracket to go back
lays<00:00:40.260> flat<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.250> took<00:00:42.210> another<00:00:42.390> piece<00:00:42.660> of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
lays flat on here took another piece of

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.940 
lays flat on here took another piece of
angle<00:00:43.379> bracket<00:00:44.149> bolded<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.739> right<00:00:46.739> there

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
angle bracket bolded it on right there

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
angle bracket bolded it on right there
to<00:00:47.219> attach<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.520> bottom<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> echame<00:00:48.600> the

to attach the bottom of the echame the
cables<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.620> going<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:50.160> cycle<00:00:50.760> out<00:00:50.879> i'll<00:00:51.539> have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
cables are going out cycle out i'll have

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.510 
cables are going out cycle out i'll have
all<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.079> area<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.620> i<00:00:52.680> can<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.219> strap

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
all this area that i can use to strap

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.529 
all this area that i can use to strap
things<00:00:53.789> with<00:00:54.350> i<00:00:55.350> used<00:00:55.800> another<00:00:56.039> piece<00:00:56.309> of

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
things with i used another piece of

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.490 
things with i used another piece of
angle<00:00:57.539> iron<00:00:57.780> ear<00:00:58.609> or<00:00:59.609> angle<00:00:59.940> plate<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:01.140> secure

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
angle iron ear or angle plate to secure

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
angle iron ear or angle plate to secure
the<00:01:01.829> each<00:01:02.699> chain<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> position<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:06.470> from

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the each chain in that position and from

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.390 
the each chain in that position and from
here<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.369> I've<00:01:09.090> got<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:10.400> backboard

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
here you can see I've got the backboard

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.330 
here you can see I've got the backboard
I<00:01:11.640> made<00:01:12.150> three<00:01:12.630> little<00:01:12.930> brackets<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:14.310> I

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
I made three little brackets to that I

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.190 
I made three little brackets to that I
screwed<00:01:14.670> onto<00:01:14.909> then<00:01:15.299> bullard<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.930> onto<00:01:16.170> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
screwed onto then bullard it onto the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.100 
screwed onto then bullard it onto the
back<00:01:18.710> so<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.950> lays<00:01:20.610> pretty<00:01:20.939> good<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.390> little<00:01:21.900> bit

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
back so it lays pretty good a little bit

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.510 
back so it lays pretty good a little bit
of<00:01:22.200> an<00:01:22.290> overlap<00:01:22.530> but<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.040> not<00:01:23.130> too<00:01:23.250> worried

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of an overlap but I'm not too worried

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
of an overlap but I'm not too worried
about<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.509> keep<00:01:24.659> something

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
about that it's just to keep something

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.179 
about that it's just to keep something
from<00:01:25.020> flopping<00:01:25.409> around<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.890> take<00:01:26.070> them

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
from flopping around and take them

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.530 
from flopping around and take them
strain<00:01:27.650> over<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.829> for<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> x<00:01:29.909> axis<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
strain over here for the x axis this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.840 
strain over here for the x axis this
worked<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.930> pretty<00:01:31.200> plain<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:32.549> use<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
worked up pretty plain I just use the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.179 
worked up pretty plain I just use the
piece<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.180> angle<00:01:33.329> bracket<00:01:33.960> took<00:01:34.890> these<00:01:35.040> two

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
piece of angle bracket took these two

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.590 
piece of angle bracket took these two
bolts<00:01:35.369> out<00:01:37.070> pull<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.450> then

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
bolts out pull it it down and then

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
bolts out pull it it down and then
attach<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.869> each<00:01:40.140> into<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:41.930> then<00:01:42.930> like

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
attach the each into that and then like

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.730 
attach the each into that and then like
I<00:01:43.979> said<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> secure<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> table

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
I said it's going to secure to the table

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
I said it's going to secure to the table
so<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> checked<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.280> positionings<00:01:48.020> it'll

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
so I checked all my positionings it'll

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
so I checked all my positionings it'll
now<00:01:49.170> retract<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> whole<00:01:50.250> way<00:01:50.630> I'll<00:01:51.630> run<00:01:51.810> my

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
now retract the whole way I'll run my

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.980 
now retract the whole way I'll run my
cables<00:01:52.409> off<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.590> end<00:01:53.570> off<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> side<00:01:54.960> here

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
cables off the end off the side here

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.569 
cables off the end off the side here
down<00:01:55.380> because<00:01:55.619> I'm<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> put<00:01:56.549> my

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
down because I'm going to put my

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
down because I'm going to put my
electronics<00:01:57.329> down<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> side<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
electronics down on this side of the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.700 
electronics down on this side of the
machine<00:01:59.869> so<00:02:00.869> all<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.200> work<00:02:01.439> pretty<00:02:01.619> good

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
machine so all in all work pretty good

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.120 
machine so all in all work pretty good
course<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> all<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:02.939> lot<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.469> guess<00:02:04.469> echame

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130

through this particular one I believe

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.869 
through this particular one I believe
was<00:02:23.739> 40<00:02:24.280> inches<00:02:24.580> long<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:27.640> in<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
was 40 inches long and the one in the

was 40 inches long and the one in the
back<00:02:28.060> up<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:30.459> believe<00:02:30.670> 44<00:02:31.390> inches<00:02:31.720> long

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
back up here is I believe 44 inches long

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.380 
back up here is I believe 44 inches long
one<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.549> other<00:02:33.610> things<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.940> forgot<00:02:34.239> to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
one of the other things I forgot to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.759 
one of the other things I forgot to
mention<00:02:34.420> whenever<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.140> were<00:02:35.260> assembling<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
mention whenever you were assembling the

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.490 
mention whenever you were assembling the
machine<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:38.010> y-axis<00:02:39.930> there's<00:02:40.930> actually<00:02:41.440> a

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
machine the y-axis there's actually a

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.670 
machine the y-axis there's actually a
counter<00:02:41.920> board<00:02:42.160> whole<00:02:42.340> back<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
counter board whole back here and to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.460 
counter board whole back here and to
allow<00:02:44.890> you<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.099> put<00:02:45.280> shoulder<00:02:45.640> bolts<00:02:45.910> in<00:02:46.060> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
allow you to put shoulder bolts in and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.420 
allow you to put shoulder bolts in and
that<00:02:47.470> shoulder<00:02:47.680> bolts<00:02:48.450> carriage<00:02:49.450> bolts<00:02:50.430> I'm

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
that shoulder bolts carriage bolts I'm

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.250 
that shoulder bolts carriage bolts I'm
not<00:02:51.640> add<00:02:51.790> mine<00:02:52.030> down<00:02:52.299> on<00:02:52.569> this<00:02:52.720> side<00:02:52.989> you

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
not add mine down on this side you

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.569 
not add mine down on this side you
probably<00:02:53.680> could<00:02:53.860> have<00:02:53.890> mounted<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.459> the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
probably could have mounted it on the

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.780 
probably could have mounted it on the
other<00:02:54.730> side<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.209> put<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.569> beam<00:02:56.410> over<00:02:56.790> but

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
other side if you put this beam over but

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.039 
other side if you put this beam over but
I<00:02:57.819> figured<00:02:58.180> I'd<00:02:58.299> have<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> little<00:02:58.629> lower

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
I figured I'd have a little lower

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.750 
I figured I'd have a little lower
there's<00:02:59.500> plenty<00:02:59.829> of<00:02:59.950> clearance<00:03:00.340> underneath

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
there's plenty of clearance underneath

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.740 
there's plenty of clearance underneath
the<00:03:01.000> machine<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:02.560> allow<00:03:02.829> you<00:03:03.489> know<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the machine to allow you know that and

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.180 
the machine to allow you know that and
then<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.959> wouldn't<00:03:05.200> be<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:05.530> tight<00:03:05.769> with<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
then it wouldn't be so tight with the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.130 
then it wouldn't be so tight with the
key<00:03:06.549> chain<00:03:07.470> so<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.500> worked<00:03:08.799> out<00:03:08.980> real<00:03:09.220> well

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
key chain so that worked out real well

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.770 
key chain so that worked out real well
everything<00:03:11.140> clears<00:03:11.470> itself<00:03:11.950> through<00:03:12.540> all<00:03:13.540> the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
everything clears itself through all the

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.629 
everything clears itself through all the
axises<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.950> yeah<00:03:18.100> overall<00:03:18.880> very<00:03:19.840> pleased<00:03:20.170> very

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
axises so yeah overall very pleased very

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.420 
axises so yeah overall very pleased very
simple<00:03:21.639> setup<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:23.410> got<00:03:23.590> some<00:03:23.829> flats

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
trapping some angle strapping and cut

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.770 
trapping some angle strapping and cut
some<00:03:27.130> pieces<00:03:27.280> and<00:03:27.790> Boulder<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.510> all<00:03:28.599> together

some pieces and Boulder it all together

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.650 
some pieces and Boulder it all together
I<00:03:29.170> did<00:03:29.829> have<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.010> drill<00:03:30.280> a<00:03:30.310> few<00:03:30.400> holes<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.000> open

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
I did have to drill a few holes and open

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.059 
I did have to drill a few holes and open
up<00:03:31.780> some<00:03:31.930> channels<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.440> little<00:03:32.680> bit<00:03:32.799> on<00:03:32.950> the

up some channels a little bit on the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.750 
up some channels a little bit on the
slots<00:03:33.630> so<00:03:34.630> I<00:03:34.660> can<00:03:34.840> get<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.079> 5<00:03:35.980> 16<00:03:36.370> s<00:03:36.459> bolts

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
slots so I can get the 5 16 s bolts

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.370 
slots so I can get the 5 16 s bolts
through<00:03:37.410> but<00:03:38.410> other<00:03:39.370> than<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:40.319> i'm<00:03:41.319> very
