00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640
 I read the curious troca 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.710
 [Music] 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.950
 Y 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.950
 [Music] 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.350
 where it is read 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.350
 we search 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.130
 I read here you are 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.180
 we find you 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:40.869
 [Music] 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.030
 has brought us parts for a new 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.840
 vehicle 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.949
 As we look, unload your cargo, you go to 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.949
 build a tractor 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:02.940
 well let's start the chassis first 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
 the motor 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.040
 [Music] 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.409
 and we have to put together the seat for the 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.409
 biker 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.480
 well done 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:26.120
 let's assemble the chain 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:29.050
 [Music] 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.050
 the steering wheel 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.059
 the tires 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.059
 [Music] 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.530
 the defenses 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.810
 and the exhaust pipe 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:52.280
 but something missing I read you can guess what 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.130
 is 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.630
 and of course a tire 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.360
 but you can run with three tires not 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:13.679
 search mola 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:13.679
 [Music] 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:34.280
 [Music] 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.620
 do not 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.930
 [Music] 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.910
 leo is a tire 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.990
 [Music] 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.910
 do not 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.470
 It's a front shovel 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.319
 but you can take it 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.390
 [Music] 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:06.180
 Excellent 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:10.430
 [Music] 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.430
 but where is the tire 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:23.409
 [Music] 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.409
 and here it is on the slide 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.090
 [Music] 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.080
 move the leo 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:46.460
 [Music] 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.250
 Let's see how the tractor is under 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.250
 ready 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.080
 I read and the front shovel 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.760
 [Music] 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.950
 good idea 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.530
 [Music] 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.040
 you have built a tractor with a shovel 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.040
 frontal 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.220
 the tractor is ready to work good 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.069
 work leo 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:28.069
 [Applause]
