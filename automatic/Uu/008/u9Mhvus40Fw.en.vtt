we're<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.030> do<00:02:24.270> is<00:02:24.570> make<00:02:25.560> sure<00:02:25.590> our<00:02:26.190> load

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
we're going to do is make sure our load

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.750 
we're going to do is make sure our load
up<00:02:26.820> an<00:02:26.940> image<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.710> then<00:02:28.710> go<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.370> your<00:02:29.490> image

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
up an image and then go to your image

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.360 
up an image and then go to your image
and<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.120> sure<00:02:30.270> it's<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.600> CMYK<00:02:31.170> color<00:02:32.120> hit<00:02:33.120> OK

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
and make sure it's in CMYK color hit OK

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
and make sure it's in CMYK color hit OK
so<00:02:35.370> we've<00:02:35.490> got<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.270> know<00:02:36.840> what<00:02:37.020> CMYK

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
so we've got that and you know what CMYK

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.700 
so we've got that and you know what CMYK
if<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.070> go<00:02:38.940> back<00:02:39.120> into<00:02:39.420> image<00:02:39.840> mode<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.530> it's

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
if you go back into image mode and it's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.310 
if you go back into image mode and it's
checked<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.690> now<00:02:42.690> let's<00:02:42.960> create<00:02:43.140> a

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
checked right there now let's create a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.950 
checked right there now let's create a
new<00:02:43.440> layer<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.820> need<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.210> make<00:02:45.930> a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
new layer and we need to make a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.380 
new layer and we need to make a
selection<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.640> I'm<00:02:47.730> going<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> do<00:02:48.120> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
selection and what I'm going to do is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.250 
selection and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:48.720> going<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.990> make<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.770> this<00:02:50.570> text<00:02:51.570> I'm

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
I'm going to make the this text I'm

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.710 
I'm going to make the this text I'm
going<00:02:52.320> to<00:02:52.770> go<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.980> this<00:02:53.220> text<00:02:53.640> tool<00:02:54.030> here<00:02:54.300> we're

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
going to go to this text tool here we're

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.270 
going to go to this text tool here we're
going<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.320> horizontal<00:02:56.010> horizontal

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
going to go to the horizontal horizontal

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.690 
going to go to the horizontal horizontal
type<00:02:57.030> mask<00:02:57.060> tool<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:58.980> say<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.430> right<00:02:59.550> it's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
type mask tool so I say that right it's

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
type mask tool so I say that right it's
kind<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.850> hard<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.060> say<00:03:00.300> I'm<00:03:01.050> just<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.440> up

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
kind of hard to say I'm just going to up

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
kind of hard to say I'm just going to up
this<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.860> little<00:03:02.250> bit<00:03:02.430> so<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.820> see<00:03:03.030> it<00:03:03.210> and

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
this a little bit so I can see it and

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.420

I'm when I type it's just going to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.090 
I'm when I type it's just going to
create<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> mask<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.330> us<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:07.230> let's<00:03:07.860> go<00:03:08.010> ahead

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
create a mask for us so let's go ahead

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.770

there's so many colors so I'll just pick
this<00:04:02.940> Pantone<00:04:03.440> 295<00:04:04.440> see<00:04:05.070> whatever<00:04:05.990> got<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
this Pantone 295 see whatever got the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.170 
this Pantone 295 see whatever got the
numbers<00:04:07.380> completely<00:04:07.980> wrong<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.490> I<00:04:08.640> hit<00:04:08.790> OK

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
numbers completely wrong but I hit OK

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
numbers completely wrong but I hit OK
it's<00:04:09.900> going<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.140> put<00:04:10.320> the<00:04:10.350> name<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.740> it<00:04:10.860> for<00:04:11.070> me

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
it's going to put the name in it for me

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.740 
it's going to put the name in it for me
solidity<00:04:12.080> here<00:04:14.300> it's<00:04:15.300> pretty<00:04:16.109> much<00:04:16.260> opacity

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
solidity here it's pretty much opacity

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.180 
solidity here it's pretty much opacity
but<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.840> doesn't<00:04:19.200> really<00:04:19.410> affect<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.980> press

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
but it doesn't really affect the press

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.650 
but it doesn't really affect the press
output<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.049> just<00:04:22.049> hit<00:04:22.140> OK<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:23.300> now<00:04:24.300> we<00:04:24.360> had

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
output so just hit OK and now we had

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.330 
output so just hit OK and now we had
this<00:04:24.810> new<00:04:25.020> spot<00:04:25.350> channel<00:04:25.740> here<00:04:25.950> and<00:04:25.980> it's

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
this new spot channel here and it's

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.420 
this new spot channel here and it's
going<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.669> show<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.810> on<00:04:28.080> our<00:04:28.830> layers<00:04:29.070> and

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
going to show up on our layers and

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.840 
going to show up on our layers and
that's<00:04:30.330> how<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.630> create<00:04:30.900> one<00:04:31.550> now<00:04:32.550> let's

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
that's how you create one now let's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.580 
that's how you create one now let's
check<00:04:33.450> it<00:04:33.600> out<00:04:33.720> I<00:04:35.540> start<00:04:36.540> undoing<00:04:37.140> some<00:04:37.440> of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
check it out I start undoing some of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
check it out I start undoing some of
these<00:04:37.710> you<00:04:38.430> can<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.090> it<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.270> up<00:04:39.630> there<00:04:39.900> I

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
these you can see that it is up there I

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.490 
these you can see that it is up there I
see<00:04:42.150> if<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.300> got<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.540> move<00:04:42.690> it<00:04:42.840> up<00:04:42.960> or<00:04:43.110> something

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
see if I got to move it up or something

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.590 
see if I got to move it up or something
oh<00:04:44.210> it'll<00:04:45.210> just<00:04:45.540> be<00:04:45.690> there<00:04:45.900> um<00:04:47.000> it's<00:04:48.000> in<00:04:48.419> the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
oh it'll just be there um it's in the

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.580 
oh it'll just be there um it's in the
it's<00:04:48.870> in<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.260> back<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:51.330> we<00:04:51.990> can't<00:04:52.260> see<00:04:52.560> it

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
it's in the back and we can't see it

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.840 
it's in the back and we can't see it
because<00:04:53.190> the<00:04:53.640> solidity<00:04:54.419> was<00:04:54.960> at<00:04:55.290> zero<00:04:55.850> so

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
because the solidity was at zero so

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.020 
because the solidity was at zero so
let's<00:04:57.440> step<00:04:58.440> back<00:04:58.500> real<00:04:59.010> quick<00:04:59.220> step

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
let's step back real quick step

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.570 
let's step back real quick step
backwards<00:05:00.530> let's<00:05:01.530> create<00:05:01.800> our<00:05:01.919> spot<00:05:02.190> channel

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
backwards let's create our spot channel

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.490 
backwards let's create our spot channel
again<00:05:02.820> and<00:05:03.530> then<00:05:04.530> if<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:04.950> up<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.340> solidity<00:05:05.910> here

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
again and then if I up the solidity here

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.159 
again and then if I up the solidity here
to<00:05:07.500> 100%<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:09.270> we're<00:05:09.390> definitely<00:05:09.630> where<00:05:10.050> it's

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
to 100% and we're definitely where it's

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.070 
to 100% and we're definitely where it's
going<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.380> show<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.370> if<00:05:11.460> we<00:05:11.580> do<00:05:11.729> it<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.970> 50%<00:05:12.390> just

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
going to show so if we do it to 50% just

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.270 
going to show so if we do it to 50% just
like<00:05:13.200> I<00:05:13.320> said<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.590> was<00:05:13.680> kind<00:05:13.890> it's<00:05:14.040> kind<00:05:14.220> of

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
like I said it was kind it's kind of

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.500 
like I said it was kind it's kind of
like<00:05:15.320> opacity<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.100> I<00:05:17.130> put<00:05:17.370> this<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.610> 100%<00:05:17.940> and

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
like opacity so I put this to 100% and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.409 
like opacity so I put this to 100% and
hit<00:05:18.660> OK<00:05:18.990> now<00:05:19.830> it's<00:05:20.040> on<00:05:20.370> top<00:05:20.700> and<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.090> can<00:05:21.210> or

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
hit OK now it's on top and you can or

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.740 
hit OK now it's on top and you can or
you<00:05:21.600> can<00:05:21.750> actually<00:05:21.930> see<00:05:22.320> it<00:05:22.850> so<00:05:23.850> that's<00:05:24.570> all

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
you can actually see it so that's all

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.950 
you can actually see it so that's all
there<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:24.930> to<00:05:25.380> making<00:05:25.770> spot<00:05:26.190> channels<00:05:26.640> and

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
there is to making spot channels and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.890 
there is to making spot channels and
remember<00:05:27.960> this<00:05:28.169> is<00:05:28.380> going<00:05:28.410> for<00:05:29.150> work<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.390> like

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900
