00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but if you do a real slow all the glue

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.060 
but if you do a real slow all the glue
should<00:01:29.009> come<00:01:29.579> off<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.000> paper<00:01:30.920> like<00:01:31.920> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
should come off with the paper like on

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
should come off with the paper like on
this<00:01:32.220> one<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:32.880> window<00:01:33.299> right<00:01:33.329> here<00:01:33.479> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
this one on this window right here I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.740 
this one on this window right here I
didn't<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> can't<00:01:34.860> really<00:01:34.979> see<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.750> there

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
didn't do it can't really see the there

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.710 
didn't do it can't really see the there
glue<00:01:36.960> but<00:01:37.200> maybe<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.560> can<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.509> little<00:01:39.509> bit

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
glue but maybe you can see a little bit

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.749 
glue but maybe you can see a little bit
right<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.009> can't<00:01:41.009> even<00:01:41.100> see<00:01:41.369> through<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
right here can't even see through the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.190 
right here can't even see through the
background<00:01:44.270> but<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.450> pull<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.780> down<00:01:45.960> real

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
background but just pull it down real

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340 
background but just pull it down real
slow<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.799> should<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.009> good<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.310> go

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
slow and you should be good to go

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.960 
slow and you should be good to go
especially<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:50.159> your<00:01:50.369> window<00:01:50.700> done

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
like about a couple months ago it should

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.910 
like about a couple months ago it should
come<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.450> easier<00:01:54.869> I've<00:01:55.079> had<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.560> one<00:01:55.770> on

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920
