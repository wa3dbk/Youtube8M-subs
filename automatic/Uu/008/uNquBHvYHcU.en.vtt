bring<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.090> think<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.110> biggest<00:01:58.259> concern<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.009> will

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
bring I think my biggest concern it will

00:01:59.159 --> 00:01:59.660 
bring I think my biggest concern it will
be<00:01:59.340> when

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
be when

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.240 
be when
do<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> roundabout<00:02:00.630> because<00:02:01.380> it'll<00:02:02.130> be

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
do the roundabout because it'll be

do the roundabout because it'll be
closed<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.060> think<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> little<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.080> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
closed I think a little bit more the

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080
