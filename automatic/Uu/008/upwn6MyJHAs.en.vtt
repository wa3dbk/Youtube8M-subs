00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.350
 I was walking down the street and 

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:10.540
 I suddenly noticed one thing and one time 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.760
 it gives me document in truth 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.410
 two out of every four people that passed 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.500
 at that time down the street they were 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.160
 Cap 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.830
 and not everyone now carries those 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 caps that is a type of soccer ucr and of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 these guys with potholes and coughs and I 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.750
 I wonder why everyone will take 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.150
 this 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.940
 and it's a problem that has given me to think 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.079
 to record this video 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.179
 everything is done in fashion 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.399
 is that every time he gets something fashionable 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:43.320
 everybody takes it and that is 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.320
 doing it to lose its own style 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.220
 or envious people for example your neighbor 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.510
 an awning has been purchased, not for this reason 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.510
 side because out of sheer envy 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.470
 my friend has the iphone service i what 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.400
 supero buying from club fonsi for pure 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.070
 envy 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.870
 I do not see it normal with this of fashions 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.560
 you're losing your own style the 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.560
 personality 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.430
 the society is doing is being 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.770
 owns doing what you wear your 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.329
 put in right now and they're going to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 criticize for wearing other clothes that are not 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:26.520
 I am one of those who wear clothes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.200
 football I would have arranged a lot 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 but when it had been fixed 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.520
 solidarity arranged with clothes I 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.759
 I do not like being forced by the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.590
 less others and most times not not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.079
 it's fashionable to me I do not like that of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.270
 wearing hats like that I do not like 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.819
 hats those current insurance that I do not 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.770
 like but for giving envy or for 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.439
 be able to try to be fashionable 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.840
 They are wearing them and I see 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.600
 people who 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.700
 feel 10 hours with a cap on the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.960
 head that has to be of the hair 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.659
 full of shit 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.969
 I think it says 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.920
 that's why what I'm saying is that you stop 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.259
 follow the fashions or follow your 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.739
 own style if you really like it 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.099
 take the cap and bring it to me gives me 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:16.160
 same but I do not want to see 20,000 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.390
 uncles and 22 days of my mom the same 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.340
 shape 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.620
 a while ago he wore in the tracksuit 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.659
 they are unified and now they do not take 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.239
 There are people that I'm looking at because they have 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.100
 his personality and until the end one of 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.940
 more history 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.870
 now it's the fashion that of the caps in a 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.450
 future may be for example makes 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.580
 a few years there were bell-type trousers 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.540
 or corduroy trousers 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.430
 of t-shirts of these raperas there is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.350
 all kinds of fashions but I say that 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.150
 follow your own style that nobody 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.040
 I change it 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.500
 what he tries to do with me and he has not 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.760
 got 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.760
 if you are this video 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.190
 if it seems to be true is that I do not 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.040
 I like people to lose their grief 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.250
 that neither by anyone nor by society is 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.830
 that society and above the color of 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.650
 new is the consumption that is the society 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.100
 wants us to consume to take the 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:22.140
 exposed the little money 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.140
 for that they also make the sales 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.010
 look, I can think of another video topic what 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.940
 of the sales we will do it in another video 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.030
 offers them 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 Well here I leave this video thank you 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:39.260
 to see me and I'm going to invent a 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.100
 goodbye because this time they do it 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.100

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:01.800
