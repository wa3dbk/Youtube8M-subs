00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
actually it's a little over 12 years um
I<00:00:36.590> first<00:00:37.590> started<00:00:37.980> when<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.250> like

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
I first started when I was like

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.580 
I first started when I was like
somewhere<00:00:39.329> between<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.690> six<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.290> eight<00:00:40.410> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
somewhere between like six and eight I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.290 
somewhere between like six and eight I
got<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:41.070> drumsticks<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:41.940> just<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.270> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
got some drumsticks and was just kind of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.700 
got some drumsticks and was just kind of
messing<00:00:42.570> around<00:00:42.660> with<00:00:42.960> everything<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.590> my

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
messing around with everything so my

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.900 
messing around with everything so my
parents<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:44.160> tell<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> really<00:00:44.730> wanted

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
parents could tell that I really wanted

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.779 
parents could tell that I really wanted
to<00:00:45.000> play<00:00:45.059> drums<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.920> my<00:00:46.920> dad<00:00:47.100> actually<00:00:47.430> like

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
to play drums and my dad actually like

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.130 
to play drums and my dad actually like
really<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> drums<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.629> he<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> kid

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
really like the drums and he was a kid

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.520 
really like the drums and he was a kid
too<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.129> he<00:00:50.850> was<00:00:51.059> inspired<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:52.320> me

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
too and so he was inspired to have me

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.100 
too and so he was inspired to have me
start<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.719> was<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> was

from<00:03:41.400> an<00:03:42.060> ABR<00:03:42.420> cover<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:43.170> eight<00:03:43.440> months<00:03:43.620> ago

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
from an ABR cover like eight months ago

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.590 
from an ABR cover like eight months ago
I<00:03:44.220> mean<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.430> might<00:03:44.910> have<00:03:45.060> been<00:03:45.150> able<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.360> play<00:03:45.540> it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
I mean I might have been able to play it

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.990 
I mean I might have been able to play it
with<00:03:45.780> some<00:03:45.930> practice<00:03:46.079> but<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:46.680> it's<00:03:46.920> like<00:03:47.100> it

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
with some practice but now it's like it

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.819 
with some practice but now it's like it
just<00:03:48.060> comes<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.690> much<00:03:48.870> easier<00:03:49.110> from<00:03:49.530> all<00:03:49.739> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
just comes so much easier from all the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.729 
just comes so much easier from all the
experience<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.370> I've<00:03:50.549> had<00:03:50.579> and<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.320> that<00:03:52.320> and

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
experience that I've had and so that and

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.650 
experience that I've had and so that and
also<00:03:52.890> like<00:03:53.310> if<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.700> play<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.910> lot<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.269> gigs<00:03:54.480> and

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
also like if you play a lot of gigs and

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.370 
also like if you play a lot of gigs and
you<00:03:54.720> play<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.079> lot<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.260> different
