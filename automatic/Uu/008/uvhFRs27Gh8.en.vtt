00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
was moving backwards as zombies in my

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.940 
was moving backwards as zombies in my
face<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> shot<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.180> through<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> car<00:00:45.629> and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
face and I shot up through a car and

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.930 
face and I shot up through a car and
yeah<00:00:46.950> but<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.610> point<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
yeah but that's not the point in this

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
yeah but that's not the point in this
video<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.480> after<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.809> did<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> started<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
video so after I did that I started to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.049 
video so after I did that I started to
think<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.829> played<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.219> subs<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> played<00:00:50.940> this

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
think I played my subs and I played this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.369 
think I played my subs and I played this
one<00:00:51.239> sub<00:00:51.480> that's<00:00:51.690> always<00:00:51.930> talking<00:00:52.230> about

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
one sub that's always talking about

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
one sub that's always talking about
doing<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.680> trick<00:00:52.949> shots<00:00:53.219> like<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
doing like trick shots like on the

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.970 
doing like trick shots like on the
crawlers<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.809> stuff<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.559> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
crawlers and stuff like that and I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.200 
crawlers and stuff like that and I
started<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.309> think<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.149> know

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
started to think about it I don't know

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
started to think about it I don't know
if<00:00:57.300> there's<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> place<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.410> in

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
if there's really a place for that in

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
if there's really a place for that in
the<00:00:58.620> zombie<00:00:59.250> community<00:00:59.670> because<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.239> know

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the zombie community because you know

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
the zombie community because you know
zombies<00:01:00.960> don't<00:01:01.500> move<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.190> different

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
zombies don't move in like different

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.979 
zombies don't move in like different
ways<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> stuff<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.449> like<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> human

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
ways and stuff like that like a human

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.230 
ways and stuff like that like a human
would<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> ray<00:01:05.790> guns<00:01:06.030> one

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240

shot<00:01:06.510> stuff<00:01:06.750> like<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.560> started<00:01:07.890> to

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
shot stuff like that but I started to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.010 
shot stuff like that but I started to
think<00:01:07.979> about<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.460> after<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.090> played<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.810> lot

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
think about it after that I played a lot

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.630 
think about it after that I played a lot
of<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.260> subs<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> lot<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.159> now<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.340> have

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of my subs and a lot of them now I have

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.980 
of my subs and a lot of them now I have
to<00:01:11.790> fight<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.479> ballistic<00:01:12.810> knives

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
to fight for the ballistic knives

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.270 
to fight for the ballistic knives
they're<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.320> yeah<00:01:13.470> ever<00:01:13.710> since<00:01:13.799> watching

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
they're like yeah ever since watching

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.219 
they're like yeah ever since watching

and to try to do revive so I started to

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.410 
and to try to do revive so I started to
think<00:01:20.070> about<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.490> would<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.119> could<00:01:21.150> have

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
think about it would if we could have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.990 
think about it would if we could have
like<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.869> trick<00:01:22.170> revived<00:01:22.590> community<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.729> that's
