00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.080
 the methanisation sector is at its 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.509
 very early in reality it is a sector 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.480
 emerging the first purchase price date 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.310
 from 2006 and the second series tariffs 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.430
 purchase these 2011 as well for the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.560
 cogeneration for injection and we get 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 found today after this short 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.650
 period 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.510
 with 200 agricultural units or 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.099
 territorial territory which represents a 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.200
 doubling in two to three years which 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.880
 have just passed but obviously 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.710
 is not up to the 7000 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.629
 German methanizer the French model 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.010
 in terms of anaerobic digestion is a model 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.920
 ensuring the treatment of effluents 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.110
 by raising them in energy 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.010
 and in amendment and fertilizer for 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.260
 agricultural exploitations 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.690
 this model contributes to autonomy in 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
 nitrogen and the reduction of greenhouse gases 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.059
 Greenhouse as presented in the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.379
 plan and launched me in 2013 the model 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.359
 French is different from the German model 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.309
 whose sole purpose is to 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.270
 produce renewable energy to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.270
 from energy crops 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.840
 at the current rate we may fear that 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.860
 this objective is not achieved from 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 less not in 2020 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.360
 indeed the time of assembly of a project 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.040
 and the time needed to obtain 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.440
 administrative authorizations and very 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.390
 long even though an experiment 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 single authorization currently in 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.470
 course aims to reduce this 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.450
 problem it does not preclude that there are often 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 local residents and that 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.550
 heard this greatly lengthens the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.770
 deadlines on the other hand the sector has alerted 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.660
 actually recently on the units 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.369
 in operation for two to three years 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.009
 and more so those on which we have 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.380
 a real setback she found some 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.820
 additional costs in terms of investment 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.440
 additional costs in terms of operation 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 especially on maintenance on 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.110
 maintenance on breakdowns and then more 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.040
 overall additional costs in terms of 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.650
 cost of labor since 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.870
 the hours devoted to the methanizer 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:09.950
 were probably underestimated at 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:12.710
 departure current purchase rates leaves 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.200
 very little room for maneuver 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.850
 but the hazards can be seen at 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.310
 the experience that there is a lot 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.980
 in the life of an anaerobic digestion project 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.810
 there are mechanical hazards that 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.530
 hold to the functioning of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.600
 Installation 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.880
 there are also uncertainties 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.370
 inputs have indeed been working on 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 in the living and we are dealing with 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.030
 rations modifications to 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.740
 modifications of power 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.959
 methanogenic or even at risk 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.760
 sanitary all kinds of events 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.450
 that can affect the profitability of 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.400
 Installation 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.620
 today several serious studies 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.300
 are underway to assess these hazards and 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.090
 their consequences on profitability 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.830
 units in operation but it does not 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.989
 do not forget that there are units 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.340
 profitable which procured a real 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.340
 improved income for farmers 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.430
 there are key points to secure from the 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 startup startup project 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.510
 the project study the cost of 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.000
 investment securing the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.430
 inputs the choice of equipment and 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.590
 technical stakeholders opportunities 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.709
 heat on being only the generation 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 outlet for the digestate the follow-up 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.510
 administrative permissions that is 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.880
 so a key point also without forgetting 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.440
 strong motivation and good 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.440
 preparation of project leaders
