just on the back of his fins there than
if<00:00:13.740> you<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:13.920> see<00:00:14.160> there's<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.460> little<00:00:14.490> bit<00:00:14.790> of

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
if you can see there's a little bit of

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.140 
if you can see there's a little bit of
ruggedness<00:00:15.480> which<00:00:15.960> has<00:00:16.139> come<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.970> and<00:00:17.970> that's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
ruggedness which has come in and that's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
ruggedness which has come in and that's
just<00:00:18.359> arrived<00:00:18.750> over<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.170> past<00:00:19.380> few<00:00:19.619> days

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.920 

you're<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> traffic<00:00:23.070> going<00:00:23.190> by<00:00:23.280> that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
you're the traffic going by that

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.750 
you're the traffic going by that
basically<00:00:24.930> what<00:00:25.050> I've<00:00:25.140> done<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.500> added<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.640> lot

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
basically what I've done is added a lot

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.210 
basically what I've done is added a lot
of<00:00:26.820> salt<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.420> tank<00:00:27.660> as<00:00:27.840> well<00:00:28.020> so<00:00:28.950> I'm

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
of salt to the tank as well so I'm

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.910 
of salt to the tank as well so I'm
hoping<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> will<00:00:30.930> cut<00:00:31.200> down<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.619> any

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
hoping that that will cut down on any

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
hoping that that will cut down on any
sort<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> bacteriological<00:00:33.180> introduction

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
sort of bacteriological introduction

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
sort of bacteriological introduction
that's<00:00:34.140> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> happen<00:00:34.880> the<00:00:35.880> temperature

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that's going to happen the temperature

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.960 
that's going to happen the temperature
at<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.630> moment<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.260> around<00:00:38.220> about<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.520> 30

cold water fish I know and the only

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.420 
cold water fish I know and the only
reason<00:02:18.810> I've<00:02:19.049> turned<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.470> heat<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.250> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
reason I've turned the heat up on the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.729 
reason I've turned the heat up on the
tank<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.390> combat<00:02:21.750> some<00:02:21.930> disease<00:02:22.260> problems

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
tank is to combat some disease problems

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.030 
tank is to combat some disease problems
that<00:02:22.860> I've<00:02:22.950> been<00:02:23.040> having<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:25.040> introduced

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
that I've been having and introduced

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.569 
that I've been having and introduced
some<00:02:26.220> some<00:02:26.730> Daniel's<00:02:27.510> etc<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.680> they<00:02:28.980> they<00:02:29.549> got

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
some some Daniel's etc and they they got

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.539 
some some Daniel's etc and they they got
a<00:02:29.790> few<00:02:30.030> little<00:02:30.410> bugs<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.680> diseases<00:02:32.040> came<00:02:32.400> in

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
a few little bugs and diseases came in

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.009 
a few little bugs and diseases came in
with<00:02:32.670> them<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:32.880> I<00:02:32.910> lost<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.299> four<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.870> them

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
with them and I lost about four of them

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.910 
with them and I lost about four of them
so<00:02:34.859> I<00:02:35.519> did<00:02:36.000> what<00:02:36.150> any<00:02:36.180> fish<00:02:36.930> people<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.410> let's

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
so I did what any fish people do let's

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.410 
so I did what any fish people do let's
turn<00:02:38.190> up<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.180> temperature<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.810> 30<00:02:41.420> which

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
turn up the the temperature to 30 which

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.160 
turn up the the temperature to 30 which
kills<00:02:42.930> most<00:02:43.230> parasites<00:02:44.030> add<00:02:45.030> salt<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:48.170> remove

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
kills most parasites add salt and remove

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.849 
kills most parasites add salt and remove
and<00:02:49.470> treat<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.760> sick<00:02:51.180> ones<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.989> separate

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
and treat the sick ones in a separate

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.670 
and treat the sick ones in a separate
tank<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.459> I've<00:02:54.180> done<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.049> I've<00:02:55.530> actually

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
tank and I've done and I've actually

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.819 
tank and I've done and I've actually
managed<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.190> save<00:02:56.600> well<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.049> them<00:02:58.230> out<00:02:58.470> of

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
managed to save well one of them out of

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.000 
managed to save well one of them out of
four<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.720> he's<00:03:00.720> back<00:03:00.930> in<00:03:01.079> the<00:03:01.230> tank<00:03:01.410> now<00:03:01.650> back

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
four and he's back in the tank now back

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.860 
four and he's back in the tank now back
in<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.220> main<00:03:02.459> tank<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.030> he's<00:03:03.420> quite<00:03:03.660> healthy

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
in this main tank and he's quite healthy

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.640 
in this main tank and he's quite healthy
looking<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.760> I'm<00:03:06.269> still<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.989> sure<00:03:07.049> what<00:03:07.530> it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
looking so I'm still not sure what it

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.490 
looking so I'm still not sure what it
was<00:03:07.799> but

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.960 

I<00:03:11.800> think<00:03:12.700> it<00:03:12.820> was<00:03:12.850> just<00:03:14.010> just<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.190> bad<00:03:15.610> sort<00:03:15.910> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
I think it was just just a bad sort of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.420 
I think it was just just a bad sort of
bacteriological<00:03:18.970> infection<00:03:20.130> I've<00:03:21.130> yet<00:03:21.400> to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
bacteriological infection I've yet to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.370 
bacteriological infection I've yet to
track<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.880> down<00:03:21.910> find<00:03:22.750> out<00:03:22.840> exactly<00:03:22.930> what<00:03:23.290> it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
track it down find out exactly what it

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.620 
track it down find out exactly what it
was<00:03:23.470> but<00:03:23.710> all<00:03:24.670> in<00:03:24.790> all<00:03:24.880> I'm<00:03:25.060> quite<00:03:25.420> pleased

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
was but all in all I'm quite pleased

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.820 
was but all in all I'm quite pleased
with<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.840> tacit<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.200> tanks<00:03:26.440> doing<00:03:26.680> really

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
with the tacit the tanks doing really

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.140 
with the tacit the tanks doing really
