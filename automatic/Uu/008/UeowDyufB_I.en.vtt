00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
because over time it would still loosen

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.340 
because over time it would still loosen
up<00:01:31.700> especially<00:01:32.240> when<00:01:32.329> you<00:01:32.390> start<00:01:32.570> washing<00:01:32.990> it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
and it starts to grow out a little bit

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.800 
and it starts to grow out a little bit
and<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:34.909> wouldn't<00:01:35.090> have<00:01:35.149> gained<00:01:35.420> anything

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
and you wouldn't have gained anything

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.419 
and you wouldn't have gained anything
other<00:01:36.020> than<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.200> sore<00:01:36.439> scalp<00:01:36.740> hairs<00:01:37.250> that<00:01:37.369> are

together<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.860> root<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.400> you<00:02:34.490> have<00:02:34.580> to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
together the root and so you have to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.280 
together the root and so you have to
pull<00:02:34.880> them<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.150> opposite<00:02:35.420> directions<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:36.020> stop

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
them from knotting together if you

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090 
them from knotting together if you
refrain<00:02:38.480> from<00:02:38.540> doing<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.230> separating<00:02:39.800> those

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
dreads that are slightly out together we

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.360 
dreads that are slightly out together we
get<00:02:42.050> more<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.290> more<00:02:42.470> nuts<00:02:42.770> together<00:02:42.950> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
get more and more nuts together and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.060 
get more and more nuts together and
eventually<00:02:44.150> grow<00:02:44.450> out<00:02:44.630> combine<00:02:45.320> like<00:02:45.890> this

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
eventually grow out combine like this

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.380 
eventually grow out combine like this
one<00:02:46.250> here<00:02:46.459> which<00:02:46.610> was<00:02:46.760> originally<00:02:47.180> for

dreadlocks you could see the original

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.620 
dreadlocks you could see the original
four<00:02:48.920> ends<00:02:49.340> this<00:02:49.730> is<00:02:49.790> where<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.120> root<00:02:50.270> was<00:02:50.480> at

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
four ends this is where the root was at

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.210 
four ends this is where the root was at
one<00:02:50.780> point<00:02:50.810> they<00:02:51.620> knocked<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:51.920> together

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
one point they knocked it together

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.100 
one point they knocked it together
slightly<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.910> didn't<00:02:53.300> separate<00:02:53.630> them<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.020> then

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
slightly I didn't separate them and then

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.199 
slightly I didn't separate them and then
they<00:02:54.320> grew<00:02:54.530> out<00:02:54.680> as<00:02:54.890> one<00:02:55.100> dreadlock<00:02:55.489> from<00:02:55.970> then

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
they grew out as one dreadlock from then

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.680 
they grew out as one dreadlock from then

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.860 
combine and if you want to help them
along<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.790> can<00:03:07.970> do<00:03:08.120> that<00:03:08.300> by<00:03:08.450> getting<00:03:08.510> those

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
along you can do that by getting those

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.229 
along you can do that by getting those
two<00:03:09.080> dead<00:03:09.260> locks<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.590> either<00:03:09.830> share<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.519> bead<00:03:10.910> or

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
two dead locks to either share a bead or

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.210 
two dead locks to either share a bead or
binding<00:03:12.170> them<00:03:12.320> together<00:03:12.410> a<00:03:12.590> bit<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.920> string

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
binding them together a bit of string

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.949 
binding them together a bit of string
what<00:03:13.760> are<00:03:13.820> you<00:03:13.880> doing<00:03:14.150> there<00:03:14.390> is<00:03:14.630> keeping

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
what are you doing there is keeping

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.750 
what are you doing there is keeping
those<00:03:15.170> two<00:03:15.470> locks<00:03:15.709> close<00:03:16.070> to<00:03:16.280> each<00:03:16.370> other<00:03:16.550> and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
those two locks close to each other and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.250 
those two locks close to each other and
therefore<00:03:16.970> increasing<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.720> likelihood<00:03:17.900> that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
therefore increasing the likelihood that

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.870 
therefore increasing the likelihood that
they<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.590> gonna<00:03:18.830> be<00:03:19.010> able<00:03:19.070> to<00:03:19.190> not<00:03:19.550> together

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
they are gonna be able to not together

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.220 
they are gonna be able to not together
