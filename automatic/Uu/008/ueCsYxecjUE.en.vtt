into account for his weather forecasts
you<00:01:05.850> recognize<00:01:06.810> certain<00:01:07.650> weather<00:01:07.890> patterns

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you recognize certain weather patterns

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
you recognize certain weather patterns
on<00:01:09.270> these<00:01:09.450> balloon<00:01:09.810> launches<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> are

favorable or unfavorable for balloon
operations<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> take<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
operations and so you take that

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.490 
operations and so you take that
information<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.810> mix<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.409> the

of the atmosphere to come then we on top
of<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.009> we<00:01:20.220> put<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> man<00:01:20.729> part<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.360> that's
