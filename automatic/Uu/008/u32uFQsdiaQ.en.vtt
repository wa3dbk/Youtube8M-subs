00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 Florentino Perez prepares his candidacy. 

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:06.401
 Florentino: ... and what are you wearing right now? 

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:11.501
 Mmmmm ... Ie you wear that T-shirt that I gave you. 

00:00:11.502 --> 00:00:16.702
 I tell you, white is very much for you, Cristiano. 

00:00:16.703 --> 00:00:23.303
 Mmmm ... Ok, come on, put the phone down ... No, no, no, you put it, you! 

00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:27.004
 No, no, no, no, no, no ... You hang up, please ... 

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.305
 How rude! He hung up! 

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:38.006
 Ok, you need to call another one ... Chess ... Sess ... Numbers .. Behold ... Damn, it doesn't matter ... Kaka. 

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.007
 Handset voice: Your international call limit has been reached. 

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:54.008
 Florentino: It can't be ... Tinaaaaaaaaa! 

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.109
 Tina: Yes, Tino? 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.510
 Florentino: My new technical secretary has already come? 

00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:00.011
 Tina: Yes. 

00:01:00.712 --> 00:01:04.012
 Cruyff: This is outrageous. I'm a barcelona player to the bone! 

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:07.013
 I even lost my voice because of the Barca celebrations. 

00:01:07.014 --> 00:01:11.714
 And I can not work for an opponent. You can offer me nothing that would change my opinion. 

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:15.015
 Florentino: Well, in truth, I can offer you a lot of money. 

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:19.016
 Cruyff: When should I get to work? 

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:21.717
 See, for a start ... 

00:01:21.718 --> 00:01:24.018
 my best advice. 

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.019
 Such as... 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 ... put Alexanco center forward, 

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:34.021
 or play with the cow as a center forward, 

00:01:34.022 --> 00:01:37.022
 or even the most ridiculous: 

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:41.023
 play with my son Jordi as a center forward. 

00:01:42.024 --> 00:01:44.024
 Florentino: In truth, your advice seems so stupid 

00:01:44.025 --> 00:01:47.025
 but if they worked with Leopard. 

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:52.026
 How about discussing new players? Cristiano Ronaldo. 

00:01:52.027 --> 00:01:54.027
 Cruyff: Well ... He's a good goalkeeper. 

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.528
 Florentino: Cheks. 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:04.029
 Cruyff: I certainly like it when I get paid by check, but I don't understand why we speak Catalan. 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 Florentino: Kaka. 

00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:09.031
 Cruyff: Well ... This is obvious, his name speaks for itself: shit. 

00:02:09.032 --> 00:02:11.032
 I would prefer him ... I do not know, son Romerito. 

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.433
 He is still in elementary school, but he will become a great player. 

00:02:13.434 --> 00:02:16.634
 Florentino: Great idea! I'll prepare the contract right away. 

00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:20.035
 Cruyff: Poor ... Poor Florentino ... 

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:26.036
 He does not know that the secret to using me as an adviser is to pay no attention to me. 

00:02:28.037 --> 00:02:29.737
 Florentino: What are you laughing at? 

00:02:29.738 --> 00:02:33.038
 Cruyff: Um ... Uh ... Well ... I just ... Laughed at the game Sergio Ramos in the last match. 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:38.039
 Florentino: Hahaha, yes ... It was very funny. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.040
 Cruyff: Yes, yes, of course.
