00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.969
 I leave you because we are now to talk 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.620
 of the diet protein nothing is a diet 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.840
 anna new or what happens 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.180
 tell me about it is a diet that now 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.889
 It starts to be fashionable because people 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.230
 every time he does it more is a diet that 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.960
 is based on a doctoral thesis 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.179
 year 1971 is a diet that has appeared 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.519
 now let's go in now 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.710
 Now is when it's good 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.210
 seeing how effective it is and then each 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.210
 there are more patients and in Spain ' 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.130
 we call for 150,000 I think it's 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.250
 say that there are days we have to 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.230
 be with medical prescription 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.460
 It is a diet that must be made unique and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.960
 exclusively under medical supervision 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.360
 because you should not consider a 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.940
 diet to use but a medical treatment 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.650
 for overweight and obesity 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.590
 okay then it's a diet 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.210
 unbalanced but because patients 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.800
 who are obese or who are overweight 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.940
 they are unbalanced in themselves 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 then they can not make a diet 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.250
 balanced the diets that you have seen 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.470
 before 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.060
 most are unbalanced from 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.280
 agreement but the balanced diet is the 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.050
 better diet to keep us in weight 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.700
 but when we're about those we have 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.550
 that unbalance the diet 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.620
 I will explain what it consists of with the diet 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.720
 protein we're going to give the whole organism 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.220
 the protein you need but we're going to 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.590
 remove carbohydrates what 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.830
 before the doctor commented Rodriguez 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.180
 so that we force the organism if it 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.950
 we are removing carbohydrates 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.229
 we are forcing you to burn your own 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.180
 fat but preserving muscle mass 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.310
 because we are giving him the protein that 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.780
 you need and because we give you the protein 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.540
 in the form of envelopes and not in the form of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.540
 food because every envelope has 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.900
 15 grams of protein therefore yo yo 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.979
 or the doctors who prescribe 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.960
 quantifying the number of envelopes that 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.150
 take the patient we know what amount 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.160
 exact protein we are giving you for 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.630
 that unlike what I was saying before 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.000
 the doctor of Rodriguez of the diet that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.310
 is that it is hyperproteic this diet is 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.630
 protein standard we do not overload my 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.460
 liver my kidney be that it 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.220
 turn into food this becomes 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.310
 food on what kind of food then look 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:06.610
 let's make it grapefruit grapefruit 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.830
 a fruit of or less is not that way 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.670
 round commented a woman is a drink 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.959
 of terms 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 with my favor against me 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.980
 so 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.460
 when it had iron all a security 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.540
 of 200 milliliters each preparation is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.830
 prepare with a but good that comes in 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.080
 the preparation is a house that baby 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.390
 that is drunk and is giving you the 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.980
 protein that you need to force your 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.720
 organism to lose fat but the mass 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.160
 muscle then what's important about those 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.350
 obese is that they have many pathologies 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.870
 associated and we're not just going to do them 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.880
 lose weight but by decreasing the 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.040
 fat they 're going to improve their diabetes they're going to 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.610
 improve local super tension but you 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.250
 they put calcium 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.710
 salt clear because that can explain 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.290
 Dr. RodrÃ­guez is better 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:17.350
 give them supplementation the diet 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.230
 Protein should always be supplemented 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.210
 with minerals like it is in the salt that 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.940
 every organism should drink tea or take 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.740
 day 6 grams of salt also finish 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.720
 balance the potassium with calcium 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.000
 so there are no problems 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.620
 osteoporosis and with a supplement 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.930
 vitamin so that all talking about what 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.890
 know if you are taking the vitamins 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.950
 exactly vitamins and minerals 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.959
 add-ons like the shake so you do not 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.570
 has any CITES ie 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.489
 body must preserve all the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.950
 how many with this planet animal 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.020
 It depends on the kilos to lose ie 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.450
 more chubby people will have to be 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.610
 more time but both are generally said 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.590
 that you have to lose 80% of the weight that 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.690
 we want to lose in ketosis ie 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.810
 burning your own fat and not eating anything 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.580
 of food at the beginning from the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.020
 principle you take some vegetables 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.480
 allowed vegetables here we have a 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.560
 example and proteins and as 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.660
 we are losing weight 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.310
 we have to rebalance the diet as much as 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.650
 important of a diet 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.359
 that makes us lose weight and improve our 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.459
 health is that you have to teach us 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.230
 eat any diet is a vaccine for 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.060
 obesity if then I do not learn to 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.740
 eat a balance my diet go back to 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.600
 fattening that is the most important thing or 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.330
 be it is recommended and everything 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.620
 you do not recommend the bullet 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.620
 obviously because we started with a 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.290
 concept that is a diet of 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.290
 medical prescription and because also not 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.750
 is limited to diet only 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:43.300
 lose weight but then there is 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.410
 that food reeducation and change in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.669
 the habits that is what we are going to 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:53.979
 need in the course of a 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.570
 very important psychology and we have to 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.820
 of a discipline and habits that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.860
 we have to keep in good order 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.620
 before I promised you that I would give you a 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.080
 great advice to be able to see you well 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.900
 inside and that can be reflected 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.820
 then in the face mirror outside look 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.650
 I have a word here that is 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.150
 great that is order to be able 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.220
 achieve our goals we have to 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.780
 have a certain order in our life in 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.310
 our house and at our table by 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.800
 course but especially in our 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.360
 see why order then side of 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.670
 Organize yourself organize the purchase when 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.070
 go to do it do not improvise the ere 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.900
 remind you permanently every day what 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.400
 is what you want to get hey I want 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.780
 lose weight I want to see myself well I want to 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.620
 look good on the inside and therefore for 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:37.810
 outside the discarding of those foods 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.030
 tempters who are out there was at 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.830
 end then they make me do things that I do not 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.690
 I want to make the effort necessary to 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.650
 force you already know at home we always say 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.650
 that you have to strive to get 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.600
 things and finally the nd neutralize 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.340
 those boycotting thoughts that you 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.650
 lead to achieve goals with such is 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.500
 so pay attention to me if you keep the order 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.620
 in your food in the end you'll look good 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.840
 inside and also as I told you before by 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.160
 outside and above all patience at the time 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.040
 because it's also that when we put on 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.370
 to do diets we have a need to 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.540
 that the 115 days true doctor lori 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:15.680
 we want nothing in two days 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.090
 8 kilos and that can not be logically 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.650
 we have to be prepared also 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.870
 for that is the goal is to start 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.050
 now the diet because we will have lost 4 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.820
 I want on Monday with the diet that's not 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.980
 that is, each person is the loss of 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.920
 you should not lose a weight at speed 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.530
 of lightning if you are under medical supervision in 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.840
 the problem level is important and 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:38.260
 It is also vital to exercise 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.260
 this
