to choose the surface this surface right
here<00:00:49.829> which<00:00:49.980> I've<00:00:50.129> named<00:00:50.399> reflective<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.420> I'm

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
here which I've named reflective and I'm

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
going to open up the node editor i can

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.549 
going to open up the node editor i can
go<00:00:54.480> ahead<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.629> close<00:00:54.839> down<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> surface

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
go ahead and close down the surface

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
go ahead and close down the surface
editor<00:00:55.859> because<00:00:55.979> i<00:00:56.100> won't<00:00:56.249> need<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.199> as

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
editor because i won't need that and as

editor because i won't need that and as
you<00:00:58.409> can<00:00:58.559> see<00:00:58.589> we<00:00:58.800> have<00:00:58.829> our<00:00:58.979> CD<00:00:59.729> shader<00:01:00.089> that's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you can see we have our CD shader that's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.479 
you can see we have our CD shader that's
the<00:01:00.989> basic<00:01:01.469> shader<00:01:01.679> that<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.069> input<00:01:02.249> the

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the basic shader that we can input the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.570 
the basic shader that we can input the
other<00:01:02.760> nodes<00:01:03.030> into<00:01:03.769> i'm<00:01:04.769> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.190> add<00:01:05.339> an

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
other nodes into i'm going to add an

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.270 
other nodes into i'm going to add an
anisotropic<00:01:05.909> shader<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.050> from<00:01:07.290> add<00:01:07.560> node<00:01:07.890> i'm

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280

anisotropic shader so from add node i'm
going<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> come<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> shaders<00:01:09.799> specular

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
going to come down to shaders specular

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
going to come down to shaders specular
and<00:01:11.070> anisotropic<00:01:12.409> okay<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.650> before<00:01:14.190> i

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and anisotropic okay and before i

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.860 
and anisotropic okay and before i
connect<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.090> anything<00:01:15.180> i'm<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.780> go

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
connect it to anything i'm going to go

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.060 
connect it to anything i'm going to go

percent i'm going to change it to
seventy-five<00:01:22.260> percent<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:22.740> just<00:01:22.920> lower<00:01:23.130> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
seventy-five percent so just lower the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
seventy-five percent so just lower the
specularity<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.390> i'm<00:01:24.690> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> change<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.200> U

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
specularity and i'm going to change my U
and<00:01:25.710> V<00:01:25.890> value<00:01:26.310> so<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.760> skew<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> I'm

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
and V value so that I can skew it I'm

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.940 
and V value so that I can skew it I'm
going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:27.690> a<00:01:27.720> hundred<00:01:27.960> percent<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> you

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
going to go a hundred percent on the you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.870 
going to go a hundred percent on the you
and<00:01:29.280> two<00:01:30.030> percent<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.800> V<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.730> I<00:01:32.760> get

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and two percent on the V so that I get

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.120 
and two percent on the V so that I get
this<00:01:33.060> nice<00:01:33.300> little<00:01:33.600> sliver<00:01:34.080> right<00:01:34.410> here<00:01:34.770> I'm

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
this nice little sliver right here I'm

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.560 
this nice little sliver right here I'm
going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.310> go<00:01:35.370> ahead<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.520> leave<00:01:35.730> the<00:01:36.030> rest<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
going to go ahead and leave the rest of

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.970 
going to go ahead and leave the rest of
the<00:01:36.690> settings<00:01:36.900> default<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.710> I'm<00:01:37.770> going<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
the settings default so I'm going to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.630 
the settings default so I'm going to
close<00:01:38.370> that<00:01:39.860> let's<00:01:40.860> go<00:01:40.980> ahead<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.160> connect

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
close that let's go ahead and connect

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.570 
close that let's go ahead and connect
the<00:01:41.850> anisotropic<00:01:42.390> shader<00:01:43.260> to<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.890> specular

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
the anisotropic shader to the specular

the anisotropic shader to the specular
shading<00:01:45.120> on<00:01:45.440> our<00:01:46.440> surface<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.190> do<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.120> test

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
shading on our surface and do a test

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.600 
shading on our surface and do a test
render<00:01:49.880> okay<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:52.200> get<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.680> specular

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
render okay so we get the specular

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.440 
render okay so we get the specular
highlights<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:54.240> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.480> CD<00:01:56.120> now<00:01:57.120> we<00:01:57.180> could

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
highlights here on the CD now we could

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240 
highlights here on the CD now we could
call<00:01:57.660> this<00:01:57.780> finished<00:01:58.230> if<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.620> was<00:01:58.830> just<00:01:59.070> going

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
call this finished if I was just going

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.550 
call this finished if I was just going
for<00:01:59.550> a<00:01:59.610> metal<00:01:59.970> surface<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:01.110> what<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.230> really

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
for a metal surface but what I really

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.950 
for a metal surface but what I really
want<00:02:01.800> is<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.160> colors<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:03.300> show<00:02:03.600> up<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.870> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
want is the colors that show up in the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.050 
want is the colors that show up in the
specular<00:02:04.380> highlights<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> CD<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:05.850> what<00:02:05.970> I'm

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
specular highlights on a CD so what I'm

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
specular highlights on a CD so what I'm
going<00:02:06.150> to<00:02:06.210> do<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:07.350> back<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> node

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
going to do is go back to the node

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to do is go back to the node
editor<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.610> I've<00:02:09.239> already<00:02:09.450> created<00:02:09.720> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
editor and I've already created a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.990 
editor and I've already created a
gradient<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> i<00:02:10.890> can<00:02:11.069> use<00:02:11.370> and<00:02:11.640> i've<00:02:11.730> saved

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
gradient that i can use and i've saved

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.160 
gradient that i can use and i've saved
it<00:02:12.209> off<00:02:12.330> which<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.599> one<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.019> nice<00:02:13.140> features

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it off which is one of the nice features

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.020 
it off which is one of the nice features
of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> node<00:02:13.860> editor<00:02:13.890> i'm<00:02:14.610> going<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.819> right

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
of the node editor i'm going to right

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.149 
of the node editor i'm going to right
click<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.599> import<00:02:16.290> one<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.650> nodes<00:02:16.830> I've

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
click and import one of the nodes I've

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.890 
click and import one of the nodes I've
got<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.310> gradient<00:02:17.790> folder<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> I've<00:02:18.480> created<00:02:18.659> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
got a gradient folder and I've created a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.010 
got a gradient folder and I've created a
CD<00:02:19.230> gradient<00:02:19.710> so<00:02:20.340> I<00:02:20.400> open<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.060> move

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
CD gradient so I open that up and move

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.180 
CD gradient so I open that up and move
it<00:02:22.050> right<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:22.380> let's<00:02:22.410> take<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> look<00:02:22.980> at<00:02:23.069> what

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it right here let's take a look at what

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.170 
it right here let's take a look at what
it<00:02:23.280> is

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
it is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.000 
it is
basically<00:02:25.180> I've<00:02:25.720> got<00:02:26.020> a<00:02:26.050> gradient<00:02:26.560> that<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
basically I've got a gradient that is

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.640 
basically I've got a gradient that is
like<00:02:27.490> a<00:02:27.520> rate<00:02:27.820> of<00:02:27.850> rainbow<00:02:28.480> pattern<00:02:28.750> I<00:02:29.170> just

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
like a rate of rainbow pattern I just

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.010 
like a rate of rainbow pattern I just
wanted<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.890> go<00:02:30.100> from<00:02:30.370> various<00:02:31.120> colors<00:02:31.510> over

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
wanted to go from various colors over

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.090 
wanted to go from various colors over
and<00:02:32.140> over<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.350> over<00:02:32.410> again<00:02:32.530> instead<00:02:32.950> of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and over and over again instead of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.280 
and over and over again instead of
recreating<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.730> here<00:02:34.210> right<00:02:34.780> now<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:34.990> went

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
recreating that here right now I went

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.720 
recreating that here right now I went
ahead<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.470> saved<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.950> off<00:02:36.100> because<00:02:36.430> I<00:02:36.610> can

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
ahead and saved it off because I can

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.440 
ahead and saved it off because I can
simply<00:02:37.180> load<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.230> use<00:02:38.350> it<00:02:38.380> again<00:02:39.450> so

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
simply load it up and use it again so

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:41.820 
simply load it up and use it again so
let's<00:02:40.600> go<00:02:40.690> ahead<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.840> close<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.110> down<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
let's go ahead and close that down and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.480 
let's go ahead and close that down and
I'm<00:02:42.580> going<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:42.990> feed<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.320> color<00:02:45.130> information

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
I'm going to feed the color information

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.240 
I'm going to feed the color information
from<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.060> gradient<00:02:46.530> into<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> may<00:02:47.860> use<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.100> as

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
from the gradient into I may use that as

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.580 
from the gradient into I may use that as
my<00:02:48.370> input<00:02:48.550> for<00:02:49.150> my<00:02:49.360> aunt<00:02:49.630> isotropic<00:02:50.110> shader

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
my input for my aunt isotropic shader

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.290 
my input for my aunt isotropic shader
you<00:02:51.070> can<00:02:51.160> already<00:02:51.280> see<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.700> show<00:02:51.940> up<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.180> this

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
you can already see it show up in this

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.090 
you can already see it show up in this
little<00:02:52.480> preview<00:02:52.810> let's<00:02:53.620> go<00:02:53.710> ahead<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:53.890> take<00:02:54.040> a

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
little preview let's go ahead and take a

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.140 
little preview let's go ahead and take a
look<00:02:54.190> at<00:02:54.370> what<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:54.700> going<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:54.940> look<00:02:55.030> like

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
look at what that's going to look like

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.470 
look at what that's going to look like
in<00:02:55.450> our<00:02:55.570> test<00:02:55.810> render<00:02:56.670> when<00:02:57.670> it<00:02:57.760> test<00:02:58.030> nine<00:02:58.210> for

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
in our test render when it test nine for

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.350 
in our test render when it test nine for
a<00:02:58.540> test<00:02:58.750> render<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.340> you<00:03:00.340> can<00:03:00.490> see<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.000> colors

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
a test render and you can see the colors

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.690 
a test render and you can see the colors
start<00:03:01.390> showing<00:03:02.080> up<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.380> here<00:03:02.650> now<00:03:03.190> i'm<00:03:03.610> going

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
start showing up in here now i'm going

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.910 
start showing up in here now i'm going
to<00:03:03.790> go<00:03:03.850> ahead<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.210> just<00:03:04.930> minimize<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.770> node

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
to go ahead and just minimize the node

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.680 
to go ahead and just minimize the node
editor<00:03:05.950> real<00:03:06.400> fast<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.970> i'm<00:03:07.150> going<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.300> change

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
editor real fast and i'm going to change

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.360 
editor real fast and i'm going to change
the<00:03:08.470> angle<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.850> CD<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.900> do<00:03:11.890> another<00:03:11.980> test

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
the angle of the CD and do another test

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.970 
the angle of the CD and do another test
render<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.420> can<00:03:13.600> see<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.560> colors<00:03:14.950> change

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
render so you can see the colors change

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.540 
render so you can see the colors change
and<00:03:15.640> also<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.210> specular<00:03:17.110> hit<00:03:17.350> changes<00:03:17.890> as<00:03:18.040> the

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
and also the specular hit changes as the

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.480 
and also the specular hit changes as the
CD<00:03:19.200> moves<00:03:20.200> around<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.710> the<00:03:20.770> light<00:03:20.950> hits<00:03:21.340> it

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.490 
CD moves around and the light hits it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.940 
CD moves around and the light hits it
different<00:03:21.910> i'm<00:03:22.180> going<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.360> put<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> back<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:23.080> 10

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
different i'm going to put it back to 10

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.140 
different i'm going to put it back to 10
and<00:03:24.690> there<00:03:25.690> we<00:03:25.810> go<00:03:25.930> now<00:03:26.470> this<00:03:27.250> gives<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.940> pretty

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
and there we go now this gives a pretty

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.610 
and there we go now this gives a pretty
neat<00:03:28.330> effect<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.960> could<00:03:29.110> use<00:03:29.350> it<00:03:29.380> on

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
neat effect and you could use it on

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.430 
neat effect and you could use it on
sunglasses<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.850> fish<00:03:31.660> scales<00:03:32.020> and<00:03:32.290> things

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
sunglasses and fish scales and things

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.660 
sunglasses and fish scales and things
like<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:32.650> but<00:03:33.130> on<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> CD<00:03:34.210> you<00:03:34.870> would<00:03:35.020> have

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
like that but on a CD you would have

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.270 
like that but on a CD you would have
these<00:03:36.670> lines<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> gradient<00:03:38.170> going<00:03:39.040> in

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
these lines of the gradient going in

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.850 
these lines of the gradient going in
this<00:03:39.610> direction<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:41.170> want<00:03:41.380> to<00:03:41.440> recreate

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
this direction and I want to recreate

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.030 
this direction and I want to recreate
that<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:43.600> looks<00:03:43.720> more<00:03:44.050> like<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.290> CD

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
that so that it looks more like a CD

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.420 
that so that it looks more like a CD
surface<00:03:46.410> let's<00:03:47.410> bring<00:03:47.620> our<00:03:47.770> node<00:03:47.950> editor<00:03:48.070> back

up<00:03:48.640> and<00:03:48.940> what<00:03:49.780> I'm<00:03:49.870> going<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.020> do<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.230> I'm<00:03:50.320> going

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
up and what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.770 
up and what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:03:50.500> define<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.250> shape<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.330> gradient

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
to define the shape of this gradient

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.200 
to define the shape of this gradient
before<00:03:53.410> it<00:03:53.530> gets<00:03:53.680> fed<00:03:53.950> into<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.340> anisotropic

before it gets fed into the anisotropic

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.330 
before it gets fed into the anisotropic

and<00:03:57.490> use<00:03:57.670> another<00:03:58.030> anisotropic<00:03:58.960> shader

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
and use another anisotropic shader

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.620 
and use another anisotropic shader
instead<00:04:00.070> of<00:04:00.190> grabbing<00:04:00.910> another<00:04:01.210> one<00:04:01.390> from<00:04:01.510> the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
shape here in the preview so let's do a

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.230 
shape here in the preview so let's do a
test<00:04:20.470> render<00:04:20.890> so<00:04:21.400> i'm<00:04:21.489> going<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:22.030> come<00:04:22.210> over

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
test render so i'm going to come over

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.300 
test render so i'm going to come over
here<00:04:22.420> hit<00:04:22.930> f9<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:25.890> now<00:04:26.890> we<00:04:26.950> have<00:04:27.040> something

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
here hit f9 and now we have something

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.370 
here hit f9 and now we have something
that<00:04:27.610> looks<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:27.850> lot<00:04:28.120> more<00:04:28.180> like<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.960> surface

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
that looks a lot more like the surface

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.410 
that looks a lot more like the surface
of<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.770> CD<00:04:30.070> I'm<00:04:30.610> go<00:04:30.760> ahead<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.030> minimize

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.090 
of a CD I'm go ahead and minimize
actually<00:04:32.169> I<00:04:32.229> can<00:04:32.350> go<00:04:32.410> ahead<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.560> close<00:04:32.830> the

actually I can go ahead and close the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.580 
actually I can go ahead and close the
node<00:04:33.280> editor<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.169> let's<00:04:35.169> go<00:04:35.290> ahead<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:35.440> look

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
node editor and let's go ahead and look

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.050 
node editor and let's go ahead and look
at<00:04:35.710> it<00:04:35.770> from<00:04:36.070> different<00:04:36.160> angles<00:04:36.550> I'm<00:04:36.880> going<00:04:37.000> to

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
at it from different angles I'm going to

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.340 
at it from different angles I'm going to
come

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
come

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.450 
come
to<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:37.680> keyframe<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> test<00:04:39.300> render<00:04:39.690> and

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
to this keyframe to a test render and

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.240 
to this keyframe to a test render and
again<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:42.000> spec<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.570> changes<00:04:43.110> and<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.770> colors

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
again the spec it changes and the colors

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.340 
again the spec it changes and the colors
from<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.850> gradient<00:04:45.270> are<00:04:45.360> changing<00:04:45.810> based<00:04:46.020> off

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
from the gradient are changing based off

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.420 
from the gradient are changing based off
the<00:04:46.620> angle<00:04:46.920> and<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> light<00:04:47.580> hitting<00:04:47.850> it<00:04:48.120> and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
the angle and the light hitting it and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.780 
the angle and the light hitting it and
there's<00:04:50.430> another<00:04:50.700> one<00:04:50.910> so<00:04:51.710> depending<00:04:52.710> on<00:04:52.790> what

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
there's another one so depending on what

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.510 
there's another one so depending on what
angle<00:04:54.030> that<00:04:54.390> we<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.780> it's<00:04:55.620> going<00:04:56.070> to<00:04:56.220> read
