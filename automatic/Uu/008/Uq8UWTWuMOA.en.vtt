00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
impressive since they say the part took

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
impressive since they say the part took
just<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:35.040> hour<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.610> 41<00:00:36.000> minutes<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.600> build

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
just one hour and 41 minutes to build

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.940 
just one hour and 41 minutes to build
and<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.829> resin<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.219> supposedly<00:00:38.610> an<00:00:38.910> ABS<00:00:39.510> like

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
and the resin is supposedly an ABS like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
and the resin is supposedly an ABS like
polymer<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.190> we're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> drive<00:00:42.450> that

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
polymer and we're going to drive that

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.470 
polymer and we're going to drive that
out<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:42.930> second<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> quite<00:00:44.789> honestly<00:00:44.820> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
like structure in the very center of the
part<00:01:25.350> now<00:01:26.220> when<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.580> look<00:01:26.700> closely<00:01:27.060> you'll

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
part now when you look closely you'll

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.330 
part now when you look closely you'll
see<00:01:27.600> some<00:01:27.750> black<00:01:28.020> hairs<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.650> specks<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
see some black hairs or specks on the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.649 
see some black hairs or specks on the
part<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.729> those<00:01:29.909> are<00:01:30.090> actually<00:01:30.270> embedded

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
part and those are actually embedded

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.380 
part and those are actually embedded
into<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> resin<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.430> guess<00:01:32.880> somebody<00:01:33.270> with

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
into the resin so I guess somebody with

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.030 
into the resin so I guess somebody with
a<00:01:33.420> black<00:01:33.659> t-shirt<00:01:33.960> handled<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.650> part<00:01:34.860> when<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
a black t-shirt handled the part when it

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.910 
a black t-shirt handled the part when it
came<00:01:35.250> fresh<00:01:35.579> off<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> print<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:37.500> plastic

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
came fresh off the print the plastic

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.679 
came fresh off the print the plastic
itself<00:01:38.070> is<00:01:38.430> actually<00:01:38.729> somewhat<00:01:39.240> translucent

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
itself is actually somewhat translucent

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.100 
itself is actually somewhat translucent
it's<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> whitish<00:01:40.950> creamy<00:01:41.520> color<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.990> also

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
it's a whitish creamy color but it also

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.770 
it's a whitish creamy color but it also
lets<00:01:43.380> light<00:01:43.649> shine<00:01:44.009> through<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.750> along<00:01:45.750> with

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
lets light shine through and along with

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.230 
lets light shine through and along with
the<00:01:46.140> semi<00:01:46.500> glossy<00:01:47.130> finish<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.700> it

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the semi glossy finish I think it

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.149 
the semi glossy finish I think it
actually<00:01:48.750> makes<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.079> really<00:01:49.380> decent<00:01:49.619> looking

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
actually makes a really decent looking

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550 
actually makes a really decent looking
part<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:51.360> does<00:01:51.600> have<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:52.049> minor

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
part it does have some minor

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.859 
part it does have some minor
imperfections<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:54.180> where<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.570> light

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
imperfections like your where the light

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.370 
imperfections like your where the light
bounces<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.740> just<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.250> bit<00:01:56.479> irregularly<00:01:57.479> but

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
bounces off just a bit irregularly but

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.679 
bounces off just a bit irregularly but
honestly<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.549> totally<00:02:00.030> different<00:02:00.060> level

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
honestly it's a totally different level

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.990 
honestly it's a totally different level
than<00:02:01.259> what<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.280> film<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.759> based

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
than what you get from a film and based

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.260 
than what you get from a film and based
printer<00:02:03.680> especially<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.799> way<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.460> formlabs

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
printer especially the way the formlabs

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.900 
printer especially the way the formlabs
handles<00:02:06.930> sharp<00:02:07.530> corners<00:02:08.069> on<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.340> outside<00:02:08.759> is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
handles sharp corners on the outside is

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:09.859 
handles sharp corners on the outside is
pretty<00:02:09.209> impressive

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
pretty impressive

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
pretty impressive
now<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.830> see<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> DNA<00:02:11.640> structure

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
now you can see that DNA structure

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.080 
now you can see that DNA structure
embedded<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.599> very

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
embedded and very

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.900 
embedded and very
Center<00:02:13.300> of<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.569> rook<00:02:13.769> now<00:02:14.769> this<00:02:15.250> last<00:02:15.519> part

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
Center of the rook now this last part

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.089 
Center of the rook now this last part
pained<00:02:16.420> me<00:02:16.690> quite<00:02:16.989> a<00:02:17.019> bit<00:02:17.140> but<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.890> the

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
pained me quite a bit but you know the

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.610 
pained me quite a bit but you know the
things<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.489> do<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:18.640> signs<00:02:19.090> I<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:20.110> tried

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
things you do for signs I actually tried

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.280 
things you do for signs I actually tried
to<00:02:20.650> break<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.129> part<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.879> I<00:02:22.510> tried<00:02:22.690> twisting

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
to break the part and I tried twisting

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.229 
to break the part and I tried twisting
it<00:02:23.410> bending<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:24.489> my<00:02:24.610> bare<00:02:24.640> hands

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
it bending it just with my bare hands

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.780 
it bending it just with my bare hands
but<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:26.170> couldn't<00:02:26.709> get<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:26.980> split<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.550> hurry

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
but I couldn't get it to split the hurry

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.059 
but I couldn't get it to split the hurry
crack<00:02:28.239> once<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.690> think<00:02:28.750> but<00:02:29.260> you<00:02:29.560> know<00:02:29.680> it's<00:02:29.860> not

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
crack once I think but you know it's not

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.580 
crack once I think but you know it's not
giving<00:02:30.430> up<00:02:30.549> I'm<00:02:31.239> sure<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> could<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:32.230> just

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
giving up I'm sure I could have just

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.350 
giving up I'm sure I could have just
crushed<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.099> the<00:02:33.220> vise<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:34.030> know<00:02:34.150> that's

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
crushed in the vise but you know that's

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.080 
crushed in the vise but you know that's
not<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:34.599> point<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.489> honestly<00:02:36.489> I<00:02:36.640> think<00:02:36.670> is

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
not the point and honestly I think is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.759 
not the point and honestly I think is
actually<00:02:37.269> holding<00:02:37.629> up<00:02:37.780> better<00:02:37.959> than<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.349> part

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
actually holding up better than the part

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.350 
actually holding up better than the part
from<00:02:38.920> a<00:02:38.980> repair<00:02:39.340> printer<00:02:39.670> since<00:02:39.910> I<00:02:40.030> would<00:02:40.209> have

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
from a repair printer since I would have

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.800 
from a repair printer since I would have
just<00:02:40.690> split<00:02:41.080> along<00:02:41.349> with<00:02:41.739> layers<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:43.269> yeah<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
just split along with layers so yeah I

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.630 
just split along with layers so yeah I
really<00:02:44.319> like<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.830> way<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.160> form<00:02:45.430> 1<00:02:45.610> plus

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
really like the way the form 1 plus

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.520 
really like the way the form 1 plus
prints<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.959> you're<00:02:47.110> looking<00:02:47.380> for

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
prints and if you're looking for

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.900 
prints and if you're looking for
something<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.860> prints<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.220> bit<00:02:48.370> nicer<00:02:48.610> than

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
something that prints a bit nicer than

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.940 
something that prints a bit nicer than
the<00:02:49.030> typical<00:02:49.269> filament<00:02:49.840> based<00:02:50.019> printers<00:02:50.410> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
the typical filament based printers the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.440 
the typical filament based printers the
former<00:02:51.280> Plus<00:02:51.579> might<00:02:51.880> be<00:02:52.000> something<00:02:52.329> you'd

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
former Plus might be something you'd

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.140 
former Plus might be something you'd
want<00:02:52.690> to<00:02:52.750> look<00:02:52.959> into
