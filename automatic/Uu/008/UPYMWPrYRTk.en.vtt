00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
through 800 times that so but then you

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.050 
through 800 times that so but then you
get<00:04:16.620> into<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.769> game<00:04:16.919> where<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.220> dude<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.850> like

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
laggy and he's not even connected so you

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.440 
laggy and he's not even connected so you
just<00:04:20.880> keep<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.269> just<00:04:21.510> run<00:04:21.660> up<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:21.930> smash<00:04:23.450> it's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
just keep on just run up and smash it's

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.510 
just keep on just run up and smash it's
I<00:04:24.900> don't<00:04:25.200> know<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.410> game's<00:04:25.620> fine<00:04:25.980> I<00:04:26.010> think

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
I don't know the game's fine I think

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.130 
I don't know the game's fine I think
that<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:27.240> definitely<00:04:27.570> should<00:04:27.660> check<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.990> out

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140
