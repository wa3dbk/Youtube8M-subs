certain<00:04:59.720> areas<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.320> I<00:05:00.560> don't<00:05:01.010> have<00:05:01.160> all<00:05:01.310> those

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
certain areas so I don't have all those

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.120 
certain areas so I don't have all those
weird<00:05:01.730> I<00:05:01.880> just<00:05:01.910> sticking<00:05:02.450> out<00:05:02.630> and<00:05:02.960> just<00:05:03.830> maybe

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
weird I just sticking out and just maybe

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.090 
weird I just sticking out and just maybe
add<00:05:04.310> some<00:05:04.520> hairspray<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:06.169> know<00:05:06.320> that's

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
add some hairspray and you know that's

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.180 
add some hairspray and you know that's
about<00:05:07.250> it<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:08.090> I<00:05:08.350> hope<00:05:09.350> this<00:05:09.560> works<00:05:09.770> out<00:05:10.040> for

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190
