00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.600
 levin that it comes I put 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.290
 you explain I asked the moon to 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.150
 indochine 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 so since I explained you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.230
 today it is a passage that is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.450
 struck throughout the piece so with 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.250
 the same of an agreement and all that first 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.450
 I play you a banker then after I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.700
 will explain each part so 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.110
 it will divide people two parts one 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.110
 part launches martine faster 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.310
 my fact 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.310
 but 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.640
 but 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 Yes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.079
 Yes 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.170
 and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.170
 Yes 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.809
 that's when we start with the 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:00.780
 first part in here longer 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.610
 you put your index in seventh box 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.530
 I do not have any nonsense that goes 7th box and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.130
 with your right hand 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.659
 you play with your index finger your thumb 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.659
 4th and 5th rope from the bottom 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:24.020
 then you put your ring finger in 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.020
 seventh case 89th case by fourth string 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.179
 smooth and your index finger in 4th box and you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.200
 always play the same strings etc the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.200
 same fingering and 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.829
 but that's already the most 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.520
 slow that you play twice 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.520
 so here we go 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.350
 but 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 Oh 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.500
 then gone faster you put 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.970
 so your index same thing that at the beginning 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.040
 so in 16th 4 even you are same body 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.369
 and you will play same thing but two 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.369
 times faster 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.500
 huchon 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.500
 and 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.069
 after that it changes slide your index 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:19.519
 smi in 7 8 9th box same fingering same 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.519
 rope etc 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:33.030
 2 in 8th 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:35.230
 born partly 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.430
 If it is possible but not 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.880
 far right payment and like 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.130
 usually the end index in the seventh box 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.770
 so the break he has the name the position of 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.390
 departure with your canceled in the ninth 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.390
 fourth body box 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.300
 this is then explain us all dead 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.590
 according to georges will see the first part 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.590
 and then after the second 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 basically 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.250
 but 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.620
 m 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.459
 and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.459
 m 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.580
 and 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.010
 m 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.010
 m 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.920
 this is my foot for example you have 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.350
 want to waves and there is frankly 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.150
 way you play you the same thing 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.540
 for example shifting by 2.15 in 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.210
 bavaria 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.490
 we for example I was when we 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.280
 so is it so at the beginning we also start 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.110
 team car if I do in fifth so 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.840
 you back all with two boxes 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.980
 the times of the man sometimes it does not 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.750
 mayor - it obviously needs hardly done 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.340
 moved on several strings and it's not 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.520
 badly to offer his chance in the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.520
 group 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.730
 everyone here 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.040
 Oh 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.930
 Oh 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.770
 I showed you two small variants 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.600
 you have plenty I see all others 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.730
 eat hectares have fun and 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.450
 we'll see each other soon for another
