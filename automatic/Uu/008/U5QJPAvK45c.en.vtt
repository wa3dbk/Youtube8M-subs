I<00:01:00.040> don't<00:01:01.040> think<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:01.400> i<00:01:01.430> haven't<00:01:01.550> seen<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.090> we

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
I don't think so i haven't seen that we

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.450 
I don't think so i haven't seen that we
just<00:01:03.050> have<00:01:03.200> to<00:01:03.260> realize<00:01:03.560> we<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:04.309> play

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.550 
to score it's nice to score goals but
that's<00:01:10.610> not<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.790> case<00:01:10.910> right<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:11.660> you

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
that's not the case right now so you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.230 
that's not the case right now so you
know<00:01:12.650> we<00:01:12.860> have<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.040> take<00:01:13.190> play<00:01:13.850> every<00:01:14.060> shift

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
shift important you can't we can't

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.480 
shift important you can't we can't
afford<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.350> mental<00:01:21.920> lapses<00:01:22.250> or<00:01:22.340> make

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
afford to have mental lapses or make

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.880 
afford to have mental lapses or make
mistakes<00:01:22.820> because<00:01:23.080> we<00:01:24.080> haven't<00:01:24.680> traveled

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
mistakes because we haven't traveled

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.790 
mistakes because we haven't traveled
scoring<00:01:25.130> goals<00:01:25.280> to<00:01:25.520> to<00:01:26.240> counteract<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.620> goals

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
scoring goals to to counteract the goals

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.320 
scoring goals to to counteract the goals
against<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:28.310> we<00:01:28.640> have<00:01:28.760> to<00:01:28.880> win<00:01:29.240> the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
against so we have to win the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.240 
against so we have to win the
low-scoring<00:01:29.630> games<00:01:29.930> and<00:01:30.200> do<00:01:30.800> that<00:01:30.950> as<00:01:31.010> a<00:01:31.070> team

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
low-scoring games and do that as a team

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.140 
low-scoring games and do that as a team
that's<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.580> only<00:01:31.700> way<00:01:31.790> it's<00:01:31.880> going<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.060> happen

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
that's the only way it's going to happen

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.000 
that's the only way it's going to happen
and<00:01:32.479> maybe<00:01:33.229> the<00:01:33.440> score<00:01:33.619> no<00:01:33.740> come<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:33.920> little

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
and maybe the score no come a little

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.859 
and maybe the score no come a little
