00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.900
 hello today's class will be about the set 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.639
 doctors and we will start our class with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.290
 a set of natural numbers and in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.940
 then we will talk about the set of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 whole numbers 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.420
 all the natural members of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.029
 natural numbers are numbers that 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 we use to count or enumerate 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 things then it is represented by a n 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.080
 with the litter and if he found it 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.779
 to differentiate the set of natural 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:37.190
 a set of any and it is given 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.190
 by 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.030
 if we want to represent the whole 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.930
 of the natural ones in 10 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.940
 we must represent it with the asterisk né 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 right here above the n 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.980
 so every time an asterisk appears 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.739
 here we will understand that zero does not 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.469
 will not be part of the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 An interesting application is the 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.479
 set of even and odd numbers 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 observe set of my pairs is given 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.110
 by 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 and so on 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 we can also represent the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.770
 countries by means of a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.950
 property that is another language 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.570
 to represent a set then it is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.380
 here the p of paris will be equal to x né a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.409
 people call x grandda power generalize 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.570
 Any number that 's for then 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 here xp natural trends 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.020
 natural world such that this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.899
 trace since it means such that x is 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.549
 equal to 2 times so let's understand 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.670
 again the numbers peace will be all xp 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.680
 natural tissues such that there is already a 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 condition for this xis and this condition is 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.170
 given by x 2 m wherein reached him 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.759
 number is natural then note that for 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.670
 any natural number that people 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 replaces here and I always have a 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.520
 For example, if the yen was zero 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.500
 will stay 20 notes here will give a 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 number if it equals 1 goes 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.460
 stay 2 times 12 will also be the number pa 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.480
 was good the 2 will get 224 will generate 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.530
 also a number for 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:24.960
 then this is the property né the form is 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.000
 how to write the set of my 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.370
 pairs across a property then 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.180
 Here's a set of numbers 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.010
 odd 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.430
 let's pretend to rush what it is 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 equal to 1 357 9 11 13 and thus 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.100
 successively 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.560
 if we want to represent this 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.150
 set through a property of the 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.620
 same way we did for the whole 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.940
 even numbers 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.270
 Let's have it written as follows 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.690
 way the sim set looks like let's 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.670
 represent that puri will be equal to xp 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.400
 natural stresses or any number 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.930
 belonging to the natural to the natural 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.480
 that the following condition is met: 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.630
 ox he has to be equal to 2 him more 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.380
 one then notice that this form here goes 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.930
 make sure that for any natural n 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.750
 that we put here will always have a 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.800
 x inpa example if the error was equal to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 zero will stay 2010 plus one is equal goes 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.989
 generate an odd number 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.500
 if he stayed 22 times 2 to 4 plus 15 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.060
 will also generate an odd number ok 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.230
 Let's talk now about the set of 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.050
 whole numbers 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.790
 the set of integers will be 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.820
 precisely the set of natural 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.440
 plus their friendly 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.890
 with a minus sign on the front then 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.200
 note that from here a 10 to 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.110
 zero we have the set of numbers 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.030
 that this part here and the 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.600
 left of zero we also have the set 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.230
 natural or 0 1 2 3 4 and so 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.910
 against 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.250
 the difference is that now we put 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.830
 a minus sign to indicate that the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.769
 number is a negative number 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.630
 generally the set of integers is 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:10.650
 widely used to represent 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:12.239
 to represent is life is temperatures 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.910
 negative and etc. 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.950
 néné and we represent him he 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.739
 set of integers also by a z 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.470
 with a double tummy here to 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.690
 to differentiate between a set of 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.180
 any time that 11 appeared with 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.150
 another little bar 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.520
 Join here let's understand what it is 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.009
 of the set of integers of the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.419
 the same way we did with natural 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.820
 if we want to represent the 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.610
 integrity without 10 must put a 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.009
 asterisk up here is to stay the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.320
 integers in 10 is represented by 12 up 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.810
 and note that there are all the numbers 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.270
 whole or even efficiently to 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.340
 left and ellipsis here to say 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.830
 to indicate that infinite however 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.560
 for negatively and positively 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.030
 and note that zero will not be part of 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.620
 this set we will see is some 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.289
 examples 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.419
 the first example there we will represent 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.949
 the following sets by means of a 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.740
 property letter a 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:15.440
 I want to represent this set to such 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.099
 2 3 4 and 5 note that these numbers are 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.419
 natural numbers and are also numbers 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:23.060
 integers and I want to use a 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:25.009
 property equal we used there 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.650
 to represent the pairs and the simple ne 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:29.360
 of that form x belongs to natural 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.389
 talk etc 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.690
 So let's see how it goes. 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.449
 note this set a will be equal to 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.010
 x belonging to integers 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:41.810
 note that I could also 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.039
 putting the natural ones would be fine 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.630
 none because these numbers from here to 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.729
 two three four five are numbers 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.860
 natural numbers are also integers 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.979
 so I decided to use one of the numbers 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.370
 integers then it will stay x this xis here 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:57.259
 it will get exactly these numbers the 2nd 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.870
 3rd 45 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.610
 so stay x belongs to integers come 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.770
 now the condition that is represented by 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.300
 such that this vertical bar 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.430
 Now let's see what's happening. 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.830
 note that the 2 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.240
 He is the least number of all here then 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.330
 We'll put two here and he's 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.699
 smaller and can also be equal to any 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:21.860
 number that is precisely what is 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:23.360
 our x then 2009 gouaches and our x 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.690
 for everyone who is here notes that 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.940
 all those who are less than 5 or 

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:32.470
 case of being 5 will be equal to 5 then already 

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:36.540
 put quiches is less than or equal to 5 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.760
 beauty example baby illustration 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.020
 and let's represent the set to which 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:45.810
 less 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.760
 Note that we have numbers here 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.560
 integers because I have both positive 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.870
 but negative also notes that 10 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.580
 not going is not part of this set 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.920
 so if I want to use an x to 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.230
 represent all these elements to the 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.110
 solution will follow the way the 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.540
 set the mare x né belonging to the 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.770
 asterisk because zero does not 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.900
 is here such that at least four it is the 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.210
 smaller number of everyone here then less 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.990
 four is smaller than che than all 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.600
 the numbers 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:19.110
 can be equal to minus four 

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:23.160
 né and all x question that all these 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:26.340
 numbers here will be less than or equal to 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.850
 to six n or 6 is the largest number of 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:33.060
 everyone here is represented and that is 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:36.000
 The whole thing is ok 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:38.280
 so if you have not yet subscribed to 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.080
 our channel sign up for being 

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.890
 updated new videos 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.890
 to the next
