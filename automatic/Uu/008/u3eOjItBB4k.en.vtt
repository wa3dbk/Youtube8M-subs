00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that is being put through to the box and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.260 
that is being put through to the box and
then<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.750> three<00:01:16.080> say<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.560> DTV<00:01:16.920> 3d<00:01:17.490> TV<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:17.909> 3d

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
then these three say to DTV 3d TV and 3d

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.210 
then these three say to DTV 3d TV and 3d
DLP<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.670> type<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.950> format<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
DLP and that is the type of format that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.100 
DLP and that is the type of format that
you're<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.060> you've<00:01:24.330> chosen<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> output<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:27.110> so

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
you're you you've chosen to output to so

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.760 
you're you you've chosen to output to so
you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.159> processor<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.970> convert<00:01:30.770> 2d

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you can use this processor to convert 2d

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.240 
you can use this processor to convert 2d
media<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.670> 3d<00:01:33.450> formats<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.920> formats

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
media to 3d formats so these formats

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.149 
media to 3d formats so these formats
range<00:01:35.490> from<00:01:35.820> amber<00:01:36.750> blue<00:01:36.930> glasses<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.530> 2d<00:01:37.829> TVs

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

shutter glasses on 3d TVs polarized
glasses<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.549> now<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.329> processor<00:01:42.960> is

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
glasses and now the processor is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.219 
glasses and now the processor is
optimized<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.829> be<00:01:43.950> used<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.430> 3d<00:01:45.360> ready<00:01:45.570> DLP

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

projectors and shutter glasses as well

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.289 
projectors and shutter glasses as well
so<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.890> course<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.790> bypass

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so of course there's also a bypass

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.240 
so of course there's also a bypass
function<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.409> lets<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.799> media<00:01:53.040> pass

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
function that lets your media pass

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
function that lets your media pass
straight<00:01:53.549> through<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> box<00:01:54.090> without

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
augmentation this way the 3d media

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.060 
augmentation this way the 3d media
processor<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.170> both<00:01:58.350> powerful<00:01:58.680> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
can think of the the creative

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.699 
can think of the the creative
possibilities<00:02:18.040> are<00:02:18.220> endless<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:20.500> kind<00:02:20.680> of

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
possibilities are endless so you kind of

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.250 
possibilities are endless so you kind of
just<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.040> play<00:02:21.190> with<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.510> overall<00:02:22.510> the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
just have to play with it overall the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.009 
just have to play with it overall the
box<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.709> very<00:02:24.220> powerful<00:02:24.580> very<00:02:25.239> powerful<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
box is very powerful very powerful and

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.680 
box is very powerful very powerful and
easy<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.590> use<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:27.580> took<00:02:27.760> me<00:02:27.910> all<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> three

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
easy to use it took me all of three

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.070 
easy to use it took me all of three
minutes<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:29.110> set<00:02:29.290> up<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.560> learn<00:02:29.739> you

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
minutes to set up and learn you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.110 
minutes to set up and learn you
basically<00:02:32.080> feed<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> 2d<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.099> 3d<00:02:33.130> signal<00:02:33.910> and

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
basically feed it a 2d or 3d signal and

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.150 
basically feed it a 2d or 3d signal and
then<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.900> choose<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.319> format<00:02:35.650> that<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.980> want

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
then you choose the format that you want

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.890 
then you choose the format that you want
the<00:02:36.250> processor<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.730> put<00:02:37.000> out<00:02:37.150> it's<00:02:37.660> really

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the processor to put out it's really

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.870 
the processor to put out it's really
that<00:02:38.110> simple

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
that simple

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.100 
that simple
until<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:39.970> integrates<00:02:40.330> into<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:40.660> enter

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
until they integrates into your enter

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.720 
until they integrates into your enter
him<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.410> set<00:02:41.590> up<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:41.920> there's<00:02:42.130> really<00:02:42.549> not

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
him and set up and there's really not
