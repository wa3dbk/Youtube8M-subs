00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
all right I think I'm ready to get this

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.269 
all right I think I'm ready to get this
thing<00:00:02.240> in<00:00:03.240> the<00:00:03.419> water<00:00:03.570> I<00:00:03.959> got<00:00:04.710> my<00:00:04.859> boat<00:00:05.040> out<00:00:05.069> of

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
thing in the water I got my boat out of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.560 
thing in the water I got my boat out of
the<00:00:05.370> way<00:00:05.839> I've<00:00:06.839> got<00:00:06.960> two<00:00:07.170> tires<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:08.389> big<00:00:09.389> piece

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the way I've got two tires a big piece

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.520 
the way I've got two tires a big piece
of<00:00:09.599> rope<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:11.070> Jamie<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:12.290> think<00:00:13.290> that's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
of rope and the Jamie I think that's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:01:16.640 
of rope and the Jamie I think that's
enough<00:00:13.710> stuff<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.130> it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:27.929 

yeah

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.060 

and<00:01:28.689> you'd<00:01:28.840> get<00:01:29.020> more<00:01:29.170> tire<00:01:29.469> to<00:01:29.619> put<00:01:29.799> down<00:01:29.950> in

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
and you'd get more tire to put down in

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.580 
and you'd get more tire to put down in
the<00:01:30.130> front<00:01:30.340> there<00:01:30.899> if<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:31.990> let<00:01:32.020> go<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.469> rope

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590

some holes in some PVC pipe I had lying

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.370 
some holes in some PVC pipe I had lying
around<00:05:00.860> put<00:05:01.729> a<00:05:01.760> nail<00:05:01.970> through<00:05:02.229> into<00:05:03.229> this

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
around put a nail through into this

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.689 
around put a nail through into this
board<00:05:03.680> and<00:05:03.889> then<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.070> same<00:05:04.250> thing<00:05:04.460> over<00:05:04.580> here

board and then the same thing over here

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:09.760 
board and then the same thing over here
so<00:05:05.690> that<00:05:05.840> can<00:05:06.020> pivot<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:09.080> then<00:05:09.380> this<00:05:09.500> is<00:05:09.740> just

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
so that can pivot and then this is just

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.080 
so that can pivot and then this is just
two<00:05:10.340> two<00:05:10.610> by<00:05:10.760> sixes<00:05:11.150> with<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.599> bunch<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:11.930> walk

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
two two by sixes with a bunch of walk

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:21.640 
two two by sixes with a bunch of walk
things<00:05:14.090> across<00:05:14.330> it<00:05:16.539> pretty<00:05:17.539> good<00:05:17.720> man<00:05:20.650> there

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
things across it pretty good man there

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.370 
things across it pretty good man there
we<00:05:21.710> get<00:05:21.830> down<00:05:22.039> here<00:05:22.370> and<00:05:23.210> I've<00:05:23.570> got<00:05:23.599> chunks<00:05:24.229> of

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
we get down here and I've got chunks of

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.649 
we get down here and I've got chunks of
tires<00:05:24.680> tire<00:05:25.520> rubber<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:26.030> was<00:05:26.150> leftover<00:05:26.479> from

00:05:26.649 --> 00:05:26.659 
tires tire rubber that was leftover from

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:28.240 
tires tire rubber that was leftover from
I<00:05:27.199> don't<00:05:27.409> even<00:05:27.650> know<00:05:27.860> what

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
I don't even know what

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.580 
I don't even know what
so<00:05:28.340> I<00:05:28.370> nailed<00:05:28.639> it<00:05:28.789> to<00:05:28.970> this<00:05:29.199> from<00:05:30.199> that<00:05:30.320> side

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
so I nailed it to this from that side

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.640 
so I nailed it to this from that side
and<00:05:30.620> then<00:05:31.130> nailed<00:05:31.430> it<00:05:31.610> down<00:05:31.729> here<00:05:32.500> it<00:05:33.500> looks

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
and then nailed it down here it looks

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.070 
and then nailed it down here it looks
like<00:05:33.740> it's<00:05:33.889> pretty<00:05:34.010> good<00:05:34.130> you<00:05:34.699> know<00:05:34.760> I<00:05:34.820> should

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
like it's pretty good you know I should

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.990 
like it's pretty good you know I should
give<00:05:36.080> a<00:05:36.110> decent<00:05:36.560> amount<00:05:36.800> of<00:05:37.010> flexibility<00:05:37.520> and

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
give a decent amount of flexibility and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.740 
give a decent amount of flexibility and
a<00:05:38.300> bit<00:05:38.449> of<00:05:38.570> a<00:05:38.599> springiness<00:05:39.260> and<00:05:42.220> oh<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:44.270> had<00:05:44.599> some

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
a bit of a springiness and oh I had some

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.469 
a bit of a springiness and oh I had some
other<00:05:44.870> leftover<00:05:45.490> rubber<00:05:46.490> parts<00:05:46.909> to<00:05:47.150> make<00:05:47.300> my

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
other leftover rubber parts to make my

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.480 
other leftover rubber parts to make my
boat<00:05:48.229> tires

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
boat tires

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.969 
boat tires
so<00:05:50.419> this<00:05:50.690> is<00:05:50.840> like<00:05:50.990> one<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.620> those<00:05:51.740> things

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
so this is like one of those things

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:53.920 
so this is like one of those things
called<00:05:52.370> these<00:05:53.120> things<00:05:53.360> what<00:05:53.539> are<00:05:53.569> what<00:05:53.900> are

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
called these things what are what are

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.540 
called these things what are what are
these<00:05:54.080> things<00:05:54.259> called<00:05:54.500> I<00:05:54.800> don't<00:05:55.069> know<00:05:55.130> anyway

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
these things called I don't know anyway

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:56.980 
these things called I don't know anyway
that's<00:05:55.970> what<00:05:56.090> those<00:05:56.180> are<00:05:56.360> so<00:05:56.419> you<00:05:56.630> can<00:05:56.750> tie

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
that's what those are so you can tie

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.270 
that's what those are so you can tie
your<00:05:57.020> ropes<00:05:57.350> around<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.099> cool<00:05:58.250> thing

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
your ropes around and the cool thing

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.860 
your ropes around and the cool thing
about<00:05:58.520> the<00:05:58.729> rubber<00:05:58.910> is<00:05:59.180> the<00:05:59.360> rubber<00:05:59.539> kind<00:05:59.810> of

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
about the rubber is the rubber kind of

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.080 
about the rubber is the rubber kind of
pushes<00:06:00.169> down<00:06:00.319> so<00:06:00.650> you<00:06:00.740> just<00:06:00.919> stick<00:06:01.789> your<00:06:01.910> rope

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
pushes down so you just stick your rope

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.570 
pushes down so you just stick your rope
under<00:06:02.389> it<00:06:02.479> and<00:06:02.750> it<00:06:02.870> stays<00:06:03.310> but<00:06:04.310> I<00:06:04.340> tied<00:06:04.550> it

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
under it and it stays but I tied it

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.890 
under it and it stays but I tied it
anyway<00:06:04.970> you<00:06:05.150> know<00:06:05.300> because<00:06:05.509> I'm<00:06:05.599> gonna<00:06:05.720> leave

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:14.180 
drive their boats into my thing without

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.089 
drive their boats into my thing without
breaking<00:06:14.569> it

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
breaking it

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:21.960

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:23.950 

let's<00:06:22.970> keep<00:06:23.120> crate

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
let's keep crate

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.370 
let's keep crate
