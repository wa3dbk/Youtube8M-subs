 maximum maximum nipples from udine 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.629

00:00:22.629 --> 00:00:25.800
 the big sleep 5 thousand Naples fans from Naples 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.849
 and that of the Udine area they came into contact with were scuffles 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.000
 this morning around noon and then about 20 minutes ago in the first 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.890
 contact a guy from Udine was injured by a stabbed state 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.909

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:49.800
 things put on messersÃ¬ well if yes but be okay 100 paul jones oh but after 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.979
 these moments tension around noon 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.510
 instead then again the fans are 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.560
 or have not returned to the front lying on the square in front of the north curve e 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.909
 the one behind my back on the curve of the Udinese fans while the parish priests 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.250
 are still taralli sirens noise can be heard of the siren noises 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.460
 ambulances that are evidently crossing the business square is one 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.720
 Charterhouse area remember better who has the hope I hope those images 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.340
 will not be sent are the miss you maybe a few minutes made that very important 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.460
 what do you know around 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.540
 20 minutes ago these of these incidents are 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.480
 they came right out of the stadium I confirm the sum of these two 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.720
 moments of tension between the two supporters in the first moment there would have been one 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.430
 A fan from Udine who was transported was stabbed 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.469
 in the hospital of udine is not in degrees 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:47.179
 read conditions as I understand it from the police should already have 

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:52.329
 made of 20 bon bonuses. of the fans via those voids with faces in these 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.109
 these clashes for this indiscretion I find absolutely no confirmation for the 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.400
 moment now these are the gif images taken 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.460
 at the moment the situation seems to have returned to calm but I have been 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.619
 I have an antopa a decidedly unpleasant appetizer of this Naples-Udine I see 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.819
 to be 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.849
 this exam and vegetable Sunday evening party with lots of fans 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.209
