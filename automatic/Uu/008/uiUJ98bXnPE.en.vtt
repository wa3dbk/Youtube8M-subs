00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.860
 I am the founder of a society that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.980
 is called the fan shop 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.790
 a digital manufacturing workshop I 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.109
 another activity actually 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.359
 historically I am a builder 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.270
 of scenery of this show modeling 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 3d brought me to the digital fabrication and 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.800
 at the thought of creating this company there is 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.800
 few years the choice 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.460
 at the request of the bhv we thought about 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.739
 the installation in the in the bhv of this 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.120
 which is called the factory of bhv and we 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.480
 will turn into a party for six 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.260
 weeks 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.480
 the whole store in a factory 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.699
 contemporary where we will produce 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.760
 design draw objects that 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.720
 correspond to the different universes of the 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.720
 psg store 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.690
 there are actually two ways of doing things 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.000
 3d models either using 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.030
 design software that allow 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800
 to draw what you need or in 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.750
 using what's called a 3d scanner 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.090
 which makes it possible to acquire a 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.780
 object of a character when we wish 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.140
 make a copy 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.690
 from these data the software is going 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.990
 make an inquiry and actually creates 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.990
 a sequence of two slices of layers 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.900
 3d printers allow all 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.400
 activities concerned by 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.620
 representations in three dimensions 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.030
 virtual world that surrounds them for 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.550
 whatever the market what address 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.550
 be it the architectured medicine 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.230
 design mechanics agribusiness 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.160
 all these industries that works in 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.920
 done in the virtual 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.390
 for years now ironing 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.210
 through a modeling and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.530
 making objects to be able to 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.610
 share share innovate and accelerate 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.610
 the pace of their innovation 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.710
