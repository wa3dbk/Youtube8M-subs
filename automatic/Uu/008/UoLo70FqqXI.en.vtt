certain different things but your

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.880 
certain different things but your
computer<00:00:33.390> has<00:00:33.600> some<00:00:33.780> kind<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.020> indicator<00:00:34.440> that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
computer has some kind of indicator that

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.290 
computer has some kind of indicator that
if<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.340> plug<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.640> iPod<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
if do you plug your iPod in and it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.810 
if do you plug your iPod in and it
starts<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> detect<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.200> now<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.430> it's<00:00:38.640> not

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
starts to detect it now if it's not

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.520 
starts to detect it now if it's not
doing<00:00:39.239> anything<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.050> detecting

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
doing anything and not detecting

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.520 
doing anything and not detecting
anything<00:00:41.450> then<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.110> go<00:00:43.260> through<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
anything then you have to go through the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.340 
anything then you have to go through the
process<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:44.070> elimination<00:00:44.899> of<00:00:45.899> some<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
process of elimination of some of the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.260 
process of elimination of some of the
possible<00:00:46.770> causes<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.670> let's<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.030> that

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
possible causes so let's do that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.270 
possible causes so let's do that
the<00:00:48.899> first<00:00:49.140> thing<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.590> recommend<00:00:49.770> that

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
the first thing that I recommend that

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.950 
the first thing that I recommend that
you<00:00:50.340> do<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.820> make<00:00:50.969> sure<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
you do is to make sure that you have the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.209 
you do is to make sure that you have the
latest<00:00:52.140> USB<00:00:52.829> drivers<00:00:53.340> installed<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:55.469> getting
