00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:09.150
 the or you step on another one stolen 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.519
 see the following is not had come back 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080
 a video much earlier in the week but what 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.969
 results in a video now for 2 million 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.670
 many first of them is that 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.050
 Let's say so without issue I 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.720
 I have how to release videos with more 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 ease and speed it is clear that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 Keep it up in the week is right but I'm 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.390
 Quiet then wanting to enjoy a 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.800
 videos of the week to answer 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.660
 comments you make on the 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 youtube on facebook then some 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.780
 power- separated comments 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.969
 reply but arrives in comments and 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.719
 creditors that the following only have in 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.430
 Facebook 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.399
 once again you did not follow robbed 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 on facebook they do that already the company already 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.600
 Because there you can see everything I 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.489
 I can not get back in the prepared video 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.780
 a video to release instantly is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.219
 once a text then ends up being a 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 much faster stuff and links and so on 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.829
 go 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 this warning in the case was what I wanted 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.329
 warn of ballistic beta 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.359
 ballistic is a fps developed by qnx 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.070
 from porto alegre from brazil it's on facebook 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.619
 I work on this project as 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.820
 writer then not only I am 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.110
 totally in favor of the project because I 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 I am part of it but also because I 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.439
 I really do believe in work. 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.840
 those has an incredible portfolio 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.479
 young people involved and is natural of reef 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.340
 pe facebook right then they have done with 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.530
 you basically and enter your 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 email them on their website and there you have it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.140
 access they will use when the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.100
 servers will be open so that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 to participate 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.560
 It is a multiplayer fps okay is a context 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 including running a brief 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.710
 I will do here but the historical context is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.170
 essence is that a new form of energy 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.479
 was discovered and you have the creation of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.909
 mfk embute federation online let's say 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.350
 so the new the future and on the one hand 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.840
 you have them that the monopoly control 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.149
 personal hunger for power and another 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.159
 so let's say that the faction of the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.590
 ebooks and that no one knows if that 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.479
 It is perhaps the power today 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.579
 oil barons who do not want to lose 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.640
 Let's just say it 's all your power and your 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.560
 twin hegemony over is that source of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.939
 energy that is oil and now 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.369
 I passed this new source of energy more 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.020
 ecologically sustainable 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.540
 this is the historical context but in the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.179
 practice is to know that you have ufpa 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.860
 facebook multiplayer with two factions and 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.610
 some maps that are already being tested 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.680
 13 in total 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.360
 Is it that you can play to give your 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 opinion the idea that eating until you can 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.840
 to say and say it here is not working 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.760
 here in the state but it's right 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.710
 There were people who already warned about the bug. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.730
 on some technical issues because 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.500
 so the development will be 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.870
 part of the protest 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.820
 Okay, so all sides are here in the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.700
 description of the video you can see the site 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.130
 east and also trailer once has the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.630
 idea that you finally meet a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.150
 little of the project in order to become 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.730
 part of it has finished the test here now 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.500
 we arrived in the comments looks nice 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.830
 I've separated some comments made 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.090
 via facebook and it's the youtube I wanted 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.610
 reply to these comments 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.980
 the Miss Earth Brazil said it enjoy 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.900
 Did you mention recent you expose 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.610
 your thoughts make a video bigger 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.220
 so as not to sound like a radio narrator 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.080
 Look I know it's hard, it's boring you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.610
 watch a short video where they do not have time 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.620
 to argue with Copts is not 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.050
 cool but I know I'm a person 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.580
 naturally prolix then including the 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.830
 comment from Jessica's gain on tariff 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.620
 and I have notion of these actions of hers 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.940
 that's why it's very clear I want 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.260
 make a short video because I think 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.360
 it will not be worth your while to live 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.700
 talk for 10 minutes but I want 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.290
 also be able to score specific topics 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.459
 this video here is more serious in the state 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 so it was from a list that now 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.290
 Talk about your comments, I do not 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.370
 I threw it so I can not speak, it's because 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.170
 own experience but what I can 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.360
 To talk is that Brazil is yours and that's what 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.760
 he since the receptive series since 2004 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.950
 she followed for a generation more action 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.870
 and less than being will roll it all there 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.299
 world knows no mystery but what it is 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.040
 It's important to know that I do not think 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.830
 interesting you are a bad game 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.590
 it's just not a game that lets say 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.430
 diverged from its origin and this did not 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.530
 is bad 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.940
 this is a different type of game will not 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.380
 to resend you if you want a 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.989
 experience more like derlei 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.060
 Peniche or the ps2 ranking which are 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.549
 games you basically run away and not that 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.989
 You will face the danger but today 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.760
 You guys, I think he has some tips. 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.080
 above the cool innovations fact of power 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.100
 Play as a zombie in multiplayer game 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.570
 from another person 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:14.380
 cooperative modes are very cool 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:16.479
 so beauty is there oscar cariri it 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.040
 said the following non-format is promising 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.660
 Good, we had a very short time. 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.099
 to express their opinion with the edition of 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.840
 law to fit and even fit 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.760
 every argument in this time that you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.170
 it really proposes more like 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.370
 edit has not much to do 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.590
 agreeing with staff thought it best 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.480
 a longer long video I have 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.030
 booking and know that not even want to get 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.650
 close to 2 minutes and maximum 26 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.510
 but without editing always a little more 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.770
 him to comment and talk without haste 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.760
 Thank you so much, I think talking to 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.080
 Hurry I 'll always talk because 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.090
 of course, but with the 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.620
 stopwatch in my throat does not have 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.170
 Very good, I'll talk in a hurry 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.180
 the 3 billion with reports 2d games 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.830
 especially of platform they have 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.360
 excellent titles but they were left half 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.240
 forgotten in current generation 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.770
 look 2d games no opinions never left 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.460
 they should never fail to 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.850
 exist 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.590
 we have examples like the 2d and 3d that 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.810
 play with this idea shadow complex is 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.260
 What comes to my mind is also 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.520
 o o must light than that of the decade 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.900
 80 I want to talk a little bit about 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.730
 That game I think is pretty cool, he's got a 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.560
 area so I find interesting as 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.140
 a narrative complementation game 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.460
 so it's the games I do not think they 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.140
 were forgotten but obviously a 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.230
 technical issue at first you had a 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.400
 very great emphasis is on the whole website 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.090
 in that game being on the left for the 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.620
 right 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.020
 This is because of the technical 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:32.170
 there was no one there, let's say the 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.820
 very strong graphics processing for 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.170
 to be able to reach games with polygons 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.300
 three times it's sad we come 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.860
 following from and understands the super 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.680
 nintendo and then there to nintendo 64 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.240
 three of them even look like one and 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.620
 The day we have one, let's say one 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.910
 very interesting mix 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.670
 now this does not mean that games 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.380
 can not have stories and see 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.240
 example of night or all these 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.250
 line games over the metroidvania 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.220
 sheep and encourage the 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.600
 Indian game aquarium that comes to mind is 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.450
 encourage exploration to experiment 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.490
 narrative elements such as 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.780
 story is one of those pastors who do not 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.140
 I'm a fan of history but there are people who 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.850
 like it and you think as much 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.620
 obede chrono one he said something that 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:14.020
 the chief crucial moment he puts the 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.180
 name of the games do not know they put 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.680
 in beauty description from now 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.420
 I'll always put the names of the games that I 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.890
 I'm talking about a trailer if possible. 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:25.630
 thing so that you can have a 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:28.990
 notion and it's eee his name disappeared 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:30.700
 Hell, I think it was Helton Borges. 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.160
 he said he did not think we did not 

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.990
 It was the Wesley day care doctor they went to 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.330
 Church notifies and tiresome has a vote 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:38.740
 nor more than ten minutes is not tiring 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.500
 I do not feel comfortable with all this 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.210
 time talking endlessly is then you 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.669
 I want to feel comfortable even in the 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.319
 video is so effective to talk about themes 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:49.330
 managed to close in 5 minutes really 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:51.370
 talk about it in five days without 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.240
 It's hard to edit, for example. 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.800
 now I've passed 16 but the idea here is 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.770
 that I can talk about games and have no 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.419
 that the point of not saying not to have 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.240

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:06.219

 specifically with the text is that 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.150
 when an activity with the 

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.610
 protagonist performance in the game is 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.389
 acceptable in that universe and when not 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:04.389
 and then there's space left more 

00:08:01.389 --> 00:08:06.909
