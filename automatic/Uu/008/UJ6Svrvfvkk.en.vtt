00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:05.940
 it means the continuation of the brand in Quito 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.379
 speeches, I'm telling the truth about how I make well 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.929
 It would by itself is not so important as the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.410
 no country no matter how funny 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.509
 funny and interesting what happens in 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.400
 China in general from the Chinese tea culture 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:24.150
 So I believe that this is now the format 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:27.539
 plaque to the shah he would give it torture vat and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.609
 so on but there it resembles the development 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.679
 Moscow tea culture of Chinese 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.960
 Moscow Chinese tea culture 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.239
 only we like it is not strange and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 interesting it happened a few 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.700
 well, not that earlier but well, in everything 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.559
 the case at the same time that is Chinese 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.250
 got out of the economic assholes later 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.670
 than russia and when not accordingly 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 when a person is already said to have some 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.610
 such a little bit of Chinese pasha 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.469
 proverb 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.770
 von bowsuel that is to eat warmed up 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 you can think about sex here 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.920
 it means actually happening with 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.159
 cultural aspects of the gift occurs 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.890
 the story itself the man has already fed himself 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 and he has the ability to pay more 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 attention to some such more subtle 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.939
 feeling rather than just your stuffed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
 belly as soon as this story arises to 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.020
 at the disposal of the Chinese unlike 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.500
 Russian citizens a little earlier 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.750
 always means cultural aspect forever 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.420
 waiting for any Chinese who wish 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 to turn to him and therefore huge 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.869
 number of Chinese now 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.270
 also became interested in tea culture and 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.119
 also buy their own boards and happens 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.710
 absolutely absolutely the same 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.950
 happens in Moscow that is 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.780
 Moscow in Russia, that is, they exchange 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.720
 information find some kind of literature 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.210
 someone else is able to teach each other 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.729
 can do that is the difference in this your 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.409
 there is absolutely no reason why 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.260
 As for the market, the same thing happens 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.210
 there are people who do not hunt to fool and 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.950
 There are people who fool hunting 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 so there are people who buy 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.740
 burners buy kettles buy 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.080
 metal earthenware kettles 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.930
 Porcelain buy tourist burners 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.489
 buy a stove or make these stoves themselves 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.860
 Find in the wood for wood or buy 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.080
 decline or in some way and order 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.530
 most create this one in its thin 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.239
 feeling and taking into account the experience of previous times 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.250
 creates this one 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.470
 magic act called 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.110
 making tea tea with a capital letter and 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.970
 so actually the difference between 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.600
 what is happening in russia and in china 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.680
 almost no no only 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.840
 the difference with the Chinese is that the case in 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.730
 literature on this whale on 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.130
 Chinese for Chinese naturally 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.810
 much more than a similar translation 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.330
 catholic literature in Russia that is why 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.910
 Waka is also in China, the Chinese also keep 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:01.829
 cherished me and some long stand by lu 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 yu checks there they put them cups well and 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.360
 Well, in general, the difference is absolutely no 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.220
 this is actually a description of that 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.440
 as it happens in china that is 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.970
 come to someone on the whip there is one like 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.579

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.440
 wrapped up here comes to him fucking I 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.780
 Yesterday went shorter in our village 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.000
