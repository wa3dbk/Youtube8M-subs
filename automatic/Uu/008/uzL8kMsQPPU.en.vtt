in<00:01:28.049> strips<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.560> give<00:01:28.710> much<00:01:28.890> more<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.340> rag

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
in strips to give much more of a rag

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.039 
in strips to give much more of a rag
effect<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:32.090> bags<00:01:33.090> themselves<00:01:33.840> would

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
effect so that the bags themselves would

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
effect so that the bags themselves would
have<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.590> weightier<00:01:35.040> meteor<00:01:35.460> fabric<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
have a weightier meteor fabric and then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.810 
have a weightier meteor fabric and then
by<00:01:36.810> adding<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.409> rag<00:01:37.710> strips<00:01:38.250> straight<00:01:38.579> into

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
the weft and leaving them extended she

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.100 
the weft and leaving them extended she
was<00:01:41.820> able<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.090> brave<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.600> handle<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
was able to brave the handle and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.960 
was able to brave the handle and
integrate<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:43.920> into<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> bag<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
integrate it right into the bag which is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.690 
integrate it right into the bag which is
a<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.329> clever<00:01:45.689> design<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.590> again<00:01:47.220> she<00:01:47.520> used

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
a very clever design and again she used

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.160 
a very clever design and again she used
a<00:01:47.820> brown<00:01:48.060> bag<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:49.380> white<00:01:49.590> bag<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:51.990> have
