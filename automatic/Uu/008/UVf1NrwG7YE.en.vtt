00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 very good to everyone in this new 20 they 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.750
 I bring a game of m17 but only 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.440
 get action for rm of 6 for the 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.089
 lovers of the legends smell this game 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 it will come but excellent because it is 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.420
 a replica very similar but very 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 similar far legend and very similar and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.269
 good let's put campaign we are going to 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 select the weather map and we're going to 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.130
 invite to select our our 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 heroes or our legends I will choose 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.730
 that is here in this in this we can 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.380
 choose 3 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.980
 but it's this way we see line av 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.210
 and already begins to load the map this 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.340
 game really was very good has 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.710
 obviously conchÃ¡n fire it goes down a bit 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.370
 the graphics but it really is very very 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.820
 good has a pretty cute graphic 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.950
 also has we can level up is 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.900
 very equal lesson for those who 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.210
 they know to do like for those who 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.400
 I love this game I recommend to 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.910
 100% the only thing to make life easier 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.680
 taylor on a 17 rm because install it on 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.040
 a network of 6 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.700
 it's very complicated requires your time your 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.759
 reading your analysts and analysis as 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.750
 they create injuries but it takes a long time and 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:35.780
 dedication because we were going to need in 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.850
 many obvious things to be directly 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.920
 root to have rooted to the cell phone 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.490
 make this game go, but we're not going to 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.299
 power directly we will jump 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.380
 that the application closes 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.520
 unexpectedly and we will not be able to 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:54.220
 play so for root users 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.740
 you know this game is for lovers 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.570
 of lola or for those who do not also because 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.570
 no but basically it's very similar like 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.200
 can see come here come to do 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:11.740
 the base I do not know very well how it's called in 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.250
 the sun but I played very little the truth 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.330
 but basically I insist because it continues 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.330
 well the screen by god 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.000
 He tells me to freeze a little of the 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.300
 principle but it's because it's loading 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.300
 the map 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.450
 they say we can 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.500
 to come 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.500
 let's go for god 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.650
 i 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.450
 ah 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.450
 there will be a way on board at home 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.250
 good usually hang was dying 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.610
 there we started and so with a lot of side but 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.250
 now it fits we'll be able to wait 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.950
 to the half 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.660
 at this time and now if we start 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.260
 Sirs 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.230
 and we can see in our other our 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.460
 another hero always remember that it is a 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.290
 remedy game you feel that you are 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.090
 optimized for m-16 obviously neither in 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.690
 your faults as you can see on the map 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.080
 which is how I had a lot of 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.020
 mistakes but basically ready and we're going to 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.580
 attack one of the towers 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.580
 because he told me he got off 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:46.230
 we instruct your first tower we are going to give 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:48.670
 with the second are the enemies and there 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.420
 or 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.420
 we go 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.570
 all right 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.650
 our next hero 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:08.310
 is very aware because they have 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.130
 things over your head and you can see I do not know 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:17.480
 what simply 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:21.410
 I guess characters but good I want 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:27.100
 tell them that the item is not deleted 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.100
 the level but that remains for example this 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.569
 with me 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.760
 an important stand awaits us and they are 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.180
 punishing 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.250
 They are giving me everything and keep killing him 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.300
 we follow the stalking and the tower if it runs 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.060
 run Run Run 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.100
 runs runs runs or by god the shit 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:05:00.070
 what is that, there would be a thousand people 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.900
 I would have behaved but if I play this 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.260
 it's like it's half in version 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.770
 beta because it has not been made yet 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.330
 I could completely say full because 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.330
 he does not have his fakes 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.669
 Y 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.710
 good for what he likes they bend and 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.850
 they have enough patience and it is this 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.740
 game for you 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:35.060
 I like that it exists as for 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.060
 have a good time 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.910
 as its fun its touch but if it 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.300
 I would fix the bus balloon bucs that has 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.800
 and other problems would be a game of 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:56.270
 true that it would be very good for 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.270
 stop me from 6 android of course 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:03.390
 It really is very good for us 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.390
 dude from the map 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.000
 as a host and ready 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.050
 in the minutes 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.920
 they showed me another 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.840
 other 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.030
 center in really that I am very bad 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.670
 playing in the evaluation as you can see 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.310
 but it's only for them to know the 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.760
 game that you like that are the most 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.760
 important 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.960
 here we go come on let's go 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.960
 go Go 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.900
 if we go to the 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.530
 to the base I do not envy you what it's called 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.530
 the last tower 

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:07.470
 and if we are going to destroy and win we have 

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:10.790
 we have 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:12.910
 with a lot of effort but we won 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.660
 and happy 

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.660
