 managed to put it 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 but today I wanted to show the best ones 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.900
 the best ten applications 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.000
 available in app stores not only 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.350
 on the other hand, old because why how 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.820
 you can see in tenth position 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.970
 we really have him 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.290
 once you have chosen the language in the mythical 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.040
 who tor 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.549
 ok is in alarm is an application that 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.049
 however you certainly know everyone 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.600
 through some questions I'll explain 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.970
 briefly through the questions to which this 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.440
 sir does it to you like for example numbers ad 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.640
 example we have to think of a 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:30.220
 character maybe we think of admitted no 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:32.410
 maybe I'll show you briefly how 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.020
 he works through aid to this 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.609
 question is will he understand 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.609
 what are we talking about 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:51.289

00:01:51.289 --> 00:02:00.860
 it is Brazilian no to the name that begins 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.229
 for it is ok 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.500
 obviously very simple questions like 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.349
 you can see he got it right and this was it 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.970
 the first application to chi network 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.599

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.590
 cents

 the hilton tolone text is a game and how 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.230
 you can see through the quizzes of the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.800
 strategies p is like we say a puzzle 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 why 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.820
 through quizzes and things really 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.890
