00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
inch will be

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.160 
inch will be
2208<00:00:41.870> by<00:00:42.140> 12<00:00:42.560> 42<00:00:43.160> so<00:00:43.790> which<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.270> Right<00:00:44.570> the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
2208 by 12 42 so which is Right the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.080 
2208 by 12 42 so which is Right the
iPhone<00:00:45.470> 6<00:00:45.710> might<00:00:45.860> also<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:46.370> a<00:00:46.399> sapphire

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
iPhone 6 might also have a sapphire

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.819 
iPhone 6 might also have a sapphire
crystal<00:00:47.600> display<00:00:48.020> now<00:00:48.230> this<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:48.530> supposedly

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
crystal display now this is supposedly

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.250 
crystal display now this is supposedly
2.5<00:00:49.790> times<00:00:50.059> stronger<00:00:50.390> than<00:00:50.570> Gorilla<00:00:51.020> Glass

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
2.5 times stronger than Gorilla Glass

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.930 
2.5 times stronger than Gorilla Glass
which<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:51.680> what<00:00:51.860> Apple<00:00:52.040> is<00:00:52.280> actually<00:00:52.579> using

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
which is what Apple is actually using

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.670 
which is what Apple is actually using
right<00:00:53.090> now<00:00:53.120> so<00:00:53.930> if<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:54.140> is<00:00:54.290> true<00:00:54.440> there's

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
right now so if this is true there's

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.840 
right now so if this is true there's
probably<00:00:54.980> going<00:00:55.130> to<00:00:55.190> be<00:00:55.250> less<00:00:55.489> cracked

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
probably going to be less cracked

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.790 
probably going to be less cracked
screens<00:00:56.239> which<00:00:56.450> means<00:00:56.690> less<00:00:57.050> warranty<00:00:57.530> claims

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
screens which means less warranty claims

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.549 
screens which means less warranty claims
which<00:00:58.280> means<00:00:58.520> more<00:00:58.879> money<00:00:58.910> for<00:00:59.210> Apple<00:00:59.719> iPhone

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
which means more money for Apple iPhone

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.590 
which means more money for Apple iPhone
6<00:01:00.590> will<00:01:01.010> also<00:01:01.370> have<00:01:01.520> an<00:01:01.610> all-new<00:01:01.940> design<00:01:02.329> but

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
6 will also have an all-new design but

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.359 
6 will also have an all-new design but
actually<00:01:02.930> resembles<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.469> old-school<00:01:03.829> iPhone

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
actually resembles the old-school iPhone

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.550 
actually resembles the old-school iPhone
even<00:01:04.609> more<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.389> fifth-generation<00:01:05.689> iPod

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
even more the fifth-generation iPod

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.199 
even more the fifth-generation iPod
looks<00:01:07.189> like<00:01:07.340> we'll<00:01:07.459> be<00:01:07.490> seeing<00:01:07.759> those<00:01:07.969> round

00:01:08.199 --> 00:01:08.209 
looks like we'll be seeing those round

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:10.120 
looks like we'll be seeing those round
edges<00:01:08.539> again<00:01:08.810> now<00:01:09.380> it's<00:01:09.560> also<00:01:09.679> gonna<00:01:09.889> have<00:01:10.069> a

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
edges again now it's also gonna have a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.859 
edges again now it's also gonna have a
thinner<00:01:10.459> bezel<00:01:10.939> as<00:01:11.090> well<00:01:11.299> as<00:01:11.420> movement<00:01:11.630> from

easily reachable on a larger device will

which<00:01:20.630> could<00:01:20.990> be<00:01:21.619> a<00:01:21.829> quad-core<00:01:22.159> 64-bit

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:23.029 
which could be a quad-core 64-bit

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:24.489 
which could be a quad-core 64-bit
processor<00:01:23.600> but<00:01:23.779> then<00:01:23.899> again<00:01:24.020> it<00:01:24.259> could<00:01:24.350> also

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:24.499 
processor but then again it could also

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.949 
processor but then again it could also
be<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.770> dual-core<00:01:25.429> running<00:01:25.789> around<00:01:25.959> 2.0

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
be a dual-core running around 2.0

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.870 
be a dual-core running around 2.0
gigahertz<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.039> that's<00:01:28.219> a<00:01:28.310> step<00:01:28.520> up<00:01:28.639> from<00:01:28.759> a

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
gigahertz now that's a step up from a

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.669 
gigahertz now that's a step up from a
1.3<00:01:29.329> gigahertz<00:01:29.779> that<00:01:30.049> we<00:01:30.139> have<00:01:30.259> right<00:01:30.469> now<00:01:30.499> but
