00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.529
 hi everyone is magic linky on 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.300
 is today for a video 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.520
 quite special since this is the 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.750
 unpacking the xbox one edition of the 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.550
 one so with fa 14 and ford at 50.10 y 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.550
 have limited so I'll do it after 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.379
 so already 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.489
 the township of agde mocks swan people 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.230
 see that there is a little by little because end 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.910
 turn pretty disgusting so we go 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.949
 remove 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.280
 here and there we have the box of the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.370
 xbox one so a very nice black box 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.589
 for the edition of one so the front 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.900
 on the side we go all that is to 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.510
 inside so the case what the 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.699
 kinect console a joystick so the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.860
 console at 500 giga so the back of the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.770
 laddh the box and the other side so we 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.759
 will open this game there lying for laughs and 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.149
 we will immediately what is 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.410
 interior 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.640
 so this is really a first debate there 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.210
 I do not know at all what there is like 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:23.440
 years old and therefore already makes soup of sully 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:30.570
 if we see the kinect then the kinect is 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.570
 big enough for small papers 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:47.710
 so here is the kinect he big enough 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.299
 deep enough wide and that the tool 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 epilogue xbox here on the left but 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.469
 I think she's under a TV 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.549
 it's going to be on a TV of any taste 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.200
 so I do not know at all how 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.590
 it can hold 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.780
 this is it that's good when so then 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.640
 that they are there, so we are 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:13.620
 the title up 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.620
 here we have the code to download fifa 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:25.890
 which we have the code to download fipa 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:32.950
 of the adoc wild a lot of doc 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.629
 that's how to connect the facts it was 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.910
 more interesting I'll connect you 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.019
 here to send a little bit like he 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.519
 makes small stickers so sees himself there 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:49.060
 it's goodies so the helmet to 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.859
 helmet that provides a gray suit 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.859
 like this way to conclude 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.050
 because there was before so I not so 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.780
 we'll see a little 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.780
 xbox inscription here a little edging 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.370
 green too loriette which I think 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.150
 it's quality is not not 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.989
 magical lannion 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.200
 it really means it provided 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.780
 a helmet so with the taking that is 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.910
 plug the dice in like that 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.790
 it's still a lot of the Aveyron 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:32.140
 half-time after which he brushed 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 temptations that I do not know 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.959
 if he would be fine I will unpack 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:55.080
 so plastic monday withdrew here lo 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.270
 so good it's a pretty big 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.820
 increase so it looks like a small 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.540
 hitbox on a shiny side macho side 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.300
 so that's me personally that annoys me 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:10.880
 no design edition are besides my 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:15.750
 TV stand so no problem then 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:18.540
 the famous controller with the inscription 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.970
 of one 2013 if I do not know if I you 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.100
 see of course the camera the joystick 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.620
 sincerely she's just perfect 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.210
 it's really a very, very good 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:34.790
 handle with the little flu on them 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.650
 sticks here the iii which is a lot more 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.540
 functional and more ergonomic than on 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.460
 the 360 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.490
 we can see here the little guide button 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.290
 box that turns on when the console 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.480
 to start and the triggers to are 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.419
 much wider this one click a little 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:53.150
 the little hiding place on the top 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.419
 click a little bit but nothing good 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.650
 transforming however a problem 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.480
 problem while they do not have one 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.550
 the joysticks running on the stack 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:09.419
 so that's really not what there is 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:12.160
 better but that's how it's 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:35.830
 other cables here 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:38.230
 and to finish so in a style a 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:47.890
 little paper like that so have succeeded 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:50.470
 of the opener between the mans already has it in 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:53.890
 I find it more beautiful than what 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.680
 I go so here is the console so there we 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.770
 returns the little button x box that allows 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:04.420
 to turn on the console the blu ray player 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:08.170
 who is here and on the top we see 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.960
 so the little xbox here or to leave to 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.940
 her big tits there because the pretty 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.070
 thick enough bush but prettier 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.020
 than what I did not believe that all the 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.150
 world said claude what we are not 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.580
 magic etc 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.640
 it's true go not extraordinary but 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:28.990
 it is still pretty enough so I 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:32.050
 put you on the console that's with the 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:37.680
 little toilet and then we'll go 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:40.510
 forza limited edition so here is the 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.330
 so casing and a special dust jacket x 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.669
 10 units and inside the stud book 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.810
 who is really gorgeous smaller 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.810
 big docks logo forza 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.510
 inside there is the idea of ​​the content 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.900
 downloadable that's all nothing from 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:04.090
 special 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:04.090
 the blu ray of forza the stickers then 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:10.070
 we're not doing well because it's a 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.600
 white is not bad price stickers to 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.260
 straw and expense control so 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:18.320
 frankly nothing special transcendent 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:20.229
 in this limited edition there are 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.729
 many more marbles more there the dlc 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:25.430
 otherwise really not much what 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:30.020
 so it was a little quick unpacking 

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:38.630
 so xbox one was asked here from 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:40.820
 bost stands with assassin's creed iv 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.880
 so I'm waiting to receive guests from 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:48.220
 other games I had asked for 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:51.020
 I draisines 3 fifa eastern Congo here 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.510

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.990

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:56.870
 6-4 

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.430
 I'm not here yet so that's what 

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.010
 little unpacking of the xbox wayne in 

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.139

 impatient of the branch is so there 

00:08:03.139 --> 00:08:05.690

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.479
 I discovered with you what is 

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.960

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.560
