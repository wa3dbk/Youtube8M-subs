00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.110
 hello everyone is steven is 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.460
 today little video just for 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
 warn you that apple has finally 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.500
 formalized its special event for 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.000
 October 22, 2013 so the rumor 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.080
 was spinning a bit on the internet already 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.359
 lately but today 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 it's official there will be a 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.849
 who notes so an apple conference 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.289
 October 22, 2013 is a Tuesday and at 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.939
 the time I'm doing this video it will be 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.130
 so in exactly a week 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.780
 then once again apple will hold 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.390
 his lecture in san francisco 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.969
 it will start at 10 am local time so for 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.379
 we French will be at 7 pm in this 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.300
 regarding new apple products 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 should present on this occasion the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 new generation of ipad and ipod me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.050
 so read two ipads will be presented this 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.700
 evening we should discover the ipad of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.059
 fifth generation with always a 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.219
 screen of 9.7 inches diagonally but the 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 design of this ipad 5 would be closer 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.809
 from that of the ipad mini 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.090
 there will be a smaller iPad thinner 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.339
 lighter and with probably a 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 7 processor like on the iphone 5 is 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 so it's all good ipad a good 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 finer much nicer in hand and 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.040
 once again more powerful than the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 previous generation of ipad 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.560
 then concerning the ipad mini and well 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.400
 this year we move to the second 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.950
 generation 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.630
 so this ipad mini 2 should finally be 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.490
 equipped with a retina screen 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.619
 which means a much better 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.689
 definition on the screen but against a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 ipad mini probably slightly more 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.540
 thick a little bit heavier than the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.090
 previous generation 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 it should really be very light but 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.689
 it's worth it and it's mostly 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.430
 needed to have this screen retina 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.960
 the size of the screen she she does not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.150
 will not change it will always be an ipad 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.430
 smaller than the classic ipad between 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.280
 ipad mini quotation marks will remain so on the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.350
 7.9 inches diagonally and like for 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.799
 the ipad 5 we can expect a processor to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.810
 7 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.820
 once again as the iPhone 5 s 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.950
 so that's what we know today 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.590
 these two ipads will be presented on 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.570
 Tuesday 22 October by apple for the awards 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.829
 well we'll see that tonight and for 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.630
 the date of marketing 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.070
 we do not know it yet but we can 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.590
 easily imagine that it will turn out 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 around the 30th and the 31st of October 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.050
 then apart from the presentation of 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.360
 these two new ipod models 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.640
 apple during his note that should finally 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.800
 formalized the release date of the bones x 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.660
 10 points 9 mavericks that is already 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.980
 available in final version for 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.830
 developers for several weeks 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.840
 so os x mavericks that will equip all 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.550
 the new mac intosh and that will be 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.170
 accessible on older models 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.470
 via an update from the mac app 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.230
 blind 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.390
 we should have the date that night and 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.410
 the price also then we should 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.910
 also have a date of 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.500
 marketing for new mac 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.330
 pro who I remind you have been 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.310
 presented during the previous note 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.170
 is always with regard to 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.940
 new products we can hope this 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.590
 evening there a renewal of macbook 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.780
 pro who will therefore move on to a new 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.950
 range and why not a new 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.260
 apple tv generation 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.540
 but all that remains very vague 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.000
 that's guessing and once again 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.440
 we will be all this on October 22 at night 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.150
 during the apple conference 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.350
 so that's it for the main 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 novelties that can be expected 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.130
 during the conference is 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.170
 then like every year at the beginning 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.270
 apple will offer different statistics 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.340
 and figures including that of 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.690
 the installation of ios is rather 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.860
 impressive if you believe 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.120
 last reports we've seen a 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.730
 little bit everywhere on the internet 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.170
 eyeos is has been massively install 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.030
 you are very likely to have it 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.230
 used on your iphone your ipod 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.270
 touch or your ipad 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.760
 so we'll know the official numbers 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.840
 again again tonight for 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.239
 finish you may be wondering 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
 how to watch it this lecture and 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.090
 well it's very simple firstly if 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.890
 you did not have the chance to receive 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.170
 the invitation card you can 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.610
 see on the screen and that was sent 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.080
 to many journalists who will be 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.850
 present that night in the room 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.560
 well, you'll be like me 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.230
 your computer to follow that on 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.750
 internet and we hope that apple will 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.730
 propose a live streaming a broadcast 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.680
 live this was not the case during 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.989
 the previous one that notes sal was during 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.820
 those before so we do not know how 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.350
 it's going to happen we'll be a few hours 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.790
 before the start and I will hold you at 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.110

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.550
 strongly urge you to follow me on 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.670
 facebook and on twitter 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.090
 and in case apple does not broadcast this 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.230
 event 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.910
 Well, I'll give you some 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.769

 live photos 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.919
 so that's all there is 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.000
 important to know about this event 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.190
