00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.670
 watson everyone is writing this julien 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.660
 his camp makes for the woods that we 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 shoot about battlefield game 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 khattab write off is possible to win 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.250
 points and it's nice to see you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.089
 mario paypal does not care to put a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.740
 little ever the video there 1 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.570
 comment cocof participate you are 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.890
 not necessarily forced to do all this 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.289
 so all that is actually by long 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.460
 ticket actually at micromania I think 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.519
 so that I bought there are not bad 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.720
 so with lots of code so to give 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.210
 of course something that's what you 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 people do all this I do not see 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.469
 really what I could do with it 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.329
 finally even xbox and even basket brief 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.350
 totally chelous justification in 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.120
 done today so I'm going to you 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.730
 talk about the game not you go four to port 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.260
 bouet 2 battlelog a small option 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 extra in fact it's going to happen 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 on the boat 2004 so then there will be 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.750
 a lot of things that have been given to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.550
 About this I have to talk to you 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.899
 some big information to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 about log boats then if you 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.320
 leave something going to be 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.910
 extra to the game that goes one goes 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 improve it in fact you're going to come back from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 extra families at the game we're going to 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.680
 frame is like that we will say like that 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.629
 we will say these are options 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.010
 additional advanced options 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.049
 you do not necessarily have to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.460
 do it all but here I was when 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.210
 even look forward to telling you because there is 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.930
 still enough things 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.189
 interesting 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 so then you'll have a little option 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.340
 which serve to undermine the boat screen the 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.689
 swing boat what is that what 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.670
 it's just a new system 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.799
 that will actually play with two 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.060
 west screens two screens are you going 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.650
 have your TV screen when 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
 you played for example on balls 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.030
 2004 on those on playstation 3 or xbox 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.159
 360 or break 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.270
 so you played on a screen is in 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.979
 do you will be able to play with two 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.360
 screens or where does this second 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.369
 screen just not your 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.650
 ipad phone or something else tablet 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.850
 on everything you want and well you 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 can you actually connect your 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.070
 cell phone or tablet to 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.540
 battlelog that actually goes to him so 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.670
 after of course data all that like 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.079
 what this second screen does that you 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.369
 can put it next to you when 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.350
 I was not playing in ointment 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.000
 multiplayer battlefield 4 and well 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.290
 you will be able to play so of course 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.759
 you see the screen where you are the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.920
 staff under what normal what 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.270
 down since the 4th and then next you have 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.400
 your phone and it will allow you 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.440
 in fact to give you 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.550
 additional information as per 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.560
 example line map 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.110
 so there will be the display of a mafia 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280
 in addition to that it's not julia not that it 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.170
 if you want it already is nice and 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.030
 everything going to be on ios of course and 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.110
 on android so we'll be pretty much 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.360
 all platforms 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.000
 so all phone versions and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.310
 kyo it's new tablets either 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.320
 500 go finally short or downloaded in any 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.450
 case the application normally battlelog 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.950
 after log in and then you go 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.050
 to be able to see his interests interactions 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 the possible sounds of course it's a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.970
 new extension and all that on the other hand 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.930
 will be available on playstation 4 pc and 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.090
 xbox one 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.010
 on the other hand on playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.810
 but on the other hand there is not sure 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.400
 so I will not be able to you 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.280
 confirm on the platforms that are 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.390
 low of the moment ie ps3 x360 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.550
 on the other hand it is true that the platform 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.530
 pc it is compatible with these 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.330
 so then also in fact what I 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.040
 wanted to tell you about battlelog 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.140
 which will also have the possibility of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.400
 do interactions on it's up to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.560
 to say that you will be able to everything 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.180
 simply move the map to make 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.590
 things with your phone 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.480
 knowing that you are at the same time 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.769
 connected actually based on the mode 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.160
 multiplayer and more you can do 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.600
 lots of things 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 so it's true that even for example if 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.390
 we look at dad without the mini map that 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.840
 the bank knew at the bottom left of 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.980
 your screen 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.540
 Well, it's still something 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.459
 quite important even in all fps 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.160
 and she gives you a lot 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.989
 information and that's the fact of 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.030
 have it on your tablet on your 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.370
 ipad or other or on your iphone pass 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.019
 to allow for perhaps from strength of 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.459
 head better played yesterday because it takes 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.850
 there are more to the right of your 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.700
 screen 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.530
 so that can be good it can you 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.600
 give a few seconds a little 2 of 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.950
 delay but somewhere that's risky 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.390
 to be frankly a very good idea 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.890
 which I also found a very good 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.180
 idea of ​​doing that actually in effect 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.739
 battlelog docile additional option 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.269
 called the Hollies and the boys 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.830
 are pronounced knew the engineer by 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.390
 the little english accent all that so 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.100
 it's completely wrong finally I know 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.510
 it does not save it's completely it's the 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.250
 good way short yes the good 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.780
 pronunciation actually that you know it 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 not tell you where you are specifically 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.930
 that is to say that when you 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.730
 play bella not simple you do some 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.750
 parts those of surba 2004 comes well 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.360
 sure you will play so with a 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.160
 certain weapons on a certain map 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.830
 so after that you're here it depends 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.120
 two 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.370
 it smells all of this basically if you 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.470
 want to make a big summary of that's okay 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.410
 save exactly what you 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.080
 do on the tablecloth in a precise time 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.940
 and with tears you would have used 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.010
 that is to say that there will be a 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.480
 kind of world scor there from us by 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.370
 example the person who will have done the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.680
 more than he has with the m16 on a 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.850
 certain map them so for example who 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.680
 will have that kind of thing that will 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.780
 available so it's called jim lee of 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.040
 bones then by cons here it's going you 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.630
 ask for a location 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.430
 enjoy the throat and look and 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.260
 geolocation excuse me yeah that's it 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.700
 I think that's how it is 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.350
 is actually where you are 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.940
 caution this is not required 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.800
 you do not have to say where you 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.930
 that is to say that you live in 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 France where you are exactly like me 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.750
 for example in lyon 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.980
 maybe not necessarily you are not 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.270
 obliged so that's good I find it 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.260
 respect a little bit the players there is 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.820
 maybe not necessarily everyone 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.990
 who want to show up and tyr where he 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.760
 lives so you can also you 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.440
 put in anonymous mode like that and 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.390
 sing it goes if you are a french 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.040
 or German en route but you can 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.950
 still participated in that way in 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.180
 do it's just competitive spirit 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.130
 in every day in fact of 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.140
 pathetic 4 through a 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.940
 makes this little application of 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.470
 this new extension makes battlelog 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.120
 rossi one last thing that will be called 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.650
 mission then by cons there I have not 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.120
 exactly all inclusive so tell me 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.500
 if I make a small mistake at wholesale 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.030
 you will be able to create missions and 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.190
 to be able to share them ie you 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.750
 can ask your friends to do a 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.100
 number of kills with a 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.720
 some soul or something else 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.950
 so here's no I found that it's 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.810
 frankly it's these interactions 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.700
 extra are really cool 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.680
 I wish he had done a little 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.540
 almost the same as in the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.700
 call of duty but hey that's still 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.870
 still shows there on blackpool 4 by 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.400
 example I was talking about kiwi colonies 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.500
 did for example kinds of 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.850
 small missions even in co-op but good 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.470
 it's not the same as strouk lacquer and 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:48.360
 it's different they did more than 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.800
 back and I find it really nice 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.720
 of their talking about finding these small 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.790
 extra things sassard again 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.620
 more immersive makes the game five years 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.270
 before all the mayors thanks who subject 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.190
 thank you goodbye everyone thank you 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.940
 my said i like to the video it's great
