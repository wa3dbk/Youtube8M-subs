recording area and I'm all for testing
different<00:00:26.400> microphones<00:00:26.910> seeing<00:00:27.449> if<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.660> can

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
different microphones seeing if I can

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.839 
different microphones seeing if I can
improve<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> audio<00:00:28.380> quality<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.609> really

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
improve the audio quality and really
checking<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.599> some<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.869> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
checking out what some of the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
checking out what some of the
alternatives<00:00:31.260> actually<00:00:32.189> offer<00:00:32.340> in<00:00:32.669> terms<00:00:33.270> of

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
alternatives actually offer in terms of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.200 
alternatives actually offer in terms of
quality<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> be<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.940> test

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
quality so this is going to be my test

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
quality so this is going to be my test
of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> spark<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:37.950> want<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.340> give<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.670> a

a<00:01:40.140> sort<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.009> mound<00:01:41.280> shock<00:01:41.939> mount<00:01:42.210> now<00:01:42.990> what

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
a sort of a mound shock mount now what

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.230 
a sort of a mound shock mount now what
shock<00:01:43.409> mounts<00:01:43.799> do<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> they<00:01:44.220> mount<00:01:44.759> onto<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
shock mounts do is they mount onto the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.359 
shock mounts do is they mount onto the
microphone<00:01:46.079> arm<00:01:46.350> I'm<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> putting

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
microphone arm I'm going to be putting

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.940 
microphone arm I'm going to be putting
mine<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:48.149> behind<00:01:48.420> me<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.799> they

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
mine just behind me here and then they

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.310 
mine just behind me here and then they
suspend<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.820> microphone<00:01:51.360> using<00:01:51.840> sort<00:01:52.049> rubber

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
suspend the microphone using sort rubber

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.679 
suspend the microphone using sort rubber
or<00:01:52.500> elastic<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.909> does<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.540> any

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
or elastic and what this does is any

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.569 
or elastic and what this does is any
vibrations<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> are<00:01:55.740> coming<00:01:56.070> through<00:01:56.250> from

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
vibrations that are coming through from

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.690 
vibrations that are coming through from
your<00:01:56.759> desk<00:01:57.000> for<00:01:57.119> example<00:01:57.780> on<00:01:58.579> resonated<00:01:59.579> up

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
your desk for example on resonated up

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.969 
your desk for example on resonated up
into<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.030> microphone<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> idea

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
into the microphone so that's the idea

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.679 
into the microphone so that's the idea
of<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> shock<00:02:02.340> mount<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.149> we<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.600> those

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
of a shock mount so we get one of those

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.760 
of a shock mount so we get one of those
in<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> box<00:02:04.170> we<00:02:05.130> also<00:02:05.280> get<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.049> dedicated<00:02:07.049> pop

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
in the box we also get a dedicated pop

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.190 
in the box we also get a dedicated pop
shield<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.670> spark<00:02:09.030> as<00:02:09.209> well<00:02:09.360> now<00:02:09.989> what

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
shield for the spark as well now what

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
shield for the spark as well now what
pops<00:02:10.470> yield<00:02:10.709> does<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.129> when<00:02:11.580> you're<00:02:11.760> saying

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
pops yield does is when you're saying

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.160 
pops yield does is when you're saying
peas<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.170> example<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.800> don't<00:02:13.980> get

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
peas for example you don't get

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.410 
peas for example you don't get
they<00:02:14.260> saw<00:02:14.470> popping<00:02:14.980> noise<00:02:15.160> coming<00:02:15.970> through<00:02:16.240> in

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
they saw popping noise coming through in

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.270 
they saw popping noise coming through in
your<00:02:16.450> audio<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.500> pop<00:02:17.680> shield<00:02:17.950> is<00:02:18.099> meant

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
your audio and the pop shield is meant

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.910 
your audio and the pop shield is meant
to<00:02:18.370> help<00:02:18.550> with<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.959> dedicated<00:02:20.440> pop

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to help with that so dedicated pop

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.900 
to help with that so dedicated pop
shield<00:02:21.130> and<00:02:21.340> then<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.489> get<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.640> microphone

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
shield and then we get the microphone

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.479 
shield and then we get the microphone
itself<00:02:22.390> I'm<00:02:23.349> just<00:02:23.560> amazed<00:02:23.890> at<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.220> box

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
itself I'm just amazed at this box

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.479 
itself I'm just amazed at this box
actually<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:26.110> it's<00:02:26.200> just<00:02:26.319> open<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.739> up<00:02:26.920> now

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
actually so it's just open this up now

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.949 
actually so it's just open this up now
do<00:02:27.550> stay<00:02:27.910> tuned<00:02:28.239> because<00:02:28.270> i'm<00:02:28.599> actually<00:02:28.690> going

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
do stay tuned because i'm actually going

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.690 
do stay tuned because i'm actually going
to<00:02:29.050> set<00:02:29.260> this<00:02:29.410> art<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:30.040> you're<00:02:30.310> going<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.489> hear

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
to set this art and you're going to hear

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.110 
to set this art and you're going to hear
what<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.060> spark<00:02:31.450> sounds<00:02:31.870> like<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.230> this<00:02:32.380> video

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
what the spark sounds like in this video

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.080 
what the spark sounds like in this video
so<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.630> is<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.470> feels<00:02:35.950> really<00:02:36.670> well

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
so this is it and it feels really well

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.990 
so this is it and it feels really well
made<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:38.110> says<00:02:38.380> remove<00:02:38.800> screw<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.430> attach<00:02:39.459> pop

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
made it says remove screw to attach pop

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.990 
made it says remove screw to attach pop
filter<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.750> side<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.790> just<00:02:42.790> got<00:02:42.970> a

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
filter on that side and just got a

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.190 
filter on that side and just got a
little<00:02:43.060> bit<00:02:43.239> of<00:02:43.269> packaging<00:02:43.750> stuck<00:02:43.989> there

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
little bit of packaging stuck there

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.400 
little bit of packaging stuck there
there<00:02:44.349> we<00:02:44.500> go<00:02:44.650> look<00:02:45.519> at<00:02:45.700> this<00:02:45.940> there's<00:02:46.600> a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
there we go look at this there's a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.309 
there we go look at this there's a
little<00:02:47.650> button<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.040> I<00:02:48.250> haven't<00:02:48.550> read<00:02:48.850> the

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
little button here I haven't read the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.960 
little button here I haven't read the
instructions<00:02:50.319> yet<00:02:50.560> but<00:02:51.130> I'm<00:02:51.280> assuming<00:02:51.459> this

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
instructions yet but I'm assuming this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.449 
instructions yet but I'm assuming this
button<00:02:52.360> changes<00:02:52.750> maybe<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.230> pattern<00:02:53.590> pop

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
button changes maybe the pattern pop

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:55.979 
button changes maybe the pattern pop
shield<00:02:54.700> on<00:02:54.880> here<00:02:55.239> we've<00:02:55.510> got<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.750> blue

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
shield on here we've got the blue

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.130 
shield on here we've got the blue
microphones<00:02:56.739> or<00:02:56.980> logo<00:02:57.459> on<00:02:57.670> their<00:02:58.180> XLR

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
microphones or logo on their XLR

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.509 
microphones or logo on their XLR
connection<00:02:59.620> so<00:02:59.950> what<00:03:00.069> I'm<00:03:00.130> going<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.280> be<00:03:00.400> doing

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
connection so what I'm going to be doing

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.550 
connection so what I'm going to be doing
is<00:03:00.730> connecting<00:03:01.000> this<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.450> my<00:03:01.870> focusrite

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
is connecting this to my focusrite

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.059 
is connecting this to my focusrite
scarlett<00:03:02.769> 2i2<00:03:03.600> USB<00:03:04.600> audio<00:03:04.750> interface<00:03:05.069> and

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
scarlett 2i2 USB audio interface and

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.289 
scarlett 2i2 USB audio interface and
then<00:03:06.220> we've<00:03:06.340> obviously<00:03:06.459> got<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:06.910> actual

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
then we've obviously got the actual

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.110 
then we've obviously got the actual
microphone<00:03:08.610> diaphragm<00:03:09.610> or<00:03:09.640> element

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
microphone diaphragm or element

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.070 
microphone diaphragm or element
underneath<00:03:10.900> this<00:03:11.110> sort<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.440> mesh<00:03:11.730> piece<00:03:12.730> here

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
underneath this sort of mesh piece here

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.750 
underneath this sort of mesh piece here
so<00:03:14.080> let's<00:03:14.350> get<00:03:14.470> this<00:03:14.650> set<00:03:14.890> up<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:15.549> I'll

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
so let's get this set up and then I'll

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.729 
so let's get this set up and then I'll
give<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.030> a<00:03:16.060> listen<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> blue<00:03:17.080> microphone

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
give you a listen to the blue microphone

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.770 
give you a listen to the blue microphone
spark<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.970> wanted<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.299> give<00:03:19.450> you<00:03:19.570> a<00:03:19.630> quick

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
spark so I wanted to give you a quick

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.110 
spark so I wanted to give you a quick
close<00:03:20.170> up<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.980> spark<00:03:21.340> before<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.760> gave<00:03:22.000> you

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
close up of the spark before I gave you

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.390 
close up of the spark before I gave you
the<00:03:22.180> audio<00:03:22.750> demonstration<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.980> you<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.190> see

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
the audio demonstration and you can see

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.460 
the audio demonstration and you can see
here<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.820> sits<00:03:25.000> beautifully<00:03:25.420> within<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
here it sits beautifully within the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.289 
here it sits beautifully within the
vocal<00:03:26.950> booth<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.430> supplied<00:03:27.760> by<00:03:27.970> editors

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.289 
vocal booth that supplied by editors
keys<00:03:28.600> look<00:03:29.560> really<00:03:30.010> nice<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.220> the<00:03:30.760> sort<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.060> red

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
keys look really nice in the sort of red

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.330 
keys look really nice in the sort of red
orange<00:03:31.750> color<00:03:32.049> we've<00:03:32.590> got<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:32.829> shock<00:03:33.070> mount

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
orange color we've got the shock mount

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.640 
orange color we've got the shock mount
in<00:03:33.519> place<00:03:33.790> we've<00:03:34.359> got<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.780> pop<00:03:35.200> shield<00:03:35.470> in

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
in place we've got the pop shield in

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.920 
in place we've got the pop shield in
place<00:03:35.680> or<00:03:36.130> the<00:03:36.250> pop<00:03:36.430> filter<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.060> now<00:03:37.720> let's

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
place or the pop filter and now let's

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.960 
place or the pop filter and now let's
have<00:03:38.079> a<00:03:38.230> listen<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.010> what<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.609> Blue

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
have a listen to what the Blue

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.360 
have a listen to what the Blue
Microphones<00:03:40.180> spark<00:03:40.989> sounds<00:03:41.410> like<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:42.280> I've

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
Microphones spark sounds like so I've

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.250 
Microphones spark sounds like so I've
had<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.519> little<00:03:42.670> read<00:03:43.060> of<00:03:43.359> the<00:03:43.690> instruction

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
had a little read of the instruction

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.960 
had a little read of the instruction
manual<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.650> well<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.250> blue<00:03:45.459> microphone

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
let's have a listen to that now so now

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:08.940 
let's have a listen to that now so now
what<00:04:07.810> we're<00:04:07.989> hearing<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.739> blue

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
what we're hearing is the blue

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.000 
what we're hearing is the blue

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
microphone spark in normal mode you

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.009 
microphone spark in normal mode you
should<00:04:12.250> hear<00:04:12.519> a<00:04:12.549> great<00:04:12.850> vocal<00:04:13.420> range<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.870> my

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
should hear a great vocal range in my

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.259 
should hear a great vocal range in my
voice<00:04:14.260> both<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.829> high<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.370> low<00:04:15.400> frequencies

with great definition and very little

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.430 
with great definition and very little
background<00:04:18.940> noise<00:04:19.209> I've<00:04:19.870> been<00:04:20.229> really

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
background noise I've been really

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.870 
background noise I've been really
pleased<00:04:20.889> during<00:04:21.250> my<00:04:21.370> couple<00:04:21.639> of<00:04:21.729> weeks

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
pleased during my couple of weeks

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.550 
pleased during my couple of weeks
testing<00:04:22.360> with<00:04:22.510> this<00:04:22.659> microphone<00:04:23.200> it

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
testing with this microphone it

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.030 
testing with this microphone it
certainly<00:04:24.010> does<00:04:24.220> perform<00:04:24.430> as<00:04:24.880> expected

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
certainly does perform as expected

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.020 
certainly does perform as expected
so<00:04:27.160> there<00:04:27.280> you<00:04:27.310> go<00:04:27.400> you've<00:04:27.640> heard<00:04:27.880> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
so there you go you've heard the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.300 
so there you go you've heard the
microphone<00:04:28.540> in<00:04:28.780> normal<00:04:29.380> mode<00:04:29.560> now<00:04:30.190> we're

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
microphone in normal mode now we're

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.680 
microphone in normal mode now we're
going<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.460> switch<00:04:30.730> that<00:04:30.880> button<00:04:31.270> on<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.480> back

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
going to switch that button on the back

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.890 
going to switch that button on the back
to<00:04:32.380> focus<00:04:32.890> mode<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.430> what<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.090> instruction

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
to focus mode and what the instruction

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.500 
to focus mode and what the instruction
manual<00:04:34.930> says<00:04:35.290> about<00:04:35.530> focus<00:04:36.010> mode<00:04:36.250> is<00:04:36.520> that

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
manual says about focus mode is that

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.660 
manual says about focus mode is that
when<00:04:37.720> the<00:04:37.840> button<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.140> pressed<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.740> in<00:04:38.950> focus

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
when the button is pressed in in focus

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.880 
when the button is pressed in in focus
mode<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:40.030> spark<00:04:40.360> will<00:04:40.630> provide<00:04:41.020> even<00:04:41.530> greater

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
mode the spark will provide even greater

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.820 
mode the spark will provide even greater
clarity<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.970> detail<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:44.110> focus<00:04:44.530> control

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
clarity and detail the focus control

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.520 
clarity and detail the focus control
feature<00:04:45.280> in<00:04:45.700> acts<00:04:46.150> as<00:04:46.390> a<00:04:46.420> subtle<00:04:46.960> change<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
feature in acts as a subtle change to

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.710 
feature in acts as a subtle change to
the<00:04:47.680> circuitry<00:04:48.250> of<00:04:48.340> your<00:04:48.580> spark<00:04:48.970> microphone

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
the circuitry of your spark microphone

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.840 
the circuitry of your spark microphone
which<00:04:50.440> draws<00:04:50.740> focus<00:04:51.250> to<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.430> heart<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.790> the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
which draws focus to the heart of the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.850 
which draws focus to the heart of the
recorded<00:04:52.360> signal<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.870> mid-range<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:53.590> upper

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
recorded signal the mid-range and upper

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.040 
recorded signal the mid-range and upper
frequencies<00:04:54.490> let's<00:04:55.330> have<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.480> listen<00:04:55.690> to<00:04:55.840> that

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
frequencies let's have a listen to that

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.580 
frequencies let's have a listen to that
now<00:04:57.240> so<00:04:58.240> now<00:04:58.390> what<00:04:58.630> we're<00:04:58.780> hearing<00:04:59.020> is<00:04:59.260> the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
now so now what we're hearing is the

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.850 
now so now what we're hearing is the
blue<00:04:59.770> microphone<00:05:00.430> spark<00:05:00.910> in<00:05:01.210> focus<00:05:01.780> mode<00:05:01.860> this

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
blue microphone spark in focus mode this

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.770 
blue microphone spark in focus mode this
should<00:05:03.070> have<00:05:03.160> enhanced<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.820> mid-range<00:05:04.390> and

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
should have enhanced the mid-range and

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.110 
should have enhanced the mid-range and
the<00:05:04.960> high-end<00:05:05.410> frequencies<00:05:06.070> in<00:05:06.250> my<00:05:06.490> voice<00:05:06.730> and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
the high-end frequencies in my voice and

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.230 
the high-end frequencies in my voice and
give<00:05:07.660> you<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.840> much<00:05:08.140> greater<00:05:08.590> range<00:05:09.100> during<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
give you a much greater range during the

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.600 
give you a much greater range during the
vocal<00:05:10.630> reproduction<00:05:11.410> I<00:05:11.590> think<00:05:12.520> this

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
vocal reproduction I think this

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.090 
vocal reproduction I think this
microphone<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.450> a<00:05:13.660> great<00:05:14.200> performer<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:15.040> I've

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
microphone is a great performer and I've

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.470 
microphone is a great performer and I've
been<00:05:15.220> very<00:05:15.280> pleased<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.120> how<00:05:16.210> it's<00:05:16.360> been

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
been very pleased with how it's been

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.010 
been very pleased with how it's been
performing<00:05:16.990> so<00:05:17.260> far<00:05:18.330> so<00:05:19.330> now<00:05:19.690> you've<00:05:19.870> heard

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
performing so far so now you've heard

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.200 
performing so far so now you've heard
both<00:05:20.290> modes<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:21.250> really<00:05:21.700> is<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:21.910> great

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
both modes it really is a great

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.450 
both modes it really is a great
microphone<00:05:22.930> it's<00:05:23.140> beautifully<00:05:23.830> presented<00:05:24.130> in

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
microphone it's beautifully presented in

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.340 
microphone it's beautifully presented in
that<00:05:24.640> wooden<00:05:24.910> box<00:05:25.150> and<00:05:25.840> when<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:25.990> was<00:05:26.140> looking

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
that wooden box and when I was looking

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.990 
that wooden box and when I was looking
at<00:05:26.470> pricing<00:05:27.070> which<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.460> can<00:05:27.580> see<00:05:27.610> on<00:05:27.790> your

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
at pricing which you can see on your

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.750 
at pricing which you can see on your
screen<00:05:28.150> now<00:05:28.630> roughly<00:05:29.080> about<00:05:29.290> here<00:05:29.800> I<00:05:29.980> was

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
screen now roughly about here I was

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.640 
screen now roughly about here I was
really<00:05:31.150> amazed<00:05:31.450> at<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.750> price<00:05:31.990> of<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.470> blue

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
really amazed at the price of the blue

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.040 
really amazed at the price of the blue
microphone<00:05:33.220> spark<00:05:33.640> I<00:05:33.910> certainly<00:05:34.510> think<00:05:34.870> it

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
microphone spark I certainly think it

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.550 
microphone spark I certainly think it
outperforms<00:05:35.920> its<00:05:36.070> asking<00:05:36.610> price<00:05:37.200> so<00:05:38.200> thanks

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
outperforms its asking price so thanks
