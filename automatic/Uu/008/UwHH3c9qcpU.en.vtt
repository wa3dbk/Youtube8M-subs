00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hey guys my name is Matteo and today I'm

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.390 
hey guys my name is Matteo and today I'm
a<00:00:03.060> little<00:00:03.659> frustrated<00:00:04.290> many<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.279> guys

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
a little frustrated many of you guys

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.579 
a little frustrated many of you guys
know<00:00:05.640> that<00:00:05.670> I<00:00:05.970> love<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.839> straw<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.350> the

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
know that I love the straw in the

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.080 
know that I love the straw in the
battlefield<00:00:08.040> for<00:00:08.340> I've<00:00:08.519> loved<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.849> since<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
battlefield for I've loved it since the

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.549 
battlefield for I've loved it since the
very<00:00:09.269> beginning<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.809> games<00:00:10.019> released

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
very beginning of the games released

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.110 
very beginning of the games released
it's<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> reason<00:00:11.250> why<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.460> engineer<00:00:11.969> class

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
it's the reason why the engineer class

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480 
it's the reason why the engineer class
is<00:00:12.420> my<00:00:12.599> favorite<00:00:13.170> kit<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> game<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
is my favorite kit in the game and it

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.820 
is my favorite kit in the game and it
all<00:00:14.639> comes<00:00:14.969> down<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.630> rocket<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.590> was

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
all comes down to that one rocket it was

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.429 
all comes down to that one rocket it was
challenging<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:17.910> satisfying<00:00:18.570> but<00:00:19.289> ever

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
challenging it was satisfying but ever

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.590 
challenging it was satisfying but ever
since<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.160> most<00:00:20.340> recent<00:00:20.789> update<00:00:21.090> as<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.449> sure

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
since the most recent update as I'm sure

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.019 
since the most recent update as I'm sure
all<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> guys<00:00:22.050> are<00:00:22.260> aware<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:23.340> patch<00:00:23.609> has

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
all of you guys are aware the patch has

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.720 
all of you guys are aware the patch has
put<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.359> wrench<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.320> enjoyment<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.130> told

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
put a wrench into that enjoyment I told

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.339 
put a wrench into that enjoyment I told
myself<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.449> when<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.660> patch<00:00:27.900> went<00:00:28.140> live

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
myself that when that patch went live

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.200 
myself that when that patch went live
that<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.980> gonna<00:00:29.099> stick<00:00:29.460> through<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.000> was

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that I was gonna stick through it I was

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.640 
that I was gonna stick through it I was
gonna<00:00:30.300> grit<00:00:30.630> my<00:00:30.779> teeth<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.199> was<00:00:31.320> gonna<00:00:31.439> learn

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
gonna grit my teeth I was gonna learn

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.680 
gonna grit my teeth I was gonna learn
the<00:00:31.859> mechanics<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.090> gonna<00:00:33.210> be<00:00:33.360> able<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the mechanics and I was gonna be able to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.569 
the mechanics and I was gonna be able to
use<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> maybe<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> same<00:00:34.980> standards

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
use it maybe not to the same standards

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
use it maybe not to the same standards
that<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.760> could<00:00:36.059> before<00:00:36.420> because<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.290> just

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
that I could before because well it just

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.360 
that I could before because well it just
doesn't<00:00:37.530> have<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.890> same<00:00:38.160> capability

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
doesn't have that same capability

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
doesn't have that same capability
anymore<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.020> gonna<00:00:40.140> read<00:00:40.379> learn<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
anymore but I was gonna read learn it

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.229 
anymore but I was gonna read learn it
and<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.040> was<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.670> start<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> use<00:00:42.120> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and I was going to start to use this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
and I was going to start to use this
once<00:00:42.600> again<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.469> primary<00:00:43.860> rocket<00:00:44.489> of

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
once again as my primary rocket of

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
once again as my primary rocket of
choice<00:00:45.350> sadly<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.440> this<00:00:46.530> route<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.980> really

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
choice sadly in this route this really

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.010 
choice sadly in this route this really
hurts<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.329> guys<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.690> how<00:00:48.870> much

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
hurts me because you guys know how much

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840 
hurts me because you guys know how much
I<00:00:49.140> love<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:50.070> come<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
I love this thing I've come to the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.689 
I love this thing I've come to the
conclusion<00:00:50.879> after<00:00:51.629> hours<00:00:52.559> tens<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.280> hours<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
conclusion after hours tens of hours of

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.430 
conclusion after hours tens of hours of
playing<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.539> new<00:00:54.629> mechanics<00:00:55.140> playing

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
playing with the new mechanics playing

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
playing with the new mechanics playing
with<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.620> new<00:00:55.770> straw<00:00:56.070> I've<00:00:56.550> come<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
with a new straw I've come to the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.900 
with a new straw I've come to the
conclusion<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:58.260> thing<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.309> sucks

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
conclusion that this thing now sucks

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.790 
conclusion that this thing now sucks
when<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> compare<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> small<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
when you compare it to the small and the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.549 
when you compare it to the small and the
RPG<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.670> under<00:01:02.969> performs<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.690> almost<00:01:04.019> every

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
RPG it under performs in almost every

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.859 
RPG it under performs in almost every
situation<00:01:04.939> basically<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.360> dice<00:01:06.510> has<00:01:06.689> done

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
situation basically what dice has done

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.630 
situation basically what dice has done
in<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.049> raw<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.650> before<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.130> patch<00:01:08.340> it

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
in this raw is that before the patch it

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.550 
in this raw is that before the patch it
was<00:01:08.909> at<00:01:09.060> least<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.420> decent<00:01:09.630> way<00:01:09.990> at<00:01:10.170> taking<00:01:10.380> out

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
was at least a decent way at taking out

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
was at least a decent way at taking out
helicopters<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.939> its<00:01:12.150> main<00:01:12.299> draw<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
helicopters that was its main draw you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.570 
helicopters that was its main draw you
could<00:01:13.290> take<00:01:13.439> out<00:01:13.590> tanks<00:01:14.040> but<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.490> at

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
could take out tanks but you would be at

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
could take out tanks but you would be at
a<00:01:14.610> disadvantage<00:01:14.820> because<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> stand

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
a disadvantage because you had to stand

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
a disadvantage because you had to stand
out<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> open<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.310> was<00:01:17.460> still<00:01:17.700> decent<00:01:18.119> at

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
out in the open it was still decent at

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.420 
out in the open it was still decent at
that<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.110> its<00:01:19.350> main<00:01:19.530> draw<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
that but really its main draw was to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
that but really its main draw was to
snipe<00:01:20.610> helicopters<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.390> sky<00:01:21.570> if<00:01:21.840> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
snipe helicopters out of the sky if you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.899 
snipe helicopters out of the sky if you
were<00:01:22.380> skillful<00:01:22.799> enough<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.189> was<00:01:23.400> possible

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
were skillful enough it was possible

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.370 
were skillful enough it was possible
what<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.479> still<00:01:24.720> incredibly

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
what but it was still incredibly

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
what but it was still incredibly
challenging<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.610> really<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> main

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
challenging and that was really the main

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.090 
challenging and that was really the main
reason<00:01:27.090> why<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.810> satisfying<00:01:28.200> but

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
reason why it was so satisfying but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
reason why it was so satisfying but
because<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.610> most<00:01:29.790> recent<00:01:29.880> update<00:01:30.240> they

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because of this most recent update they

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
because of this most recent update they
went<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.140> nerfed<00:01:31.470> its<00:01:31.740> turn<00:01:32.040> radius<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
went in and nerfed its turn radius I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060 
went in and nerfed its turn radius I
would<00:01:33.270> argue<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.049> raw<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.650> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
would argue that this raw is now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
would argue that this raw is now
inferior<00:01:36.060> at<00:01:36.270> taking<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> helicopters

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
inferior at taking out helicopters

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
inferior at taking out helicopters
compared<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> SMAW<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.790> am<00:01:39.329> terrible<00:01:39.990> with

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
compared to the SMAW I am terrible with

the SMAW I literally just started using

the SMAW I literally just started using
it<00:01:42.150> yesterday<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.079> hundreds<00:01:43.649> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it yesterday I don't have hundreds of

it yesterday I don't have hundreds of

have and I'm still able to snipe

helicopters<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.450> sky<00:01:48.630> because<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.470> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
helicopters at the sky because of that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.350 
helicopters at the sky because of that
faster<00:01:49.890> travel<00:01:50.250> speed<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.939> had<00:01:51.090> more<00:01:51.299> time

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
faster travel speed if I had more time

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
faster travel speed if I had more time
and<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> same<00:01:52.560> type<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> dedication

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and I had the same type of dedication

and I had the same type of dedication
that<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> put<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> small<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> RPG<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
that I put to the small with the RPG I

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.929 
that I put to the small with the RPG I
could<00:01:56.040> probably<00:01:56.250> pull<00:01:56.490> off<00:01:56.640> even<00:01:56.909> more

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
could probably pull off even more

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.270 
could probably pull off even more
impressive<00:01:57.899> Snipes<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.409> these<00:01:58.860> helicopters

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
impressive Snipes on these helicopters

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.639 
impressive Snipes on these helicopters
but<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> main<00:02:00.299> reason<00:02:00.750> why<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:00.899> small<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.469> my

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
but the main reason why this small in my

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.130 
but the main reason why this small in my
opinion<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.460> hell<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:03.329> better<00:02:03.479> then

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
opinion is a hell of a lot better then

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.260 
opinion is a hell of a lot better then
the<00:02:04.469> straw<00:02:04.770> at<00:02:05.009> taking<00:02:05.189> out<00:02:05.310> helicopters<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the straw at taking out helicopters is

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.749 
the straw at taking out helicopters is
simply<00:02:06.689> because<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.320> travels<00:02:07.799> significantly

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
simply because it travels significantly

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.669 
simply because it travels significantly
faster<00:02:09.000> through<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.450> air<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.259> reason<00:02:10.590> why

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
faster through the air the reason why

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.710 
faster through the air the reason why
the<00:02:10.739> straw<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.550> difficult<00:02:11.940> right<00:02:12.030> now

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the straw is so difficult right now

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.810 
the straw is so difficult right now
is<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.020> yes<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.350> can<00:02:13.680> maneuver<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.670> the

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
is that yes you can maneuver it in the

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.060 
is that yes you can maneuver it in the
sky<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.690> because<00:02:16.020> helicopters<00:02:16.620> move<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
sky but because helicopters move so

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.980 
sky but because helicopters move so
quickly<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.670> soon<00:02:18.030> as<00:02:18.150> they<00:02:18.240> do<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> stray<00:02:18.690> front

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
quickly as soon as they do a stray front

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.520 
quickly as soon as they do a stray front
on<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
on you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.200 
on you
you<00:02:19.740> can<00:02:19.920> fire<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.640> you're<00:02:20.730> gonna<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
you can fire but you're gonna have to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.240 
you can fire but you're gonna have to
have<00:02:21.360> some<00:02:21.660> divine<00:02:22.080> intervention<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:23.010> figure

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
have some divine intervention to figure

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.620 
have some divine intervention to figure
out<00:02:23.400> where<00:02:23.640> they're<00:02:23.850> gonna<00:02:24.030> be<00:02:24.240> when<00:02:24.480> your

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
out where they're gonna be when your

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660 
out where they're gonna be when your
straw<00:02:24.900> finally<00:02:25.500> reaches<00:02:25.830> its<00:02:25.980> destination

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
straw finally reaches its destination

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.610 
straw finally reaches its destination
because<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.480> don't<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.960> on<00:02:28.170> missions

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
because if you don't have on missions

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.230 
because if you don't have on missions
and<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.830> can't<00:02:29.130> make<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.580> ridiculous

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
and you can't make that ridiculous

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.240 
and you can't make that ridiculous
prediction<00:02:30.750> there<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.350> no<00:02:31.650> way<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:31.980> you're

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
prediction there is no way that you're

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
prediction there is no way that you're
gonna<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.490> able<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.730> get<00:02:32.850> that<00:02:33.060> kill<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.990> well

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
gonna be able to get that kill and well

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.960 
gonna be able to get that kill and well
I'm<00:02:34.320> not<00:02:34.350> saying<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.250> a<00:02:35.340> cakewalk<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
I'm not saying that it's a cakewalk to

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.880 
I'm not saying that it's a cakewalk to
snipe<00:02:36.480> something<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> small<00:02:37.650> like

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
snipe something with the small like

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
snipe something with the small like
don't<00:02:38.070> get<00:02:38.190> me<00:02:38.340> wrong<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:38.760> still

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
don't get me wrong it's still

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.940 
don't get me wrong it's still
challenging<00:02:39.690> it's<00:02:39.840> still<00:02:40.020> very<00:02:40.170> satisfying

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
challenging it's still very satisfying

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.700 
challenging it's still very satisfying
but<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.670> felt<00:02:41.940> significantly<00:02:42.780> easier<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.500> drop

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
but it felt significantly easier to drop

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.620 
but it felt significantly easier to drop
those<00:02:43.980> targets<00:02:44.580> when<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.000> was<00:02:45.300> using<00:02:45.510> that

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
those targets when I was using that

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.960 
those targets when I was using that
rocket<00:02:46.050> compared<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> straw<00:02:47.040> another

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
rocket compared to the straw another

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.340 
rocket compared to the straw another
thing<00:02:48.180> that's<00:02:48.300> been<00:02:48.420> irritating<00:02:48.990> me<00:02:49.080> about

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
thing that's been irritating me about

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.199 
thing that's been irritating me about
this<00:02:49.500> raw<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> main<00:02:50.400> reasons<00:02:50.910> why

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
this raw and one of the main reasons why

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.850 
this raw and one of the main reasons why
I've<00:02:51.540> been<00:02:51.660> making<00:02:51.990> this<00:02:52.080> transition<00:02:52.380> over

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
I've been making this transition over

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.890 
I've been making this transition over
the<00:02:52.950> last<00:02:53.070> couple<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.459> days<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.780> is

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
the last couple of days is that it is

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.230 
the last couple of days is that it is
awful<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.680> tank<00:02:55.980> combat<00:02:56.220> when<00:02:57.000> you're<00:02:57.120> using

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
awful in tank combat when you're using

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.940 
awful in tank combat when you're using
the<00:02:57.420> RPG<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.050> small<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.770> best

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the RPG and the small one of the best

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.530 
the RPG and the small one of the best
benefits<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.550> that<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.760> that<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.209> you<00:03:00.330> see<00:03:00.510> a

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
benefits of that is that if you see a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.360 
benefits of that is that if you see a
tank<00:03:00.900> coming<00:03:01.230> on<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.830> this<00:03:01.980> is<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> main

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
tank coming on in and this is the main

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.680 
tank coming on in and this is the main
reason<00:03:02.580> why<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:02.910> would<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.330> use<00:03:03.510> these

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
reason why you would want to use these

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.080 
reason why you would want to use these
Rockets<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.709> see<00:03:04.890> them<00:03:05.040> roll<00:03:05.250> on<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.820> fire

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
Rockets you see them roll on in you fire

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.430 
Rockets you see them roll on in you fire
your<00:03:06.270> rock<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.690> they<00:03:06.780> jump<00:03:06.959> behind<00:03:07.050> cover

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
your rock and they jump behind cover

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.650 
your rock and they jump behind cover
because<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.430> dynamic<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:09.120> allows<00:03:09.300> you<00:03:09.540> to

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
because of this dynamic it allows you to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.449 
because of this dynamic it allows you to
get<00:03:09.810> another<00:03:10.050> rocket<00:03:10.590> really<00:03:11.100> quickly

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
get another rocket really quickly

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.820 
get another rocket really quickly
reloaded<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.480> also<00:03:12.600> keeps<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.260> concealed

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
reloaded but it also keeps you concealed

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.620 
reloaded but it also keeps you concealed
and<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.340> only<00:03:14.490> keeps<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.000> protected<00:03:15.150> because

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and not only keeps you protected because

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.300 
and not only keeps you protected because
you're<00:03:15.870> behind<00:03:15.959> cover<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.800> it<00:03:16.860> also<00:03:16.950> makes<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you're behind cover but it also makes it

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.460 
you're behind cover but it also makes it
very<00:03:17.370> challenging<00:03:17.580> for<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.690> tank<00:03:18.930> driver<00:03:19.200> to

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
very challenging for the tank driver to

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.410 
very challenging for the tank driver to
know<00:03:19.620> exactly<00:03:20.040> where<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.459> are<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:21.150> can<00:03:21.330> get

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
know exactly where you are you can get

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.390 
know exactly where you are you can get
two<00:03:21.690> or<00:03:21.810> three<00:03:21.840> shots<00:03:22.380> off<00:03:22.680> before<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:23.190> tank

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
two or three shots off before the tank

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.190 
two or three shots off before the tank
even<00:03:23.640> realizes<00:03:24.300> exactly<00:03:24.450> where<00:03:25.050> you're

even realizes exactly where you're

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
located and that gives you a huge

because it is wire-guided I will admit

that is one of the nice benefits of a

that is one of the nice benefits of a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
straw at least in tank combat but as

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.979 
straw at least in tank combat but as
soon<00:03:38.760> as<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:38.970> go<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.330> second<00:03:39.750> shot

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
soon as you go for that second shot

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.509 
soon as you go for that second shot

because you have to be out in the open
for<00:03:41.549> a<00:03:41.700> significant<00:03:42.209> amount<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.510> time<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.080> line

you've<00:03:50.730> used<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.209> straw<00:03:51.420> since<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.780> very

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
you've used a straw since the very

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:53.660 
you've used a straw since the very
beginning<00:03:52.110> you<00:03:52.560> should<00:03:52.860> know<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.310> as<00:03:53.459> long

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
beginning you should know that as long

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.789 
beginning you should know that as long
as<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.209> your<00:03:54.480> crosshair<00:03:55.049> over<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.530> tank

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
as you have your crosshair over the tank

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.940 
as you have your crosshair over the tank
and<00:03:56.100> if<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.610> start<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.030> reload<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:58.080> rocket<00:03:58.830> is

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
and if you start to reload the rocket is

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.500 
and if you start to reload the rocket is
still<00:03:59.100> gonna<00:03:59.280> fly<00:03:59.549> towards<00:03:59.970> its<00:04:00.120> destination

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
still gonna fly towards its destination

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.660 
still gonna fly towards its destination
and<00:04:00.900> land<00:04:01.320> exactly<00:04:01.530> where<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.160> were<00:04:02.250> pointing

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
and land exactly where you were pointing

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.640 
and land exactly where you were pointing
and<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:03.120> would<00:04:03.299> be<00:04:03.450> right<00:04:03.660> but<00:04:04.170> as<00:04:04.260> soon<00:04:04.470> as

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
and you would be right but as soon as

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.229 
and you would be right but as soon as
the<00:04:04.799> tank<00:04:05.040> realizes<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.730> you're<00:04:05.880> there<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the tank realizes that you're there and

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.940 
the tank realizes that you're there and
you're<00:04:06.330> going<00:04:06.450> against<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.840> competent<00:04:07.380> tank

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
you're going against a competent tank

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.190 
you're going against a competent tank
driver<00:04:08.280> they're<00:04:09.180> gonna<00:04:09.330> make<00:04:09.660> themselves<00:04:10.140> a

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
driver they're gonna make themselves a

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.720 
driver they're gonna make themselves a
harder<00:04:10.500> target<00:04:10.709> they're<00:04:11.040> gonna<00:04:11.160> start<00:04:11.489> moving

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
harder target they're gonna start moving

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.699 
harder target they're gonna start moving
around<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.450> because<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.110> slower<00:04:13.410> travel

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
around and because of that slower travel

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.009 
around and because of that slower travel
speed<00:04:14.010> of<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.400> straw<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.940> basically<00:04:15.570> ensures

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
speed of the straw it basically ensures

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.690 
speed of the straw it basically ensures
that<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.530> either<00:04:16.650> need<00:04:16.919> to<00:04:16.950> have<00:04:17.040> awesome

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
that you either need to have awesome

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.099 
that you either need to have awesome
prediction<00:04:18.180> skills<00:04:18.450> like<00:04:18.660> I<00:04:18.780> mentioned

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
prediction skills like I mentioned

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.140 
prediction skills like I mentioned
before<00:04:19.140> or<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.310> need<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.549> sit<00:04:20.880> out<00:04:21.030> in<00:04:21.060> the

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
before or you need to sit out in the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.730 
before or you need to sit out in the
open<00:04:21.419> for<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.599> little<00:04:21.780> bit<00:04:21.870> longer<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.320> ensure

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
open for a little bit longer to ensure

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.110 
open for a little bit longer to ensure
that<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.130> rocket<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.550> gonna<00:04:23.729> reach<00:04:23.910> its

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
that the rocket is gonna reach its

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.400 
that the rocket is gonna reach its
destination<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:25.470> little<00:04:26.130> bit<00:04:26.220> of

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
destination that little bit of

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.320

pointing I learned of this just
yesterday<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:46.180> feel<00:04:46.480> like<00:04:46.660> an<00:04:46.780> idiot<00:04:46.930> because

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
yesterday I feel like an idiot because

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:48.780 
yesterday I feel like an idiot because
I've<00:04:47.530> been<00:04:47.650> using<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.010> straw<00:04:48.220> since<00:04:48.490> the<00:04:48.580> very

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
I've been using the straw since the very

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.490 
I've been using the straw since the very
beginning<00:04:48.910> but<00:04:49.360> apparently<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:49.900> followers

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
beginning but apparently my followers

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.810 
beginning but apparently my followers
said<00:04:50.710> that<00:04:50.830> this<00:04:50.920> is<00:04:51.040> a<00:04:51.130> mechanic<00:04:51.550> that's<00:04:51.640> been

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
said that this is a mechanic that's been

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.790 
said that this is a mechanic that's been
in<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.030> game<00:04:52.210> since<00:04:52.420> the<00:04:52.510> very<00:04:52.720> beginning<00:04:53.230> but

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
in the game since the very beginning but

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.070 
in the game since the very beginning but
as<00:04:53.950> soon<00:04:54.220> as<00:04:54.580> you're<00:04:55.030> no<00:04:55.240> longer<00:04:55.510> aiming<00:04:55.930> down

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
as soon as you're no longer aiming down

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.530 
as soon as you're no longer aiming down
sight<00:04:56.440> your<00:04:57.010> rocket<00:04:57.490> will<00:04:57.640> actually<00:04:58.180> kind<00:04:58.450> of

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
sight your rocket will actually kind of

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.840 
sight your rocket will actually kind of
go<00:04:58.630> up<00:04:58.870> a<00:04:58.990> little<00:04:59.140> bit<00:04:59.440> to<00:04:59.920> give<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:00.340> very

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
go up a little bit to give you a very

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.270 
go up a little bit to give you a very
clear<00:05:01.180> example<00:05:01.420> I'm<00:05:02.050> looking<00:05:02.260> at<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.010> ledge

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
clear example I'm looking at this ledge

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.220 
clear example I'm looking at this ledge
here<00:05:03.310> I<00:05:03.820> fire<00:05:04.150> right<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.510> should<00:05:04.840> hit<00:05:05.020> directly

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
here I fire right it should hit directly

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.190 
here I fire right it should hit directly
at<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.950> top<00:05:06.160> event<00:05:06.460> but<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.000> sails<00:05:07.330> right<00:05:07.660> on

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
at the top event but it sails right on

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.160 
at the top event but it sails right on
over<00:05:08.490> like<00:05:09.490> I<00:05:09.670> said<00:05:09.940> this<00:05:10.150> was<00:05:10.390> news<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.690> me<00:05:11.080> I

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
over like I said this was news to me I

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.020 
over like I said this was news to me I
mean<00:05:11.320> people<00:05:11.650> claimed<00:05:12.160> that<00:05:12.490> this<00:05:12.640> was<00:05:12.820> since

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
mean people claimed that this was since

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.010 
mean people claimed that this was since
the<00:05:13.120> very<00:05:13.300> beginning<00:05:13.450> and<00:05:13.780> they'll<00:05:13.870> take

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
the very beginning and they'll take

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.690 
the very beginning and they'll take
their<00:05:14.170> word<00:05:14.380> on<00:05:14.530> it<00:05:14.770> but<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.190> distinctly

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:15.700 
their word on it but I distinctly

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.550 
their word on it but I distinctly
remember<00:05:16.000> maybe<00:05:16.450> my<00:05:16.660> memory<00:05:16.930> is<00:05:17.050> just<00:05:17.110> fuzzy

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
remember maybe my memory is just fuzzy

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.740 
remember maybe my memory is just fuzzy
that<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.220> had<00:05:18.580> multiple<00:05:19.090> occasions<00:05:19.540> where<00:05:19.720> I

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
that I had multiple occasions where I

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.320 
that I had multiple occasions where I
would<00:05:20.110> be<00:05:20.320> going<00:05:20.710> after<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.280> sniping<00:05:21.760> recon<00:05:22.180> who

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
would be going after a sniping recon who

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.000 
would be going after a sniping recon who
was<00:05:22.480> just<00:05:22.630> camping<00:05:22.990> off<00:05:23.140> in<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.350> distance<00:05:23.530> I

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
was just camping off in the distance I

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.010 
was just camping off in the distance I
would<00:05:24.340> fire<00:05:24.610> the<00:05:24.820> rocket<00:05:25.240> start<00:05:25.570> the<00:05:25.720> reload

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
would fire the rocket start the reload

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.230 
would fire the rocket start the reload
process<00:05:26.160> knowing<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.760> rocket<00:05:28.120> would

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
process knowing that the rocket would

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.120 
process knowing that the rocket would
hit<00:05:28.360> exactly<00:05:28.510> where<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:29.110> was<00:05:29.350> aiming<00:05:29.530> and<00:05:29.950> of

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
hit exactly where I was aiming and of

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.440 
hit exactly where I was aiming and of
course<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.520> kill<00:05:30.700> would<00:05:30.850> happen<00:05:31.150> like<00:05:31.240> two

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
course the kill would happen like two

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.660 
course the kill would happen like two
seconds<00:05:31.870> later<00:05:32.140> maybe<00:05:32.860> my<00:05:33.190> memory<00:05:33.490> is

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
seconds later maybe my memory is

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.370 
seconds later maybe my memory is
terrible<00:05:33.910> and<00:05:34.210> I<00:05:34.270> have<00:05:34.360> absolutely<00:05:35.020> no<00:05:35.260> idea

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
terrible and I have absolutely no idea

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.510 
terrible and I have absolutely no idea
what<00:05:35.650> I'm<00:05:35.740> talking<00:05:36.070> about

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
what I'm talking about

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.950 
what I'm talking about
but<00:05:36.730> this<00:05:36.850> is<00:05:36.970> just<00:05:37.120> further<00:05:37.300> evidence<00:05:37.450> that

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
but this is just further evidence that

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.570 
but this is just further evidence that
you<00:05:38.050> have<00:05:38.080> to<00:05:38.470> stay<00:05:38.650> out<00:05:38.860> in<00:05:38.980> the<00:05:39.040> open<00:05:39.100> longer

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
you have to stay out in the open longer

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.000 
you have to stay out in the open longer
ensuring<00:05:40.570> that<00:05:40.600> your<00:05:40.930> rocket<00:05:41.320> is<00:05:41.470> gonna<00:05:41.740> slam

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
ensuring that your rocket is gonna slam

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.800 
ensuring that your rocket is gonna slam
into<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.340> side<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.760> tank<00:05:43.000> and<00:05:43.210> so<00:05:43.660> it's

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
into the side of the tank and so it's

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.290 
into the side of the tank and so it's
because<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.230> these<00:05:44.350> two<00:05:44.650> reasons<00:05:45.160> why<00:05:45.940> I've

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
because of these two reasons why I've

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.690 
because of these two reasons why I've
been<00:05:46.510> more<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.350> more<00:05:47.560> frustrated<00:05:48.190> when<00:05:48.430> I<00:05:48.460> am

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
been more and more frustrated when I am

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.060 
been more and more frustrated when I am
using<00:05:49.120> this<00:05:49.210> weapon<00:05:49.390> on<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.840> battlefield

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
using this weapon on the battlefield

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.010 
using this weapon on the battlefield
sure<00:05:51.070> does<00:05:51.340> have<00:05:51.520> its<00:05:51.700> moments<00:05:51.790> yes<00:05:52.600> it<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:52.900> the

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
sure does have its moments yes it is the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.230 
sure does have its moments yes it is the
best<00:05:53.260> at<00:05:53.470> sniping<00:05:53.680> things<00:05:54.100> at<00:05:54.370> long-range<00:05:54.669> and

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
best at sniping things at long-range and

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.120 
best at sniping things at long-range and
every<00:05:55.660> once<00:05:55.930> in<00:05:56.080> a<00:05:56.169> while<00:05:56.410> once<00:05:56.800> in<00:05:56.950> a<00:05:57.010> blue

moon you can snipe a helicopter at the

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:01.290 
moon you can snipe a helicopter at the
sky<00:05:59.380> it's<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.160> reason<00:06:00.550> why<00:06:00.760> when<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.180> guys

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
sky it's the reason why when you guys

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.540 
sky it's the reason why when you guys
see<00:06:01.510> my<00:06:01.660> stream<00:06:01.960> highlights<00:06:02.410> that<00:06:02.860> I<00:06:02.919> freaked

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
see my stream highlights that I freaked

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.610 
see my stream highlights that I freaked
out<00:06:03.760> it's<00:06:04.180> because<00:06:04.360> it's<00:06:04.750> that<00:06:04.990> challenging

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
out it's because it's that challenging

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.460 
out it's because it's that challenging
it<00:06:05.770> happens<00:06:06.160> so<00:06:06.730> infrequently<00:06:06.940> now<00:06:07.660> that<00:06:08.290> when

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
it happens so infrequently now that when

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.230 
it happens so infrequently now that when
it<00:06:08.590> does<00:06:08.710> happen<00:06:08.770> you<00:06:09.310> have<00:06:09.460> to<00:06:09.520> screech<00:06:09.970> like

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
it does happen you have to screech like

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.700 
it does happen you have to screech like
a<00:06:10.270> little<00:06:10.510> schoolgirl<00:06:10.780> it's<00:06:11.110> that<00:06:11.470> incredible

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
a little schoolgirl it's that incredible

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.890 
a little schoolgirl it's that incredible
but<00:06:12.580> as<00:06:12.669> soon<00:06:12.820> as<00:06:12.940> I<00:06:13.060> started<00:06:13.300> to<00:06:13.390> transition

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
but as soon as I started to transition

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.230 
but as soon as I started to transition
on<00:06:14.050> over<00:06:14.290> to<00:06:14.500> the<00:06:14.830> small<00:06:15.160> it<00:06:15.550> really<00:06:16.000> didn't

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
on over to the small it really didn't

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.110 
on over to the small it really didn't
feel<00:06:16.360> like<00:06:16.570> I<00:06:16.780> was<00:06:16.960> using<00:06:17.260> a<00:06:17.640> superior<00:06:18.640> weapon

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
feel like I was using a superior weapon

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.690 
feel like I was using a superior weapon
not<00:06:19.840> only<00:06:20.140> because<00:06:20.440> it<00:06:20.590> felt<00:06:20.860> way<00:06:21.190> better<00:06:21.490> at

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
not only because it felt way better at

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.250 
not only because it felt way better at
taking<00:06:21.880> out<00:06:22.120> tanks<00:06:22.390> which<00:06:22.630> is<00:06:22.750> something<00:06:23.110> that

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
taking out tanks which is something that

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.810 
taking out tanks which is something that
you're<00:06:23.650> gonna<00:06:23.710> be<00:06:23.919> fighting<00:06:24.160> a<00:06:24.370> hell<00:06:24.580> of<00:06:24.610> a<00:06:24.700> lot

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
you're gonna be fighting a hell of a lot

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.150 
you're gonna be fighting a hell of a lot
more<00:06:24.850> than<00:06:25.330> aircrafts<00:06:25.900> but<00:06:26.140> when<00:06:26.620> that<00:06:26.919> Scout

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
more than aircrafts but when that Scout

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.190 
more than aircrafts but when that Scout
helicopter<00:06:27.700> did<00:06:27.910> make<00:06:28.120> that<00:06:28.270> strafing<00:06:28.720> run<00:06:28.960> I

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
helicopter did make that strafing run I

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.290 
helicopter did make that strafing run I
felt<00:06:29.680> way<00:06:29.860> more<00:06:29.890> confident<00:06:30.610> dropping<00:06:31.090> it<00:06:31.180> with

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
felt way more confident dropping it with

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.240 
felt way more confident dropping it with
the<00:06:31.390> small<00:06:31.690> compared<00:06:32.410> to<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.770> sraw<00:06:33.040> which

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
the small compared to the sraw which

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.800 
the small compared to the sraw which
I've<00:06:33.400> used<00:06:33.430> since<00:06:33.880> the<00:06:33.970> very<00:06:34.150> beginning<00:06:34.300> it<00:06:34.690> is

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:34.810 
I've used since the very beginning it is

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:35.850 
I've used since the very beginning it is
something<00:06:34.990> that<00:06:35.110> I<00:06:35.229> just<00:06:35.289> picked<00:06:35.620> up<00:06:35.680> the

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
something that I just picked up the

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.469 
something that I just picked up the
other<00:06:36.010> the<00:06:36.190> other<00:06:36.310> day<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.789> I<00:06:37.030> think<00:06:37.090> that

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:37.479 
other the other day and I think that

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.140 
other the other day and I think that
really<00:06:37.630> speaks

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
really speaks

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.080 
really speaks

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
for how far this raw has fallen in its

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.150 
for how far this raw has fallen in its
power<00:06:42.330> maybe<00:06:43.200> you<00:06:43.440> guys<00:06:43.590> will<00:06:43.770> disagree<00:06:44.040> with

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
power maybe you guys will disagree with

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.920 
power maybe you guys will disagree with
me<00:06:44.280> saying<00:06:44.670> that<00:06:44.790> I<00:06:44.940> suck<00:06:45.330> I'm<00:06:45.570> the<00:06:45.780> worst

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
me saying that I suck I'm the worst

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.360 
me saying that I suck I'm the worst
player<00:06:46.170> ever<00:06:46.260> I<00:06:46.560> have<00:06:46.770> no<00:06:46.950> idea<00:06:47.190> what<00:06:47.280> I'm

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
player ever I have no idea what I'm

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:48.290 
player ever I have no idea what I'm
talking<00:06:47.790> about

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
talking about

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.300 
talking about
but<00:06:48.600> I<00:06:48.630> feel<00:06:48.960> like<00:06:49.110> I<00:06:49.290> gave<00:06:49.350> this<00:06:49.650> a<00:06:49.710> fair<00:06:50.040> shake

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
but I feel like I gave this a fair shake

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.400 
but I feel like I gave this a fair shake
it<00:06:50.550> was<00:06:50.790> like<00:06:51.030> I<00:06:51.180> said<00:06:51.240> at<00:06:51.570> my<00:06:51.660> feet<00:06:51.990> my

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
it was like I said at my feet my

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.560 
it was like I said at my feet my
favorite<00:06:52.860> weapon<00:06:53.160> in<00:06:53.280> the<00:06:53.400> game<00:06:53.520> I<00:06:53.760> love<00:06:54.240> this

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:54.570 
favorite weapon in the game I love this

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:56.690 
favorite weapon in the game I love this
raw<00:06:54.780> before<00:06:54.990> this<00:06:55.290> updates<00:06:55.800> and<00:06:56.040> I<00:06:56.370> think<00:06:56.580> the

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:56.700 
raw before this updates and I think the

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.370 
raw before this updates and I think the
reason<00:06:56.970> why<00:06:57.090> I'm<00:06:57.360> as<00:06:57.510> upset<00:06:57.630> as<00:06:57.840> I<00:06:58.020> am<00:06:58.050> right

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
reason why I'm as upset as I am right

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.350 
reason why I'm as upset as I am right
now<00:06:58.410> is<00:06:58.770> that<00:06:58.980> I<00:06:59.040> have<00:06:59.370> put<00:06:59.670> tens<00:06:59.910> of<00:07:00.090> hours

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
now is that I have put tens of hours

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.870 
now is that I have put tens of hours
into<00:07:00.540> the<00:07:00.690> into<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.140> new<00:07:01.260> mechanics<00:07:01.530> I<00:07:01.890> really

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
into the into the new mechanics I really

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.000 
into the into the new mechanics I really
tried<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.180> make<00:07:03.330> it<00:07:03.630> work<00:07:03.840> but<00:07:04.470> every<00:07:04.740> time<00:07:04.950> I

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
tried to make it work but every time I

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.370 
tried to make it work but every time I
transition<00:07:05.820> on<00:07:05.940> over<00:07:06.150> to<00:07:06.360> using<00:07:06.570> the<00:07:06.810> small<00:07:07.080> it

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.740 
transition on over to using the small it
does<00:07:07.740> feel<00:07:08.010> like<00:07:08.040> I'm<00:07:08.280> just<00:07:08.460> using<00:07:08.790> a<00:07:09.150> superior
