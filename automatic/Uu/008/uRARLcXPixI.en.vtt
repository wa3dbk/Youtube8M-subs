all<00:00:00.269> right<00:00:00.359> so<00:00:00.539> we're<00:00:00.659> doing<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.870> comparison

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:01.290 
all right so we're doing a comparison

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.970 
all right so we're doing a comparison
video<00:00:01.620> between<00:00:02.629> pro2<00:00:03.629> and<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.319> GoPro<00:00:04.680> Hero<00:00:04.710> 3

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
video between pro2 and the GoPro Hero 3

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.519 
video between pro2 and the GoPro Hero 3
silver<00:00:05.520> again<00:00:05.850> it'd<00:00:06.029> be<00:00:06.660> really<00:00:07.020> similar<00:00:07.379> to

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
silver again it'd be really similar to

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.549 
silver again it'd be really similar to
last<00:00:07.770> one<00:00:08.099> what<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> same<00:00:08.760> test<00:00:09.410> starting<00:00:10.410> off

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
last one what a same test starting off

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.129 
last one what a same test starting off
physically<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:12.799> pr2<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.670> lot<00:00:14.910> smaller<00:00:15.240> Hero

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
physically the pr2 is a lot smaller Hero

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:16.490 
physically the pr2 is a lot smaller Hero

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
3

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.900 
3
it's<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.369> battery<00:00:18.830> this<00:00:19.830> way<00:00:20.070> they're<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.730> same

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's a battery this way they're the same

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.990 
it's a battery this way they're the same
but<00:00:21.560> width<00:00:22.560> wise

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
but width wise

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.810 
but width wise
here<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.019> three<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.260> about<00:00:25.380> finish<00:00:26.779> skinnier

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
here are three is about finish skinnier

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.770 
here are three is about finish skinnier
they<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.090> three<00:00:30.359> runs<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:32.390> micro<00:00:33.390> SD

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
they here are three runs with a micro SD

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
they here are three runs with a micro SD
card<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.280> there<00:00:35.460> importing

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
card we don't have it in there importing

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
card we don't have it in there importing
some<00:00:36.329> footage<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.719> now<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.200> they're

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
some footage right now but they're

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.709 
some footage right now but they're
really<00:00:37.890> small<00:00:38.190> it's<00:00:38.610> tiny<00:00:38.910> as<00:00:39.329> compared<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
really small it's tiny as compared to

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.389 
really small it's tiny as compared to
the<00:00:39.870> regular<00:00:39.989> SD<00:00:40.350> card<00:00:40.739> which<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.070> be<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.190> pain

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
the regular SD card which can be a pain

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.639 
the regular SD card which can be a pain
but<00:00:41.790> I<00:00:42.000> guess<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> save<00:00:42.660> space<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.290> mean

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
but I guess it's to save space I mean

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.529 
but I guess it's to save space I mean
other<00:00:43.980> than<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.460> they're<00:00:44.910> pretty<00:00:45.120> similar

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
other than that they're pretty similar

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.060 
other than that they're pretty similar
the<00:00:46.610> mounting<00:00:47.610> brackets<00:00:48.980> there<00:00:49.980> are

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the mounting brackets there are

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.600 
the mounting brackets there are
different<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> different<00:00:51.719> mouth<00:00:52.520> it's<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
different a different mouth it's a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250 
different a different mouth it's a
little<00:00:53.850> bit<00:00:54.000> different<00:00:54.300> basically<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> same

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
little bit different basically the same

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.849 
little bit different basically the same
general<00:00:55.829> idea<00:00:55.920> yeah<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.649> housing

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
general idea yeah and that the housing

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.849 
general idea yeah and that the housing
has<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> flat<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.989> curved<00:01:00.989> ones<00:01:01.230> which<00:01:01.680> is

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
has a flat and curved ones which is

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.139 
has a flat and curved ones which is
supposed<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> provide<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> different<00:01:02.760> picture

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
supposed to provide a different picture

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
supposed to provide a different picture
how<00:01:03.510> you'll<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:03.899> one<00:01:04.470> thing<00:01:04.650> we<00:01:04.769> noticed<00:01:04.920> was

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
how you'll see one thing we noticed was

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.539 
how you'll see one thing we noticed was
the<00:01:05.580> mouth<00:01:06.080> didn't<00:01:07.080> come<00:01:07.320> with<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> long<00:01:08.010> screw

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the mouth didn't come with a long screw

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.020 
the mouth didn't come with a long screw
so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.720> been<00:01:09.900> competing<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.860> get<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.760> real

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so it's been competing to get it real

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.080 
so it's been competing to get it real
tight<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.770> gets<00:01:14.010> stuck<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.640> they

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
tight in here it gets stuck and they

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
tight in here it gets stuck and they
look<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.390> mouth<00:01:15.810> has<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> wrong<00:01:16.860> screw

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
look the other mouth has a wrong screw

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.760 
look the other mouth has a wrong screw
to<00:01:17.880> make<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.210> easier<00:01:18.600> get<00:01:18.930> it<00:01:19.020> tighter<00:01:19.259> at<00:01:19.619> high

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
to make it easier get it tighter at high

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.340 
to make it easier get it tighter at high
speeds<00:01:20.150> yeah<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.360> than<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.659> physically

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
speeds yeah other than that physically

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
speeds yeah other than that physically
there's<00:01:22.799> really<00:01:23.040> many<00:01:23.939> other<00:01:24.150> differences

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
there's really many other differences

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.310 
there's really many other differences
that<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.860> noticed<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:27.090> we're<00:01:27.450> gonna<00:01:27.540> do<00:01:27.780> a

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
that we noticed so we're gonna do a

00:01:28.320 --> 00:03:58.420 
that we noticed so we're gonna do a
couple<00:01:28.680> tests<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:30.470> enjoy<00:01:31.470> thank<00:01:32.220> you
