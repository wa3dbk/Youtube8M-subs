00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.930
 for today's craft we are going to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.789
 need a plastic bottle like 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.340
 this one that is square and if you do not have a 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.470
 square you can use the round and 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.930
 then you can make it square that you already 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.530
 I will teach as stickers or elements 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.600
 decorative with scissors and silicone for 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.059
 start let's take our bottle and 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.059
 we are going to make a small hole 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.830
 and we are going to cut them 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.670
 to this part 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.140
 I dedicate this part we do not need it 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.210
 you can save for another craft that 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.610
 it happens to you and in this case I'm going to 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.380
 need this square part if not 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.750
 you have a bottle is square like this 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.340
 you can take the round and fold it 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.340
 fold it this way 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.590
 until you get something more or less like that 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.140
 but in this case as I already have this 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 I'm going to make use of this to start 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 let's take a piece of paper from 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.450
 same size on one side in 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.480
 our bottle and we're going to write a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.030
 letter or whatever we want to put here in 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.960
 this paper once we have something else 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.290
 or less so 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.290
 let's take it and let's put silicone 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.290
 inside 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.240
 to be able to paste our letters as 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.880
 yes 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.670
 ah 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.150
 thus 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.690
 once we have already introduced in 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:16.780
 our letter we will start to cover 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.940
 out everything we want 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.069
 let's put all the details in 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.890
 this case I will put details above and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.830
 down to but not to cover the load and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.720
 from both sides also once 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.420
 we have something more or less like that I have 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.630
 put a flower are artificial a 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.830
 piece of lace a bow of these that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.460
 we have learned to do here in the channel and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.130
 now we would be closed to take a 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.200
 piece of cardboard I've made up 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.280
 both sides that is more or less the same 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.580
 size than our bottle and we're going to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.400
 Take the same cardboard 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.950
 play in this case I'm going to take the paper 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.810
 corrugated that chosen and we will go 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.450
 hitting the edge to the edge in such a way 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.450
 that we form a cap around the edge 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.820
 As you can see, I have had problems 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.860
 close I have to remove the ornament 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.500
 that I had exposed him but there is no 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.720
 problem because we can put the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.720
 adornment to this part 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.630
 well and now to mat tampa center 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.260
 let's embed 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.250
 a small roll of corrugated paper 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.260
 that we will put to the center 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.030
 especially to be able to open and close the 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:59.350
 and in this way 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.950
 We could close our box without any 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.950
 problem 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.920
 in this way and here we can 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.230
 put sweets is this sweet or any 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.790
 kind of thing and so it would be finished 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.410
 our craft I hope you have 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.610
 liked and see you until the next 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.610
