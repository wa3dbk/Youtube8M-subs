for<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.000> moment<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:07.110> what<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:07.979> means<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.370> that

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
for a moment and what that means is that

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.460 
for a moment and what that means is that
we've<00:06:08.640> brought<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.300> richness<00:06:09.510> of<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:10.050> moment

the entire slide show to the tweet

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:16.580 
the entire slide show to the tweet
itself<00:06:14.630> so<00:06:15.630> it<00:06:15.900> looks<00:06:15.960> like<00:06:16.229> we're<00:06:16.440> not<00:06:16.470> going

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590
