 Ah 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 This is the work done freely Surprisingly they come to an antenna tower 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.050
 I will 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.860
 Used for wireless communications . 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.580
 Since the method of broadcasting communication has changed, about seven days out of about 25 days, 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:45.520
 Antenna 46 Replace this demolition r Renovation 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.520
 The first itinerary begins at Mount Geomdan 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.860
 Being responsible for the dismantling of antenna demolition 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:59.240
 The 7-person antenna tinning work 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.120
 Jeong Soon-yong 's 28 years of career experience 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.510
 Kim Mun Suk of 18 years of experience

 17 years to be flotation join new career 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.720
 All the veterans are all in the antenna work. 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:18.349
 There are a lot of chanties dedicated to the work of iron-perm lace. 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:21.230
 Park, Won-Soon of Su Yeon 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:26.500
 It consists of Park Jong-sung, who has five years of experience. 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.500
 Everyone is a skilled person who has been waiting for a long time . 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.590
 Preparations are under way to demolish the antenna 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.660
 Oh , you gotta give me four. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:45.260
 Oh, Donna, Donna, what happened at the moment? 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:48.319
 Tie the antenna to the rope. Remove the attachments that fastened the antenna to the tower. 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.269
 Taking hundreds of kilograms. 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.269
 Safety is paramount. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.830
 After the preparatory work 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:04.700
 Connected to the antenna recyclable bogong walks balanced Eva to appear 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 The antenna slowly comes down to the ground 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.180
 I'll try. 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.580
 Yes, it is. 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.950
 I just dropped an antenna and it starts to rain suddenly. 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:26.030
 It's a challenge from the start. 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:31.220
 From the 13th to the 14th All the Demand Demand International Spill 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.209
 Looking now that you can now resistant to the car and use the pinch, so make a lot 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.950
 Know 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.950
 There's a lot more work to do, but I have to do it. 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.430
 It is a small amount, but when it rains, the new steel tower is slippery. 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.489
 One 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.879
 In cold Inspection and dismantling the antenna 3 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:04:01.680
 There will be four replacement work 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:01.680
 But the allocated time is busy again just one day and demolition work begins 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.909
 Because of this, high-pitting was a challenge. 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:13.540
 But the situation is also difficult for the ground team 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.540
 The nerves of the dangerous worker are sharp 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:24.580
 Less than a few dozen to a few hundred kilograms . 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.340
 When the wind blows or falls, the load increases to thousands of kilograms. 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.100
 The destructive power is beyond imagination 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.100
 So the founders came to work on the back of prudence 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.870
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:46.950
 Ah ah well now completely separated from the tower But somehow not continue to go down 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.950
 It collides with a tower . 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.720
 There is a concern about the safety of the team . 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:05.560
 Antenna of steel tower structure 3 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:09.419
 You have to change the direction of the antenna, but you need to adjust the direction only by the pulling force of the rope. 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.419
 It is not easy to work because 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:19.010
 All of the embarrassed dentists took an emergency. 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:24.230
 The situation becomes even more dangerous if an antenna collides with seven towers 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:27.140
 The front floor to the rain is slippery and gives strength 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.830
 In addition, the antenna weighs only about 300kg 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:37.820
 If the wind blows, the load is more than 6 times higher 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:43.720
 If you do not have to endure the weight of the balance as soon as both magazines heaped high-altitude workers 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:43.720
 Everyone who is dangerous is pouring out all for repentance. 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:51.349
 Fortunately, this little piece of land 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.580
 But I was still relieved. 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:57.050
 Although it was better , the collision of the pylons is continuing, and now only the pylons 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:01.569
 I'm going down in half. 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.569
 I need to get more strength. 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:09.759
 Or when the antenna is near the bottom 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.759
 Groundworkers are starting to get more power. 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.010
 I finally poured out my power and finally the antenna arrived on the ground. 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:23.040
 A task that was difficult 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:28.350
 I passed another process, but the place where I put the antenna down is not good 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:32.460
 This challenge again, pollution and chaos example be cut 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:38.340
 No, no, go around pushing back They r 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:41.729
 I'm behind you . You should not be afraid . 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:45.470
 9 then flow back logo 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:45.470
 Yes, you are. 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:56.389
 I can not go even of the people jumping kids walking to get to the short- and long-term 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.870
 Overcoming the conflict with the installed generators, workers now have a sigh of relief 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.870
 I am exhausted.
