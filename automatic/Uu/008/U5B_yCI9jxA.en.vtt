dragon height innate is not helmet and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
dragon height innate is not helmet and
the<00:01:13.770> Bissell<00:01:14.220> whip<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.450> you're<00:01:15.600> using

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the Bissell whip like if you're using

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.990 
the Bissell whip like if you're using
melee<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.830> shouldn't<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.549> range<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
melee you shouldn't use the range on

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.570 
melee you shouldn't use the range on
modern<00:01:18.360> touches<00:01:18.570> bad<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.220> he<00:01:20.400> also

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
modern touches bad and I think he also

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.120 
modern touches bad and I think he also
had<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> defender<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.990> cannot<00:01:22.350> confirm<00:01:22.619> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
had a defender but I cannot confirm this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
had a defender but I cannot confirm this
because<00:01:23.549> I'm<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.939> looking<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> clip

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
because I'm not looking at the clip

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.920 
because I'm not looking at the clip
right<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.250> anyway<00:01:26.250> eventually<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:27.509> did<00:01:27.780> I

the<00:01:48.720> past<00:01:48.899> two<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.409> half<00:01:49.590> days<00:01:49.860> I've<00:01:50.100> been

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
the past two and a half days I've been

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.030 
the past two and a half days I've been
training<00:01:50.640> agility<00:01:50.909> non-stop<00:01:51.920> initially<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
training agility non-stop initially it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.130 
training agility non-stop initially it
was<00:01:53.220> supposed<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:53.820> just<00:01:53.970> two<00:01:54.299> levels<00:01:54.930> or

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
was supposed to be just two levels or

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.530 
was supposed to be just two levels or
maybe<00:01:55.500> three<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.880> just<00:01:57.090> bored<00:01:57.390> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
maybe three because I was just bored and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.300 
maybe three because I was just bored and
I<00:01:57.659> had<00:01:57.840> nothing<00:01:58.170> else<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.439> do<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.159> thought

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
I had nothing else to do and I thought

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
I had nothing else to do and I thought
agility<00:01:59.880> was<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.770> click<00:02:01.770> intense<00:02:02.219> skill<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
agility was this click intense skill and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.539 
agility was this click intense skill and
that's<00:02:03.750> why<00:02:04.049> I<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.619> hated<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:05.159> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that's why I really hated it but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.399 
that's why I really hated it but
eventually<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.270> more<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> did<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.990> more

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
eventually the more I did it the more

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.339 
eventually the more I did it the more
automatic<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.580> went<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.239> my<00:02:09.390> brain<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:10.319> I

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
automatic it went in my brain like I

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.490 
automatic it went in my brain like I
didn't<00:02:10.739> feel<00:02:10.950> how<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> went<00:02:11.550> from<00:02:11.730> like<00:02:11.940> level

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
didn't feel how I went from like level

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.610 
didn't feel how I went from like level
73

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
73

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.490 
73
74<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.790> was<00:02:14.940> so<00:02:15.150> automatic<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.110> hand<00:02:16.319> was

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
74 it was so automatic like my hand was

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.190 
74 it was so automatic like my hand was
just<00:02:16.680> moving<00:02:16.950> like<00:02:17.659> when<00:02:18.659> you<00:02:18.780> click<00:02:19.080> on

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
just moving like when you click on

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.649 
just moving like when you click on
obstacle<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.040> like<00:02:20.310> 4<00:02:20.549> seconds<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.120> afk

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
obstacle you have like 4 seconds of afk

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:24.680 
obstacle you have like 4 seconds of afk
so<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.409> can<00:02:22.590> watch<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:23.010> movie<00:02:23.489> or<00:02:23.730> read<00:02:24.540> an

so you can watch a movie or read an
article<00:02:24.900> or<00:02:25.349> something<00:02:25.379> so<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.459> wasn't<00:02:26.879> just

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
article or something so it wasn't just

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.680 
article or something so it wasn't just
stare<00:02:28.140> at<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.319> screen<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.790> know<00:02:29.940> like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
stare at the screen and you know like

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.380 
stare at the screen and you know like

mining also one of the daily tasks was
agility<00:02:33.989> for<00:02:34.170> me<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:35.159> was<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.610> lucky

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
agility for me so that was kind of lucky

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.479 
agility for me so that was kind of lucky

access the agility course and that was
kind<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.310> bad<00:02:41.549> because<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.030> was<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
kind of bad because that was the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
but eventually I'll get that so the

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.240 
but eventually I'll get that so the
agility<00:03:58.199> is<00:03:58.620> done<00:03:59.069> no<00:03:59.639> more<00:03:59.879> agility<00:04:00.209> ever
