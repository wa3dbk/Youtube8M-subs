increase I cannot stress the importance

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:48.450 
increase I cannot stress the importance
that<00:05:46.720> you<00:05:46.840> need<00:05:47.050> to<00:05:47.289> increase<00:05:47.710> that<00:05:47.770> protein

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
within the muscles so much greater
