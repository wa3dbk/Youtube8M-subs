00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.580
 here and now and this is in the cellar 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:25.590
 shelf is born rack for cans 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:29.660
 pickles and jam while he has this 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.660
 all this will be cooked together now 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:37.800
 shelf shelving 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:41.200
 rack frame assembled from 32 tubes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.800
 polypropylene with such fittings 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:55.330
 here crosses to here a threesome Ukraine them 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:59.949
 only taynichki sections of the legs unit 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.790
 which help in welding off collected 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 completely two sections 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.430
 left service and right section completely 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.800
 will show 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.180
 between them there will still be this 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:19.560
 the heart that is only 4 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.560
 full section 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.150
 inside was reported sill 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.140
 sliced â€‹â€‹accordingly 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.760
 I'll show you bye 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.450
 first tagged haven't started already 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:41.050
 definitely the job of making a shelving 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:44.270
 pvc and so shelves are fully welded 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.680
 By the way sometimes such questions arise 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.950
 the exit pipe is falling 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.910
 or will some say they are soldered 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.690
 friend is wrong panko this is where 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.690
 heterogeneous materials 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.470
 That is, there is also solder and flux 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.990
 here is a homogeneous material plastic 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.910
 so the Varenz pipes are exactly welding 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.630
 let's get away so badly removed all show 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.340
 small cellar 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.180
 Well, that's how it turned out four sections 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.180
 one 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 four sections and a small gap left 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.900
 there will be a pipe tilted 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.650
 vent try a different corner 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.640
 go in and out 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:36.520
 show here it looks like a rack and 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.630
 Shelves will keep everything put on 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.220
 a place 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 pvc pipe try the closest view 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:52.810
 show how all the sweat crosses to 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.470
 threesome triple 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.540
 crosses to extreme sections rendered 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.370
 stumps in stalinka used 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 that is, on the contrary in only gingerbread in 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.590
 tap heart a in intermediate 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.080
 use also cross wreaths when 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.650
 If desired, you can ramp up to the ceiling 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.780
 yet that space will show 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.670
 to the ceiling, in principle, can be simplified 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.670
 one more shelf engraftment 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:26.990
 coconut is fully set before that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.920
 here it is the so-called exhaust pipe 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:35.040
 was laid 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:38.370
 she goes here under the frame under 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.310
 shelves in the opposite diagonal 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.340
 google i.e. circulation should 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.400
 everything is a fight like this 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.150
 completely into the frame into place all by 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.350
 level on such sites 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.730
 legs stand in the ground in bits of pins 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.930
 stainless steel 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:03.200
 that is, it is a plastic armature 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.239
 it is shifting but also extra though 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.120
 maybe it doesn't need two for such 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:13.700
 years snaps to the wall the whole design 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.920
 visible yet whip 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.329
 Now we put the cams and see 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.250
 general view and there well here and presentation 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:32.169
 cellars and shelves and hollow in general 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.169
 first twist seaming 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:41.709
 Himself responsible to the magnet show. the very 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.709
 bottom where colder 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.829
 general view of such 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.790
 Here is a pvc in the cellar 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.870
 or polypropylene ukina correctness 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:12.770
 polypropylene backwater 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.919
 shelves of window sills 50 wide 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.139
 centimeters and a half meter long we 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.210
 They took exactly three parts cut and 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.970
 It turned out such wonderful here 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.840
 the junction 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.860
 shelves can not go anywhere not forward 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:33.610
 not back and sideways 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:38.259
 well fixed well let's get started 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:43.660
 story about polypropylene 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.660
 rack shelf for cellar 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.970
 is ending
