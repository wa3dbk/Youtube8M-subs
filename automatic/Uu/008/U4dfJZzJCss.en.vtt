 dixmude command as part of its 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.129

 to maintain our know-how in Libya 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.989
 since it's one of the missions

 qualification in the amphibian field 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.200
 first a first level that the

 with qualification courses for 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.539
 amphibious operations a second level 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.490
 which concerns the units the companies 

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.970
 of the regiment with the formation of their 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.649
 pilots 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.930
 so it's a technical training for 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.530
 embarking re-barge 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.380
 transhipment 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.750
 or other boats 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.219
 which could bring you to and finally the 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.140
 third level of qualification it's 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:30.130
 sonic have led right now with 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.720
 exercises said target 2 etc. and we have 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.579
 seized this opportunity and the means 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.039
 who were granted therefore the setting 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.979
 provision of a projection building 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:43.500
 and command to achieve a 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.500
 amphibious exercise at regimental level 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.450
 this maneuver allows the fourth 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.750
 company to apply this knowledge 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.090
 amphibious specificity of the 6th Brigade 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.410
 light armored to which the second 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.420
 it belongs to the legionaries were able 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.049
 evaluate the effectiveness of such 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.959
 surgery 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:22.220
 these constraints and the need for 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.220
 protect the beachhead
