be patient work through this process
here<00:02:42.709> this<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.950> probably<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.489> most

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
here this is probably one of the most

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.990 
here this is probably one of the most
tedious<00:02:43.940> part<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:45.640> we'll<00:02:46.640> go<00:02:46.760> ahead<00:02:46.880> and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
tedious part so we'll go ahead and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.100 
tedious part so we'll go ahead and

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
finish them up and we'll be back with

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.150 
finish them up and we'll be back with
you
