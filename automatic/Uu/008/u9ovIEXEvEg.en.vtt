00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 for me 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.339
 we are at a height do not be champion of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.329
 one million Guadalajara tournament 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:47.110
 arturo how do you feel we are very 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.150
 happy because finally it was possible 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.570
 nothing that I say happy nothing more 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.810
 happy once at the end complicated 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.530
 because at the beginning I started to shoot well 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:03.100
 I went up a lot and it did not make anything difficult for me 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.500
 the table I had there winning several many 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.930
 hands and then I lost a click with the king 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.440
 against cribs and from there it started 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.180
 Complicate 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.140
 to complicate and I found another link 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:20.780
 it's not against I was paid with ray j 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:26.290
 but then he rose again and again 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.990
 facilitated a bit and it was pretty easy 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.890
 you've had a year the truth enough 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.430
 good for your career that we hope 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.430
 continue like this 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.290
 look more tournaments and keep coming away 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.480
 Not only that, your brother is also in 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.780
 the final table of the tree 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.090
 I have 6 left I think it's good in chips 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.760
 let's hope he wins 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.640

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.510
