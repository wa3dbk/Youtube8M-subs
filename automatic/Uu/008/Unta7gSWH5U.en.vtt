00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.210
 Huh 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:21.460
 Yes I tried to hear this sound from this, but 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:21.460
 When Yeah I heard I heard Well, first iphone use in iphone 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.060
 There are many but 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.830
 That's right I 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.550
 That sound is already that 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.050
 So it will contain it sound 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.140
 that 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.350
 So-called aralog 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.649
 It is not a sound 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.649
 Arogu is not on so leave contains as it is sound 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.730
 As sound comes in just as it is 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.680
 That sound quality is very clear this 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.890
 that 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:06.770
 The so-called cd Toka that sound when you play there is the fact that Tsu Shah 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.080
 I think it sounds but it's a bit too 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.330
 There is no io and it is very clear 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.710
 Of course even when I heard it on a PC 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.620
 like that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.350
 Kotowaa that Shah 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:22.010
 I will not say that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010
 Is clear 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.050
 Mast Anon referred to as more watermelon 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.870
 Do you say 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.730
 that 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.730
 Very low 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.710
 Also I have worked punch 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.440
 a 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.920
 Vocals too 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.920
 very 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.240
 Punch works well yeah 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.770
 London Panpan and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.490
 Weather sound Oh 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.490
 You put 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.100
 And that 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.090
 Ades I 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.360
 Well that's that minute 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.360
 It may be said that the expansion of the space of sound 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.760
 What a do you say I 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.920
 That sound 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.920
 I can not feel the spread so much 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.690
 Push it forward 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.910
 It says Pan are you 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:35.150
 The sound that came out of that was that great but beautiful 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:36.600
 I do not think that it has spread so much that the space of the spread is spread 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.470
 that 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.170
 Each such instrument or vocal 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.030
 Each one 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.030
 Kedomo it in I think also that there is a space 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.710
 It is a feeling that it gathers in one place and becomes each 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:03.670
 Certainly vocals and he is that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 And Gyu' until the very way from N Keio 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.819
 Excluding 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:20.690
 The I has become as O and Well is I entered that course 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.160
 There is a site called mora of that sony sony site , but 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.319
 your 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.840
 that 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:32.630
 Even though Hi-Res is what sound source corresponding site 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.950
 That turtle from the source of that 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.930
 I can watch it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.890
 Have a high res sound source at your site and stand the branch 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.440
 I watched it but 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.530
 I hear 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.580
 Certainly that vocal far away but meeting 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.800
 Also spirit and such a fine and go 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.800
 You can hear fiction clearly 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.019
 Huh 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.940
 That sound is very clear 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.390
 Oh dear 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.460
 In fact Hano Hi-Res I'd never sound source is heard actually download Well, it is if 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.720
 Also 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.859
 I can see that claiming trial viewing but on that site 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.500
 As far as I heard it 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.620
 That's right a 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.750
 Toka when he said that the balk 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:28.980
 That's about it 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.900
 It is that zone dog of music that I used to listen to in the place 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.900
 After all that sound is good, isn't it? 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:43.580
 Even that old music 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:47.210
 After all it sounds like that little different sound 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.500
 It does not sound like it was when listening to cd 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.500
 I feel like that 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.599
 Maa's 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.599
 By say so 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:01.300
 Saying 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.040
 Oh dear 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.260
 I kinda Kedomo is the first time that I 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.480
 It's like this 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.230
 It is introduction of purchased product 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.230
 Yeah 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:23.840

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:34.740
 I thought that would like to Hey adjustment is the sort of thing 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.430
 Next time I wonder Izu I do not know if such products can buy such products 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.580
 But 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.580
 Well that time I will try to come up again 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:47.129
 It is the number of lines 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:52.900
 Sled in the US 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:55.889
 The fact that that many new even God comes out even integration 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.889
 Also it'd have been announced 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.620
 And of course it 's a type and a 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.580
 140,000 in Japan prices 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.580
 It seems to be 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:19.080
 Of course it corresponds to the heart of the movement that corresponds to the wild tiger 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.080
 It is for erasing high res sound source reproduction 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.159
 mdr says harbor a 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:31.449

 Oh dear 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.289

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.300

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.710
 I tried to up the video on that day to try to buy the goods 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.760

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:16.690
 I think 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:24.620
 So even though you Etchotto described extreme clumsiness 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:27.580
 Thank you for watching
