00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:08.509

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.509
 the subject has just arrived 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.459
 ears with a song 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.399
 jealousy and llÃ­ria have a whole 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 exactly and we're going to see a 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.829
 thing we are already in season we have a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 month and a half of lots and the best ones say 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.239
 which are the ones that come from toluca because 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.410
 they also take them from Puebla but the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.730
 public medical city because they are the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.559
 those from toluca mexico for a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.150
 reason nothing more because those of peoples the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.360
 the men and toluca water the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 linked 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.720
 then I think 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.090
 big and long is very beautiful we are 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.270
 absolutely everything true tell you 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.009
 When it is already dry, we have it here 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.570
 another corn called cocoa nods and 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.710
 this cost 5 pesos of aniston is a 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.710
 huge corn 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:24.130
 this is the corn kernel pozole 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:26.020
 corn pozolero exactly that 's fine 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.670
 because it 's important that I see it because 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:36.539
 it costs 5 pesos sad we do not have here 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.539
 It is here we are weighing up 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.009
 I bought in the central supply that 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.740
 it's in iztapalapa this cost me 250 and 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:55.179
 see that because this figure of the sack 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.100
 because obviously the cost goes down 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.170
 multiply up to a weight an corn 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.159
 up to 60 cents 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 as soon as the two get settled interesting 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.340
 those that are two or three pesos up in 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 20 up to 20 pesos ok and those that are from 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.260
 2 or 150 may be in 10 pesos and these 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.209
 excesses also depends on the area there is like 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.819
 30 pesos sold to bread in xochimilco 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.040

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.739

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.739
