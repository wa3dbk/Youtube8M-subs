going<00:02:59.829> to<00:02:59.949> be<00:03:00.099> using<00:03:01.560> magnets<00:03:02.560> now<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.519> can

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
going to be using magnets now you can

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.449 
going to be using magnets now you can
use<00:03:04.180> any<00:03:04.480> various<00:03:05.290> assortment<00:03:05.829> of<00:03:05.949> things<00:03:06.010> you

I'm going to show you how to use a

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.679 
I'm going to show you how to use a
magnet<00:03:15.250> because<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.609> magnets<00:03:15.939> for<00:03:16.150> me<00:03:16.299> are

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
magnet because the magnets for me are

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.360 
magnet because the magnets for me are
the<00:03:16.840> easiest<00:03:17.169> way<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.409> go<00:03:17.560> I'm<00:03:17.980> going<00:03:18.219> to<00:03:18.280> take

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
the easiest way to go I'm going to take

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.659 
the easiest way to go I'm going to take
a<00:03:18.489> little<00:03:18.819> tiny<00:03:19.060> square<00:03:19.599> of<00:03:19.979> duct<00:03:20.979> tape<00:03:21.069> I'm

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
a little tiny square of duct tape I'm

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:24.030 
a little tiny square of duct tape I'm
going<00:03:21.819> to<00:03:21.879> place<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.120> right<00:03:22.479> over<00:03:22.930> top<00:03:23.349> my

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
going to place it right over top my

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.349 
going to place it right over top my
magnet<00:03:24.430> wherever<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.879> want<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> place<00:03:25.329> my

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
magnet wherever I want to place my

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.050 
magnet wherever I want to place my
magnet<00:03:25.870> on<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.109> top<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:27.009> like<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:27.579> I'm

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
magnet on the top just like that and I'm

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.699 
magnet on the top just like that and I'm
going<00:03:28.269> to<00:03:28.299> rub<00:03:28.540> that<00:03:28.689> down<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:29.349> it's<00:03:29.500> nice<00:03:29.680> and

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
going to rub that down so it's nice and

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.270 
going to rub that down so it's nice and
secure

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
secure

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.460 
secure
just<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:33.209> now<00:03:34.209> here<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.049> easiest

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
just like that now here is the easiest

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.729 
just like that now here is the easiest
way<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.739> make<00:03:36.159> sure<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:37.060> your<00:03:37.599> magnet<00:03:38.139> is<00:03:38.379> in

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
way to make sure that your magnet is in

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.979 
way to make sure that your magnet is in
the<00:03:38.859> correct<00:03:39.250> position<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:39.939> also<00:03:40.659> polarized

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
the correct position and also polarized

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.899 
the correct position and also polarized
the<00:03:41.560> right<00:03:41.739> way<00:03:41.889> because<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.370> know<00:03:42.400> magnets

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
the right way because you know magnets

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:44.939 
the right way because you know magnets
will<00:03:43.060> either<00:03:43.239> force<00:03:43.629> each<00:03:43.810> other<00:03:43.989> apart<00:03:44.349> or

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
will either force each other apart or

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.499 
will either force each other apart or
they'll<00:03:45.189> track<00:03:45.579> and<00:03:45.879> you<00:03:46.060> want<00:03:46.209> yours<00:03:46.389> to

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:46.509 
they'll track and you want yours to

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:48.509 
they'll track and you want yours to
attract<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.079> not<00:03:47.319> push<00:03:47.560> itself<00:03:47.859> away<00:03:48.099> so<00:03:48.459> I'm

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519
