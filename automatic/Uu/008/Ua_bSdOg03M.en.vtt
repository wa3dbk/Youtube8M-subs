if it's too fine to grit it'll make the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.500 
if it's too fine to grit it'll make the
board<00:02:09.709> too<00:02:09.920> smooth<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.700> won't<00:02:10.879> accept<00:02:11.330> the

stain like always we want to use little

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.819 
stain like always we want to use little
light<00:02:17.120> pressure<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.780> sander<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.349> go<00:02:18.530> with

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
light pressure on a sander and go with

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:26.800 
light pressure on a sander and go with
the<00:02:19.040> grain<00:02:19.250> of<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> way

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.800 

why<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:28.110> kind<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.740> insane<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.510> difference

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
why a kind of insane now the difference

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
why a kind of insane now the difference
between<00:02:30.870> stain<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.010> polyurethane<00:02:32.340> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
between stain and that polyurethane it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.089 
between stain and that polyurethane it
was<00:02:32.880> on<00:02:33.060> here<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.480> steam<00:02:33.780> doesn't<00:02:34.500> try<00:02:35.040> to

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
was on here is the steam doesn't try to

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.610 
was on here is the steam doesn't try to
put<00:02:35.489> a<00:02:35.520> coat<00:02:35.849> over<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.690> wood<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:37.319> much<00:02:37.470> as

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
put a coat over the the wood so much as

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.030 
put a coat over the the wood so much as
it<00:02:37.739> kind<00:02:38.010> of<00:02:38.040> blends<00:02:38.760> into<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.800> when<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.830> do<00:02:40.920> this

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it kind of blends into it when I do this

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
it kind of blends into it when I do this
by<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.459> way<00:02:41.640> here's<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:42.120> trick<00:02:42.360> I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
by the way here's a little trick I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
by the way here's a little trick I
learned<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.470> put<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.770> on<00:02:43.950> scrap

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
learned I like to put this on scrap

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.910 
learned I like to put this on scrap
pieces<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.850> wood<00:02:44.970> so<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.360> can<00:02:45.600> get<00:02:46.200> at<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.470> edges

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
pieces of wood so I can get at the edges

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.000 
pieces of wood so I can get at the edges
I<00:02:47.390> went<00:02:48.390> ahead<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.630> stripped<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> bottom

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
I went ahead and stripped the bottom

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.860 
I went ahead and stripped the bottom
part<00:02:50.220> too<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:50.700> don't<00:02:51.330> know<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.540> I'm<00:02:51.660> going<00:02:51.810> to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
part too I don't know that I'm going to

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.390 
part too I don't know that I'm going to
stain<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.230> necessarily<00:02:52.739> but<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.069> do<00:02:53.130> want<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
stain it necessarily but I do want the

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
stain it necessarily but I do want the
polyurethane<00:02:53.790> off<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.390> bottom<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:55.739> this

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
polyurethane off the bottom of this

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.830 
polyurethane off the bottom of this
piece<00:02:56.280> because<00:02:56.489> otherwise<00:02:57.269> they<00:02:57.569> can't

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
piece because otherwise they can't

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.250 
piece because otherwise they can't
breathe<00:02:58.140> if<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.500> gets<00:02:58.650> moisture<00:02:59.069> in<00:02:59.190> it<00:03:00.260> well

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
breathe if it gets moisture in it well

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.130 
breathe if it gets moisture in it well
that's<00:03:01.440> pretty<00:03:02.180> okay<00:03:03.180> over<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.780> last<00:03:03.900> couple

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
that's pretty okay over the last couple

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.229 
that's pretty okay over the last couple
of<00:03:04.350> days<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.739> put<00:03:04.980> two<00:03:05.220> coats<00:03:05.459> of<00:03:05.640> stain<00:03:05.760> on

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
of days I put two coats of stain on

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.150 
of days I put two coats of stain on
these<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.750> looked<00:03:06.959> good<00:03:07.110> I<00:03:07.380> tried<00:03:08.040> to

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
these and that looked good I tried to

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.059 
these and that looked good I tried to
put<00:03:08.340> on<00:03:08.489> three<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.209> it's<00:03:09.720> stink<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.920> wood

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
put on three but it's stink so the wood

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.559 
put on three but it's stink so the wood
took<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.370> much<00:03:11.519> as<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.790> could<00:03:11.880> absorb<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.480> then

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
took as much as it could absorb and then

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.360 
took as much as it could absorb and then
wouldn't<00:03:12.810> absorb<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.290> third<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:14.040> really

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
wouldn't absorb the third it's really

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.039 
wouldn't absorb the third it's really
simple<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:14.880> put<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.480> back<00:03:15.569> together<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
simple you just put it back together the

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.330 
simple you just put it back together the
way<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.230> took<00:03:16.410> it<00:03:16.470> apart<00:03:16.799> notice<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.250> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
way you took it apart notice that I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.670 
way you took it apart notice that I
didn't<00:03:17.670> take<00:03:17.819> it<00:03:17.970> all<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.420> apart<00:03:18.780> this

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
didn't take it all the way apart this

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.170 
didn't take it all the way apart this
way<00:03:19.920> there's<00:03:20.160> not<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.489> much<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> have<00:03:21.000> to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
way there's not as much to have to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.259 
way there's not as much to have to
reassemble<00:03:21.799> okay<00:03:22.799> we're<00:03:23.430> done

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
reassemble okay we're done

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.940 
reassemble okay we're done
really<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:24.989> took<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.170> couple<00:03:25.410> days<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:25.799> I

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
really that took a couple days because I

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.449 
really that took a couple days because I
had<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.190> wait<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.549> stain<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.970> dry<00:03:28.220> toss<00:03:29.220> to

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
had to wait for the stain to dry toss to

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.130 
had to wait for the stain to dry toss to
the<00:03:29.519> stain<00:03:30.410> sandpaper<00:03:32.180> pretty<00:03:33.180> inexpensive

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
the stain sandpaper pretty inexpensive

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.870 
the stain sandpaper pretty inexpensive
project<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:34.769> it<00:03:34.859> probably<00:03:35.100> scented<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> life

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
project and it probably scented the life

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.610 
project and it probably scented the life
of<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.180> nice<00:03:36.420> bench<00:03:36.750> at<00:03:36.930> least<00:03:37.079> five<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.440> ten

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
of this nice bench at least five to ten
