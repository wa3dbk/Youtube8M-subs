00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
properly without using a brush guard

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.429 
properly without using a brush guard
because<00:00:23.670> um<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.960> guys<00:00:25.109> would

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
because um I know some of you guys would

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.589 
because um I know some of you guys would
not<00:00:25.650> want<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.890> spend<00:00:26.099> money<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.939> extra<00:00:27.420> money

not want to spend money or extra money

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.060

on<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> brush<00:00:28.080> guard<00:00:28.380> because<00:00:28.560> brush<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
on a brush guard because brush is

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.370 
on a brush guard because brush is
already<00:00:29.369> expensive<00:00:29.789> themselves<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.140> came

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
already expensive themselves so I came

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.010 
already expensive themselves so I came
up<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.769> this<00:00:32.070> little<00:00:32.369> crazy<00:00:32.759> funky<00:00:33.180> idea<00:00:33.690> so

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
up with this little crazy funky idea so

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.220 
up with this little crazy funky idea so
what<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.500> did<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.489> took<00:00:35.520> two<00:00:36.149> binders<00:00:36.690> I'm

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
what I did is I took two binders I'm

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
what I did is I took two binders I'm
sorry<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.860> camera's<00:00:38.250> not<00:00:38.280> focusing<00:00:39.030> really

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
sorry my camera's not focusing really

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.540 
sorry my camera's not focusing really
well<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.690> took<00:00:39.809> two<00:00:40.140> binders<00:00:40.559> um<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
well but I took two binders um so it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.600 
well but I took two binders um so it
would<00:00:41.670> give<00:00:42.290> some<00:00:43.290> elevation<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> got<00:00:44.430> some

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
would give some elevation and I got some

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
would give some elevation and I got some
duct<00:00:44.879> tape<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.480> sticky<00:00:45.750> side<00:00:45.989> pointing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
duct tape with the sticky side pointing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.790 
duct tape with the sticky side pointing
upwards<00:00:47.280> um<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.480> duck<00:00:48.930> brushes<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
upwards um I just duck brushes on to the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.950 
upwards um I just duck brushes on to the
tape<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> end<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.059> fold<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
tape and on the end I would fold it

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.020 
tape and on the end I would fold it
inward<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.860> on<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> tape<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.760> stick

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
inward so that on the tape would stick

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
inward so that on the tape would stick
onto<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.539> binder<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.559> secure

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
onto the binder and you want to secure

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.010 
onto the binder and you want to secure
it<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.070> another<00:00:56.550> piece<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.059> tape<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
it with another piece of tape so that

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.139 
it with another piece of tape so that
the<00:00:58.289> brushes<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:58.949> wait<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> paste<00:00:59.699> this

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the brushes don't wait this paste this

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.680 
the brushes don't wait this paste this
piece<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> tape<00:01:01.530> downwards<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
piece of tape downwards and you do the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.640 
piece of tape downwards and you do the
same<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> other<00:01:04.320> side<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.820> know<00:01:05.939> and

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
same on the other side so you know and

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
same on the other side so you know and
surprisingly<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.369> brushes<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
surprisingly like big brushes like this

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
surprisingly like big brushes like this
stayed<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.680> well<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
stayed on really well like you have to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.420 
stayed on really well like you have to
really<00:01:11.939> pull<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.630> what<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> come<00:01:13.950> off<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
really pull on it what to come off and

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.960 
really pull on it what to come off and
that's<00:01:15.500> pretty<00:01:16.500> surprising<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.430> I

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
that's pretty surprising to me because I

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's pretty surprising to me because I
was<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.750> worried<00:01:19.049> about<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.409> planning

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
was kind of worried about that planning

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.170 
was kind of worried about that planning
on<00:01:20.280> putting<00:01:20.400> another<00:01:20.610> piece<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.909> tape<00:01:21.030> here

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
on putting another piece of tape here

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.590 
on putting another piece of tape here
but<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.450> guess<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.900> didn't<00:01:22.140> really<00:01:22.259> need<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.770> UM

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
but I guess I didn't really need to UM

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.030 
but I guess I didn't really need to UM
for<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> double-ended<00:01:25.320> Russians<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> want

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
for the double-ended Russians you want

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
for the double-ended Russians you want
to<00:01:26.130> lay<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.400> flat<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.299> paper<00:01:28.080> towel

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to lay them flat on the paper towel

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
to lay them flat on the paper towel
because<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.549> know<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.509> it

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because you know if you point it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.359 
because you know if you point it
downwards<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.320> on<00:01:31.530> top<00:01:31.860> would<00:01:32.100> get

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
downwards the one on top would get

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
downwards the one on top would get
ruined<00:01:32.820> um<00:01:33.320> if<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.590> guys<00:01:34.799> are<00:01:35.009> wondering

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
ruined um if you guys are wondering
