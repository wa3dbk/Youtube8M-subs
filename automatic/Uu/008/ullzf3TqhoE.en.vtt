you see it's shiny black and I've got a
lot<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.930> fingerprints<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.590> because

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
lot of fingerprints on it because

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.069 
lot of fingerprints on it because
everyone's<00:00:59.250> been<00:00:59.340> touching<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.879> everyone<00:01:00.840> at

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
everyone's been touching it everyone at

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
everyone's been touching it everyone at
work<00:01:01.379> has<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:01.770> been<00:01:02.100> opening<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.820> box

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
work has actually been opening this box

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
work has actually been opening this box
several<00:01:03.539> times<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.110> hear<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.559> so<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
several times just to hear that so I

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.219 
several times just to hear that so I
expect<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.880> battery<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.869> die<00:01:06.990> pretty

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
expect that battery to to die pretty

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.130 
expect that battery to to die pretty
soon<00:01:07.500> but<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> comes<00:01:08.549> with<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.760> core<00:01:09.210> i5<00:01:09.479> that

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
soon but this comes with a core i5 that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.649 
soon but this comes with a core i5 that
you<00:01:10.320> version<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> low-power<00:01:11.159> version<00:01:11.729> Intel

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you version the low-power version Intel

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.810 
you version the low-power version Intel
processor<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.619> put<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.950> your<00:01:14.100> RAM<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.520> put<00:01:14.729> in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
processor you put in your RAM you put in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210 
processor you put in your RAM you put in
your<00:01:14.970> drive<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:16.380> ready<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.770> rock<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
your drive and you're ready to rock and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
your drive and you're ready to rock and
roll<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> pretty<00:01:17.939> nice<00:01:18.270> computer<00:01:19.080> we'll<00:01:19.380> be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
roll so a pretty nice computer we'll be

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.350 
roll so a pretty nice computer we'll be
looking<00:01:19.619> at<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.640> future<00:01:21.000> video

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
looking at that in a future video

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
looking at that in a future video
the<00:01:21.840> second<00:01:22.200> computers<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.979> also

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the second computers that I have also

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
the second computers that I have also
very<00:01:23.670> small<00:01:24.030> but<00:01:24.990> slightly<00:01:25.979> larger<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.369> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
very small but slightly larger and it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
very small but slightly larger and it
has<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:27.090> more<00:01:27.119> power<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> shuttle

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
has a lot more power this is the shuttle

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.080 
has a lot more power this is the shuttle
des<00:01:29.759> 81<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.650> about<00:01:32.090> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
des 81 you can see that it's about the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
des 81 you can see that it's about the
size<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.840> CD<00:01:33.900> drive<00:01:34.650> now<00:01:35.100> actually<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.670> a

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
size of a CD drive now actually it's a

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
size of a CD drive now actually it's a
little<00:01:36.000> bit<00:01:36.119> bigger<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.479> bigger<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.140> just<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
little bit bigger it's bigger but just a

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.190 
little bit bigger it's bigger but just a
little<00:01:38.520> bit<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.509> reason<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
little bit and the reason I know that is

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200 
little bit and the reason I know that is
I<00:01:40.350> try<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> fit<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.220> an<00:01:41.340> empty<00:01:41.670> tray<00:01:41.939> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I try to fit it in an empty tray and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.990 
I try to fit it in an empty tray and
