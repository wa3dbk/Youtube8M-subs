00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.520
 black ops 2 on the mtv channel on the map 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.420
 doni 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.690
 unfortunately the gameplay bugged because I 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.519
 I took the tietÃª he's well publicized 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 it has several new functions and 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.980
 interesting but not trustworthy I 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.010
 I'm going to continue from here to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.560
 front only recording the matches because I 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.570
 I'm posting a game was good but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.970
 I've been better still 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.710
 I can not take 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.620
 I can find it, and it's all gone. 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.040
 and the final part is not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 present but the mp goes rolling and I'm with 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.329
 a very good weapon at msm c which is a sub 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 machine 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.260
 I think its maxixe is great on the team 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.239
 are good and I will speak just my 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 opinion on the game try at least 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.559
 of paulinha if you have in the means eu 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 I put any promises to continue. 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 this is black ops 2 or whatever 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.379
 another thing the game is good is not how it is 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.660
 that is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.329
 in my view about the game I think not 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 has nothing to do with black ops 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.360
 it has much more to do with the series 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.159
 fashion catch approached more style 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.340
 because the game is faster 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.560
 the maps are much more detailed are 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.250
 maps much more like fashion r 3 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.600
 in the aspect of detail and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.670
 The amount of things you have to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.290
 hide place the entrance of these there 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.650
 windows doors 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.020
 the graph is beautiful with India 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.509
 she has a limit and they have succeeded 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.670
 to explore as much as a little bit 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.189
 more colorful than refined 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.030
 than in the modern and beautiful 31 graphic gives 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.759
 pro expense 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.409
 the system you have is a very 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.329
 interesting in the same way as 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.619
 kind of show support 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:52.079
 they came with that new refreshment 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.390
 I play because I have to do this but it is not 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.909
 something revolutionary but always brings a 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.530
 time for you to stay and spend 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.969
 pressures who played the past games 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.310
 You have something new for you. 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.930
 It is the best code there is. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.820
 people were not supposed to say a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.740
 thing I think this will depend on 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.009
 everyone who starts playing for black 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.840
 ops 2 will get really crazy a game of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.860
 same way that the Basque began to 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.470
 complicate 31 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.200
 the room r3 is not modern and 2 occurs 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.840
 four is always that taste that they 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.180
 taste of you know this type of game 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.770
 He's sure to power anyone to 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.710
 who plays the most time 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.200
 It is certainly a high level game he 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.870
 For me it's better for black ops 1 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.270
 I do not think it looks like that one shot. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.430
 better because it will depend a lot 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.030
 who makes the game look good on sounds 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.860
 players 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.709
 This is the great truth, I've already entered. 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.959
 a lot of room that gave me dismay because 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.480
 I was very annoying to play a lot of people. 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.270
 doing the anti game and you sure 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.160
 You know that the time is the game. 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.160
 developing are the people who are 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.290
 playing will make the game good bad it 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 have tools that can 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.350
 mess up if used to make anti 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:08.670
 game and in a few matches was very 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.560
 that boredom that you have today 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.850
 because the game is getting ten thousand 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.470
 professional people are very 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:18.810
 worried about each re there leaves abandoned 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.880
 the match then sometimes the game in the other 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.560
 the game is developing another 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.000
 time starts to get a kiosk starts 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.100
 a lot of people leak out of the game this is 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.620
 bad for someone who is playing well and was 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.870
 winning your prizes and then you have the match 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.489
 off for you who are on the team 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.160
 times simply the wide galley 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.910
 Alone and then you unfortunately have to 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.410
 deal with this type of reality, ie 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.040
 companies that will do there that she has 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.540
 a controversy there that youtube until 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.970
 they work because they teach that 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.680
 look at an exclusivity here in 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.700
 Brazil to say something have several 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 channels that show 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.220
 various issues or how to play it 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.400
 you can take advantage of the map 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.019
 I think it's a bit 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.510
 find what I do not like 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.890
 I find it more interesting, I do not think it was 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.290
 maybe it has not been touched I think 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.140
 when some people make up rule 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.799
 you can not do can not use kill 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.540
 the guy is very angry with this 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.060
 play there the competitive 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.940
 anka the dry cuts bridges drinks that 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:27.330
 the Spaniards that will be called 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.970
 and make a game more gun in the water because 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.919
 can have much of this evaluation and 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.699
 How many times did this type of people 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.639
 doing is trying is always important 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.740
 a will here is another one that has a 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.900
 channel that sometimes people do not know 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.550
 which is the Argentine one that started a lot 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.139
 because of that his own name 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.969
 There were people who got so 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.800
 thinking it was a fuck better than the 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.419
 others and he put in the name of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.340
 Argentinian that you think someone is 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.349
 God I think I'm even more and 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.349
 started to teach as if it needed 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.210
 teach rush and use rpg times that 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.759
 people simply abhor to be 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.050
 irreverent then whenever he saw 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:07.650
 some things 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.930
 thus being forbidden and that the 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.289
 people wanted to impose and packed a 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.080
 different and intelligent way of doing 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:18.479
 a slut a hoot do something 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.360
 hilarity based on the people are 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.460
 irritated and he dies laughing with it in 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.189
 other situations but it also has 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.409
 done that is has caused some 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.960
 people who think he can not talk 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:33.360
 It turns out that Kodja was that 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.610
 people are stacked that the game is a 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.580
 Very exciting game and leaves everything very 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.830
 very very angry very spoiled 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.440
 this begins to discuss a week of 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.800
 play and even this whole mess and 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.449
 It does not even have as youtube that 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.909
 game avacalha one week I'm 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.589
 entering the rooms at the party and three months 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.930
 it's very complicated to play exactly 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.569
 because the person outside the matches 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.430
 account of each r and this has nothing to 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.289
 see with youtube who taught this or 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.490
 that was showed a weapon so the 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:05.610
 people are playing 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.469
 It's going to happen to me, I guess. 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.990
 that this does not have much to do with xvii 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:12.690
 Can not blame the guy who made the video 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.909
 And it showed that you could do it. 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.680
 what anyone considering this game 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:18.719
 not only my opinion i think people 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.120
 will take the game more seriously I think 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:24.210
 It has to be a very touristy thing and 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.949
 I'll be annoyed I'm already using the 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:32.009
 skaf is the control enjoying much already 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.560
 I feel like I got a shot gun, so I got you. 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:37.380
 very much so let's go vandinho 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.380
 advantage will give you something else you 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.600
 Can do something much more control 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.240
 It has a lot more features and can in 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.250
 several cases that I did and I had 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.490
 more ease of making you will arrive 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.440
 jumping surprised by guilt in the sights 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.750
 your opponent by shooting and making a 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:57.090
 drop shot of up machine or else 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.790
 arrives from shot-gun Holland and giving a 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.320
 Definite shot for you is less chance. 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.810
 to be successful 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.640
 I've always seen a lot of people playing with this 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.400
 Skill I think on the pc keyboard is 

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.750
 much easier time you will 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.760
 to control a little more difficult 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.040
 we have more facility than other 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:16.470
 people but control this facilitated 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.930
 because I intend to play more and suddenly 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.220
 do a review of the control is more or 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.390
 At least I think the game is very good. 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:28.680
 Yes, I like it, and I do not think you need to. 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:31.710
 of so much controversy on account of youtube 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.170
 people have to accept that the game 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.830
 he has his imbalances 

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.710
 purposeful 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.550
 otherwise it would not be code until the next game 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.550
 play was good
