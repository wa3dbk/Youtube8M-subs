00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.220
 hello everyone on the channel is all but greenhouses and 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.690
 greenhouses 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.809
 today we look at such a teach 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.210
 serious question that everyone has this 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.930
 ventilation greenhouse do it yourself 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.560
 for ventilation everyone knows that any 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.310
 vegetables fruits without proper ventilation 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.279
 just spoil 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.920
 no one is like an illness and all the labor goes 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.700
 on with the brand therefore did not give the need 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.520
 confront by doing everything 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.770
 take on ventilation everywhere in every 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.500
 croatia whether greenhouses she done 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.829
 completely different this is all done 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 by making the simplest 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.760
 windows which is located in ningbo on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.590
 the roof in the sore walls of the greenhouse and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.710
 finishing complex systems that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.260
 brute results just make but they 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.649
 fully relevant to perform 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 ventilation liang big greenhouse is not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.100
 little important especially for those who wear 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 big beats products on and outlast 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.840
 first you need to install 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.659
 two things this is the first portion usually that 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 we calmly put it and not particularly 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.189
 bother poured over the mound 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.759
 if you have a serious construction and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.560
 serious intention of music to recover 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 electronic which will more accurately be 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.229
 just define uberpool also highlighted 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.890
 you will need to install 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.159
 and psychos to which will show 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.270
 constant humidity and why would 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.560
 identify sash pro 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.939
 we need to give in to panic one of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.180
 simplest ways to perform 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.580
 ventilations are door also bad 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.130
 which may be 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.130
 made in various designs with 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:00.690
 using these simple fixtures 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 without looking at the parameters on the device, you can 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.110
 regulate a given area of ​​the room 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.000
 to return your circle you need 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.700
 use a variety of mechanical 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.980
 devices 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.010
 some also use electrical 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.150
 drive fans the rest if u 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 you are serious 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:26.820
 serious business to you get find 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:30.300
 money for such fields it does not 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.600
 need a means for guaranteeing she 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.540
 will pay for itself and bring profits to lead 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.219
 pay seconds 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.129
 well- proven 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:43.069
 forced ventilation process 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:46.459
 which works are used small 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:49.450
 Europe are electric ones 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.400
 cost but they are pretty dozens 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.549
 you can connect the thermostat 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.099
 which is 1 bay alarm contacts 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.010
 it depends on the number of fans 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:04.519
 which will connect as well as from them 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.730
 dorn power traces narrated in 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.290
 top game main permeable that all 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.340
 how greenhouse is the humidity 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.989
 environment and he very quickly come up for 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.989
 greenhouse ventilation applied 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.669
 fan which can be different 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:25.220
 the size of it depends on the area of ​​the room 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.810
 and the power becomes the subway sometimes they 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.950
 may even be very large 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.049
 stationary 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.790
 This is meant for large areas. 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.930
 there is one nuance and never 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.239
 should set the sound of different 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.239
 fans dick power input volume 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.780
 should be equal to the amount of benefit 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.459
 total air is a must and principle 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.989
 they 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.440
 ventilation is not aged 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.729
 which is just plain 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.909
 pulls out of the greenhouse would not be the inlet 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:03.879
 which on the contrary draws air with 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.599
 road that is sunetsya 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.280
 often used reparation 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.200
 fans of which desert is simply not 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.900
 allow legs to take place in the greenhouse 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.480
 and accelerates it too 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.880
 guys are the evil thing that does not require 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.389
 high consumption costs 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:28.139
 electricity in some cases not 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.960
 knew all this you can read 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.880
 clicking on it set out to reduce ssylochku 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.720
 teaching but also useful and necessary information 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.580
 you understand that in one movie so 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.010
 it's very hard to say 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 each tells remove systems 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:46.440
 training and especially mounting in them 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.360
 completely different and setting this 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.360
 go eat looks
