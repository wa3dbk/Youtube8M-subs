00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the grass blocks around here that can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.360 
the grass blocks around here that can
spread<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.600> except<00:00:58.229> for<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.440> one<00:00:58.499> we<00:00:59.010> gave<00:00:59.219> up

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
you know building a staircase down to

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.930 
you know building a staircase down to
the<00:02:07.469> ground<00:02:07.679> didn't<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.519> get<00:02:08.610> rid<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.849> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the ground didn't just get rid of it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.059 
the ground didn't just get rid of it
later<00:02:09.179> once<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> grass<00:02:10.200> spreads<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.890> don't

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
later once the grass spreads you don't

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.830 
later once the grass spreads you don't
absolutely<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.480> tried

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
absolutely have to have tried

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.809 
absolutely have to have tried
blocks<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> creative<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.550> I'm<00:02:14.640> going

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
blocks but I'm in creative so I'm going

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.190 
blocks but I'm in creative so I'm going
to<00:02:14.849> use<00:02:14.910> them<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.720> need<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> block<00:02:16.080> here

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
to use them now you need a block here

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.229 
to use them now you need a block here
this<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:16.980> is<00:02:17.099> temporary<00:02:17.580> we're<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.120> going

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
this one is temporary we're just going

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.940 
this one is temporary we're just going
to<00:02:18.269> build<00:02:18.510> off<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.680> build<00:02:19.860> a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
to build off of it and you build a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.050 
to build off of it and you build a
little<00:02:20.220> ring<00:02:20.489> like<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:22.280> not<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.519> we're

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
little ring like this not here we're

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.400 
little ring like this not here we're
going<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> get<00:02:24.330> rid<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.660> one<00:02:24.840> though<00:02:24.989> I'm

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to get rid of this one though I'm

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
going to get rid of this one though I'm
going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> place<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:25.950> dispenser<00:02:26.849> facing<00:02:27.660> this

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
going to place a dispenser facing this

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.479 
going to place a dispenser facing this
direction<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:29.010> we're<00:02:29.099> going<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.250> fill

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
direction and then we're going to fill

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.250 
direction and then we're going to fill
out<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> rest<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.209> ring<00:02:30.510> then<00:02:31.170> we're

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
out the rest of this ring then we're

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.940 
out the rest of this ring then we're
going<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.440> build<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.830> again<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.780> hear<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.830> can

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
going to build up again to hear you can

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.119 
going to build up again to hear you can
get<00:02:35.069> rid<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.250> these<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.870> make<00:02:36.870> one<00:02:37.530> more<00:02:37.799> ring

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
get rid of these and make one more ring

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.080 
get rid of these and make one more ring
and<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:40.049> as<00:02:40.739> far<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.519> I<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:41.700> as

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and this is as far as I know as

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.210 
and this is as far as I know as
efficient<00:02:42.660> as<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.080> can<00:02:43.230> get<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:43.980> grass

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
efficient as you can get for the grass

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
efficient as you can get for the grass
to<00:02:44.250> spread<00:02:44.790> to<00:02:45.329> down<00:02:45.510> there<00:02:45.860> minus<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> one

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
to spread to down there minus the one

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.030 
to spread to down there minus the one
for<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.640> dispenser<00:02:48.329> you<00:02:49.319> can't<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.739> keep

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
for the dispenser you can't really keep

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.069 
for the dispenser you can't really keep
grass<00:02:51.410> grass<00:02:52.410> here<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.940> dies<00:02:54.180> as<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
grass grass here because it dies as you

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.920 
grass grass here because it dies as you
saw<00:02:55.260> there<00:02:55.819> what<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.970> don't<00:02:57.180> have<00:02:57.390> to<00:02:57.599> do<00:02:57.720> this

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
saw there what you don't have to do this

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.300 
saw there what you don't have to do this
but<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.290> you're<00:02:58.410> going<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.709> any<00:02:59.010> baby

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
but if you're going to have any baby

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.339 
but if you're going to have any baby
sheep<00:02:59.640> inside<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.269> thing<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.660> any<00:03:00.810> point<00:03:01.049> you

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
sheep inside this thing at any point you

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.009 
sheep inside this thing at any point you
might<00:03:02.099> want<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.370> put<00:03:02.489> glass<00:03:02.819> blocks<00:03:03.180> here<00:03:03.660> you

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
might want to put glass blocks here you

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.440 
might want to put glass blocks here you
could<00:03:04.170> also<00:03:04.290> use<00:03:04.470> glowstone<00:03:05.370> or<00:03:05.910> anything

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
could also use glowstone or anything

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.610 
could also use glowstone or anything
that's<00:03:06.510> not<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:06.959> lower<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.470> light

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that's not going to lower the light

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.610 
that's not going to lower the light
level<00:03:07.980> on<00:03:08.129> top<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.760> these<00:03:08.849> grasp<00:03:09.209> blocks<00:03:09.780> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
level on top of these grasp blocks so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.280 
level on top of these grasp blocks so
that<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.980> grass<00:03:11.400> doesn't<00:03:11.730> die<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.170> by

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
that the grass doesn't die but just by

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.690 
that the grass doesn't die but just by
putting<00:03:13.470> those<00:03:13.650> four<00:03:13.950> blocks<00:03:14.190> there<00:03:14.400> that'll

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
putting those four blocks there that'll

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.879 
putting those four blocks there that'll
keep<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> sheep<00:03:15.180> enclosed<00:03:15.780> put<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> button

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
keep the sheep enclosed put a button

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
here inside you're going to place a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.949 
here inside you're going to place a
water<00:03:19.079> bucket<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.620> that's<00:03:20.190> it<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.569> do<00:03:21.720> need

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
water bucket and that's it you do need

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.379 
water bucket and that's it you do need
to<00:03:22.019> get<00:03:22.200> some<00:03:22.350> sheep<00:03:22.590> inside<00:03:23.069> do<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.180> however

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
stick around i'll show you how in just a
minute<00:03:28.859> but<00:03:29.069> that's<00:03:29.639> really<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:30.090> you<00:03:30.239> just<00:03:30.329> put

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
minute but that's really it you just put

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.990 
minute but that's really it you just put
sheep<00:03:30.569> in<00:03:30.959> there<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:32.569> your<00:03:33.569> farm<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.049> done<00:03:34.380> and

sheep in there and your farm is done and

sheep in there and your farm is done and
honestly<00:03:36.000> it's<00:03:36.299> actually<00:03:36.810> pretty<00:03:37.260> efficient

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
honestly it's actually pretty efficient

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.370 
honestly it's actually pretty efficient
unless<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.430> really<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:39.000> want<00:03:39.120> tons<00:03:39.959> and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
unless you really just want tons and

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.550 
unless you really just want tons and
tons<00:03:40.560> and<00:03:40.769> tons<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.160> wool<00:03:41.340> all<00:03:41.549> at<00:03:41.730> once

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
tons and tons of wool all at once

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.379 
tons and tons of wool all at once
because<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.709> doesn't<00:03:43.739> replenish<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.579> fast

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
because it doesn't replenish that fast

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:47.780 
because it doesn't replenish that fast
you<00:03:46.200> have<00:03:46.319> to<00:03:46.440> wait<00:03:46.590> for<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.889> to<00:03:46.919> regrow<00:03:47.459> and

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
you have to wait for it to regrow and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.420 
you have to wait for it to regrow and
then<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.389> sheep<00:03:48.599> to<00:03:48.750> eat<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:50.010> did<00:03:50.250> some

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
then the sheep to eat it and I did some

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.520 
then the sheep to eat it and I did some
testing<00:03:50.910> with<00:03:51.150> those<00:03:51.599> guys<00:03:51.810> over<00:03:52.049> there<00:03:52.169> the

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
testing with those guys over there the

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.250 
testing with those guys over there the
game<00:03:52.709> does<00:03:52.919> not<00:03:53.030> prioritize<00:03:54.030> if<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.840> sheep<00:03:55.049> has

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
game does not prioritize if a sheep has

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.770 
game does not prioritize if a sheep has
wool<00:03:55.709> or<00:03:56.099> does<00:03:56.280> not<00:03:56.519> have<00:03:56.700> wool<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.299> doesn't

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
wool or does not have wool it doesn't

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.690 
wool or does not have wool it doesn't
matter<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.470> has<00:03:58.650> seems<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.220> have<00:03:59.310> an<00:03:59.400> equal

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.620 
matter it has seems to have an equal
chance<00:03:59.730> of<00:04:00.060> actually<00:04:00.209> eating<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.750> grass<00:04:01.049> so

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
chance of actually eating the grass so

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.479 
chance of actually eating the grass so
sometimes<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:04.590> guys<00:04:04.739> already<00:04:05.010> have<00:04:05.099> wool<00:04:05.340> are

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
sometimes the guys already have wool are

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.670 
sometimes the guys already have wool are
going<00:04:05.639> to<00:04:05.700> eat<00:04:05.849> it<00:04:06.200> that's<00:04:07.200> just<00:04:07.410> the<00:04:07.470> way<00:04:07.590> it

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
going to eat it that's just the way it

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.729 
going to eat it that's just the way it
is<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.370> simple<00:04:08.849> simple<00:04:09.660> simple<00:04:09.739> there

to the wiki I'm going to assume it's

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.470 
to the wiki I'm going to assume it's
correct<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.830> this<00:04:28.920> case<00:04:29.220> now<00:04:29.880> in<00:04:30.120> order<00:04:30.330> to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.260 
correct in this case now in order to

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
accomplish that just put a torch a torch

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.900 
accomplish that just put a torch a torch
and<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.990> torch<00:04:34.260> now<00:04:34.530> your<00:04:34.770> area<00:04:35.130> around<00:04:35.490> here

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
and a torch now your area around here

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.110 
and a torch now your area around here
might<00:04:36.450> be<00:04:36.480> lit<00:04:36.900> up<00:04:37.050> I<00:04:37.770> you<00:04:38.520> may<00:04:38.700> not<00:04:38.880> actually

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
might be lit up I you may not actually

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.720 
might be lit up I you may not actually
need<00:04:39.480> these<00:04:39.630> torches<00:04:39.990> but<00:04:40.770> if<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.130> come<00:04:41.610> to

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
need these torches but if we come to

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.340 
need these torches but if we come to
this<00:04:41.940> one<00:04:42.180> which<00:04:42.210> is<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.660> only<00:04:42.810> one<00:04:43.140> with<00:04:43.290> a

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
this one which is the only one with a

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.440 
this one which is the only one with a
block<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.860> between<00:04:44.460> all<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.940> others<00:04:45.180> it's

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
block in between all the others it's

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.780 
block in between all the others it's
clear<00:04:45.750> so<00:04:46.020> if<00:04:46.140> we<00:04:46.230> check<00:04:46.440> it<00:04:46.800> we<00:04:47.160> know<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
clear so if we check it we know that the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.460 
clear so if we check it we know that the
others<00:04:48.000> are<00:04:48.150> right<00:04:48.390> so<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.930> hit<00:04:49.020> up<00:04:49.080> three

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
others are right so if we hit up three

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.010 
others are right so if we hit up three
here<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:49.920> we<00:04:50.610> go<00:04:50.730> right<00:04:51.030> here<00:04:51.060> let's<00:04:51.750> break

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
here and we go right here let's break

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.820 
here and we go right here let's break
this<00:04:52.230> block<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:53.460> block<00:04:53.670> light<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.150> 10<00:04:54.870> so

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
this block and the block light is 10 so

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.760 
this block and the block light is 10 so
we<00:04:56.580> are<00:04:56.730> fine<00:04:57.060> all<00:04:57.690> right<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:57.990> torch<00:04:58.290> torch<00:04:58.560> in

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
we are fine all right so torch torch in

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.410 
we are fine all right so torch torch in
the<00:04:58.830> torch<00:04:59.070> and<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.880> will<00:05:00.030> solve<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
the torch and that will solve the

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.760 
the torch and that will solve the
problem<00:05:01.370> anyway<00:05:02.540> that's<00:05:03.540> it<00:05:03.750> for<00:05:03.810> those<00:05:04.620> of

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
problem anyway that's it for those of

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.170 
problem anyway that's it for those of
you<00:05:04.920> know<00:05:05.070> how<00:05:05.160> to<00:05:05.250> get<00:05:05.340> sheep<00:05:05.580> in<00:05:05.760> here<00:05:06.000> and
