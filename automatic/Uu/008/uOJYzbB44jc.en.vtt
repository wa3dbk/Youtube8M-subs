to<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.429> run<00:02:05.459> because<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.849> normally<00:02:06.149> don't<00:02:06.209> have

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to the run because I normally don't have

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.790 
to the run because I normally don't have
a<00:02:06.390> problem<00:02:06.660> stopping<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.319> to<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.470> certain

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
a problem stopping it to a certain

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.089 
a problem stopping it to a certain
degree<00:02:08.179> so<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> wasn't<00:02:09.750> quite<00:02:09.959> in<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.590> complete

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
degree so I wasn't quite in the complete

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.440 
degree so I wasn't quite in the complete
run<00:02:11.310> d<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.730> could<00:02:11.880> see<00:02:11.970> he's<00:02:12.120> definitely

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
run d so you could see he's definitely

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.960 
run d so you could see he's definitely
breaking<00:02:12.630> off<00:02:12.870> some<00:02:13.050> decent<00:02:13.440> runs<00:02:13.620> but<00:02:14.400> oh<00:02:14.640> my

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
breaking off some decent runs but oh my

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.520 
breaking off some decent runs but oh my
god<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.270> can't<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.110> that<00:02:16.290> would've<00:02:16.470> been

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
god I can't get that that would've been

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.410 
god I can't get that that would've been
such<00:02:16.709> a<00:02:16.740> momentum<00:02:17.250> swing<00:02:17.490> right<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:18.150> we

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
such a momentum swing right there but we

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.480 
such a momentum swing right there but we
couldn't<00:02:18.780> but<00:02:19.530> we<00:02:19.680> had<00:02:19.800> some<00:02:19.830> pressure<00:02:20.190> coming

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
couldn't but we had some pressure coming

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.250 
couldn't but we had some pressure coming
so<00:02:20.670> he<00:02:20.790> lost<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.270> up<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.540> get<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.780> user<00:02:21.990> picks

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so he lost it up we get the user picks

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.960 
so he lost it up we get the user picks
so<00:02:22.560> we're<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.069> shape<00:02:23.130> however<00:02:23.730> there's

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
so we're in good shape however there's

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.670 
so we're in good shape however there's
only<00:02:24.090> 30<00:02:24.360> seconds<00:02:24.750> left<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:25.140> do<00:02:25.349> have<00:02:25.500> three

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
only 30 seconds left I do have three

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.960 
only 30 seconds left I do have three
timeouts<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.430> couldn't<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.760> anything

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
timeouts really couldn't do anything

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.850 
timeouts really couldn't do anything
there<00:02:27.270> so<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.200> didn't<00:02:28.410> want<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.560> make<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> mistake

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
there so I didn't want to make a mistake

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.949 
there so I didn't want to make a mistake
so<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.310> took<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.670> half<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.540> see<00:02:30.750> here

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
so we took it to half you can see here

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.260 
so we took it to half you can see here
throat<00:02:31.290> right<00:02:31.560> before<00:02:31.830> half<00:02:32.040> I'm<00:02:32.220> sorry<00:02:32.489> throw

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
throat right before half I'm sorry throw

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.630 
throat right before half I'm sorry throw
another<00:02:33.630> freaking<00:02:34.230> pig<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.520> why

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
another freaking pig so this is why

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
sometimes you got to really think about

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.390 
sometimes you got to really think about
what<00:02:36.989> you're<00:02:37.290> doing<00:02:37.319> here<00:02:37.770> because<00:02:38.040> look<00:02:38.280> at

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
this he's basically getting free points

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.530 
this he's basically getting free points
out<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.739> that's<00:02:41.580> an<00:02:41.700> extra<00:02:42.030> touch<00:02:42.239> down

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
know momentum wise and mentally I'm just

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
know momentum wise and mentally I'm just
beating<00:02:50.099> down<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.540> all<00:02:51.719> bad<00:02:52.040> he<00:02:53.299> now<00:02:54.299> he's

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
beating down so it's all bad he now he's

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.459 
beating down so it's all bad he now he's
starting<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.719> mix<00:02:54.870> in<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.079> mean<00:02:55.200> he<00:02:55.290> was

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
starting to mix in I mean he was

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:56.780 
starting to mix in I mean he was
throwing<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.739> little<00:02:56.010> bit<00:02:56.129> but<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.459> had<00:02:56.579> enough

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
throwing a little bit but we had enough

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.490 
throwing a little bit but we had enough
pressure<00:02:57.030> we<00:02:57.269> were<00:02:57.299> doing<00:02:57.719> good<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
pressure we were doing good and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.740 
pressure we were doing good and
momentarily<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.340> literally<00:02:59.760> want<00:03:00.360> a<00:03:00.390> sad<00:03:00.629> to

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
momentarily I literally want a sad to

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.119 
momentarily I literally want a sad to
start<00:03:00.959> committing<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.379> the<00:03:01.469> run<00:03:01.620> figure<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
start committing to the run figure and

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:03.259 
start committing to the run figure and
you<00:03:02.189> know<00:03:02.250> he's<00:03:02.400> just<00:03:02.489> gonna<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.790> wasting<00:03:03.120> time

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
you know he's just gonna be wasting time

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.270 
you know he's just gonna be wasting time
all<00:03:03.599> he<00:03:03.719> needs<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.140> is<00:03:04.170> really<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> field<00:03:05.069> goal

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
all he needs here is really a field goal

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.670 
all he needs here is really a field goal
and<00:03:05.579> then<00:03:06.299> he<00:03:06.390> goes<00:03:06.480> up<00:03:06.689> three<00:03:06.959> scores<00:03:07.319> with

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
and then he goes up three scores with

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.470 
and then he goes up three scores with
you<00:03:07.980> know<00:03:08.069> half<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.430> third<00:03:08.610> quarter<00:03:08.879> left<00:03:09.180> all

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you know half the third quarter left all

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.959 
you know half the third quarter left all
the<00:03:09.719> Momentum's<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.260> his<00:03:10.439> in<00:03:10.799> his<00:03:10.860> favor<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:11.730> I

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:11.969 
the Momentum's in his in his favor so I

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:13.729 
the Momentum's in his in his favor so I
got<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> do<00:03:12.659> something<00:03:13.079> fortunately<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.709> a

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
got to do something fortunately we get a

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.309 
got to do something fortunately we get a
little<00:03:13.920> coverage<00:03:14.640> sack<00:03:14.879> there<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.569> then<00:03:16.260> we

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
little coverage sack there and then we

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.780 
little coverage sack there and then we
start<00:03:16.560> locking<00:03:16.739> up<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.159> run<00:03:17.310> here<00:03:17.519> third

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
start locking up on the run here third

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.250 
start locking up on the run here third
and<00:03:17.939> 13<00:03:18.060> Owen<00:03:18.420> offsides<00:03:18.719> on<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.930> play<00:03:19.109> before

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and 13 Owen offsides on the play before

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.500 
and 13 Owen offsides on the play before
but<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> sent<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.980> little<00:03:20.219> heater<00:03:20.489> making<00:03:21.359> kick

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
but we sent a little heater making kick

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.599 
but we sent a little heater making kick
the<00:03:21.629> field<00:03:21.870> goal<00:03:21.989> which<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.590> sort<00:03:23.549> of

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
the field goal which is sort of

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.069 
the field goal which is sort of
bittersweet<00:03:23.909> at<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.329> point<00:03:24.599> because<00:03:24.780> it's

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
bittersweet at this point because it's

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.330 
bittersweet at this point because it's
not<00:03:25.200> really<00:03:25.379> gonna<00:03:25.469> help<00:03:25.620> out<00:03:25.769> our<00:03:25.799> scenario

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
not really gonna help out our scenario

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.069 
not really gonna help out our scenario
so<00:03:26.519> from<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.239> point<00:03:27.359> forward<00:03:27.780> we<00:03:27.959> got

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
so from this point forward we got

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.259 
so from this point forward we got
nothing<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.159> score<00:03:29.459> touchdowns<00:03:29.879> we

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
nothing to do but score touchdowns we

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.780 
nothing to do but score touchdowns we
have<00:03:30.390> no<00:03:30.599> choice<00:03:30.629> in<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.230> matter<00:03:31.640> field<00:03:32.640> goal

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
have no choice in the matter field goal

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.970 
have no choice in the matter field goal
though<00:03:32.969> it<00:03:33.090> could<00:03:33.209> help<00:03:33.450> us<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:34.620> know<00:03:34.739> in<00:03:34.890> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
though it could help us you know in the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.289 
though it could help us you know in the
big<00:03:35.129> scheme<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.370> things<00:03:35.489> I<00:03:35.730> was<00:03:35.849> thinking<00:03:36.150> more

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
big scheme of things I was thinking more

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.030 
big scheme of things I was thinking more
or<00:03:36.390> less<00:03:36.510> two-point<00:03:36.930> conversions<00:03:37.500> just<00:03:37.950> in

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
or less two-point conversions just in

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.729 
or less two-point conversions just in
case<00:03:38.189> he<00:03:38.219> would<00:03:38.519> score<00:03:38.819> again<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.499> you<00:03:40.499> can<00:03:40.530> see

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
case he would score again so you can see

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:41.809 
case he would score again so you can see
we're<00:03:40.950> already<00:03:41.040> into<00:03:41.249> the<00:03:41.400> fourth<00:03:41.609> quarter

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
we're already into the fourth quarter

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.690 
we're already into the fourth quarter
here<00:03:42.319> my<00:03:43.319> offense<00:03:43.829> is<00:03:43.980> finally<00:03:44.340> starting<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
here my offense is finally starting to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.149 
here my offense is finally starting to
warm<00:03:44.939> up<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.269> certain<00:03:45.540> degree<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:46.170> we're

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
warm up to a certain degree and we're

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.709 
warm up to a certain degree and we're
able<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.489> punch<00:03:47.670> it<00:03:47.879> in<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.299> that's<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.569> plus

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:48.719 
able to punch it in so that's a plus

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.140 
able to punch it in so that's a plus
there<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.620> go<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:50.129> the<00:03:50.159> two-point<00:03:50.310> conversion

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
there I go for the two-point conversion

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.559 
there I go for the two-point conversion
don't<00:03:51.420> get<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> though<00:03:52.109> oh<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.760> now<00:03:53.790> you<00:03:54.480> know

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
actually been picked right there and I'm

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.510 
actually been picked right there and I'm
thinking<00:04:30.780> about<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.260> but<00:04:31.410> we<00:04:32.070> knew<00:04:32.220> where<00:04:32.400> we

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
thinking about it but we knew where we

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.400 
thinking about it but we knew where we
wanted<00:04:32.730> to<00:04:32.790> go<00:04:32.880> with<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> ball<00:04:33.450> but<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:34.110> just

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
wanted to go with the ball but I just

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.260 
wanted to go with the ball but I just
wasn't<00:04:34.590> effective<00:04:35.310> I<00:04:35.460> mean<00:04:35.670> he<00:04:35.760> was<00:04:35.970> running

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
wasn't effective I mean he was running

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.620 
wasn't effective I mean he was running
heavy<00:04:36.480> max<00:04:36.840> covered<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:37.970> you<00:04:38.970> know<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.120> can't

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
heavy max covered so you know I can't

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.910 
heavy max covered so you know I can't
blame<00:04:39.810> him<00:04:39.930> he's<00:04:40.050> got<00:04:40.200> blocked<00:04:40.440> shedders<00:04:40.770> for

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
blame him he's got blocked shedders for

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.050 
blame him he's got blocked shedders for
days<00:04:41.100> with<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.370> 49ers<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:41.850> can<00:04:41.970> see

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
days with the 49ers you can see

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.840 
days with the 49ers you can see
literally<00:04:42.360> Russian<00:04:42.780> one<00:04:42.990> dude<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:44.760> know

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
literally Russian one dude and you know

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.040 
literally Russian one dude and you know
sometime<00:04:45.240> I<00:04:45.270> mean<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.570> would<00:04:45.600> say<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.960> majority

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
sometime I mean I would say the majority

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.080 
sometime I mean I would say the majority
of<00:04:46.320> time<00:04:46.470> he<00:04:46.620> was<00:04:46.740> rushed<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.160> people<00:04:47.610> so

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
of time he was rushed to people so

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.540 
of time he was rushed to people so
sometimes<00:04:48.990> it<00:04:49.440> can<00:04:49.620> be<00:04:49.650> especially<00:04:50.190> when

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
sometimes it can be especially when

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.040 
sometimes it can be especially when
you're<00:04:50.670> down<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.150> know<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.450> couple<00:04:51.660> scores

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
you're down you know a couple scores

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.690 
you're down you know a couple scores
late<00:04:52.320> in<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.500> game<00:04:52.680> I<00:04:52.950> can't<00:04:53.340> blame<00:04:53.550> them

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
late in the game I can't blame them

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.520 
late in the game I can't blame them
because<00:04:53.850> you<00:04:54.630> know<00:04:54.720> he<00:04:54.810> needs<00:04:54.990> more<00:04:55.200> people<00:04:55.320> in

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
because you know he needs more people in

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.650 
because you know he needs more people in
the<00:04:55.620> backfield<00:04:55.800> but<00:04:56.280> unless<00:04:57.060> we<00:04:57.120> break<00:04:57.389> one<00:04:57.570> up

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
the backfield but unless we break one up

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.960 
the backfield but unless we break one up
the<00:04:57.780> middle<00:04:57.810> on<00:04:58.200> them<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.039> you<00:04:59.550> know<00:04:59.669> come<00:04:59.849> in
