00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello everyone decided all the same 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.830
 post a video about chaga 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.120
 although I did it in the winter when my husband 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.980
 gathered Charles birch found and video like 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 would not be a bit finished but because I 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 planned to further show how 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.420
 brew it but we accidentally burned 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.890
 chaga therefore want to show you 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.140
 impression of children from tea after all what 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.029
 tea is out 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.039
 through the video which has already managed to remove and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 I 'll tell you now just because 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.050
 will start asking well you will start asking 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.800
 questions what concentrate how to brew 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 so I brewed 1 teaspoon chaga 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.309
 crushed as small as possible 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.559
 on this as a brew will be on 3 somewhere 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.059
 a cup of tea that is, as a concentrate 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 did i see you give up 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.250
 concentrate the video further and I already then 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.680
 poured into cups for children less strong 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 Your husband is stronger 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.530
 can control this flavoring on 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 taste stronger and weaker 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.949
 By the way my husband really liked 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.630
 also did not have time to just take it all off but 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.270
 I want to enter that such information to you 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.549
 give what we saw ourselves know 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.970
 it means her husband really liked it in the form 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.009
 coffee when he started this straight 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.380
 drinking sugar free drying i'm like coffee 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.200
 it is possible to replace at all volt very tasty 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.720
 I certainly donâ€™t like bitter coffee 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.700
 so we drank it in the form of tea and who 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.380
 watched our videos further with trips to 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.509
 forest we took this tea with us while we 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.540
 he was not burned by this mushroom by chance on 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.950
 They took the stove with pleasure they drank right now 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.570
 sorry we lost that one 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.549
 Mushroom are looking for it can not find 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.170
 of course you can buy it on the market 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.530
 Likely and we will make here at the nearest 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.170
 the trip but look how we did it 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.590
 as it crushed there what I had time 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.850
 I hope that you somehow help 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.399
 it means brewed another such moment 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.200
 I brewed tea as usual tea that is 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.020
 I did not boil it did not boil just 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.750
 poured tea into a cup of tea 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.659
 boiled water spoon well boiled 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 boiling water kettle and he stood like 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.930
 ordinary brewing that is insisted if 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.520
 you and special teapot mean 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.830
 special teapot I did it in 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.710
 ordinary cup 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.560
 we always make tea of the present 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.130
 number ten is probably boiling water and that's it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.020
 and pour into cups we make hearth tea and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.930
 steps this chaga birch mushroom who saw 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.520
 how more was going to if you have not seen 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.040
 put and be sure how he went to 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.520
 the forest here he collected some of it 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.790
 cone of course it is desirable to handle 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.770
 when it is fresh when it is not dried 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.690
 we didn't just have opportunities there and 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.500
 the beam in the background shouts little Lena 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.390
 be quiet I was not able to immediately him 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.209
 to sort out what I immediately point is his 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.540
 washed because he grows in 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.510
 the forest 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.550
 it would seem yes high on birches but 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.430
 the wind causes different blades of mote 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.260
 therefore it is desirable that we mean I 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.380
 happiness that breaks very easily 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.570
 show sonechka show you below. 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:11.360
 look very easy breaks that is 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:14.209
 these ones are already part of a bad break 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.910
 where the black is bad we break it 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:23.780
 then we grind and that's watch 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:26.959
 very lightly it is as light as foam 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.540
 this is a bait after all where there is no 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.420
 black night mikola pray there I 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.820
 present this black bezel 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.680
 there it is hard to break it means my goal 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.489
 Now grind it as much as possible 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.630
 then we will start to study and I'm in this 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:46.690
 video clip 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.740
 I'll fill you with tea 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:54.370
 on sight I will say what taste it is possible 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.080
 I donâ€™t know whether to drink it at all 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.140
 how do we not live here to know the exact 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.320
 Transbaikalia I was told that they drink chaga 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.720
 instead of ordinary tea, the only thing 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.080
 Board has a begin to drink 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.700
 a little bit because you need to watch 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.590
 each one as it affects the body as well as on 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.060
 chamomile like alimentary other things 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:17.700
 someone might just be allergic to 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.790
 This product means they say that it is 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:26.190
 tea substitute very useful very chaga 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:30.010
 useful boosts immunity and then 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:34.890
 relieves fatigue and so on here i'm 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.890
 I prepared the kids avatar tea steps I 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:47.470

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.390

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.820

 This tea we have here from this mushroom 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.040
 Here I brew 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.210
 separately in a cup very 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.229

 as bitter as bedbugs I look like 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:22.020
 you can control the taste 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:25.260
 just adding concentrate here 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.260
