what<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> view<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> good<00:01:23.100> trigger

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
what so is this a view of a good trigger

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.340 
what so is this a view of a good trigger
finger<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.360> very<00:01:24.390> consistent<00:01:25.140> three

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
finger this is a very consistent three

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
finger this is a very consistent three
shot<00:01:25.590> kill<00:01:25.860> many<00:01:26.700> ranges<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.390> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
shot kill many ranges and I think it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.010 
shot kill many ranges and I think it
only<00:01:27.600> goes<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.200> four-shot<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:29.100> long<00:01:29.610> range

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
only goes up to a four-shot a long range

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.300 
only goes up to a four-shot a long range
maybe<00:01:31.020> 5<00:01:31.320> i'm<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.619> sure<00:01:31.740> that's<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.189> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
maybe 5 i'm not sure that's just how it
