each<00:05:18.250> other<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.520> lot<00:05:18.700> more<00:05:18.760> because<00:05:19.270> we<00:05:20.230> spent

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
each other a lot more because we spent

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.659 
each other a lot more because we spent
so<00:05:20.620> much<00:05:20.830> time<00:05:20.919> with<00:05:21.280> each<00:05:21.370> other<00:05:21.580> and

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
so much time with each other and

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.159 
so much time with each other and
something<00:05:22.030> you<00:05:22.090> know<00:05:22.180> in<00:05:22.300> the<00:05:22.390> past<00:05:22.570> it<00:05:22.810> got<00:05:23.020> no

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
something you know in the past it got no

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.810 
something you know in the past it got no
I'm<00:05:23.500> completely<00:05:23.710> right<00:05:24.160> about<00:05:24.430> this<00:05:24.610> but

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
I'm completely right about this but

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.370 
I'm completely right about this but
we've<00:05:25.419> kind<00:05:25.660> of<00:05:25.720> learned<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.050> you're<00:05:26.290> not

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
we've kind of learned that you're not

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.800 
we've kind of learned that you're not
always<00:05:26.710> right<00:05:26.860> which<00:05:27.640> made<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.330> last<00:05:28.510> album

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
always right which made the last album

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.630 
always right which made the last album
and<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.410> music<00:05:29.770> that<00:05:29.890> we're<00:05:30.040> working<00:05:30.100> on<00:05:30.430> now

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
and the music that we're working on now

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.600 
and the music that we're working on now
a<00:05:30.940> lot<00:05:31.210> easier<00:05:31.600> think<00:05:32.140> yeah<00:05:32.740> I'd<00:05:33.280> agree<00:05:33.580> with

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
a lot easier think yeah I'd agree with

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.630 
a lot easier think yeah I'd agree with
that<00:05:33.730> I<00:05:34.030> suppose<00:05:34.650> yeah<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.860> benefits<00:05:36.280> of<00:05:36.430> time

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
that I suppose yeah the benefits of time

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.670 
that I suppose yeah the benefits of time
is<00:05:36.940> that<00:05:37.450> you<00:05:37.570> learn<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.900> trust<00:05:38.080> each<00:05:38.350> other's

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
is that you learn to trust each other's

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:47.370 
is that you learn to trust each other's
opinions

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.440 

you
