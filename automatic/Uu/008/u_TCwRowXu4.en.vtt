00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.030
 that went up in the other as I explained in the 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 video uploading the channel in a bad way 20 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.809
 a video explaining why I'm going to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.219
 start uploading on this channel and good if 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.379
 subscribe to this channel and they are 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.029
 subscribed and watched this video or if you 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.850
 I appreciate very much that you are here 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.020
 thank you very much I know that this 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 you know that I love you all 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.960
 and what they see in the background is a game with 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.330
 the new update already made as 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.189
 can see is I have a nacher and now 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.290
 I think I'm going to put the lance 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.790
 I'm going to show there to see now when I 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.440
 changed the camera changed to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.489
 kill him sometimes he is far away and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 ready 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.120
 here they see that I have the cast dylan yesterday 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.700
 we can have both from the beginning 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.280
 I wanted to tell you also if you see that the 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.530
 video quality is in 480 is not in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 720 as it usually is although the video in 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.899
 yes it 's from YouTube you will be able to put 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.980
 4 in 720 sorry it will not be in 720 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.510
 because it looks a little bit different 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.309
 surely there are many people I notice it is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 because I was trying when I do 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 livestream the quality was changed so that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.010
 you see everything much more fluid I like 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.270
 that is fluid and that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.760
 although I have a good connection 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.080
 internet my computer is not the best and 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.000
 good as I tell you how I had to 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.770
 change the resolution to my xbox 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.630
 Then I got in once I finished 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.280
 doing all that I was trying to see 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.650
 if it looked good or not in the channel 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 tweets tv I was trying a little and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.090
 how it looked good and how good I left it 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.250
 well in 480 and later when I got into 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 another day I forgot to change it and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.390
 put it to 720 once it enters the game 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 and well I eat very lazy porsche 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 I said ah I'm here I 'm going to play and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
 well I will have played like a few 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.890
 games I have to say is it seems to me 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.780
 which was the third the fourth game that 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 was with this new update and with 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.800
 what I'm going to say I do not want it to look like 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.050
 I say that I am the best or nothing for the 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.030
 style I always say that there are millions 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.370
 and millions of people better than me 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.930
 when it rises but what I have to 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.090
 to say is that once with this 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.440
 update and once I learned well 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.880
 to use when I have to take the 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.770
 launches and when I have to use it nasser 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 because the first two games I have 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.580
 to say that the release does not touch 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.500
 for nothing practically when I 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.690
 he agreed was when he was dead or 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.600
 when he said there he was far away he was taken 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.800
 I cast it and killed it faster I have 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.850
 that if the first games only 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.100
 they used the nasa but 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.950
 I got used to when to use the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.570
 launches and when to use it nasser is that 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.170
 I will have played about ten games that day 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.780
 and I was in eight of them I took the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
 I saw the color of the game but I'm going 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.980
 by 500 points differences more or less 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.420
 what does this mean I do not tell you 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.430
 I do not want to say that I'm the best 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.490
 or nothing but surely I will have had a 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.320
 little bit of luck but what I get out of 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.370
 conclusion with this is that with these two 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.470
 weapons allows much more or less the game 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.240
 on equipment minus choosing weapons so 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.470
 less in public games to me is something 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.210
 I like it because if in games 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.070
 public people do not speak for the micro 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.780
 and as there is no communication did not get one 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.760
 you can stay in good one uses the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.440
 launches and another uses give yesterday in a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.890
 public game with a game where 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.300
 you are for fun is not a game 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.740
 competitive or anything like that for 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.110
 I tell you that I like this very much 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.180
 more since a person can earn itself 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.650
 a game very easily 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.080
 with these two weapons having both 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.700
 weapons that once we had a 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.280
 manager because we had to be 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.500
 forced to approach the enemy yes or yes 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.730
 and now with the lancer not a person 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.349
 as I say 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.150
 and you know what they do and take 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.940
 good decisions are going to be able to win 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.230
 departure for your team of you alone 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.930
 quietly and it was good after 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.250
 other changes of the boxes still not what 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.349
 I could try it because they did not give me any 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.970
 box in the games that I played but in 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.280
 as long as I have a box and try and 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.080
 I leave a couple of things because I tell you the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.280
 update is already done once 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.900
 upload this video and see this video the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.970
 update is already in case there was 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.190
 people who had asked me in if I think 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 that 3 hours after the video went up 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.579
 the update was already set so 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.049
 less here in Spain and good the departure 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.760
 it's over I have to tell you that this 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.980
 update at least I liked it 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.989
 very much I want to know your opinions what 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.359
 you think they are updating for 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.849
 I improved the game a lot and it's done 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.349
 much more fun to play and not as before 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.819
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.480
 Enjoy with this new update and 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.480
 we see ourselves bold
