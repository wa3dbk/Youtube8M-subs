see<00:02:24.209> from<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.480> stats<00:02:24.719> I've<00:02:24.930> played<00:02:25.439> quite<00:02:25.680> a

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
see from the stats I've played quite a

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.800 
see from the stats I've played quite a
few<00:02:25.980> games<00:02:26.219> within<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.549> six<00:02:27.000> seventy<00:02:27.390> six<00:02:27.599> games

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
few games within a six seventy six games

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.599 
few games within a six seventy six games
to<00:02:27.900> them<00:02:28.109> and<00:02:28.260> 28<00:02:28.709> goals<00:02:28.920> which<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.250> think<00:02:29.459> it's

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
to them and 28 goals which I think it's

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:31.220 
to them and 28 goals which I think it's
not<00:02:29.730> too<00:02:29.849> bad<00:02:30.030> especially<00:02:30.510> if<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.140> consider

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
not too bad especially if you consider

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920 
not too bad especially if you consider
his<00:02:31.680> stats<00:02:31.950> aren't<00:02:32.220> only<00:02:32.579> the<00:02:32.790> best<00:02:33.000> 59

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
his stats aren't only the best 59

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.149 
his stats aren't only the best 59
shooting<00:02:34.349> is<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> greatest<00:02:34.859> but

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:35.159 
shooting is of the greatest but

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:37.190 
shooting is of the greatest but
hopefully<00:02:35.549> with<00:02:36.030> this<00:02:36.150> team<00:02:36.420> we<00:02:36.599> can<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:37.049> can

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
hopefully with this team we can we can

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.020 
hopefully with this team we can we can
score<00:02:37.409> a<00:02:37.470> bunch<00:02:37.829> of<00:02:37.980> course<00:02:38.250> with<00:02:38.489> him<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.000> that

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
score a bunch of course with him so that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.210 
score a bunch of course with him so that
is<00:02:39.299> pretty<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.659> a<00:02:39.720> team<00:02:39.930> as<00:02:40.709> always<00:02:41.040> there

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.149 
tackled messy from behind so my opponent
was<00:04:06.930> there<00:04:07.109> to<00:04:07.229> pick<00:04:07.349> up<00:04:07.409> a<00:04:07.560> penalty<00:04:07.949> and

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
was there to pick up a penalty and

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.710 
was there to pick up a penalty and
pretty<00:04:08.489> much<00:04:08.549> make<00:04:08.849> it<00:04:09.030> game<00:04:09.209> over<00:04:09.389> and<00:04:09.629> that

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
pretty much make it game over and that

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.599 
pretty much make it game over and that
is<00:04:09.840> what<00:04:10.019> he<00:04:10.139> did<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:10.889> went<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.159> the<00:04:11.459> right

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
is what he did we went to the right

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.309 
is what he did we went to the right
corner<00:04:11.879> but<00:04:12.120> unfortunately<00:04:12.720> still<00:04:13.049> made<00:04:13.290> it

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
corner but unfortunately still made it

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.949 
corner but unfortunately still made it
to<00:04:13.439> nil<00:04:13.769> again<00:04:14.189> with<00:04:14.459> messy<00:04:14.970> so<00:04:15.239> we<00:04:15.659> ended<00:04:15.870> up

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
to nil again with messy so we ended up

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.319 
to nil again with messy so we ended up
losing<00:04:16.289> our<00:04:16.380> first<00:04:16.680> came<00:04:17.009> with<00:04:17.220> two<00:04:17.430> nil<00:04:17.699> I<00:04:17.880> can

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
losing our first came with two nil I can

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.360 
losing our first came with two nil I can
see<00:04:18.479> from<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.780> stats<00:04:19.019> we<00:04:19.169> had<00:04:19.259> Sarah<00:04:19.650> shots<00:04:20.159> on

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
see from the stats we had Sarah shots on

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.550 
see from the stats we had Sarah shots on
target<00:04:20.400> so<00:04:21.030> yet<00:04:21.599> was<00:04:21.780> more<00:04:21.959> than<00:04:22.079> deserve<00:04:22.260> to

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
target so yet was more than deserve to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.920 
target so yet was more than deserve to
win<00:04:22.680> for<00:04:22.710> my<00:04:22.979> opponent<00:04:23.729> so<00:04:24.419> we<00:04:24.510> go<00:04:24.630> into<00:04:24.750> the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
win for my opponent so we go into the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.240 
win for my opponent so we go into the
second<00:04:25.260> game<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.529> final<00:04:25.710> game<00:04:25.889> of<00:04:26.010> this

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
second game the final game of this

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.800 
second game the final game of this
episode<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.820> again<00:04:27.090> become

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
episode and again become

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.360 
episode and again become
guess<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.139> pretty<00:04:28.410> strong<00:04:28.650> team<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.070> Aguero

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
guess a pretty strong team with Aguero

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.240 
guess a pretty strong team with Aguero
DeMaria<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.450> also<00:04:30.720> has<00:04:30.900> our<00:04:31.139> I<00:04:31.169> think<00:04:31.560> also<00:04:31.740> mm

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
DeMaria and also has our I think also mm
