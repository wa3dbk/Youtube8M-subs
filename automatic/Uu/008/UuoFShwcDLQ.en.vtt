we'll put some names in there sales now

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.979 
we'll put some names in there sales now
we're<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.450> simple<00:00:42.629> spreadsheet

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we're just a really simple spreadsheet

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
we're just a really simple spreadsheet
now<00:00:43.950> we're<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> save<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.610> as<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> comma

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
now we're going to save this as a comma

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
now we're going to save this as a comma
separated<00:00:46.050> text<00:00:46.469> file<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> different

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
separated text file which is a different

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
separated text file which is a different
way<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:47.969> representing<00:00:48.780> data<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
way of representing data in a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.150 
way of representing data in a
spreadsheet

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
spreadsheet

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.850 
spreadsheet
it<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.789> takes<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> Excel<00:00:52.320> format

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
it actually takes it out of Excel format

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000 
it actually takes it out of Excel format
and<00:00:53.070> puts<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.399> into<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.730> text<00:00:54.510> format<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.170> each

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
and puts it into a text format and each

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.970 
and puts it into a text format and each
of<00:00:56.250> these<00:00:56.399> cells<00:00:57.149> and<00:00:57.600> rows<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:58.260> separated<00:00:58.530> by

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of these cells and rows are separated by

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.720 
of these cells and rows are separated by
a<00:00:59.960> comma<00:01:01.070> this<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> real<00:01:02.460> good<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
a comma this is real good for

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.479 
a comma this is real good for
transferring<00:01:03.600> data<00:01:04.049> between<00:01:04.489> applications

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
transferring data between applications

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
transferring data between applications
because<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.820> puts<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:06.659> simple

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
because it puts it in a very simple

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.950 
because it puts it in a very simple
format<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.799> easy<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.220> read<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.659> let's<00:01:09.659> save

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
format it's easy to read so let's save

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.960 
format it's easy to read so let's save
this<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> comma<00:01:10.710> separated<00:01:11.369> by<00:01:11.520> clicking<00:01:11.880> on

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
this as a comma separated by clicking on

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.330 
this as a comma separated by clicking on
our<00:01:12.119> office<00:01:12.479> button<00:01:13.640> you<00:01:14.640> go<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.820> save<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.390> then
