the shows have been getting smaller and
smaller<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:50.219> doesn't<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.550> concern

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
smaller and that doesn't really concern

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.819 
smaller and that doesn't really concern
me<00:00:50.910> because<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.870> much<00:00:52.079> fun<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
me because it's so much fun to have that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
me because it's so much fun to have that
small<00:00:53.160> intimate<00:00:53.550> group<00:00:53.850> however<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:55.050> shows

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
small intimate group however it shows

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.630 
small intimate group however it shows
you<00:00:55.379> should<00:00:55.530> be<00:00:55.620> gigantic<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.520> it's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you should be gigantic and I think it's

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.799 
you should be gigantic and I think it's
because<00:00:56.699> I'm<00:00:56.969> just<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.300> advertising
