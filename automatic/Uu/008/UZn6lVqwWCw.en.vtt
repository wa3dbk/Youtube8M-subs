it's<00:02:26.860> time<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.130> decide<00:02:27.400> exactly<00:02:27.610> what<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
it's time to decide exactly what you

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.460 
it's time to decide exactly what you
want<00:02:28.420> to<00:02:28.480> do<00:02:28.570> with<00:02:28.690> your<00:02:28.810> character<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.320> make

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
want to do with your character to make

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.060 
want to do with your character to make
it<00:02:29.590> best<00:02:29.830> for<00:02:30.070> sniping<00:02:30.490> now<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.860> say

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
it best for sniping now I'm going to say

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.720 
it best for sniping now I'm going to say
two<00:02:33.400> special<00:02:34.120> traits<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.350> will<00:02:35.530> make<00:02:35.890> your

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
two special traits that will make your

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.660 
two special traits that will make your
character<00:02:37.270> better<00:02:37.600> at<00:02:37.750> sniping<00:02:37.990> first<00:02:38.860> is

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
character better at sniping first is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.320 
character better at sniping first is
agility<00:02:40.330> and<00:02:40.540> second<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.380> perception<00:02:42.330> agility

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
agility and second is perception agility

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.920 
agility and second is perception agility
because<00:02:44.050> it<00:02:44.740> gives<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.220> more<00:02:45.760> action<00:02:46.510> points

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
because it gives you more action points

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.550 
because it gives you more action points
and<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:48.340> also<00:02:48.760> increases<00:02:49.420> your<00:02:49.720> overall<00:02:49.900> gun

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
and it also increases your overall gun

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.880 
and it also increases your overall gun
skill<00:02:51.360> perception<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:53.200> I'll<00:02:53.500> let<00:02:53.770> you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
skill perception because I'll let you

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.440

perception by one now both these ends
can<00:03:23.140> be<00:03:23.320> more<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.650> same<00:03:23.860> time<00:03:24.130> so<00:03:24.700> you<00:03:24.760> can

just<00:03:28.660> for<00:03:28.900> sniping<00:03:29.320> and<00:03:29.500> then<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:29.830> can<00:03:29.950> switch

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
just for sniping and then you can switch

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.280 
just for sniping and then you can switch

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
consider are the skills now there are

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.660 
consider are the skills now there are
two<00:03:38.350> main<00:03:38.560> skills<00:03:38.950> you're<00:03:39.310> going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.460> want<00:03:39.640> to

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
two main skills you're going to want to

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.910 
two main skills you're going to want to
worry<00:03:39.820> about<00:03:39.940> one<00:03:40.480> is<00:03:40.750> guns<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.200> course<00:03:41.260> and

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
worry about one is guns of course and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.700 
worry about one is guns of course and
that's<00:03:42.070> easy<00:03:42.420> second<00:03:43.420> though<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:44.020> sneak<00:03:44.470> and

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 
that's easy second though is sneak and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.170 
that's easy second though is sneak and
you<00:03:44.770> might<00:03:44.920> be<00:03:45.010> wondering<00:03:45.160> why<00:03:45.460> well<00:03:46.090> it's

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
you might be wondering why well it's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.000 
you might be wondering why well it's
because<00:03:46.390> when<00:03:46.570> you're<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:46.780> sneak<00:03:47.140> mode<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.860> do

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
because when you're in sneak mode you do

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.790 
because when you're in sneak mode you do
critical<00:03:48.370> damage<00:03:48.940> making<00:03:49.630> each<00:03:49.780> shot<00:03:50.140> do<00:03:50.770> a

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
critical damage making each shot do a

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.890 
critical damage making each shot do a
little<00:03:51.100> bit<00:03:51.280> more<00:03:51.310> being<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.210> lot<00:03:52.450> easier<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
little bit more being it a lot easier to

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.470 
little bit more being it a lot easier to
get<00:03:52.990> one<00:03:53.260> shots<00:03:53.650> on<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:53.950> web<00:03:54.100> on<00:03:54.850> enemies<00:03:55.270> as

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
get one shots on the web on enemies as

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.930 
get one shots on the web on enemies as
you<00:03:55.990> can<00:03:56.110> see<00:03:56.290> right<00:03:56.440> there<00:03:56.500> when<00:03:57.040> I<00:03:57.070> was<00:03:57.460> not

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
you can see right there when I was not

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.000 
you can see right there when I was not
getting<00:03:58.690> it<00:03:58.780> critical<00:03:59.170> to<00:03:59.200> take<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.650> few<00:03:59.830> more

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
getting it critical to take a few more

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.420 
getting it critical to take a few more
shots<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.720> the<00:04:02.200> higher<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.410> sneak<00:04:02.800> the<00:04:03.220> less

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
shots so the higher the sneak the less

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.980 
shots so the higher the sneak the less
you'll<00:04:03.580> be<00:04:03.700> seen<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.150> easier<00:04:04.510> LBD<00:04:04.960> and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
of course the sniper perk which

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.860 
of course the sniper perk which
increases<00:04:24.340> your<00:04:24.490> accuracy<00:04:25.000> to<00:04:25.330> hit<00:04:25.360> someone's

your critical damage which of course

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.520 
your critical damage which of course
will<00:04:32.819> make<00:04:32.970> each<00:04:33.270> sneak<00:04:33.750> attack<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.319> any
