00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
and a friendly offense but can you take

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
the draft I think the popular answer

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:05.809 
the draft I think the popular answer
there<00:02:04.499> is<00:02:04.529> wide<00:02:04.799> receiver<00:02:05.219> i'm<00:02:05.429> not<00:02:05.579> sure<00:02:05.789> that

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
there is wide receiver i'm not sure that

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.059 
there is wide receiver i'm not sure that

going<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.920> need<00:02:26.010> help<00:02:26.160> at<00:02:26.340> outside<00:02:26.610> linebacker

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
going to need help at outside linebacker

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.190 
going to need help at outside linebacker
they're<00:02:27.180> going<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.360> need<00:02:27.450> more<00:02:27.630> depth<00:02:27.900> there

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200

they're going to need more depth there
and<00:02:28.410> other<00:02:29.370> than<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.730> they're<00:02:30.000> in<00:02:30.090> pretty

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
and other than that they're in pretty

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
and other than that they're in pretty
good<00:02:30.300> shape<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:30.810> they're<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.020> position

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
good shape I think they're in position

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780 
good shape I think they're in position
to<00:02:31.410> kind<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.650> let<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> draft<00:02:32.160> board<00:02:32.310> come<00:02:32.610> to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
to kind of let the draft board come to

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.130 
to kind of let the draft board come to
them<00:02:32.940> which<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.210> how<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.420> teams<00:02:33.780> would<00:02:34.020> like

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
them which is how all teams would like

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.510 
them which is how all teams would like
to<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.410> good<00:02:34.740> position<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.130> be<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.370> although

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
to do good position to be and although
