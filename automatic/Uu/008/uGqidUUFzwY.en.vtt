00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.139 
English system in this training we are
going<00:01:59.140> to<00:01:59.290> begin<00:01:59.470> by<00:02:00.159> looking<00:02:00.610> at<00:02:00.759> the<00:02:00.880> problem

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
going to begin by looking at the problem

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.630 
going to begin by looking at the problem
of<00:02:01.420> English<00:02:01.780> then<00:02:02.530> move<00:02:02.829> a<00:02:02.979> little<00:02:03.130> bit<00:02:03.340> more

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
of English then move a little bit more

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.760 
of English then move a little bit more
into<00:02:04.210> some<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.509> the<00:02:04.770> oversimplifications

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
into some of the oversimplifications

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
into some of the oversimplifications
we've<00:02:06.009> been<00:02:06.189> taught<00:02:06.490> about<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.759> language<00:02:07.270> and

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
we've been taught about the language and

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.989 
we've been taught about the language and
then<00:02:08.560> begin<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:08.950> talk<00:02:09.279> about<00:02:09.429> learning<00:02:09.759> styles

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:09.999 
then begin to talk about learning styles

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:12.539 
then begin to talk about learning styles
it<00:02:10.450> will<00:02:10.899> be<00:02:11.079> a<00:02:11.109> few<00:02:11.379> hours<00:02:11.439> into<00:02:12.069> the<00:02:12.309> video

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
it will be a few hours into the video

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.459 
it will be a few hours into the video
before<00:02:12.939> we<00:02:13.059> get<00:02:13.180> into<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.659> details<00:02:14.169> of<00:02:14.379> the

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
before we get into the details of the

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:14.820 
before we get into the details of the
rule

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
rule

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.530 
rule
fools<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.310> phonograms<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.150> believe

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
fools and the phonograms but I believe

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
fools and the phonograms but I believe
that<00:02:16.570> by<00:02:16.900> laying<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.410> foundation<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.730> can

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that by laying this foundation we can

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.730 
that by laying this foundation we can
understand<00:02:19.540> how<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.720> teach<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.290> rules<00:02:20.470> and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
understand how to teach the rules and

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.490 
understand how to teach the rules and
phonograms<00:02:21.280> more<00:02:21.580> effectively<00:02:22.240> so<00:02:22.500> let's

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
phonograms more effectively so let's

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740 
phonograms more effectively so let's
begin
