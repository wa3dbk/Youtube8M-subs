to do it 10 times more you know and
that's<00:00:59.650> what<00:00:59.830> that's<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.070> very<00:01:00.220> typical<00:01:00.339> for<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
that's what that's a very typical for a

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.119 
that's what that's a very typical for a
teenager<00:01:01.150> I<00:01:01.330> think<00:01:01.780> that<00:01:01.930> it's<00:01:02.080> like<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.589> guess

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
teenager I think that it's like I guess

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.829 
teenager I think that it's like I guess
a<00:01:03.159> more<00:01:03.460> understandable<00:01:04.059> approach<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.689> you

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
a more understandable approach to you

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.899 
a more understandable approach to you
would<00:01:05.049> be<00:01:05.170> more<00:01:05.350> just<00:01:05.560> like<00:01:05.710> it's<00:01:06.340> not<00:01:06.580> it's

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
would be more just like it's not it's

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.480 
would be more just like it's not it's
when<00:01:07.450> your<00:01:07.600> mom<00:01:07.780> says<00:01:08.110> this<00:01:08.290> stuff<00:01:08.530> she<00:01:09.369> may

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
sometimes she probably presents it in an

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.310 
sometimes she probably presents it in an
awful<00:01:12.909> way<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:13.150> makes<00:01:13.330> you<00:01:13.450> want<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.080> go<00:01:14.200> and

when I got tattooed he told me the same
thing<00:01:27.190> he's<00:01:27.490> like<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.760> think<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> was<00:01:28.180> just

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
thing he's like I think I was just

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.080

I think as far as like waiting till
you're<00:01:32.890> 18<00:01:32.950> like<00:01:33.490> it's<00:01:34.180> not<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.360> far<00:01:34.900> from
