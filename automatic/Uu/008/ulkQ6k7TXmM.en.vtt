and basically whenever that's done you
already<00:02:11.840> have<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.170> USB<00:02:12.790> itself<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.880> that<00:02:14.000> so

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
already have it on USB itself of that so

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.360 
already have it on USB itself of that so
I'll<00:02:14.360> get<00:02:14.660> more<00:02:14.780> into<00:02:14.840> detail<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.560> whenever

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
I'll get more into detail and whenever

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.330 
I'll get more into detail and whenever
actually<00:02:16.760> make<00:02:16.880> videos<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.420> so<00:02:17.690> for<00:02:18.200> now
