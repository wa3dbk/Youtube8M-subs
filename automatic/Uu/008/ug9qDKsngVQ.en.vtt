00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.290
 ah 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.710
 imagine that to water your garden or 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.690
 garden should pump water from a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.790
 ditch near your home for it 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.560
 you need electrical power and no doubt 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.930
 this is going to increase your account in order to 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.510
 month but what would happen if I cup the light 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490
 solar as energy 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.290
 and that 's the question they asked him 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.850
 group of small farmers of the 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.890
 Christmas commune in the region of 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.960
 o'higgins realizing that they should 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.930
 pump the vital element from the river 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 rappel to their estates this ^ 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 substantively the costs of energy 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.570
 they paid for what came up the 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 concern of a solution that also 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.720
 be friendly with our environment 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.730
 ambient 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.410
 the answer came from the government 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.030
 regional of quines through a 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.040
 project financed by the fund 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.990
 for competitiveness and innovation 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.840
 executed by the water center of the 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.920
 university of conception the idea was 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 install a series of panels 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.000
 photovoltaic that capture energy 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.220
 solar that inject it to the pumping of water 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.810
 decreasing the amount of the final ballot 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.810
 on electricity 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.240
 captures the solar energy that passes through here 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.820
 for this sector and transforms it to 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.370
 continuous energy this energy has to 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.410
 be transformed to current power 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.570
 alternate which is the energy that is used 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.270
 in the electrical network of the houses and this 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.830
 cable which leads in this case towards 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.320
 the transformer that the way that 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.060
 converts energy to the energy that 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.030
 consumes the pumps that is to say the 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.580
 attention of 12 thousand volts 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.740
 approximately to 380 that the voltage that 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.259
 uses the pumps to consume the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.600
 system at this moment we are at 36 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.890
 meters above the rappel river that is to say 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.320
 push was to get to this point 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.570
 it takes a lot of energy to be able 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.430
 raise this flow or this volume of 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.080
 water up to this point 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
 it is important to be clear that 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.920
 all the energy that is being taken care of in 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.229
 this moment the pump is coming 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.650
 from the photovoltaic panel and also 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.020
 from the electrical network 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.610
 the idea after excellent results in your 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.380
 pilot version allowing the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 energy injection and from the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.610
 photovoltaic panels will decrease the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.200
 consumption of the electricity network and lower the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.210
 amount of payment at the end of the month 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.510
 the farmers appreciated the 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.060
 project and praised the results 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.790
 they achieved great success since this 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.879
 commune has been 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.900
 for a long time the poorest of all the 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:34.590
 country this secano seco and have a 25 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.359
 percent of the benefit I find that 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.760
 It is a great success 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:42.329
 We hope we can inject the energy that 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.549
 now we have leftover to emelectric and have that 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.430
 energy as a current account for 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.720
 next year and with this system the 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.430
 photovoltaic park that injects 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.359
 system for extracting water from the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.000
 more or less are 32 kilowatt what 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:03.450
 does that mean to work with 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.769
 only solar energy a pump and with 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.840
 that 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.080
 we are recovering now 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.160
 the small agriculture of the neighbors of 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.010
 ravel 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.220
 the project of photovoltaic panels 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.350
 it cost 255 million pesos and 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.180
 contemplates training for the 170 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.760
 benefited where the Christmas commune 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.680
 it is also expected that brevity 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.570
 systems can be monitored from 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.790
 remotely delivering all the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.290
 energy generation statistics and 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.960
 saving of consumption is tremendous vision 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.780
 what has been done in what way can 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.780
 help farmers in their is in 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.940
 to be able to irrigate their crops with a project 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:50.080
 friendly with the nature that decreases 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.750
 costs and as a pilot plan visualizes 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.730
 generates a diagnosis so that the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.470
 government the agriculture ministry can 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.200
 continue making contributions to this town 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.740
 is the cover we are very far from the 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.470
 urban areas but that requires with this 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.150
 point of innovation a development 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.490
 important for all the inhabitants and 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.220
 that happy to know the project and 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.440
 without a doubt I think a very good 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.120
 initiative that may limit other 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.889
 communes of the region 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.510
 the project waits through the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.760
 constant monitoring follow 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.919
 perfecting your results and betting 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.050
 for new experiences in other communes 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.050
 of the region and the dry coastal yogi
