to<00:02:02.690> end<00:02:02.899> all<00:02:03.170> my<00:02:03.410> fun

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.300 

we<00:02:09.930> need<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> take<00:02:10.259> out<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:10.530> sniper<00:02:10.800> right

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
now and we have a chance of taking this

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.780 
now and we have a chance of taking this
victory<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.650> otherwise<00:02:14.040> gone<00:02:14.400> very

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
victory that is otherwise gone very

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.370 
victory that is otherwise gone very
badly<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:17.370> mortar<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.140> normally<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.170> a

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
badly that mortar is normally not a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.980 
badly that mortar is normally not a
threat<00:02:19.710> right<00:02:19.950> now<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.340> most<00:02:20.550> certainly<00:02:20.760> is

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
threat right now it most certainly is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.090 
threat right now it most certainly is
hopefully<00:02:21.990> we<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.290> kill<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.680> thing<00:02:22.740> without

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
hopefully we can kill this thing without

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.950 
hopefully we can kill this thing without
losing<00:02:23.670> both<00:02:23.850> those<00:02:24.060> heavies<00:02:24.390> in<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.690> shot

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960

right now out of the range of that

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.740 
right now out of the range of that
mortar<00:02:32.640> and<00:02:32.790> we<00:02:32.880> have<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.060> chance<00:02:33.360> here<00:02:33.450> for

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750
