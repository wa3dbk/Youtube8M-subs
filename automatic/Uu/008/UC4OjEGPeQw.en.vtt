00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.390
 we will have all the assets 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.300
 I will introduce you the new gocycle so that the lot 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.549
 really great design 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.560
 cathy on July 7th and get into a little chick so what you 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.789
 see here it's 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.759
 drums 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:21.550
 the battery of the gocycle 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.080
 so it does not look like that but then I compare with my computer 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.179
 portable so fired 15 inches ground 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:30.079
 see it's a little longer 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:31.349
 the readers 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.720
 those sent in relation 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 a leader 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.059
 he still has a little near 55 centimeters 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.990
 it weighs 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.160
 it weighs a bit heavy when there may be four kilometers of years 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.320
 here and then the connectivity and everything is done above 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.410
 so as to be able to very well on that 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.130
 putting yourself a little in the sun 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.840
 quite simply 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.850
 it opens like that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.850
 here we can plug 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.060
 chargers that can charge the battery 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 it's about ten pages so that these last matches is like that 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.980
 it's like hybrid cars 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.940
 toyota prius 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.010
 it's the same system that even talked about the charges 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.440
 for fortis so that means we have to change quite often 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.660
 e 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.950
 his bike 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.300
 because if not 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.720
 afssaps well that the battery so what to do is that prechac 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.410
 use 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.610
 every day 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.850
 you want to change again if you do not use it take off 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.920
 and disconnect like me 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.380
 you still have to change once a month 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.460
 one way 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.100
 After the homeland, it will not be completely unloaded for example 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.920
 if we look at the used not because it's too cold 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.600
 barzola keep me what I do what I keep cheap 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.090
 for each month 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.480
 then 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.690
 I charge it 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.970
 who is lying 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.920
 so on my desk 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.010
 for that it is simply the singer 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.689
 here and what we are going to drill 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.779
 now that charging the battery more risky and there is the little life this 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:13.430
 that would allow that in the big cycle 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.760
 according to the site of alang inde for now e we will simply load the 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.919
 drums 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:22.139
 then we have badly installed in Michigan what you need to know is that 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.309
 people will leave 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.389
 a garage do not need to remove the battery but for three quarters of 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.439
 people who live in ile-de-france 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.909
 they have apartments 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.059
 darif we removed the homeland for those who do not have a garage 

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.349
 to fly to bring the bike down to his apartment 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.209
 and what she sees settle inside we know it very well 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.999
 it's more convenient and remove the battery 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.679
 but I would say 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.959
 but hey if we garage it is even better for the part of their data 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.319
 for the big word game 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.299
 for the dough in their skin 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:54.339
 but beyond the throat
