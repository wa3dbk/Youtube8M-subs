00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
here on the screen it is not the best

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820 
here on the screen it is not the best
quality<00:00:29.340> but<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.359> can<00:00:30.660> tell<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.140> it<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.349> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
quality but you can tell that it is a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
quality but you can tell that it is a
rainbow<00:00:32.130> zebra<00:00:32.579> type<00:00:32.759> camo<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> like<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
rainbow zebra type camo as I like to

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
rainbow zebra type camo as I like to
call<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:35.399> looks<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.969> cool<00:00:36.210> now

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
call it and it looks pretty cool now

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
call it and it looks pretty cool now
it's<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.230> actually<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.950> game<00:00:38.219> or<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> part

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it's not actually in the game or a part

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.000 
it's not actually in the game or a part
of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> camos<00:00:39.390> list<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of the camos list so it's kind of a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
of the camos list so it's kind of a
mystery<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.640> how<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> get<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> could<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.540> be

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
mystery on how to get it could it be

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.240 
mystery on how to get it could it be
hinting<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.020> infinity<00:00:43.649> war<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:44.070> be

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
hinting that infinity war will be

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
hinting that infinity war will be
releasing<00:00:44.579> future<00:00:45.210> camo<00:00:45.570> DLCs<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.350> micro

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
releasing future camo DLCs or micro

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
releasing future camo DLCs or micro
transactions<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:48.390> Treyarch<00:00:48.930> did<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.200> black

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
transactions as Treyarch did with black

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
transactions as Treyarch did with black
ops<00:00:49.649> 2<00:00:49.950> who<00:00:50.190> knows<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.670> could<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.030> which

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
ops 2 who knows or could it be which

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.720 
ops 2 who knows or could it be which
this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.440> kind<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.739> theory<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.190> really

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
this is kind of a theory here I really

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.250 
this is kind of a theory here I really
don't<00:00:53.940> think<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.329> would<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.899> but<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
don't think it would be like this but it

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.830 
don't think it would be like this but it
could<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.340> camo<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.329> for<00:00:57.539> unlocking

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
could be a camo you get for unlocking

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
could be a camo you get for unlocking
all<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.500> gold<00:00:58.710> camo<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.359> getting

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
all the gold camo or all the for getting

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
all the gold camo or all the for getting
every<00:01:01.379> gun<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.800> single<00:01:02.100> category<00:01:02.480> gold<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
every gun in a single category gold you

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.969 
every gun in a single category gold you
know<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.960> could<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.439> which<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.799> highly

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
know it could be that which I highly

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.550 
know it could be that which I highly
doubt<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.820> who<00:01:06.750> would<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> know<00:01:07.229> as

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
doubt because who would you know as

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
doubt because who would you know as
badass<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.280> camo<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.970> don't<00:01:09.119> think

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
badass as this camo is I don't think

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
badass as this camo is I don't think
that<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.750> camo<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.110> good<00:01:10.290> enough<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that the camo is good enough to be a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.090 
that the camo is good enough to be a
reward<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.520> getting<00:01:11.610> every<00:01:12.000> gun<00:01:12.180> gold<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.100> you

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
reward for getting every gun gold so you

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.070 
reward for getting every gun gold so you
know<00:01:14.189> who<00:01:14.369> knows<00:01:14.549> even<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.060> diamond<00:01:15.509> camo<00:01:15.840> maybe

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
know who knows even a diamond camo maybe

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.210 
know who knows even a diamond camo maybe
in<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> game<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.560> think<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.009> haven't

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
in the game I think we haven't

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.830 
in the game I think we haven't
discovered<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.880> or<00:01:18.060> gotten<00:01:18.390> that<00:01:18.479> far<00:01:18.659> into

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
discovered that or gotten that far into

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.030 
discovered that or gotten that far into
the<00:01:18.990> game<00:01:19.110> yet<00:01:19.320> we'll<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.770> wait<00:01:19.890> and

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
the game yet we'll just have to wait and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.240 
the game yet we'll just have to wait and
see<00:01:20.189> but<00:01:20.540> my<00:01:21.540> main<00:01:21.750> theory<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.979> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
see but my main theory is that this is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.630 
see but my main theory is that this is
probably<00:01:23.689> hinting<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.869> there<00:01:25.080> will<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.290> some

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
probably hinting that there will be some

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.440 
probably hinting that there will be some
microtransactions<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> future<00:01:27.210> for

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
microtransactions in the future for

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
microtransactions in the future for
black<00:01:27.720> ops<00:01:27.930> 2<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.500> there<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.610> also<00:01:29.790> been

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
black ops 2 because there has also been

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.300 
black ops 2 because there has also been
