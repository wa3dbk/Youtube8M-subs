okay and if you're doing less than if

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.160 
okay and if you're doing less than if

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you're doing three to five cups which is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
you're doing three to five cups which is
a<00:01:01.320> smaller<00:01:01.680> amount<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.730> push<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.180> button

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
a smaller amount you push this button

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
a smaller amount you push this button
and<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.619> does<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.100> it<00:01:05.519> makes<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.030> Bruce

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and what that does is it makes it Bruce

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.200 
and what that does is it makes it Bruce
lower<00:01:07.220> sash<00:01:08.220> direction<00:01:08.810> more<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.229> room

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
lower sash direction more of in a room

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
lower sash direction more of in a room
because<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.330> got<00:01:12.450> less<00:01:12.630> coffee<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
because you got less coffee in there it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.170 
because you got less coffee in there it
would<00:01:13.680> pass<00:01:13.860> through<00:01:14.040> faster<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> slows<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
would pass through faster so it slows it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
would pass through faster so it slows it
down<00:01:15.210> cool<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.400> is<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.549> anything<00:01:17.700> oh<00:01:18.979> yeah

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
down cool so is there anything oh yeah

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
down cool so is there anything oh yeah
we<00:01:20.520> couldn't<00:01:20.820> find<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.150> it's<00:01:21.299> had<00:01:21.390> an<00:01:21.509> auto<00:01:21.689> off

we couldn't find if it's had an auto off

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.039 
we couldn't find if it's had an auto off
they<00:01:22.200> didn't<00:01:22.439> say<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.070> manual<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.840> does

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
they didn't say in the manual so it does

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.210 
they didn't say in the manual so it does
come<00:01:25.200> on<00:01:25.470> watch<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
come on watch this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
come on watch this
this<00:01:26.909> magic<00:01:27.390> BAM<00:01:27.750> comes<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> gold-tone

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
this magic BAM comes with the gold-tone

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.219 
this magic BAM comes with the gold-tone
filter<00:01:29.189> mmm-hmm<00:01:29.909> so<00:01:30.360> number<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.079> you're

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
filter mmm-hmm so number four if you're

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.010 
filter mmm-hmm so number four if you're
using<00:01:31.530> paper<00:01:31.829> yeah<00:01:32.509> and<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.600> were<00:01:33.720> saying

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
using paper yeah and they were saying

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.219 
using paper yeah and they were saying
that<00:01:34.229> if<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.740> do<00:01:35.009> paper<00:01:35.759> versus<00:01:36.750> gold<00:01:36.990> pony

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
that if you do paper versus gold pony

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
that if you do paper versus gold pony
you<00:01:37.470> should<00:01:37.650> use<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:38.100> little<00:01:38.430> more<00:01:38.640> coffee

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you should use a little more coffee

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.060 
you should use a little more coffee
more<00:01:39.600> coffee<00:01:39.840> which<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.290> haven't<00:01:40.650> figured<00:01:40.890> out

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
more coffee which I haven't figured out

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
more coffee which I haven't figured out
exactly<00:01:41.250> why<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.090> say<00:01:42.390> use<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.899> okay

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
exactly why but they say use more okay

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.649 
exactly why but they say use more okay
and<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:44.009> you're<00:01:44.159> using<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.520> finer<00:01:44.790> grind<00:01:45.270> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and if you're using a finer grind you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.740 
and if you're using a finer grind you
use

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
use

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.300 
use
bless<00:01:48.740> as<00:01:49.040> well<00:01:49.250> yes<00:01:49.610> but<00:01:50.530> my<00:01:51.530> theory<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.280> that

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
bless as well yes but my theory is that

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.240 
bless as well yes but my theory is that
the<00:01:52.790> be<00:01:53.120> cut<00:01:53.330> because<00:01:53.540> the<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.470> paper<00:01:54.680> is<00:01:54.980> more

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
the be cut because the the paper is more

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.580 
the be cut because the the paper is more
malleable<00:01:55.550> in<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.210> gold-tone<00:01:56.540> doctor<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.530> you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
malleable in the gold-tone doctor so you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.340 
malleable in the gold-tone doctor so you
could<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.220> can<00:01:58.400> actually<00:01:58.790> fit<00:01:59.000> more<00:01:59.270> ya<00:01:59.750> could

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
could you can actually fit more ya could

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.820 
could you can actually fit more ya could
be<00:02:00.470> it
