00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
everything you expected be a lot of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.620 
everything you expected be a lot of
japanese<00:01:53.369> running<00:01:53.670> unfortunately<00:01:54.210> i<00:01:54.270> still

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
japanese running unfortunately i still

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630 
japanese running unfortunately i still
can't<00:01:54.869> speak<00:01:55.049> or<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.470> read<00:01:55.680> japanese<00:01:56.130> so

we're<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.820> gonna<00:01:57.090> guess<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
we're just gonna guess that that's the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.209 
we're just gonna guess that that's the
card<00:01:57.990> list<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.350> that's<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> contents

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
card list and that's like the contents

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.590 
card list and that's like the contents
and<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.549> somewhere<00:02:00.180> there<00:02:00.360> there's<00:02:00.540> a

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and all that somewhere there there's a

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.520 
and all that somewhere there there's a
phone<00:02:00.780> number<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.079> call<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> die

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
phone number to call if you die

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
phone number to call if you die
something<00:02:01.979> i'm<00:02:02.430> guessing<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:02.939> what<00:02:03.180> I

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
something i'm guessing that's what I

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.270 
something i'm guessing that's what I
think<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.320> what<00:02:04.439> be<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.740> box<00:02:04.920> but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
