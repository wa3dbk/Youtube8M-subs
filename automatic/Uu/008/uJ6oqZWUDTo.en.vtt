00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.329 
video in mccarroll Slav and as I've said
we're<00:00:34.409> just<00:00:34.589> sort<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.890> rolling<00:00:35.159> with<00:00:35.309> the

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
we're just sort of rolling with the

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.640 
we're just sort of rolling with the
punches<00:00:35.579> we're<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.210> rushing<00:00:36.570> anything<00:00:36.809> we're

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
punches we're not rushing anything we're

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.860 
punches we're not rushing anything we're
not<00:00:37.829> we're<00:00:38.129> not<00:00:38.159> getting<00:00:38.579> too<00:00:38.760> excited<00:00:39.180> about

not we're not getting too excited about

not we're not getting too excited about
and<00:00:40.589> trying<00:00:40.769> to<00:00:40.890> cram<00:00:41.070> too<00:00:41.309> many<00:00:41.489> ideas<00:00:41.640> into

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
and trying to cram too many ideas into

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.509 
and trying to cram too many ideas into
one<00:00:42.030> video<00:00:42.440> because<00:00:43.440> one<00:00:43.949> this<00:00:44.159> is<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> very

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
one video because one this is a very

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.910 
one video because one this is a very
complex<00:00:45.059> structure<00:00:45.540> that<00:00:45.690> occurs<00:00:46.019> from<00:00:46.350> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
complex structure that occurs from so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.569 
complex structure that occurs from so
many<00:00:47.070> openings<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> it's<00:00:48.420> also<00:00:49.430> hard<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
many openings and it's also hard to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.500 
many openings and it's also hard to
illustrate<00:00:51.269> so<00:00:51.600> many<00:00:51.780> different<00:00:52.199> ideas<00:00:53.510> when

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
illustrate so many different ideas when

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
illustrate so many different ideas when
when<00:00:55.109> you<00:00:55.140> can<00:00:55.500> reach<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.739> position<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
when you can reach a position from so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.080 
when you can reach a position from so
many<00:00:56.429> openings<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> what<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> wanted<00:00:59.519> as<00:00:59.879> i

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
many openings and so what I wanted as i

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.819 
many openings and so what I wanted as i
said<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.359> took<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.929> give<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> few<00:01:01.440> sort<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
said we took we give a few sort of

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
said we took we give a few sort of
almost<00:01:02.100> unrealistic<00:01:02.640> examples<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> how<00:01:03.660> white

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
almost unrealistic examples of how white

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740 
almost unrealistic examples of how white
can<00:01:04.170> win<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.369> gave<00:01:05.610> an<00:01:06.149> example<00:01:06.330> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
can win and then we gave an example of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.510 
can win and then we gave an example of
blacks<00:01:07.020> liberation<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> e5<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.369> will

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
blacks liberation of e5 which will

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.499 
blacks liberation of e5 which will
probably<00:01:08.700> come<00:01:08.940> back<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.210> at<00:01:09.300> some<00:01:09.450> point

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
probably come back to at some point

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:10.960 
probably come back to at some point
hopefully<00:01:09.780> talk<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.259> little<00:01:10.440> bit<00:01:10.590> more<00:01:10.740> about

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
hopefully talk a little bit more about

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.820 
hopefully talk a little bit more about
but<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.179> foreshadow<00:01:12.720> before<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.259> move<00:01:13.440> on<00:01:13.619> to

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
but as I foreshadow before we move on to

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.639 
but as I foreshadow before we move on to
c5<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:15.270> more<00:01:15.450> natural<00:01:15.600> breakthrough<00:01:16.289> /<00:01:16.440> black

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
c5 the more natural breakthrough / black

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.330 
c5 the more natural breakthrough / black
I<00:01:16.979> wanted<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> give<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.330> couple<00:01:18.539> of<00:01:18.840> examples<00:01:19.340> at

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
I wanted to give a couple of examples at

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.169 
I wanted to give a couple of examples at
least<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:21.060> here<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:22.770> what<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:23.940> happen

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
least this one here of what can happen

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.979 
least this one here of what can happen
if<00:01:24.690> white<00:01:25.050> has<00:01:25.349> a<00:01:25.619> misguided<00:01:26.280> approach

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:26.989 
if white has a misguided approach

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:29.949 
if white has a misguided approach
misplaced<00:01:27.989> ideals<00:01:28.590> about<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.069> position<00:01:29.580> and

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
misplaced ideals about this position and

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.089 
misplaced ideals about this position and
decides<00:01:30.959> it's<00:01:31.170> okay<00:01:31.440> to<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.709> a<00:01:31.770> bunch<00:01:32.009> of

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:32.099 
decides it's okay to make a bunch of

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:36.080 
decides it's okay to make a bunch of
minor<00:01:32.280> piece<00:01:32.520> trades<00:01:33.470> before<00:01:34.470> he<00:01:34.830> before<00:01:35.819> he

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
minor piece trades before he before he

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
minor piece trades before he before he
does<00:01:36.750> something<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.289> his<00:01:37.410> space<00:01:37.709> so<00:01:38.340> here<00:01:38.550> we

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
does something with his space so here we

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
does something with his space so here we
have<00:01:38.729> an<00:01:38.910> example<00:01:38.970> where<00:01:39.509> white<00:01:39.810> did<00:01:40.739> make<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
have an example where white did make a

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.430 
have an example where white did make a
bunch<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.280> minor<00:01:41.459> piece<00:01:41.700> trades<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.440> and

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
bunch of minor piece trades and and

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.380 
bunch of minor piece trades and and
hasn't<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.160> done<00:01:44.310> anything<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.940> execute<00:01:45.330> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
hasn't really done anything to execute a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.330 
hasn't really done anything to execute a
space<00:01:45.629> advantage<00:01:46.080> and<00:01:46.319> so<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.160> is<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
space advantage and so this is a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.889 
space advantage and so this is a
situation<00:01:47.580> where<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> might<00:01:48.239> first<00:01:48.539> look<00:01:48.720> at

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
situation where you might first look at

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
situation where you might first look at
it<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.229> from<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.069> classical<00:01:50.610> perspectives

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
it and from the classical perspectives

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.219 
it and from the classical perspectives
of<00:01:51.209> knowing<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.569> black<00:01:51.750> has<00:01:51.959> to<00:01:52.080> break

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
of knowing the black has to break

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
of knowing the black has to break
through<00:01:52.440> with<00:01:52.530> C<00:01:52.679> 595<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.849> would<00:01:53.970> be<00:01:54.090> obsessed

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
through with C 595 you would be obsessed

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
through with C 595 you would be obsessed
with<00:01:54.569> some<00:01:54.840> move<00:01:54.989> like<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.440> for<00:01:55.679> black<00:01:56.119> but

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
with some move like this for black but

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.520 
with some move like this for black but
the<00:01:57.450> thing<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:59.720> that's<00:02:00.720> a<00:02:00.869> possible<00:02:01.319> move

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the thing is that that's a possible move

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.469 
the thing is that that's a possible move
and<00:02:02.869> d5<00:02:03.869> is<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:05.099> actually<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.610> very<00:02:05.789> risky<00:02:06.300> idea

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and d5 is is actually a very risky idea

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.719 
and d5 is is actually a very risky idea
for<00:02:06.810> white<00:02:06.989> given<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.739> black<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.520> come

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
for white given that the black can come

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.609 
for white given that the black can come
back<00:02:08.970> defend<00:02:09.509> against<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.959> diagonal

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
back defend against this diagonal

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.280 
back defend against this diagonal
threats<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.250> immediately<00:02:12.180> expose<00:02:12.690> tactics

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
threats and immediately expose tactics

threats and immediately expose tactics
against<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.800> deep<00:02:13.950> on<00:02:14.160> which<00:02:14.940> means<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
against the deep on which means the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360 
against the deep on which means the
white<00:02:15.480> probably<00:02:15.930> wouldn't<00:02:16.140> play<00:02:16.290> d5<00:02:16.709> why

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
white probably wouldn't play d5 why

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.309 
white probably wouldn't play d5 why
would<00:02:17.580> do<00:02:17.730> something<00:02:18.090> else<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.599> then<00:02:19.140> we

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
would do something else and then we

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.110 
would do something else and then we
would<00:02:19.470> have<00:02:19.709> our<00:02:19.739> big<00:02:20.250> equal<00:02:20.640> trade<00:02:20.879> that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
would have our big equal trade that

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.089 
would have our big equal trade that
we're<00:02:21.239> always<00:02:21.360> waiting<00:02:21.599> for<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
we're always waiting for but in this

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.830 
we're always waiting for but in this
particular<00:02:23.280> position<00:02:23.970> those<00:02:24.120> tactics<00:02:24.660> may

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
particular position those tactics may

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.330 
particular position those tactics may
work<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.230> for<00:02:25.470> white<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
work out for white because of the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.700 
work out for white because of the
pressure<00:02:26.520> here<00:02:26.910> but

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
pressure here but

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.900 
pressure here but
also<00:02:28.010> for<00:02:28.280> another<00:02:28.580> reason<00:02:29.020> being<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.910> maybe

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
also for another reason being that maybe

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.090 
also for another reason being that maybe
just<00:02:32.870> maybe<00:02:32.990> because<00:02:33.530> there's<00:02:33.710> been<00:02:33.830> so<00:02:33.890> many

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
just maybe because there's been so many

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.760 
just maybe because there's been so many
minor<00:02:34.400> piece<00:02:34.670> trades<00:02:35.140> we've<00:02:36.140> crossed<00:02:36.500> that

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
minor piece trades we've crossed that

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.440 
minor piece trades we've crossed that
we've<00:02:36.980> crossed<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.550> threshold<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.270> of

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
we've crossed the threshold of that of

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.270 
we've crossed the threshold of that of
that<00:02:38.480> idea<00:02:38.810> where<00:02:39.260> okay<00:02:39.530> maybe<00:02:39.770> we<00:02:39.980> don't<00:02:40.130> need

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
that idea where okay maybe we don't need

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.410 
that idea where okay maybe we don't need
to<00:02:40.430> worry<00:02:40.580> about<00:02:40.700> changing<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.270> position

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
to worry about changing the position

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.640 
to worry about changing the position
anymore<00:02:41.750> it's<00:02:41.960> not<00:02:42.080> like<00:02:42.200> we<00:02:42.320> have<00:02:42.410> a<00:02:42.470> bad

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
anymore it's not like we have a bad

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.830 
anymore it's not like we have a bad
bishop<00:02:43.010> on<00:02:43.130> c8<00:02:43.460> still<00:02:43.730> we<00:02:44.240> don't<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.570> nights

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
bishop on c8 still we don't have nights

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.930 
bishop on c8 still we don't have nights
bumping<00:02:45.410> into<00:02:45.560> each<00:02:45.650> other<00:02:45.920> on<00:02:46.040> f6<00:02:46.460> and<00:02:46.670> d7

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
bumping into each other on f6 and d7

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.160 
bumping into each other on f6 and d7
we've<00:02:47.660> got<00:02:47.840> a<00:02:47.870> pretty<00:02:48.230> well<00:02:48.680> positioned

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
we've got a pretty well positioned

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.570 
we've got a pretty well positioned
placement<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.560> pieces<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.160> left<00:02:52.190> on

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
placement of the pieces that are left on

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.770 
placement of the pieces that are left on
the<00:02:52.670> board<00:02:52.880> so<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.210> fact<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.750> a

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the board so the fact that we have a

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.480 
the board so the fact that we have a
space<00:02:54.050> disadvantage<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.770> not<00:02:54.920> so<00:02:55.070> critical

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
space disadvantage is not so critical

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.910 
space disadvantage is not so critical
anymore<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:56.270> so<00:02:56.990> maybe<00:02:57.230> it's<00:02:57.410> time<00:02:57.590> for<00:02:57.770> us<00:02:57.890> to

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
anymore and so maybe it's time for us to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.680 
anymore and so maybe it's time for us to
relocate<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.670> shift<00:02:58.910> our<00:02:59.060> focus<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.480> how<00:02:59.630> to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
relocate and shift our focus on how to

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.270 
relocate and shift our focus on how to
increase<00:03:00.020> pressure<00:03:00.350> against<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.920> deep<00:03:01.070> on

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
increase pressure against the deep on

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.150 
increase pressure against the deep on
and<00:03:01.520> that's<00:03:02.000> exactly<00:03:02.210> what<00:03:02.750> black<00:03:02.990> did<00:03:03.920> here

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
and that's exactly what black did here

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.340 
and that's exactly what black did here
excuse<00:03:04.520> me<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:05.150> business<00:03:05.180> starting<00:03:06.020> position

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
excuse me the business starting position

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.170 
excuse me the business starting position
is<00:03:06.470> with<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.680> bishop<00:03:06.920> on<00:03:07.010> veto<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.910> exactly

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
is with the bishop on veto it's exactly

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.390 
is with the bishop on veto it's exactly
what<00:03:08.510> black<00:03:08.720> does<00:03:08.990> here<00:03:09.320> and<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:10.070> able<00:03:10.190> to

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
what black does here and is able to

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.440 
what black does here and is able to
achieve<00:03:10.460> an<00:03:10.670> advantage
