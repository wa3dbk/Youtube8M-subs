another dead end street you get a lot of
dead<00:04:04.300> ends<00:04:04.480> down<00:04:04.690> here<00:04:04.990> where<00:04:05.170> people<00:04:05.200> pull<00:04:05.650> in

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
dead ends down here where people pull in

on<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> dead-end<00:04:06.190> street<00:04:06.670> and<00:04:07.300> then<00:04:07.540> build<00:04:07.840> a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
on a dead-end street and then build a

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.390 
on a dead-end street and then build a
bunch<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.170> houses<00:04:08.320> on<00:04:08.680> it<00:04:08.800> was<00:04:08.950> really<00:04:09.190> popular
