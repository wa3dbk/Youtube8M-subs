00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.910
 hi pokémon coaches and trainers 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.740
 welcome to a new video this time 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.540
 I bring the second fight of the second 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.180
 round of the World Cup Swiss 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.789
 Washington against human remember that 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.190
 I lost the first fight so I had it 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.900
 everything quite difficult to pass from 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.250
 round if he wanted to win at human he had to 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.320
 win both the second and the third 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.510
 combat so good let's see how 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.400
 I was in the second fight in this 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.680
 second fight I decided to leave with garzón 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.510
 instead of ax back because I saw that I had 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.570
 quite afraid to use me friendly toys 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.660
 because well I guess I would expect that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.100
 I took something to counteract me 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.590
 you talk diminished in fact in the game 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.600
 earlier so I decided to take out Garzón 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.309
 that I thought he was going to help me a lot and 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 well this first turn he starts with 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.390
 chenaut electric that as you can see it looks 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.370
 evolve and electric range because there 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.159
 you need to cover h schnautz for nothing of 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.539
 cap 2 and well here I did not know very well 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.470
 what to expect milks, not because there was not 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.050
 seen play a lot 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.270
 but the one that had elixir but for 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.190
 I did not expect him to have pain, which is what 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.410
 what makes me predict me very well in this 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.780
 first turn he throws me in front of the carton 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.630
 that he throws the protect and throws him hp ice 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.700
 in this way because it does a lot 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.160
 damage practically kills him but he had it 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.010
 trained just to hold the h 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.200
 that there is magnetic first so what 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.230
 can stand and I threw him thunder wave 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.270
 contacts to shooters now more than anything 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.130
 not for speed but for 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.050
 try to scratch him some turn there 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.060
 paralysis that good could help me 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.190
 quite in this second turn I decide 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.440
 change to garzon for tyrannizing because 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.920
 I thought about saving it for the end because 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.380
 it could be quite useful and knew 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.270
 I was going to finish off this garzón will 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.580
 with flame lower instead of with hp is 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.860
 new because I was expecting Mauel to leave 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.770
 this time he did not put it on me like in the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.570
 previous combat and good I did not have I did not have 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.610
 too many problems here I threw hp ice 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.460
 hsn out to go scratching long of life and 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.380
 he throws the leeds it to bully that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.170
 Well the truth is that it is wearing 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.330
 life but right now I had the fight 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.940
 quite in favor the only problem was 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.350
 that I did not know what was going to be behind the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.300
 truth is that she expected me to talk 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.739
 this is not because they had 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.840
 evolved manet trick therefore 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:27.450
 it was very unlikely that it would lead to 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.519
 and also at three o'clock and this time 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.519
 I predicted very very well I also played it 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.870
 I very much threw thunderbolt to your mega 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.120
 electric man good that you also see that 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.349
 he throws thunderbolt and they throw me and such 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.900
 but it does not do anything to him practically 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.819
 because he is at solbes and he threw him besides 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.890
 thunderbolt assurance assurance what 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.510
 is that if the same pokemon that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.129
 you attack has received damage in that same 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.569
 turn in this case ander ball of 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:53.040
 data the power goes up to 120 and with the 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.420
 tyrannizing attack and the staff is 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.060
 enough to take down mega man &amp; 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.590
 trick therefore here I take off a 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.989
 big problem that was mega electric man 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.030
 that could end up with garzon and could 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.470
 do a lot of damage to my way and I 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.299
 I get rid of the truth that in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.090
 this turn get a lot of advantage here 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.790
 I decide to change to tyrannize by na wai 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.150
 to intimidate his tyranny suches naut 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.730
 both physical and because I did not already knew 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.650
 that at the end he had great by 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.360
 ibrox light therefore it must be 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.090
 physical was very unlikely that he had 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.549
 he also inflated güero fire blast here 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.130
 we see that for him he was totally physical 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.900
 and what is thrown is dragon dance the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.060
 famous dragon trade 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.470
 how good I said okay nothing happens 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.540
 intimidated is going to have the attack 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.099
 equally neutral and now it paralyzed him and 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.590
 there is no problem because of the speed 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.980
 but I balloon barry so it heals 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.829
 that paralysis and good can can get 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.840
 to be a problem because because if it is 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.510
 to piss rocks light and get that 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.640
 back to white I can I can 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.349
 find me in a serious problem but 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.939
 well here we see that it also stretches 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.530
 litzy be fit to follow 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.120
 Fortunately the recovering life 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.069
 have changed to tyrannize only 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.720
 recover life from a pokémon here I come back 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.450
 to change up to 2 to remove that lid 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.359
 yes so uncomfortable and in this turn also 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.819
 it goes up to predict pretty well as much as 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.920
 more obvious was to throw him play road to his 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.599
 strip ni tar that was the one that most 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.910
 more problems could you give me but I the 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.370
 I played pretty and shot play road to 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.979
 snow is waiting for the tirant and tar 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.199
 was protected like this was in this turn 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.750
 I also practically had the 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.669
 combat won because you only 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.740
 it was only and good as you see 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.940
 although it intimidates the two pokemon I have 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.800
 to tyrannize that he does not die or see 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.380
 and well I do not know if you will see commented harmony or 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.660
 I do not think that there is but also because 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.970
 so you did not do it 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.880
 excessive damage if not if I'm not wrong 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.410
 right now he puts a critic to him to mauer 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.600
 but well we see that it did not influence 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.580
 nothing and here is played a lot was thought 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.490
 that maxwell was going to be protected and back on 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.950
 fire blast a by tirant and tar without good 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.960
 they did not forget or did not notice 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.940
 that was solbes this and therefore not 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.220
 he was going to kill the salami cnrs 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.990
 ay I realized it was spex and for 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.120
 that threw fire blast because if it does not 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.390
 shut up do not attack you and Maxwell already 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.190
 it ended with him then he threw fire 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.370
 blas on that last attempt to kill 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.230
 tyrannize but it was not enough and good 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.180
 here he already surrendered seeing that he could not 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.100
 do anything with your mind throw in front of 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.650
 my other four pokemon so nothing 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.360
 I got to win that second fight and 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.000
 well you had to decide everything to a 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.770
 third fight that good I hope that 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.420
 I hope you see it I hope you like it 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.670
 I also think that for me it is the most 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.900
 interesting and good guys up here the 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.740
 second fight and see you in the 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.740
 third chao
