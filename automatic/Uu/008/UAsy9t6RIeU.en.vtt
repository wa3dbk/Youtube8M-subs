00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
practice what should we start with

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.070 
practice what should we start with
and<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.550> always<00:00:08.820> challenge<00:00:09.269> start<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
and I always challenge start with the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.759 
and I always challenge start with the
open<00:00:10.469> Street<00:00:10.820> why<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.840> Aqua<00:00:13.200> Street

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
open Street why just the Aqua Street

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.490 
open Street why just the Aqua Street
so<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.070> can<00:00:14.490> develop<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.240> better<00:00:15.269> right<00:00:16.170> hand

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
so you can develop a better right hand

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.200 
so you can develop a better right hand
technique<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.279> better<00:00:17.940> control<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.500> bow

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
technique and better control of the bow

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
technique and better control of the bow
so<00:00:21.210> also<00:00:21.779> because<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:22.949> you're<00:00:23.189> not<00:00:23.220> focusing

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
so also because now you're not focusing

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.120 
so also because now you're not focusing
on<00:00:24.119> your<00:00:24.300> left<00:00:24.570> hand<00:00:24.960> and<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.529> leaves<00:00:25.949> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
on your left hand and it's leaves you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.750 
on your left hand and it's leaves you
right<00:00:26.369> hand<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:27.599> control<00:00:28.080> so<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.490> also

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
right hand more control so and also

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.240
