00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 in the previous video we talked 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.150
 of the phases of the crisis we will now begin 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.550
 analyze the individual reactions starting 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.800
 from the first reaction is the phosphorylation 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.840
 ended the facade of glucose is 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.820
 very important for at least two reasons 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.560
 that you must surely remember 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 allows to activate the course is of 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.580
 trap it inside the cell 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.490
 we see the first function as 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 providing in these images is the cost 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.000
 6 phosphate this is the first girl 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.099
 of the farm that is called 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.529
 phosphorylation of glucose as 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 predict glucose is phosphors side 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.170
 thanks phosphoric group is slowly 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.420
 at the end of the first phase of glycols 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 it is transformed by six automata of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.950
 coal has created more than coal in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.030
 those that are inter josÃ© phosphate 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.649
 remember that you josif did yes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.110
 they call it that because they have three atoms of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.629
 carbon phosphate group therefore that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.879
 what happens in this series of reactions 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.190
 to luco being transformed into that one 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.320
 it's done becomes more reactive easier 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.109
 to be attacked by enzymes on 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.030
 FAS group made also reduces by 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.769
 to the activation energy allows one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.409
 easier assault by 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.760
 of the whole therefore facilitates cutting 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
 of the glucose molecule 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.930
 as for the second one 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.610
 function here we have a cell 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.290
 as you can see this could be 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.840
 a muscle cell a cell of the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 pancreas liver and so on 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.409
 rest what the thing does 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 from the outside it passes through this 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.020
 conveyor inside 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.540
 the glucose transporter that 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.890
 allows the passage of glucose 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.530
 from outside to inside it is called 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.509
 ugly a lot means transporter 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.310
 so thanks to this transporter 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.990
 glucose can pass inside the 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.390
 cell when the group is located 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.190
 inside the cell comes 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.869
 transformed into glucose 6 phosphate 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.210
 because it is so important in this 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.430
 reaction this grateful important for 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.600
 glucose 6 phosphate is more successful 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.580
 leak out of the cell and then 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.259
 remains trapped 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.350
 already because of the presence of the group 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:59.080
 therefore this type of reaction is phosphoric 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.450
 avoid using other energy for 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.250
 try to keep the glucose that you 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.780
 is accumulating in the cell 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.690
 because it is transformed into what you are 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.910
 phosphate so this is very important 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.410
 then glucose meets various price lists 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.930
 but an important thing to understand is 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.580
 this initial part 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 having said this let us remember that the first one 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.690
 reaction ie the first stage of the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.450
 agricultural is part of the phase 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.650
 preparatory phase the preparatory phase 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.280
 groups the first five stages of the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.890
 crisis 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 so we have the five stages we 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.739
 we are talking about the first one 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.320
 phosphorylation of glucose here we have 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.239
 a detail of the reaction as you can 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.280
 see there are important elements 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.810
 Here we have the product 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.640
 that is when the product is this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.459
 reagent then produced reagent e 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.959
 this is the enzyme this reaction from 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.850
 something like that and phosphates e 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.220
 caterina where united but called iso 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.640
 kinase this enzyme as you can see 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.069
 uses tpl in the presence of magnesium 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.830
 turns into glucose into glucose 6 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.480
 phosphate this unique arrow and remember 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.250
 chemical change in chemistry indicates a 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.569
 irreversible big guy 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.069
 ie its kinase can not 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.300
 turn new with what you are 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.620
 made in glucose 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.989
 this is very important when 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.360
 we will talk about the crane spouses born because 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.760
 the genesis allows the synthesis of 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.400
 glucose from sources that are not glucose 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.320
 from alternative sources but the crane Article 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.840
 Genesis is not simply the reverse 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.430
 of the geely crisis therefore when there are 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.220
 these irreversible reactions yes 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.720
 they use other enzymes then the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 first race of calculosis a reaction 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.819
 irreversible catalyzed by the eso 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.470
 kinase which uses ttp in the presence of 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.380
 magnesium to form into something you do 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.800
 been injured kinase so what he has 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:41.410
 made its kinases phosphors on the 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.950
 carbon save and grow things adds in 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.049
 a phosphate group therefore we have 123456 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.360
 to Sunday harmony on the sixth atom of 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.299
 carbon phosphorylation occurs for 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.730
 this is called eso the term kinase 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.410
 instead what the common name indicates 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.360
 of kinases is assigned to 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.940
 enzymes that catalyze the transfer 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.799
 of the terminal phosphoric group of the atp 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.270
 to an accept this office core 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.830
 the accepting core strands 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:09.550
 so remember when i find the 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.960
 The term kinase always refers to 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.330
 an enzyme that transfers groups 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.300
 phosphate from ATP to a case to case the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.880
 substrate memories that the generous ones make 

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.680
 part of the subclass of the 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.020
 transferase therefore only a subclass 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.400
 of the trans ferrazzi and they are so many 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.020
 of our organism in fact made 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.020
 kinase is present in all cells 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.000
 of all the bodies also mentioned 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.740
 who has harmed kinases to different names for 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.180
 example in the liver we find a 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.640
 particular kinase risk that yes 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.590
 call on the kinase 4 which is called 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.290
 more specifically kinase caterpillar way 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:44.140
 so you wo n't find the burgo kinase 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.850
 know that we are referring to the legio 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.060
 kinase present in the liver 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.890
 so these are the features 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.630
 important to remember another thing 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.700
 important to remember is magnesium 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.710
 in fact almost all the sets 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.480
 of the farm they need 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.120
 magnesium magnesium protects 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.070
 essentially the groups of the 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.770
 of the atp to allow a better 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.200
 access to the enzyme therefore this is 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.610
 a really important indeed is formed a 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.920
 real complex that is called 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.390
 magnesium and million atp complex 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.190
 Magnesium protect its own the 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.590
 negative charges of phosphoric groups 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.930
 of the atp in this way they render the atom 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.340
 of phosphorus terminal ie what 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.590
 one more target is transferred 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.020
 accessible the wire core attachment that it is 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.330
 this then attacks the group 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.890
 phosphorus that the atp forming a thing if 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.080
 was done thanks to the action of the ex 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.360
 kinases so these are more things 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.610
 important to remember on the first 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.040
 report in particular remembered 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.440
 that the first report allows one more 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.000
 easy glucose aggression allows 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.370
 to trap the accusation through the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.040
 phosphate group the first reaction ago 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.230
 part 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.170
 of the preparatory phase and yes 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:53.480
 characterizes to be irreversible 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:56.860
 catalyzed by the iso kinase in 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.240
 presence of atp and magnesium in which the 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.660
 the last group phosphorus wheat atp 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.160
 undergoes the core thread attack of the group 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.320
 seadrill ico in let's be helped by 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.080
 magnesium in the video hits with 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.120
 we will speak in the second stage, that is, of the 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.620
 second reaction in the agricultural xi in 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.410
 which we have the conversion of glucose 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.270
 6 phosphate jose phosphate fruit 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.830
