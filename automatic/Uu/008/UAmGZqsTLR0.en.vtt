but there's also this really tricky

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.500 
but there's also this really tricky
thing<00:01:02.219> especially<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:02.910> you're<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.120> sensitive

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510

person<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:05.070> letting<00:01:05.430> yourself<00:01:05.729> be

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
person of not letting yourself be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.840

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
don't have any meaning but what I mean

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.389 
don't have any meaning but what I mean
when<00:02:05.969> I<00:02:06.000> say<00:02:06.329> nuance<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.680> things<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.220> not

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
when I say nuance is that things are not

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.430 
when I say nuance is that things are not
black<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.479> white<00:02:09.569> yes

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440

No<00:02:11.070> there<00:02:11.370> are<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.760> many<00:02:12.030> shades<00:02:12.570> of<00:02:12.930> gray<00:02:13.200> they

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
No there are so many shades of gray they

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
what is easy for your brain to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.600 
world in it's just I don't know there's
something<00:02:35.220> about<00:02:35.960> nuance<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.350> subtlety<00:02:37.610> that

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
something about nuance and subtlety that

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.060 
something about nuance and subtlety that
totally<00:02:39.300> changed<00:02:39.990> my<00:02:40.080> life<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.860> feel<00:02:41.010> like

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
totally changed my life and I feel like

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.130 
totally changed my life and I feel like
I've<00:02:41.370> always<00:02:41.520> been<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.820> sensitive<00:02:42.390> person<00:02:42.930> but

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
I've always been a sensitive person but

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.350 
I've always been a sensitive person but
at<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.010> certain<00:02:44.280> point<00:02:44.400> my<00:02:44.640> life<00:02:44.850> through

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
at a certain point my life through

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.320 
at a certain point my life through
reading<00:02:45.870> and<00:02:46.290> through<00:02:46.590> school<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.340> learned<00:02:48.090> to

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
reading and through school I learned to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.930 
reading and through school I learned to
actually<00:02:48.510> articulate<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:50.100> nuance<00:02:50.400> and

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
actually articulate that nuance and

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.480 
actually articulate that nuance and
those<00:02:51.090> gray<00:02:51.450> spaces<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.500> all<00:02:53.280> my

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
those gray spaces and all my

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.250 
those gray spaces and all my
sensitivities<00:02:54.240> and<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.050> books

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
sensitivities and I think that books

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.660 
sensitivities and I think that books
like<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> reigns<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> day<00:02:56.160> can<00:02:56.370> really

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
like the reigns of the day can really

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.970 
like the reigns of the day can really
help<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.060> do<00:02:57.300> that<00:02:57.330> because<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:58.740> see

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
help you to do that because you can see

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.000 
help you to do that because you can see
how<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.820> character<00:03:00.690> was<00:03:00.990> both<00:03:01.230> completely

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
how a character was both completely

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.670 
how a character was both completely
right<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.670> completely<00:03:03.270> wrong<00:03:03.690> at<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.410> same

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
right and completely wrong at the same

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.950 
right and completely wrong at the same
time<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.240> try<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.510> make<00:03:06.750> sense

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
time and you have to try to make sense

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.750 
time and you have to try to make sense
of<00:03:07.140> that<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.470> yourself<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.100> also<00:03:08.220> get<00:03:08.460> to<00:03:08.580> see

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
of that for yourself you also get to see

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.020 
of that for yourself you also get to see
that<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.480> end<00:03:09.720> being<00:03:10.530> right<00:03:11.030> doesn't

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
that in the end being right doesn't

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.370 
that in the end being right doesn't
matter<00:03:12.390> that<00:03:12.540> much

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380
