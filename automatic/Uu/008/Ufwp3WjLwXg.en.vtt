sometimes<00:07:11.890> you<00:07:12.160> know<00:07:12.250> there's<00:07:12.460> going<00:07:12.610> to<00:07:12.700> be

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:12.730 
sometimes you know there's going to be

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.550 
sometimes you know there's going to be
some<00:07:13.030> gaps<00:07:13.240> of<00:07:13.540> where<00:07:13.810> we<00:07:13.960> can't<00:07:14.170> really<00:07:14.440> get

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
some gaps of where we can't really get

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.170 
some gaps of where we can't really get
together<00:07:14.710> and<00:07:15.100> get<00:07:15.220> it<00:07:15.370> all<00:07:15.460> done<00:07:15.670> like<00:07:15.910> we<00:07:16.060> do

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
together and get it all done like we do

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.170 
together and get it all done like we do
normally<00:07:16.390> but<00:07:16.660> that's<00:07:16.990> because<00:07:17.730> we<00:07:18.730> try<00:07:18.940> to<00:07:19.000> do

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
normally but that's because we try to do

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:20.250 
normally but that's because we try to do
things<00:07:19.360> a<00:07:19.510> little<00:07:19.540> differently<00:07:20.050> than

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.260 
things a little differently than

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.870 
things a little differently than
everybody<00:07:20.470> else<00:07:20.800> and<00:07:21.010> there's<00:07:21.640> a<00:07:21.700> lot<00:07:21.850> more

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:21.880 
everybody else and there's a lot more

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.460 
everybody else and there's a lot more
time<00:07:22.270> and<00:07:22.300> a<00:07:22.540> lot<00:07:22.660> more<00:07:22.720> effort<00:07:23.320> and<00:07:23.380> a<00:07:23.440> lot

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:23.470 
time and a lot more effort and a lot

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.830 
time and a lot more effort and a lot
more<00:07:23.620> work<00:07:23.890> invested<00:07:24.460> than<00:07:24.610> I<00:07:24.910> think<00:07:25.570> people

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 
more work invested than I think people

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.500 
more work invested than I think people
think<00:07:26.020> so<00:07:26.490> all<00:07:27.490> they<00:07:27.700> see<00:07:27.760> is<00:07:27.940> the<00:07:28.210> you<00:07:28.390> know

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
think so all they see is the you know

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.600 
think so all they see is the you know
six<00:07:28.780> minute<00:07:28.990> video<00:07:29.080> in<00:07:29.320> the<00:07:29.410> end<00:07:29.560> but<00:07:29.830> there's

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
six minute video in the end but there's

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:33.510 
six minute video in the end but there's
