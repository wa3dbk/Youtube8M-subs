00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.610
 Welcome your love to one 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.849
 new video today there are Christmassy 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.050
 sheaf of almonds wrapped in chocolate 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.700
 I 'm looking forward to it, I hope you too 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.400
 stay tuned now there's more 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:30.140
 I 'm easy and happy 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.140
 and sometimes completely 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.570
 okay for the later you also her husband 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.300
 because chocolate 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.460
 that was almost a little bit good 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.410
 still or coconut fat even better so how 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.860
 I have the blocking of the almonds 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.449
 Put some water in the pan 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.090
 The almonds are covered with the almonds 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.710
 water and it gets heated and believe 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.239
 I'm just in front of the cook from the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.860
 down herdplatte and then I can do that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.360
 peel off the almonds 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 block while the almonds are here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.570
 be first hot I do not do in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.130
 The chocolate tractor I was really like that 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.430
 I have never had the recipe on it 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 So far I have only made it yesterday 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 a friend recommended and 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.390
 I think it's quite spontaneous 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 also spice up you can be a bit 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.020
 even if you like it or not 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.250
 chili because the combination with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.950
 I like chocolate and chili 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.270
 personally very exciting a little 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.950
 secret tip of my girlfriend 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.840
 like the chocolate then on the almonds 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.270
 sticks in the connection really nice 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.910
 when it is dry and take it 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.200
 I have a bit of coconut oil 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.990
 but unfortunately not at home, but there 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.630
 is just a biomarket and also in the supermarket 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.980
 only such a small tip then still holds 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.420
 a tick better I just take it 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.950
 a bit of butter that would have to 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.580
 work very little bit of butter 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.580
 to 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:07.680
 but now it's on 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:10.420
 where now the almonds are blocked and 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.980
 now you have her in your little one 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.300
 I just realize that it 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.880
 almonds are not that easy 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.500
 to hold yourself 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can say this one with it 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 buy a supermarket 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.480
 but they are supposed to be the ones 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.080
 just getting older and then are 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.250
 according to rancid I will the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.710
 roast almonds again for a short time 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.870
 because I personally love that if that 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.550
 it still nuts this rust flavor to it 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.110
 In addition, have the perfect day and 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.500
 I hope that is really very short 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.570
 and even without fat must do 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.459
 I always very, very happy as 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.770
 burns here just captured everything in 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.550
 the pan fits well it goes 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.630
 super fast with the nuts in the 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.630
 soft liquid chocolate 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.590
 I would like to experiment a bit 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.720
 I will cook some cookies 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.230
 make classical or in addition to 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.150
 Spice up 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.150
 I'll do some with cinnamon 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.180
 is there still a bit of cinnamon added to that 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:24.570
 In any case, it suits me well 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.030
 certainly not all the more excited 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.340
 If you are in stable condition then too 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.960
 really hold or if they are completely one 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.250
 be a bit muddy and if you like 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.680
 be fixed at all by that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.770
 I would just then at least 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.970
 place in the refrigerator overnight 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.230
 and then the next day they should 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.640
 actually already be solid 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.270
 If you like, you can have a few 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.680
 grated coconut so I have 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.160
 cheated a little bit now 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.470
 I have a few cookies 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.080
 already placed in the freezer 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.740
 and there they are really tough 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.920
 become 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.270
 I'm really excited about this 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.430
 You really can look really pretty 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.400
 give a good gift 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.170
 Now they are being tried I am 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.760
 look it bitter chocolate right now 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.430
 really still such a hassle after 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.710
 taste has for the really sweet 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.330
 sweet tooth among you I would 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.200
 really recommended milk chocolate 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:22.350
 because it really is a bit bitter I like 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.570
 it just as totally and the nuts roasted 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.190
 I can really recommend that 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.530
 Just pause in the pan 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.230
 before you give her the chocolate 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.210
 because it tastes good 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.820
 and that gives so this is extra again 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 also great if you also so green tips 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.130
 have for nice homemade gifts 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.600
 Cookies that you prepare quickly 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.980

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.960
 have it in the comments or sends 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.419

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.160
 We liked to tell you then 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.090

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.650
