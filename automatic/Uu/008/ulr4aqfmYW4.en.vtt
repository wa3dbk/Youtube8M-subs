Camry and basically the idol was really

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.590 
Camry and basically the idol was really
rough<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.020> AC<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.769> AC<00:00:23.250> office<00:00:23.970> runs<00:00:24.359> nice

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
rough the AC on the AC office runs nice

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.560 
rough the AC on the AC office runs nice
and<00:00:24.779> smooth<00:00:24.990> right<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.320> 7.50<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.480> reading<00:00:27.480> on

and smooth right at 7.50 and reading on

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.189 
and smooth right at 7.50 and reading on
the<00:00:27.689> internet<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.710> found<00:00:29.580> everybody<00:00:30.199> basically

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the internet I found everybody basically

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
the internet I found everybody basically
said<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> check<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.130> throttle<00:00:32.520> body<00:00:32.700> first

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
said to check your throttle body first

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.020 
said to check your throttle body first
and<00:00:33.860> check<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.950> plugs<00:00:35.219> wires

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
and check the plugs wires

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.930 
and check the plugs wires
you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.690> stuff<00:00:36.989> regarding<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> engine<00:00:37.940> my

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you know stuff regarding the engine my

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.119 
you know stuff regarding the engine my
first<00:00:39.210> thought<00:00:39.390> was<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.260> isn't<00:00:40.440> right

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
first thought was that this isn't right

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.240 
first thought was that this isn't right
first<00:00:41.579> my<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:42.570> thought<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.980> is

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
first my first thought was a this is

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.240 
first my first thought was a this is
usually<00:00:44.789> caused<00:00:45.059> by<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.680> condition<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
usually caused by a condition when the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.180 
usually caused by a condition when the
compressor<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> too<00:00:48.090> full<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.329> freon<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.620> if

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
compressor is too full of freon so if

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.970 
compressor is too full of freon so if
you<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.579> problem<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.180> camry

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
you have this problem with your camry

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.959 
you have this problem with your camry

nine<00:00:59.460> Camry<00:01:02.180> crappy<00:01:11.720> so<00:01:12.720> first<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.770> valve

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
nine Camry crappy so first this valve

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.960 
nine Camry crappy so first this valve
right<00:01:14.280> here<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:15.240> your<00:01:15.420> low-pressure<00:01:15.840> side<00:01:16.229> and

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
right here is your low-pressure side and

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.060 
right here is your low-pressure side and
this<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> where<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> put<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.570> freon<00:01:18.840> end<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this is where you put the freon end the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
this is where you put the freon end the
first<00:01:20.280> thing<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.790> hooked<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.150> my<00:01:21.360> gauges<00:01:22.020> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
first thing is I hooked up my gauges to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.710 
first thing is I hooked up my gauges to
here<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.670> check<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.000> pressure<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
here to check the pressure and you

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.940 
here to check the pressure and you
really<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.619> get<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> much

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
really don't you get you get a much

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.760 
really don't you get you get a much
higher<00:01:26.130> reading<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.700> engine<00:01:27.030> off<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> I

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
higher reading with the engine off so I

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
higher reading with the engine off so I
basically<00:01:29.100> hooked<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> gauge<00:01:29.729> started

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
basically hooked up the gauge started

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.340 
basically hooked up the gauge started
the<00:01:30.720> car<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:32.299> then<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.420> opened<00:01:33.720> up<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> valves

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the car and then I opened up the valves

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
the car and then I opened up the valves
I<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> pressure<00:01:35.250> reading<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:36.360> I

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
I could take a pressure reading and I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
I could take a pressure reading and I
was<00:01:36.540> reading<00:01:36.750> about<00:01:36.930> 70<00:01:37.439> psi<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> way

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
was reading about 70 psi and that is way

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.609 
was reading about 70 psi and that is way
way<00:01:39.720> way<00:01:39.750> too<00:01:40.049> high<00:01:41.240> so<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.930> did<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
way way too high so what I did is I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.700 
way way too high so what I did is I
hooked<00:01:44.549> up<00:01:44.759> I've<00:01:45.720> got<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> machine<00:01:46.290> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
hooked up I've got a machine that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.219 
hooked up I've got a machine that
vacuums<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.220> freon<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.600> I<00:01:48.630> basically<00:01:48.840> hooked

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
vacuums out freon and I basically hooked

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
vacuums out freon and I basically hooked
that<00:01:49.350> up<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.890> let<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.460> down<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> about<00:01:50.909> 45<00:01:51.299> psi

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that up and let it down to about 45 psi

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.910 
that up and let it down to about 45 psi
which<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> about<00:01:53.130> right<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.729> high<00:01:53.880> side

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
which is about right on the high side

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.730 
which is about right on the high side
and<00:01:56.700> anyway<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.479> completely<00:01:58.200> cured<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
and anyway that completely cured the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.320 
and anyway that completely cured the
condition<00:01:59.220> so<00:01:59.880> if<00:01:59.940> you're<00:02:00.090> having<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
condition so if you're having this

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.670 
condition so if you're having this
problem<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.960> first<00:02:01.260> thing<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> would

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
problem that's the first thing I would

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.670 
problem that's the first thing I would
check<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:03.020> there's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> AC<00:02:04.260> compressor

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
check and there's the AC compressor

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.310 
check and there's the AC compressor
right<00:02:05.010> there<00:02:05.510> if<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.659> have<00:02:06.750> any<00:02:06.810> questions
