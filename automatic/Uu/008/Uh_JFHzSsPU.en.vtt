00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hi everyone, welcome to 01net tv 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 what are you waiting for a robot to do 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 the housekeeping that keeps you company 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.809
 that binds to work for you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.730
 we were talking about all this this week at 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.480
 lyon françois yes actually and then 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.520
 yesterday in our 0 alive weekly between 18h 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.900
 at 18:30 on 01net tv the debriefing of 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.019
 the high tech news and we were getting 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 about it amelia charney who went to 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.830
 lyon and who discovered all these robots 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.250
 who may arrive at home in 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.250
 a few years 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.250
 what have you discovered this year had 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.610
 our robots share exciting things 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.510
 first the French exoskeleton which 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 is called hercules 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.240
 he will soon be marketed the art 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.280
 when I say that you have tried 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.440
 we want it I tried them so here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.140
 it will be there you seem to be a little 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.360
 bothered a fortnight then so a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.890
 exoskeleton is a robotic armor 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.949
 1 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.240
 so that's so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.310
 it's a corner and well it's mostly for 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.560
 carry heavy loads so you can 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 wear up to 40 kg without feeling them 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.710
 in fact 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.179
 and what's even more awesome 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.340
 is that the frame itself it 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.280
 Weighs 32 kg and feels like it 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.770
 weighs 1 to 2 kg in fact so that's true 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.069
 it's blue for multiple forces 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.899
 human 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.890
 that's exactly and so in fact at 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.420
 departure it's a project that has been 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.079
 financed by the French army for 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.880
 to actually relieve the loads of the soldiers 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.159
 but it already exists 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 i believe then in the united states no it's 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.619
 still prototypes 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.030
 Americans need a lot of ads there 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 on it but there is no weapon is still 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.920
 in the world that use that remains of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 prototypes but the one the French is 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.729
 already well advanced and then he is missing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.369
 just the arms in fact 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.329
 articulated on the civilian prototype there 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.130
 we see and unfortunately I have not 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.869
 I did not have permission to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.640
 myself lift loads on the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 salon for security reasons they 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.610
 did not want 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.860
 I was afraid that you broke head I 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.049
 do not know you see there's a 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.729
 strong expectation must read all the stands 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.799
 yamani coming with his big muscles 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.510
 that said we represent but still a 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.280
 time it can be it can have a 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.450
 really impressive utility too 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 for disabled people 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.590
 I imagine because we may eventually 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.389
 that m these robots could walk to the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.220
 place of someone who no longer has the used 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.709
 of his legs that already exists in fact 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.959
 everything that is exoskeleton for 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.680
 disabled it already makes work 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.630
 Paraplegic 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.489
 it's already commercialized it's already 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.989
 something that is well on the way 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.280
 however, it still costs 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.720
 tens of thousands of euros 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.299
 that it's not accessible to everyone 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
 but then it's just legs for 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.470
 the us while these prototypes there they 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.630
 are also dedicated to 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.480
 actually wrapped the whole body and so 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.190
 to have also articulated arms then 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.570
 that exoskeletons for the disabled do not 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.240
 allow that market not to lift 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.820
 loads very well then beyond 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.020
 did you also meet romeo 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.580
 what a nice name alain condis evening there 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.660
 had no juliet but we can 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.300
 consider chromium is also the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.430
 cell if yes it's the first time 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.770
 that they were unveiled it's the big 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.570
 little brother has ok now yes a 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.220
 French humanoid who has a success 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.750
 huge in the whole world then 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.240
 Unfortunately when I passed 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.770
 iboguhé a little so I could not see it 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.290
 in all its splendor but it's 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.209
 rather the project itself which is 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.650
 very interesting because so that's 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.260
 a French company aldebaran which the 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.730
 develops it's a service robot so 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.410
 I do not know if you saw the series 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.640
 human was broadcast by arte so we 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.470
 see that there are seniors 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.209
 in this series that uses robots 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.270
 and each family has a completely 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.040
 human appearance which is actually a 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.750
 domestic koala and romeo that's all to 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.890
 do that so they consider for example 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.510
 that there is a learning phase that 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:57.030
 get used to people who who who 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.470
 get used to their action throughout 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.850
 of the day and for example when you 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.110
 will you sit in front of the TV he 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.640
 understand that you have to bring your 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.730
 glasses 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.379
 so 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.629
 but it's mostly for people 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.010
 elderly to keep them at home 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.720
 as long as possible in good health 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.340
 but it could cost how much 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.569
 already really moved that a prototype 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.519
 which is not intended to be marketed 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.669
 behind all that there is still something 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.800
 ultimate is for the CEOs of aldébaran 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.150
 it may be that the robot will replace 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.620
 the smartphone the remote control and 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.660
 the computer that it will be the last 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.840
 interface in fact my body is going to him 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.910
 talk and he will answer us and and 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.430
 become a bit the ultimate interface 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.500
 and then quickly bim who and bim then 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.880
 bim it's a telepresence robot then 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.990
 it is already operational already 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.000
 marketed the hadopi the week 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.500
 last in France and then it's enough 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.449
 surreal in the corridors of innorobo 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.860
 we saw lots of people who were at 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.810
 abroad Germany or the United States 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.639
 who was actually visiting all the time 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.870
 distance from their computer this robot 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.130
 and here is the robot that could we 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.430
 to be in the office without being 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.940
 exactly that's it then so one a 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.160
 fisheye camera there are microphones and so 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.660
 we can interact remotely with 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.910
 people who are on the spot that's when 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.830
 even I tell you that like that a little 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.960
 your office colleagues riding on 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.130
 casters like that but in fact if you 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.220
 do not want us to see you 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.389
 pass between very robust tests 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.410
 so for those who would like them 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.810
 pity and is besides there is a 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.490
 operation right now is a test in 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.650
 the rhône alpes region for robots 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.479
 high school students that is to say to allow 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:25.830
 students who are sick and they 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.050
 stay at home to attend classes at 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.979
 distance and this kind of post thanked 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.970
 by the same box 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.970
 that's awesome
