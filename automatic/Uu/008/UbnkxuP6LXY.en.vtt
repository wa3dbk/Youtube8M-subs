00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
life and I feel like they kind of really

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.670 
life and I feel like they kind of really
tend<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.760> relate<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.360> her<00:02:23.660> situation<00:02:24.349> and

historical non-fiction book about 100

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.380 
historical non-fiction book about 100
objects<00:03:45.980> in<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.220> British<00:03:46.459> Museum<00:03:46.640> that<00:03:47.180> have
