00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.500
 Hi everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.730
 goes from making pastries to pasta of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.950
 almonds 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 you can buy peeled and almonds 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.020
 then to give her to finely chop with a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 mixer or almond flour already 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.629
 ready if found in the market there 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 I recommend using a porsche bag 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.070
 with the spout large enough 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 otherwise then you will find difficulty in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 drain the mixture for that 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.059
 will be enough I think we go to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.949
 see immediately how to do it 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.949
 these luscious biscuits 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.710
 first of all 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.650
 can apply almond flour 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.740
 because it must be very fine if not 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.350
 find the almond flour you can 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.369
 use the peeled almonds and le 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 go to finely chop 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.350
 I have an i phone 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.430
 almonds chopped with the mixer lo 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.420
 icing sugar 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:36.750
 now I'm going to mix them add some 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.220
 vanillin to make the flour again 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.409
 finer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 I will go to sift I have sifted the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.149
 almond flour with sugar a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.840
 I go to insert it inside that 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.119
 the planetary but you can do this 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:01.860
 operation also simply with one 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:10.310
 spatula I put the hook I add 3 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:13.970
 egg whites and a few drops of almond mara 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.760
 and began to knead 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.720
 I do the planetary until when 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.630
 I will not have obtained a compact compound 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.870
 almond paste ready I can 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.030
 start making biscuits ho 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.400
 put the almond paste in one 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.660
 porsche bag with the starred spout 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.950
 the spout must be enough 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.900
 great 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.910
 just to make it easier to escape 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.810
 of almond paste in the 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.620
 making cookies begins at 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.620
 to make cookies 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.580
 you can outside 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.580
 and of various types 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.900
 I'm going to decorate cookies with gods 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.540
 candied in the round ones I will go to put 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.030
 of candied cherries in this 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 type of biscuits I'll go to put 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:48.480
 a peeled almond here I will go to put 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:50.989
 of candied oranges or cedar al 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.989
 face 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.140
 almond paste pastries are 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.810
 ready with the doses I have from you as they are 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.150
 came around 55 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.000
 now they will have to rest at least for 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.370
 12 hours before being baked because 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.090
 have to dry the pastries and alle 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.090
 almonds after 12 hours are perfectly 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.090
 dry 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:32.650
 so I can put it in a hot oven a 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.979
 180 degrees for ten minutes after ten 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:39.669
 Cooking minutes are ready will have to 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:42.789
 to be slightly amber I leave them 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.550
 cool completely before going there 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:50.319
 to disconnect from the card oven 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:54.069
 otherwise they will be ruined and ready 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:56.979
 almond pastries already placed 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:06.190
 on the tray I will also show you how 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:08.370
 they appear below as the that after the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.370
 cooking 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.259
 I hope this recipe was too 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.199
 to your liking 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:19.199
 a hug to everyone and the next
