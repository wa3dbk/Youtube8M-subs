making a dashboard app for the iPad and

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.319 
making a dashboard app for the iPad and
in<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:59.019> demonstration<00:00:59.350> of<00:00:59.920> the<00:01:00.070> iPad<00:01:00.460> at<00:01:01.030> the

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
in the demonstration of the iPad at the

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.580 
in the demonstration of the iPad at the
at<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:02.100> apple<00:01:03.100> event<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:04.600> are<00:01:04.660> missing<00:01:04.960> six

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
at the apple event they are missing six

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.120 
at the apple event they are missing six
core<00:01:06.070> applications<00:01:07.030> which<00:01:07.750> are<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.740> stocks

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
core applications which are the stocks

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.400 
core applications which are the stocks
the<00:01:09.610> weather<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.240> voice<00:01:10.420> memos<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.140> clock

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
the weather the voice memos the clock

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.190 
the weather the voice memos the clock
the<00:01:11.890> calculator<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.790> compass<00:01:13.240> and<00:01:13.480> that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
the calculator and the compass and that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.030 
the calculator and the compass and that
doesn't<00:01:14.560> make<00:01:14.770> much<00:01:15.340> sense<00:01:15.400> because<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.630> has<00:01:16.810> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
doesn't make much sense because it has a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.090 
doesn't make much sense because it has a
1024<00:01:18.040> x<00:01:18.520> 768<00:01:19.479> resolution<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:22.060> those<00:01:22.299> apps<00:01:22.630> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
1024 x 768 resolution for those apps and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700 
1024 x 768 resolution for those apps and
it<00:01:24.100> also<00:01:24.549> has<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.850> 10<00:01:25.210> inch<00:01:25.420> screen<00:01:25.540> so<00:01:26.229> it

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
it also has a 10 inch screen so it

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.410 
it also has a 10 inch screen so it
doesn't<00:01:27.130> make<00:01:27.220> sense<00:01:27.280> that<00:01:27.729> they<00:01:28.090> wouldn't

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
doesn't make sense that they wouldn't

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.649 
doesn't make sense that they wouldn't
make<00:01:28.570> use<00:01:28.810> of<00:01:28.840> those<00:01:29.229> apps<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.880> next<00:01:31.119> rumor

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
make use of those apps so the next rumor

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.219 
make use of those apps so the next rumor
in<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:31.930> video<00:01:32.290> is<00:01:32.939> relating<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.119> flash<00:01:34.420> so

this has may has made a lot of buzz in
the<00:01:39.759> tech<00:01:40.030> world<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.840> there<00:01:41.619> has<00:01:41.860> been<00:01:42.540> some

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
the tech world and there has been some

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.389 
the tech world and there has been some
videos<00:01:43.990> that<00:01:44.020> Apple<00:01:44.530> has<00:01:44.560> posted<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.189> head

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
videos that Apple has posted the head

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.149 
videos that Apple has posted the head
flash<00:01:45.759> then<00:01:46.450> like<00:01:46.899> an<00:01:47.110> hour<00:01:47.320> later<00:01:47.740> they<00:01:48.009> would

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
flash then like an hour later they would

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.670 
flash then like an hour later they would
correct<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:49.299> they<00:01:49.540> don't<00:01:49.810> have<00:01:49.899> flash<00:01:50.380> on

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
correct it that they don't have flash on

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.719 
correct it that they don't have flash on
the<00:01:50.799> iPad<00:01:51.250> then<00:01:51.909> that's<00:01:52.090> mean<00:01:53.280> going<00:01:54.280> back<00:01:54.520> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
the iPad then that's mean going back and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.920 
the iPad then that's mean going back and
forth<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.899> that<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:57.070> flash<00:01:57.340> so<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.570> think

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
forth so that is the flash so I think

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.800 
forth so that is the flash so I think
there<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.289> capabilities<00:02:00.280> on<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> flash<00:02:01.210> on<00:02:01.539> the

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
there is capabilities on a flash on the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.389 
there is capabilities on a flash on the
iPad<00:02:02.799> but<00:02:03.100> that<00:02:03.700> is<00:02:04.829> undecided<00:02:05.829> yet<00:02:05.859> I<00:02:06.070> guess

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
iPad but that is undecided yet I guess

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.440 
iPad but that is undecided yet I guess
and<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> last<00:02:08.500> rumor<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.369> this<00:02:10.090> video

the software development kit is why it

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.640 
the software development kit is why it
is<00:02:50.230> basically<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:52.150> made<00:02:52.930> for<00:02:52.959> creating

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
is basically the made for creating

is basically the made for creating
iphone<00:02:54.069> apps<00:02:54.340> so<00:02:55.330> that<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.930> pretty<00:02:56.260> weird<00:02:56.620> that

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
iphone apps so that is pretty weird that

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.390 
iphone apps so that is pretty weird that
it<00:02:57.069> has<00:02:57.220> support<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.950> iPad<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.190> there

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it has support for the iPad but there

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.589
