this up here so you can see the mix okay
and<00:00:13.110> what<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> did<00:00:13.670> was<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.849> made<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.360> mixture

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
and what I did was I made this mixture

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.050 
and what I did was I made this mixture
i'm<00:00:16.320> eighty-percent<00:00:17.300> zinc<00:00:18.300> sulfide<00:00:18.840> 9%

grinding between three and five percent
depending<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.400> works<00:00:26.910> best<00:00:27.210> for<00:00:27.390> you

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
depending on what works best for you

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.099 
depending on what works best for you
than<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.800> little<00:00:29.070> bit<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.310> baking<00:00:29.730> soda

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
than just a little bit of baking soda

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.580 
than just a little bit of baking soda
five<00:00:31.109> percent<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.000> tin<00:00:33.000> oxide<00:00:33.540> at<00:00:34.110> three

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
five percent and tin oxide at three

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.250 
five percent and tin oxide at three
percent<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.969> then<00:00:36.300> when<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.480> do<00:00:36.600> is<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> put<00:00:36.989> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
percent and then when I do is I put this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.610 
percent and then when I do is I put this
in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> tube<00:00:37.800> before<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.280> put<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> copper<00:00:39.210> in

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
in the tube before I put the copper in

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.220 
in the tube before I put the copper in
here<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.850> heat<00:00:42.149> this<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.690> bring<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
here and I heat this and bring it to a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.279 
here and I heat this and bring it to a
liquid<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.890> actually<00:00:44.340> melts<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.899> mixes

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
liquid it actually melts and it mixes

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.139 
liquid it actually melts and it mixes
all<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.620> together<00:00:46.829> melts<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.640> then<00:00:47.760> it<00:00:47.910> forms

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
all up together melts and then it forms

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.189 
all up together melts and then it forms
its<00:00:48.450> crystal<00:00:49.280> while<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.520> Chloe<00:00:50.989> ok<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.170> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
its crystal while it's Chloe ok now I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.709 
its crystal while it's Chloe ok now I
haven't<00:00:52.680> put<00:00:52.920> any<00:00:53.280> power<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.120> crystal<00:00:54.570> at

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
haven't put any power on the crystal at

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
haven't put any power on the crystal at
all<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.219> just<00:00:56.219> left<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.230> usually<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.980> show

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
all I just left it and usually they show

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.060 
all I just left it and usually they show
some<00:01:00.390> amount<00:01:00.780> when<00:01:01.020> they're<00:01:01.230> warm<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.969> then

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
some amount when they're warm and then

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.469 
some amount when they're warm and then
after<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.189> cool<00:01:05.430> off<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.880> go<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.090> zero<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
after they cool off they go to zero and

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
after they cool off they go to zero and
then<00:01:06.600> they<00:01:06.720> come<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:07.220> ok<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.280> anyway<00:01:08.700> i'm

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
then they come back ok so anyway i'm

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
then they come back ok so anyway i'm
going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.270> show<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.750> I'm<00:01:09.990> going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> let

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
going to show you the I'm going to let

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.100 
going to show you the I'm going to let
you<00:01:11.070> look<00:01:11.340> at<00:01:11.520> one<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.630> can<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
you look at one here you can see I just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920 
you look at one here you can see I just
melted<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> start<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.369> rot<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.780> because<00:01:15.780> I'll

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
melted it start to rot in because I'll

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.719 
melted it start to rot in because I'll
just<00:01:16.140> experimenting<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:16.979> it<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.490> I'll<00:01:17.580> hook

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
just experimenting with it so I'll hook

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
just experimenting with it so I'll hook
it<00:01:17.880> up<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:22.350> one<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.159> noticed

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
it up and this one here and I noticed

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.210 
it up and this one here and I noticed
that<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.880> fluctuate<00:01:24.210> during<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> day<00:01:25.320> they

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that they fluctuate during the day they

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.190 
that they fluctuate during the day they
sometimes<00:01:26.640> are<00:01:27.060> high<00:01:27.240> sometimes<00:01:27.840> they're<00:01:28.020> low

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
sometimes are high sometimes they're low

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.130 
sometimes are high sometimes they're low
okay<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> dead<00:01:30.150> short<00:01:30.450> current<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
okay so this is a dead short current to

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.539 
okay so this is a dead short current to
it<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:34.200> can<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.159> holding

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
it so you can see that it's just holding

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.620 
it so you can see that it's just holding
there<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.479> I'll<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.780> some<00:01:36.990> others<00:01:37.259> here

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.730 

this<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:43.790> here<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.870> little<00:01:46.230> bigger<00:01:46.470> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
this one here is a little bigger and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.700 
this one here is a little bigger and
it's<00:01:46.890> iron<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:48.060> some<00:01:48.420> iron<00:01:48.690> sulfide<00:01:49.290> mixed

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it's iron has some iron sulfide mixed

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.570 
it's iron has some iron sulfide mixed
with<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.150> instead<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.720> 10<00:01:54.170> and<00:01:55.400> you<00:01:56.400> can

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
with it instead of the 10 and you can

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.080 
with it instead of the 10 and you can
see<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.940> reading<00:01:57.300> on<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.660> one<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:59.370> you<00:02:00.060> can

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
see the reading on this one and you can

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.700 
see the reading on this one and you can
see<00:02:00.390> what<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:01.050> remember<00:02:01.500> it's<00:02:01.620> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
see what they do but remember it's a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.560 
see what they do but remember it's a
short<00:02:02.010> circuit<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.640> so<00:02:02.910> I<00:02:02.940> don't<00:02:03.150> have<00:02:03.510> a

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
short circuit here so I don't have a

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.410 
short circuit here so I don't have a
load<00:02:03.960> resistor<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.620> I'm<00:02:05.490> just<00:02:05.730> sorting<00:02:06.120> it<00:02:06.270> out

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
load resistor so I'm just sorting it out

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.500 
load resistor so I'm just sorting it out
but<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:06.900> can<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:08.090> holds<00:02:09.090> pretty

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
but you can see that it holds pretty

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.960 
but you can see that it holds pretty
well<00:02:10.160> and<00:02:11.160> I've<00:02:11.430> done<00:02:11.610> nothing<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:12.180> them<00:02:12.560> and

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
well and I've done nothing to them and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.290 
well and I've done nothing to them and
then<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.210> one<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:19.250> another<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
then this one here is another one that I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.690 
then this one here is another one that I
put<00:02:21.630> together<00:02:21.750> just<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.380> try<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:23.010> make<00:02:23.490> sure

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
put together just to try to make sure

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.490 
put together just to try to make sure
the<00:02:23.850> mix<00:02:24.090> works<00:02:24.360> each<00:02:24.600> time<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.630> this<00:02:28.260> one

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the mix works each time and this one

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.170 
the mix works each time and this one
here<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.040> last<00:02:29.250> one<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.880> hasn't<00:02:30.030> even

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
here is the last one so it hasn't even

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.160 
here is the last one so it hasn't even
at<00:02:30.450> any<00:02:30.660> time<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.110> set<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.630> see<00:02:36.870> that

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
at any time to set and you can see that

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.330 
at any time to set and you can see that
it's<00:02:37.520> it's<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.730> little<00:02:38.970> bit<00:02:39.120> lower<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.800> as<00:02:41.070> it

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it's it's a little bit lower and as it

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.030 
it's it's a little bit lower and as it
but<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.300> fluctuate<00:02:42.630> during<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.530> day<00:02:43.740> so<00:02:43.800> you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
but they fluctuate during the day so you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.890 
but they fluctuate during the day so you
can<00:02:44.190> see<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.520> you<00:02:44.670> change<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.060> mix<00:02:45.390> around<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
can see as you change the mix around a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
can see as you change the mix around a
little<00:02:46.050> bit<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:47.370> get<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.580> different<00:02:48.920> current

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
little bit you get a different current

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.790 
little bit you get a different current
in<00:02:50.040> there<00:02:50.750> also<00:02:51.750> wanted<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.110> make<00:02:52.380> sure<00:02:52.410> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
in there also wanted to make sure and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.050 
in there also wanted to make sure and
document<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.610> thing<00:02:55.280> that's<00:02:56.280> all<00:02:56.489> i'm<00:02:56.670> using

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
document this thing that's all i'm using

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.210 
document this thing that's all i'm using
i'm<00:02:57.180> using<00:02:57.540> safe<00:02:57.840> chemicals<00:02:58.140> to<00:02:58.620> do<00:02:58.800> this<00:02:58.980> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
i'm using safe chemicals to do this I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.260 
i'm using safe chemicals to do this I
don't<00:03:00.150> want<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.420> use<00:03:00.959> anything<00:03:01.260> harmful<00:03:01.830> and<00:03:02.580> I

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
don't want to use anything harmful and I

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.220 
don't want to use anything harmful and I
have<00:03:03.480> not<00:03:03.690> done<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.290> anything<00:03:05.280> with<00:03:06.230> calcium

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
have not done with anything with calcium

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.120 
have not done with anything with calcium
yet<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.830> will<00:03:08.959> as<00:03:09.959> soon<00:03:09.989> as<00:03:10.350> I<00:03:10.440> find<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.830> correct

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
yet I will as soon as I find the correct

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.930 
yet I will as soon as I find the correct
rot<00:03:11.489> rock<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:12.930> I'll<00:03:13.080> use<00:03:13.190> calcium<00:03:14.190> carbonate

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
rot rock so I'll use calcium carbonate

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.140 
rot rock so I'll use calcium carbonate
in<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:16.380> next<00:03:16.739> one<00:03:17.270> along<00:03:18.270> with<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.810> elm<00:03:18.959> and

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
in the next one along with the elm and

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.290 
in the next one along with the elm and
zinc<00:03:21.150> seems<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.750> help<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.489> zinc<00:03:23.790> sulfide

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
zinc seems to help the zinc sulfide

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.120 
zinc seems to help the zinc sulfide
seems<00:03:24.600> to<00:03:24.780> help<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.170> these<00:03:25.320> self<00:03:25.620> so<00:03:25.830> I'm<00:03:25.920> going

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
seems to help in these self so I'm going

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.790 
seems to help in these self so I'm going
to<00:03:26.190> leave<00:03:26.370> this<00:03:26.520> here<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:26.910> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.180> get<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> good

look at what i did and remember what i
did<00:03:30.840> was<00:03:30.989> i<00:03:31.140> used<00:03:31.320> a<00:03:31.440> propane<00:03:31.920> torch<00:03:32.570> after<00:03:33.570> i

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
did was i used a propane torch after i

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.180 
did was i used a propane torch after i
put<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.020> material<00:03:34.590> em<00:03:35.360> and<00:03:36.360> i<00:03:36.480> heated<00:03:36.750> it

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
put the material em and i heated it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.460 
put the material em and i heated it
until<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.340> bubbled<00:03:38.730> up<00:03:38.880> got<00:03:39.570> real<00:03:39.870> gooey<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
until it bubbled up got real gooey and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.070 
until it bubbled up got real gooey and
then<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.489> shoved<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.000> electrode<00:03:42.570> down<00:03:42.840> in

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
then I shoved the electrode down in

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.760 
then I shoved the electrode down in
there<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.000> from<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.180> point

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
there and from that point

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.510 
there and from that point
I<00:03:46.800> have<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.550> hold<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.910> with<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.210> third<00:03:48.570> hand<00:03:48.930> and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
I have to hold it with a third hand and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.190 
I have to hold it with a third hand and
let<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.550> cool<00:03:50.880> at<00:03:51.120> room<00:03:51.150> temperature<00:03:51.960> and<00:03:51.990> when

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
let it cool at room temperature and when

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.910 
let it cool at room temperature and when
I<00:03:52.230> do<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.830> can<00:03:52.980> see<00:03:53.160> when<00:03:53.310> I<00:03:53.340> first<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.910> it

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
I do that you can see when I first do it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.440 
I do that you can see when I first do it
when<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.010> first<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.520> this<00:03:56.760> you'll<00:03:57.000> get<00:03:57.180> a<00:03:57.210> good

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
when you first do this you'll get a good

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.020 
when you first do this you'll get a good
voltage<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.230> then<00:03:59.010> it'll<00:03:59.220> drop<00:03:59.430> down<00:03:59.490> and

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
voltage and then it'll drop down and

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.590 
voltage and then it'll drop down and
it'll<00:04:00.210> stay<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.630> some<00:04:00.840> certain<00:04:01.260> level<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:01.860> I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
it'll stay at some certain level but I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.800 
it'll stay at some certain level but I
check<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:03.750> with<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.140> micro<00:04:04.680> amp<00:04:04.950> meter

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
check it with the micro amp meter

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.660 
check it with the micro amp meter
because<00:04:06.810> that's<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.410> dead<00:04:07.620> short<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.250> it<00:04:08.370> i<00:04:08.430> want

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
because that's a dead short to it i want

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.430 
because that's a dead short to it i want
to<00:04:08.730> see<00:04:08.880> that<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.180> then<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.690> will<00:04:09.870> hold<00:04:10.080> there

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
to see that it then it will hold there

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.300 
to see that it then it will hold there
you<00:04:11.280> know<00:04:11.430> at<00:04:11.700> some<00:04:12.030> level<00:04:12.710> so<00:04:13.710> i<00:04:13.740> wanted<00:04:14.250> to

the money and do that I'm not going to
do<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:47.340> at<00:04:47.760> this<00:04:47.790> time<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.560> might<00:04:49.560> i<00:04:49.940> did<00:04:50.940> buy

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
do that at this time I might i did buy

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.870 
do that at this time I might i did buy
five<00:04:52.050> gallons<00:04:52.590> of<00:04:52.740> liquid<00:04:53.100> glass<00:04:53.400> so<00:04:53.790> i'm

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
five gallons of liquid glass so i'm

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.270 
five gallons of liquid glass so i'm
going<00:04:54.090> to<00:04:56.180> heat<00:04:57.180> that<00:04:57.480> and<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.410> bring<00:04:58.860> it<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.070> a

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
going to heat that and and bring it to a

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.120 
going to heat that and and bring it to a
crystal<00:04:59.880> and<00:05:00.120> then<00:05:00.900> i'm<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.320> pulverize

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
crystal and then i'm going to pulverize

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.820 
crystal and then i'm going to pulverize
it<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:03.000> i'll<00:05:03.570> try<00:05:03.810> some<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.110> that<00:05:04.260> sodium

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
it and i'll try some of that sodium

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.610 
it and i'll try some of that sodium
silicate<00:05:05.240> in<00:05:06.240> here<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.080> i'll<00:05:07.290> just<00:05:07.500> keep

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
silicate in here and i'll just keep

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.710 
silicate in here and i'll just keep
documenting<00:05:08.460> this<00:05:08.670> and<00:05:08.940> putting<00:05:09.360> it<00:05:09.570> up<00:05:09.690> for

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
documenting this and putting it up for

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.980 
documenting this and putting it up for
you<00:05:10.020> guys<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:11.520> you'll<00:05:11.850> be<00:05:12.180> on<00:05:12.330> the<00:05:12.360> right<00:05:12.660> path
