00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
lined up next is my last two parts for

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.390 
lined up next is my last two parts for
the<00:05:21.800> extra<00:05:22.039> tech<00:05:22.159> and<00:05:22.370> is<00:05:22.669> my<00:05:23.589> melding<00:05:24.589> and<00:05:24.889> one

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
the extra tech and is my melding and one

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.079 
the extra tech and is my melding and one
of<00:05:26.319> Babel<00:05:27.319> is<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:28.309> reason<00:05:28.550> why<00:05:28.639> I<00:05:28.669> appeal<00:05:28.969> is

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:29.089 
of Babel is the reason why I appeal is

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:31.019 
of Babel is the reason why I appeal is
because<00:05:29.360> I<00:05:29.389> don't<00:05:29.509> have<00:05:29.689> a<00:05:29.749> second<00:05:30.020> golden<00:05:30.319> but

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
because I don't have a second golden but

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.290 
because I don't have a second golden but
once

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
once

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.140 
once

Nolan becomes legal here in DC and a

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.809 
Nolan becomes legal here in DC and a
month<00:05:35.449> or<00:05:35.569> two<00:05:35.719> I<00:05:35.930> would<00:05:36.860> play<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.099> just

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:37.819 
month or two I would play to just

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.200 
month or two I would play to just
because<00:05:38.089> this<00:05:38.830> is<00:05:39.830> a<00:05:39.889> must<00:05:40.430> card<00:05:40.699> to<00:05:41.059> have

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
because this is a must card to have

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.159 
because this is a must card to have
because<00:05:42.849> ideally<00:05:43.849> when<00:05:44.419> used<00:05:44.659> as<00:05:44.839> the<00:05:44.930> fact

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
because ideally when used as the fact

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.159 
because ideally when used as the fact
you<00:05:45.650> hoping<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.699> have<00:05:47.060> your<00:05:47.300> star<00:05:47.629> driving<00:05:48.050> a
