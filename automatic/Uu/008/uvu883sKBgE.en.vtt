00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
background just to look at while we talk

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.550 
background just to look at while we talk
about<00:00:25.769> this<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.539> first<00:00:27.779> thing<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
about this so the first thing is the

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.820 
about this so the first thing is the
huge<00:00:29.070> screen<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.730> 4.3<00:00:30.449> inches<00:00:30.800> which<00:00:31.800> is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
huge screen it's 4.3 inches which is

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350 
huge screen it's 4.3 inches which is
bigger<00:00:32.340> than<00:00:32.489> anything<00:00:32.790> else<00:00:33.000> we've<00:00:33.120> got<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
bigger than anything else we've got the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.299 
bigger than anything else we've got the
moment<00:00:33.660> especially<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.680> an<00:00:34.739> Android<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
moment especially with an Android I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.020 
moment especially with an Android I
think<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.790> about<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.090> same<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.630> hd2<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
think it's about the same as the hd2 and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.459 
think it's about the same as the hd2 and
along<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.059> screen<00:00:39.540> along<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.079> bottom<00:00:40.170> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
along with screen along the bottom you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
along with screen along the bottom you
can<00:00:40.590> see<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> has<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.190> four<00:00:41.399> that's<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can see it has the four that's not a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.020 
can see it has the four that's not a
very<00:00:42.540> good<00:00:42.629> picture<00:00:43.190> okay<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:44.910> it's

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
very good picture okay you can see it's

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
very good picture okay you can see it's
got<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.210> four<00:00:45.420> hardware<00:00:46.379> buttons<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:47.760> screen

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
got the four hardware buttons the screen

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.279 
got the four hardware buttons the screen
has<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.690> resolution<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.860> 854<00:00:50.730> x<00:00:50.760> 480<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.260> a

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
has a resolution of 854 x 480 which is a

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.970 
has a resolution of 854 x 480 which is a
fw<00:00:53.190> vga<00:00:53.550> screen<00:00:54.350> which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.379> different<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.829> most

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
fw vga screen which is different to most

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.650 
fw vga screen which is different to most
of<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.219> leading<00:00:56.399> android<00:00:57.030> phones<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> moment

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
of the leading android phones the moment

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.770 
of the leading android phones the moment
which<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.140> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.320> wvga<00:00:59.010> which<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> 800<00:01:00.690> x

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
which go in the wvga which is the 800 x

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.250 
which go in the wvga which is the 800 x
480<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.949> we'll<00:01:02.250> see<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.699> works<00:01:02.910> out<00:01:03.170> when<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
480 so we'll see that works out when it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
480 so we'll see that works out when it
comes<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.530> rendering<00:01:04.830> apps<00:01:05.720> not<00:01:06.720> sure<00:01:06.869> if

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
comes to rendering apps not sure if

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.300 
comes to rendering apps not sure if
things<00:01:07.170> look<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> little<00:01:07.560> weird<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> start<00:01:08.159> with

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
things look a little weird to start with

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.450 
things look a little weird to start with
until<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> dead<00:01:09.210> sort<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> sort<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.460> along

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
until the dead sort of sort out along

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
until the dead sort of sort out along
with<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> new<00:01:12.360> moto<00:01:12.600> blur

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
with this it's got the new moto blur

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
with this it's got the new moto blur
which<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> Perry<00:01:13.650> much<00:01:13.890> better<00:01:14.159> than<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
which is Perry much better than the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.640 
which is Perry much better than the
older<00:01:15.450> versions<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.780> motoblur<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.439> much

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
older versions of motoblur it's much

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.609 
older versions of motoblur it's much
less<00:01:16.860> intrusive<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.900> quite<00:01:18.900> deep<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
less intrusive it's quite deep but it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
less intrusive it's quite deep but it
doesn't<00:01:19.920> block<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.229> other<00:01:22.229> bits<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
doesn't block all the other bits and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.050 
doesn't block all the other bits and
pieces<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.009> phone<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:23.759> some<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pieces from the phone which some of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
pieces from the phone which some of the
old<00:01:24.180> versions<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.659> motoblur<00:01:24.960> did<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.670> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
old versions of motoblur did it's got on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.550

Jules then on flash which is virtually

Jules then on flash which is virtually
pretty<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.600> they<00:01:33.900> can<00:01:34.020> record<00:01:34.229> up<00:01:34.350> just

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
pretty good and they can record up just

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.870 
pretty good and they can record up just
720p<00:01:36.270> HD<00:01:36.659> video<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.490> also<00:01:38.549> like<00:01:38.790> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
little bit dodgy but i'll probably get

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
in the galaxy ass because I mean it's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.170
