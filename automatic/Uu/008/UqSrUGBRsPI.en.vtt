first<00:00:40.640> job<00:00:40.850> we<00:00:40.970> need<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.150> do<00:00:41.449> is<00:00:41.629> unscrew<00:00:41.809> these

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
first job we need to do is unscrew these

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.560 
first job we need to do is unscrew these
Phillips<00:00:42.620> screws<00:00:42.949> that<00:00:43.280> are<00:00:44.269> all<00:00:44.449> around

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
Phillips screws that are all around

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.869 
Phillips screws that are all around
you'll<00:00:45.440> tear<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.710> casing<00:00:46.190> to<00:00:46.309> get<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.519> top<00:00:46.699> off

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
you'll tear a casing to get the top off

00:00:46.879 --> 00:01:15.860 
you'll tear a casing to get the top off
I'll<00:00:47.780> do<00:00:47.930> that

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.030 

it<00:01:16.870> goes<00:01:17.080> without<00:01:17.200> saying<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.830> power

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
it goes without saying that the power

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040 
it goes without saying that the power
supply<00:01:21.400> isn't<00:01:21.580> plugged<00:01:21.910> in<00:01:22.180> I<00:01:22.479> don't<00:01:22.869> think

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
supply isn't plugged in I don't think

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.530 
supply isn't plugged in I don't think
you<00:01:23.140> want<00:01:23.320> any<00:01:23.700> power<00:01:24.700> going<00:01:25.000> into<00:01:25.210> anything

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
you want any power going into anything

you want any power going into anything
electrical<00:01:26.020> device<00:01:26.380> when<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:26.740> taking<00:01:27.430> it

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
electrical device when you taking it

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.260 
electrical device when you taking it
apart<00:01:28.350> okay<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.619> then<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:30.490> top<00:01:30.790> should<00:01:31.030> just

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
apart okay and then the top should just

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:43.740 
apart okay and then the top should just
my<00:01:31.450> stuff<00:01:31.720> now<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.970> there<00:01:43.149> we<00:01:43.240> have<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.539> dual

the<00:01:53.890> power<00:01:54.280> amp<00:01:54.550> tubes<00:01:56.580> look<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:59.560> here<00:01:59.770> we<00:01:59.860> have

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
the power amp tubes look so here we have

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.700 
the power amp tubes look so here we have
the<00:02:00.070> four<00:02:00.340> preamp<00:02:01.300> tubes<00:02:01.630> in<00:02:02.050> these<00:02:02.350> metal

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
the four preamp tubes in these metal

the four preamp tubes in these metal
cases<00:02:03.100> and<00:02:04.090> under<00:02:04.300> these<00:02:04.570> sort<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.869> villas

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
cases and under these sort of villas

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.750 
cases and under these sort of villas
sprung<00:02:07.570> little<00:02:08.470> holders<00:02:09.630> we<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:11.019> el84

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
sprung little holders we have the el84

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.500 
sprung little holders we have the el84
which<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.060> power<00:02:13.269> amp<00:02:13.570> tubes<00:02:15.180> okay<00:02:16.180> we're

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
which of the power amp tubes okay we're

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.479 
which of the power amp tubes okay we're
gonna<00:02:16.660> change<00:02:16.989> out<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.380> the<00:02:17.530> 12<00:02:17.769> a<00:02:17.950> X's<00:02:18.340> in

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
gonna change out one of the 12 a X's in

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.259 
gonna change out one of the 12 a X's in
the<00:02:18.580> preamp<00:02:18.940> stage<00:02:19.299> first<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.290> all<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:22.120> they're

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
the preamp stage first of all so they're

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.060 
the preamp stage first of all so they're
in<00:02:22.420> this<00:02:22.540> sort<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:22.959> case<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:25.480> push<00:02:25.750> down

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
in this sort of case that you push down

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:37.360 
in this sort of case that you push down
and<00:02:27.070> then<00:02:27.870> twist

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.420 

when<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.520> comes<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:38.970> off<00:02:39.000> later<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:40.470> then

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
when it comes right off later and then

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.370 
when it comes right off later and then
in<00:02:41.580> order<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.850> get<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.150> valve<00:02:42.390> out<00:02:42.660> itself<00:02:43.140> we

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
in order to get the valve out itself we

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.210 
in order to get the valve out itself we
need<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.680> sort<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.040> be<00:02:44.450> quite<00:02:45.450> gentle<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
need to sort of be quite gentle and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:03:03.870 
need to sort of be quite gentle and
twist<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.790> out<00:02:50.840> sort<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.020> rotating

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.110 

and<00:03:04.300> they<00:03:05.050> have<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.470> we<00:03:06.460> don't<00:03:06.670> want<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.880> do<00:03:07.000> is

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and they have it we don't want to do is

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.180 
and they have it we don't want to do is
damage<00:03:07.360> any<00:03:07.660> of<00:03:07.780> these<00:03:07.930> quite<00:03:08.260> fragile<00:03:08.590> pins

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
damage any of these quite fragile pins

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.530 
damage any of these quite fragile pins
as<00:03:09.730> they<00:03:09.940> come<00:03:10.150> out<00:03:14.490> these<00:03:15.490> preamp<00:03:16.000> valves<00:03:16.420> are

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
as they come out these preamp valves are

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.120 
as they come out these preamp valves are
still<00:03:16.780> quite<00:03:16.990> good<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.200> think<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.740> we're<00:03:17.950> gonna

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
still quite good I think so we're gonna

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.100 
still quite good I think so we're gonna
all<00:03:18.790> right<00:03:18.850> keep<00:03:19.120> it<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.330> one<00:03:19.420> side<00:03:19.660> in<00:03:19.840> case<00:03:19.990> of

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
all right keep it to one side in case of

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:29.170 
all right keep it to one side in case of
emergency

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.479 

you<00:03:29.690> know<00:03:29.750> I'm<00:03:29.870> gonna<00:03:29.989> put<00:03:30.110> this<00:03:30.379> down<00:03:30.489> you

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
you know I'm gonna put this down you

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.250 
you know I'm gonna put this down you
preempted<00:03:32.150> to<00:03:32.450> Ben<00:03:33.040> 12ax7<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:35.569> see<00:03:35.840> there

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
preempted to Ben 12ax7 you can see there

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.720 
preempted to Ben 12ax7 you can see there
is<00:03:36.409> one<00:03:37.220> bit<00:03:37.610> where<00:03:38.060> there's<00:03:38.239> no<00:03:38.390> pin<00:03:39.670> okay<00:03:40.670> so

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
is one bit where there's no pin okay so

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.140 
is one bit where there's no pin okay so
all<00:03:41.000> you<00:03:41.150> got<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.299> do<00:03:41.450> is<00:03:41.540> line<00:03:41.750> up<00:03:41.780> that<00:03:42.409> up

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
all you got to do is line up that up

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.490 
all you got to do is line up that up
with<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.330> same<00:03:44.930> gap<00:03:45.260> in<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.040> little<00:03:47.500> sockets

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
with the same gap in the little sockets

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.720
