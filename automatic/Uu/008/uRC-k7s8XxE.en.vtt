00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you look on the back of it you can see

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.850 
you look on the back of it you can see
that<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.940> really<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.080> same<00:02:07.200> shape

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.420 

this<00:02:10.860> was<00:02:11.820> my<00:02:11.970> art<00:02:12.209> final<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.070> my<00:02:14.250> lash

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
this was my art final this is my lash

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.320 
this was my art final this is my lash
curler<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.980> dirt<00:02:17.190> normally<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.910> this

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
curler so this is dirt normally and this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.080 
curler so this is dirt normally and this
right<00:02:18.600> here<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:19.530> abstraction<00:02:20.100> of<00:02:20.550> this

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
right here is the abstraction of this

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.890 
right here is the abstraction of this
droid<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.740> an<00:02:22.740> abstraction<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.850> when<00:02:24.780> you

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
droid and an abstraction is when you

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.360 
droid and an abstraction is when you
take<00:02:25.170> every<00:02:25.530> angle<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.430> original<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.360> you

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
take every angle of the original and you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.210 
take every angle of the original and you
exaggerate<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:32.900> be<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.230> here<00:02:34.560> are<00:02:34.830> called

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
exaggerate it be very here are called

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.770 
exaggerate it be very here are called
print<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:37.440> what<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.830> did<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.700> drew<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
print so what I did is I drew the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.410 
print so what I did is I drew the
picture<00:02:39.810> on<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.730> with<00:02:41.730> Sophie<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.910> then<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
picture on here with Sophie and then I

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.120 
picture on here with Sophie and then I
had<00:02:45.810> to<00:02:45.900> paint<00:02:46.110> clear<00:02:46.470> over<00:02:46.769> it

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
had to paint clear over it

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.180 
had to paint clear over it
and<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.820> had<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> cut<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:48.360> each<00:02:48.660> piece<00:02:49.190> and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
and I had to cut out each piece and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.780 
and I had to cut out each piece and
literally<00:02:51.120> press<00:02:51.510> 8<00:02:51.720> onto<00:02:52.140> here<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.459> cut<00:02:53.760> out

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
then I cut all the Greens then pink and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.100 
then I cut all the Greens then pink and
purple<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.430> if<00:03:00.239> you<00:03:00.420> can<00:03:00.600> tell<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.019> a

original and see this is this is so much
hard<00:03:14.340> work<00:03:14.519> because<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.850> have<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:15.060> carve<00:03:15.330> it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
hard work because you have to carve it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
hard work because you have to carve it
with<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:15.750> thing<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.140> shaped<00:03:16.380> like

with this thing it's shaped like
basically<00:03:16.920> digs<00:03:17.820> out<00:03:18.090> this<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.510> linoleum

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
basically digs out this is linoleum

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.500 
basically digs out this is linoleum
which<00:03:19.440> linoleum<00:03:20.070> makes<00:03:20.280> like<00:03:20.519> tile<00:03:20.940> for

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
which linoleum makes like tile for

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.840 
which linoleum makes like tile for
kitchen<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.110> bathroom<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.590> stuff<00:03:22.799> that<00:03:23.670> was

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
so hard I like to sliced myself up in

this right here was another art project
each<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.520> these<00:03:31.640> people<00:03:31.880> I<00:03:32.120> actually<00:03:32.330> drew<00:03:32.960> in

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
each of these people I actually drew in

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.060 
each of these people I actually drew in
30<00:03:33.680> seconds<00:03:34.220> weary<00:03:35.120> or<00:03:35.330> not<00:03:35.510> because<00:03:36.320> what<00:03:36.950> we

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
30 seconds weary or not because what we

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.280 
30 seconds weary or not because what we
have<00:03:37.220> to<00:03:37.370> do<00:03:37.520> is<00:03:37.790> we<00:03:38.360> look<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:38.720> a<00:03:38.750> model<00:03:39.080> and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
seconds to draw every angle of their

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.760 
seconds to draw every angle of their
party<00:03:43.360> after<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.570> we<00:03:44.900> chose<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.200> best<00:03:45.350> ones

party after that we chose the best ones
and<00:03:46.040> we<00:03:46.370> pasted<00:03:47.270> them<00:03:47.450> all<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.720> this<00:03:47.840> paper<00:03:48.050> and

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
and we pasted them all to this paper and

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.010 
and we pasted them all to this paper and
then<00:03:49.280> we<00:03:49.370> had<00:03:49.490> to<00:03:49.610> color<00:03:49.970> them<00:03:50.240> and<00:03:50.450> everyone

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.550 
with oil paint so you can only imagine
how<00:05:10.610> long<00:05:10.880> that<00:05:11.180> took<00:05:11.480> I've<00:05:12.020> a<00:05:12.080> few<00:05:12.350> pictures

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.440 
how long that took I've a few pictures
of<00:05:12.710> me<00:05:12.920> actually<00:05:13.100> painting<00:05:13.850> it<00:05:14.030> while<00:05:14.210> it's<00:05:14.390> in

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
of me actually painting it while it's in

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.280 
of me actually painting it while it's in
the<00:05:14.570> process<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.290> I'll<00:05:15.410> put<00:05:15.590> those<00:05:15.740> up<00:05:16.010> but

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
the process so I'll put those up but

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.459 
the process so I'll put those up but
yeah<00:05:18.290> this<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.530> my<00:05:18.740> favorite

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:27.469 

so<00:05:25.979> this<00:05:26.129> is<00:05:26.279> the<00:05:26.369> drawing<00:05:26.580> I<00:05:26.789> did<00:05:26.969> of<00:05:27.029> my<00:05:27.179> own

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
so this is the drawing I did of my own

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:32.239 
so this is the drawing I did of my own
hand<00:05:27.919> kind<00:05:28.919> of<00:05:29.009> like<00:05:29.219> this<00:05:30.179> you<00:05:30.949> could<00:05:31.949> see

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:32.249 
hand kind of like this you could see

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.399 
hand kind of like this you could see
that<00:05:32.459> the<00:05:33.029> weird<00:05:33.269> shape<00:05:33.569> but<00:05:33.839> we<00:05:33.929> have<00:05:34.110> to<00:05:34.229> make

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
that the weird shape but we have to make

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.629 
that the weird shape but we have to make
it<00:05:34.529> as<00:05:34.649> complicated<00:05:35.550> as<00:05:35.909> possible<00:05:36.589> so<00:05:37.589> that<00:05:38.009> I

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
it as complicated as possible so that I

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.229 
it as complicated as possible so that I
didn't<00:05:39.089> art<00:05:39.300> and<00:05:39.509> then<00:05:39.989> show<00:05:40.199> me<00:05:40.259> use

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.239 
didn't art and then show me use

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:43.759 
didn't art and then show me use
crosshatch<00:05:42.239> and<00:05:42.539> hatch<00:05:42.689> techniques<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:43.739> I

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:43.769 
crosshatch and hatch techniques so I

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:46.309 
crosshatch and hatch techniques so I
couldn't<00:05:44.249> blend<00:05:44.519> it<00:05:44.639> at<00:05:44.789> all<00:05:45.059> I<00:05:45.239> used<00:05:45.989> purely

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
couldn't blend it at all I used purely

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:52.179 
couldn't blend it at all I used purely
pencil<00:05:46.800> no<00:05:47.580> blending<00:05:49.249> this<00:05:50.249> right<00:05:50.699> here<00:05:51.029> I

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:52.189 
pencil no blending this right here I

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:55.790 
pencil no blending this right here I
painted<00:05:53.189> for<00:05:53.580> fun<00:05:54.300> I<00:05:54.509> did<00:05:55.319> this<00:05:55.409> with<00:05:55.559> oil

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
painted for fun I did this with oil

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.009 
painted for fun I did this with oil
paints<00:05:56.159> also<00:05:56.399> and<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:57.360> looks<00:05:57.509> better<00:05:57.689> if<00:05:57.839> you

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:58.019 
paints also and it looks better if you

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.319 
paints also and it looks better if you
look<00:05:58.199> at<00:05:58.319> it<00:05:58.409> from<00:05:58.469> far<00:05:58.739> away<00:05:58.829> but<00:05:59.789> up<00:06:00.089> close

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:00.329 
look at it from far away but up close
