00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.120 

guys<00:00:06.029> fellow<00:00:06.509> here<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:06.990> I'm<00:00:07.500> sure<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> lot<00:00:07.980> of

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
guys fellow here and I'm sure a lot of

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.480 
guys fellow here and I'm sure a lot of
you<00:00:08.340> know<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.880> design<00:00:09.269> pretty<00:00:09.719> well<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:11.190> is

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
you know this design pretty well this is

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.099 
you know this design pretty well this is
seemly<00:00:12.120> minecraft<00:00:12.719> double<00:00:13.290> piston<00:00:13.469> extender

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
seemly minecraft double piston extender

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.090 
seemly minecraft double piston extender
just<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.350> that<00:00:17.630> but<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.260> only<00:00:19.470> downside

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
just like that but the only downside

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.090 
just like that but the only downside
about<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.900> does<00:00:22.320> not<00:00:22.380> receive

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
about this is that it does not receive

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.429 
about this is that it does not receive
an<00:00:23.220> input<00:00:23.550> or<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.180> cannot<00:00:24.539> receive<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.109> input

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
an input or it cannot receive an input

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.790 
an input or it cannot receive an input
from<00:00:25.769> behind<00:00:26.330> which<00:00:27.330> makes<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.900> quite

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
from behind which makes it quite

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:36.229 
from behind which makes it quite
difficult<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.789> use<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.619> multiple<00:00:33.559> projects<00:00:35.239> so

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
difficult to use in multiple projects so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:57.290 
difficult to use in multiple projects so
I<00:00:36.600> came<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:38.030> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.340 

yeah<00:00:58.300> so<00:00:58.870> this<00:00:59.559> double<00:00:59.980> piston<00:01:00.159> extender<00:01:00.429> is

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
yeah so this double piston extender is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.859 
yeah so this double piston extender is
infinitely<00:01:02.350> pliable<00:01:02.890> upwards<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.449> can<00:01:04.750> be

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
infinitely pliable upwards it can be

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.800 
infinitely pliable upwards it can be
input<00:01:05.080> from<00:01:05.560> both<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.850> back<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:09.040> front

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
input from both the back and the front

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.260 
input from both the back and the front
which<00:01:10.810> is<00:01:11.200> a<00:01:11.619> big<00:01:12.549> plus<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:15.280> big<00:01:15.520> projects

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
which is a big plus in like big projects

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.499 
which is a big plus in like big projects
as<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.509> said<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:18.100> also<00:01:18.340> extremely<00:01:18.850> compact

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
as I said it's also extremely compact

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.429 
as I said it's also extremely compact
it's<00:01:19.869> 4<00:01:20.200> x<00:01:20.470> 4<00:01:20.830> x<00:01:20.860> 2<00:01:21.130> y<00:01:21.670> or<00:01:22.149> however<00:01:22.929> high<00:01:23.380> you

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
it's 4 x 4 x 2 y or however high you

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.399 
it's 4 x 4 x 2 y or however high you
make<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.090> let's<00:01:25.600> crack<00:01:25.899> on<00:01:26.049> with<00:01:26.110> this

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
make it so let's crack on with this

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.320 
make it so let's crack on with this
tutorial<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.520> what<00:01:27.909> I'm<00:01:28.000> going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.149> do

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
tutorial and what I'm going to do

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.960 
tutorial and what I'm going to do
actually<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.899> build<00:01:29.770> one<00:01:30.009> right<00:01:30.310> on<00:01:30.520> top<00:01:30.789> of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
actually is build one right on top of

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.510 
actually is build one right on top of
this<00:01:31.119> one<00:01:31.440> so<00:01:32.440> first<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:32.830> get<00:01:32.979> your<00:01:33.159> sticky

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
this one so first you get your sticky

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.080 
this one so first you get your sticky
pistons<00:01:34.030> like<00:01:34.299> that<00:01:35.340> grab<00:01:36.340> some<00:01:36.549> half<00:01:36.729> slabs

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
pistons like that grab some half slabs

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.380 
pistons like that grab some half slabs
place<00:01:37.539> them<00:01:38.009> off<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.250> block<00:01:39.490> up<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:41.380> that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
place them off the block up like that

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.090 
place them off the block up like that
redstone<00:01:43.390> all<00:01:44.020> over<00:01:44.679> there<00:01:45.450> then<00:01:46.450> your<00:01:47.100> two

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
redstone all over there then your two

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.730 
redstone all over there then your two
inputs<00:01:48.970> or<00:01:50.250> via<00:01:51.250> your<00:01:51.640> input<00:01:52.289> so<00:01:53.289> like<00:01:53.440> that

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
inputs or via your input so like that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.620 
inputs or via your input so like that
that's<00:01:54.220> actually<00:01:54.789> not<00:01:55.030> going<00:01:55.179> to<00:01:55.299> do<00:01:55.390> anything

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
that's actually not going to do anything

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.039 
that's actually not going to do anything
right<00:01:55.929> now<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.700> building<00:01:57.700> block<00:01:58.030> on<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.450> side

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
right now a building block on the side

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.609 
right now a building block on the side
there<00:02:00.569> repeater<00:02:01.569> on<00:02:01.629> toothpicks<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
there repeater on toothpicks the

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.150 
there repeater on toothpicks the
building<00:02:03.009> block<00:02:03.250> goes<00:02:03.670> up<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.619> over<00:02:05.619> like

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
building block goes up and over like

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.680 
building block goes up and over like
this<00:02:07.259> rats<00:02:08.259> down<00:02:08.470> there<00:02:09.119> repeater<00:02:10.119> on<00:02:10.360> one

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
this rats down there repeater on one

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.740 
this rats down there repeater on one
thick<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:12.040> building<00:02:12.370> bottles<00:02:12.819> up<00:02:12.970> building

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
thick the building bottles up building

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
thick the building bottles up building
what<00:02:13.959> goes<00:02:14.140> over<00:02:14.680> with<00:02:15.069> a<00:02:15.280> repeater<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.819> top<00:02:16.150> as

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
what goes over with a repeater on top as

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.170 
what goes over with a repeater on top as
well<00:02:16.540> default<00:02:17.110> amount<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.440> ticks<00:02:17.730> then<00:02:18.730> you're

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
well default amount of ticks then you're

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.630 
well default amount of ticks then you're
upside<00:02:19.989> down<00:02:20.200> half<00:02:20.470> slab<00:02:20.800> right<00:02:21.040> there<00:02:21.310> again

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
upside down half slab right there again

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.890 
upside down half slab right there again
with<00:02:22.000> redstone<00:02:22.420> dust

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
with redstone dust

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.520 
with redstone dust
then<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:25.010> place<00:02:25.340> your<00:02:26.110> piston<00:02:27.110> moveable

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
then you place your piston moveable

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.630 
then you place your piston moveable
blocks<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.900> should<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.439> so<00:02:31.220> for

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
blocks and that should be it so for

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.000 
blocks and that should be it so for
those<00:02:32.000> you<00:02:32.329> remember<00:02:32.720> I<00:02:33.200> did<00:02:33.590> upload

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
those you remember I did upload

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.050 
those you remember I did upload
something<00:02:34.549> of<00:02:35.379> these<00:02:36.379> sorts<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.220> my<00:02:37.579> channel<00:02:37.909> a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
something of these sorts on my channel a

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.020 
something of these sorts on my channel a
while<00:02:38.239> ago<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:39.950> is<00:02:40.069> broken<00:02:40.609> now<00:02:40.790> we'd

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
while ago but that is broken now we'd

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.089 
while ago but that is broken now we'd
use<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.450> redstone<00:02:41.870> block<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.409> gold<00:02:42.739> weird

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
use the redstone block and gold weird

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.589 
use the redstone block and gold weird
mechanics<00:02:44.620> but<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:45.829> one<00:02:46.040> doesn't<00:02:46.280> anymore

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
mechanics but this one doesn't anymore

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.899 
mechanics but this one doesn't anymore
so<00:02:47.599> yeah<00:02:48.230> that's<00:02:48.620> basically<00:02:48.859> it<00:02:49.189> thanks<00:02:49.790> for

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:49.909 
so yeah that's basically it thanks for

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.239 
so yeah that's basically it thanks for
watching
