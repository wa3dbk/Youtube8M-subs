 two files 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.620
 and then they go to the gta game directory 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.620
 San Andreas 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.040
 and they paste the files inside of their 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.040
 respective folder I think 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.180
 and return to the previous window 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.130
 and they send this folder to the desktop 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.420
 Once this is done open the program 'the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.420
 fishing editor 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.470
 they click on the blue folder they are 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.600
 will open a window and look for the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.070
 they click on open 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.370
 and then a list will start loading 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.370
 of files 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.310
 and then click on the green arrow 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.989

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.620
 they look for the folder they sent to 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.620
 desk 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.410
 they open it and select all the 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.110
 files after they click on open and 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.310
 to finish with the installation 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.330
 they simply click on the blue disc 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.330
 to save the changes 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.019
 remember that it is not necessary to make a 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.090
 backup because the mod brings the 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.090
 original files in the backup folder 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.970
 below a video of moore 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.170
 hello friends as I mentioned 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.240
 previously this mode will give your game 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.100
 gta san andreas more realistic then 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.170
 will allow to dismember a person 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 using the chainsaw plus its 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.790
 excellent effect and animations run 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.790
 there comes Jayson who does not 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.620
 they looked at the parts of the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.629
 people to dismember a person 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.060
 just keep pressing the 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.739
 key to shoot in addition this mode 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.840
 corrects the chainsaw saws 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.269
 because it adds movement by means of 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.400
 commands that revolve around him 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.129
