00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello help present how to sort 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.010
 or rename his pictures where all your 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.420
 windows xp files then your 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.179
 images usually they are no 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.109
 start but image if you have not them 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:20.520
 because you do not have the repertoire 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:24.920
 my pictures in my documents you 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.470
 find the directory my pictures here 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 so here we have pictures 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.700
 mixes so you know that we are 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.730
 different display modes that we 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 already allow to have an idea so the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.899
 filmstrip mode that will show us a 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
 preview of the selected image 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 and then all the pictures down the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.660
 miniature that is very convenient 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 and then after all a series that are 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.879
 more technical that goes up to detail or 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.350
 there you have the information of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:03.000
 dimensions etc so that's where we 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.729
 finds that the images are sorted according to 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.260
 an order and order that is so at 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.750
 the order or what is the order have 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.450
 there here so in display you go 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 rearrange icons by dimension 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.770
 so here for now show us by 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:22.979
 default dimension the sort is by 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.080
 no and display made by our men 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.200
 we're going to go online is to have a 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.390
 idea here is here so see here a 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.720
 friend by no and you have the s all in at 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.900
 the display edition organized by non hop 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.600
 there we put it in the reverse order 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 see it's not bad it's enough 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.610
 practice used in literacy 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.549
 you can also use another 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:58.409
 given which size he has changed 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:02:00.149
 yet another type then by 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.950
 example the type it can be used for what 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.960
 in the photos often every 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.010
 pictures are in jpeg so eventually you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 will 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.200
 all the followed photos that are going to get 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.240
 follow but that's not the case for all 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340
 files 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:22.140
 so if we take for example in my 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 photos open here we realize 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.740
 we have files that are in jpeg 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.720
 but we also have files that 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:35.130
 are in f 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:38.340
 so if we post them by non- luminous 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.890
 all following each other in 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.180
 mixing jpeg 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.560
 so here is nef nef jpeg nef jpeg 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:55.950
 nave good so there we do nothing organized 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:59.250
 by type and there we find all our 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.040
 jpeg jpeg jpeg jpeg and then there 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 start the naves see it can be 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.900
 practical for 8 to go precisely 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.959
 quietly view a few 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:16.730
 pictures hop with a little preview here 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.989
 so that's pretty cool as a method 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.470
 you can also when you have 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 information would not put in 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.860
 information modify the photo taken on 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.420
 11 or so the dimension when 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.519
 uses the most is the name the size 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.959
 and the type 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:36.570
 so here we saw how to sort images 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.459
 then to change them then 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.130
 edit attention I'm talking about the name 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.150
 fame so here we have an image 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.910
 is called the lot so we'll click a 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.640
 sure the picture that the seleccion then a 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.110
 second hit the name so that's it 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.530
 lolo jpeg point 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:03.989
 so I will call it river points 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.130
 jpg then j pg it's the extension know 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.930
 it's jpeg 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.690
 it is not displayed by default 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.120
 function that I activated months to have 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.329
 this information but by default you 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.709
 do not have it so by default you can 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.109
 click on it 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.940
 a second one and there you put 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.789
 directly the name like me I 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:26.310
 asked to have these extensions posted 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:33.569
 I have to put them in 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:35.370
 I forget see he tells me attention you 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:36.259
 have fetched the extension the file will be 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.319
 illegible 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:42.620
 so you have to add the jpeg 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:45.960
 so we recapitulate one last time 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.490
 to rename an image or anything 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.460
 which file you click on it 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.479
 you click a second shot on the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.479
 file you select what you 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.240
 want to change where you take everything and 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.870
 you type directly what you 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:05.270
 want and clicking next is 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.810
 fame try this asset 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.810
 I thank you
