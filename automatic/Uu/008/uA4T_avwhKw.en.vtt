dungeon and work great so I was hoping

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.560 
dungeon and work great so I was hoping
that<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.350> gets<00:00:37.500> same<00:00:37.680> results<00:00:38.040> here

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570

meteor<00:01:02.489> attack<00:01:02.780> instead<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.899> having<00:01:04.049> simply

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
meteor attack instead of having simply

the tanks that eat it though you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.050 
the tanks that eat it though you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
actually have the whole raid eat it so

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually have the whole raid eat it so
what<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.270> do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.630> split<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.990> right<00:01:10.140> into

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
what you do is you split the right into

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.469 
what you do is you split the right into
parts<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.729> one<00:01:11.850> port<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:12.299> side

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
parts and you have one port on one side

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.149 
parts and you have one port on one side
one<00:01:12.630> part<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> other<00:01:13.049> side<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.890> because

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
one part on the other side it's because

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.410 
one part on the other side it's because
of<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.400> debug<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.939> can't<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.240> stack<00:01:15.390> them

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of that debug you can't just stack them

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.789 
of that debug you can't just stack them
all<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.780> groups<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.470> debuff

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
all in one groups because of that debuff

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
all in one groups because of that debuff
before<00:01:17.130> she<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.369> put<00:01:17.520> them<00:01:17.610> into<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:18.030> mean

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
before she just put them into I mean

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.210 
before she just put them into I mean
that's<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.439> Netflix<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> hold

lottery<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.330> just<00:02:37.080> think<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.350> dumb<00:02:37.680> I<00:02:37.890> think

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
lottery I just think that's dumb I think

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.620 
lottery I just think that's dumb I think
it's<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.370> dumb<00:02:38.490> idea<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:39.030> don't<00:02:39.239> like<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.450> at<00:02:39.540> all

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.540 
so I think that they should go back and
fix<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.720> anyway<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.190> guy<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.459> just

time<00:03:11.640> i<00:03:11.700> was<00:03:11.790> using<00:03:12.030> penance<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.540> flash<00:03:13.049> heal

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
time i was using penance and flash heal

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.590 
time i was using penance and flash heal
and<00:03:13.650> an<00:03:14.040> powered<00:03:14.430> shield<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.730> lot<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.450> didn't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
and an powered shield a lot so I didn't

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.940 
and an powered shield a lot so I didn't
do<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.840> damage<00:03:15.959> prevention<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.650> I<00:03:16.680> guess<00:03:16.860> I

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
do some damage prevention so I guess I

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.000 
do some damage prevention so I guess I
did<00:03:17.100> something<00:03:17.400> but<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:19.590> bulk<00:03:19.830> of<00:03:19.980> my

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
did something but the the bulk of my

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.090 
did something but the the bulk of my
mana<00:03:20.280> was<00:03:20.489> wasted<00:03:20.880> on<00:03:20.910> smite

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
mana was wasted on smite

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.150 
mana was wasted on smite
tolman<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.060> just<00:03:23.270> doesn't<00:03:23.540> perform<00:03:23.690> at<00:03:23.930> all<00:03:24.160> so

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
tolman it just doesn't perform at all so

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.740 
tolman it just doesn't perform at all so
he's<00:03:25.280> about<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.520> go<00:03:25.610> down<00:03:25.790> people<00:03:26.540> start

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
he's about to go down people start

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.380 
he's about to go down people start
dropping<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.820> when<00:03:28.820> he<00:03:28.880> gets<00:03:29.030> really<00:03:29.150> low

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
dropping and when he gets really low

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.520 
dropping and when he gets really low
it's<00:03:29.600> not<00:03:29.720> because<00:03:29.960> he<00:03:30.020> gets<00:03:30.170> harder<00:03:30.410> it's

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
it's not because he gets harder it's

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.380 
it's not because he gets harder it's
just<00:03:30.650> because<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.130> poor<00:03:31.520> shaman<00:03:32.090> who<00:03:32.210> was
