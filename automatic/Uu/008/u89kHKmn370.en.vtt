00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:39.300
 I do not enjoy seeing us cold 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 that makes it a bit playful 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.340
 making someone videos alone is complete 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.379
 not a good idea you never will 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.120

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 By the way, he really right to say 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.070
 I've been packed and are 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.360
 18 the perfect age or I have 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.590
 Immediately you do not feel so bad on the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.789
 eighteenth birthday one but not 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.380
 have to be able to make enough of everything 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.729
 We still have all the opportunities to be able to 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.890
 and besides, I'm sure of that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 now every day still helping party and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.399
 august is unlikely most 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.970
 18-year-olds argue with me 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.380
 bit different 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 since windows are drivers I have always 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.560
 full need my time so useful 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.030
 as possible to use and above all 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.200
 the positive effect on my future 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.490
 to have granted each one you 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.960

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.550
 Your young has enjoy and drink one 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.200
 I really have what I mean 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.520
 it's fun at the moment but ultimately 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.420
 satisfied nothing at all 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.610
 not at all 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.259
 Satisfaction witty man already stood 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.520
 For example, I understand what 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.869

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.179
 from hallplatz always I am not a nerd 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.590
 okay the only thing I mean then 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.520
 would use time effectively as possible 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.870
 to come closer to my dreams 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.730
 I am firmly convinced that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.020
 every person can achieve everything he does 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.610
 if you just want to stick to it 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.380
 do you think everything is fictional? 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.730
 I had with you was going certainly 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 also be successful or for it 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.800
 You do not have to become a human being 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.920
 as they spit I discuss 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.200

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 percent of humanity from the success from 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.709
 keeps things different in the morning 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.200

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.600

 But you are not serious anymore 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.280
