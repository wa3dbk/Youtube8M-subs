00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:04.880
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.570
 new video apple just got on the 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.730
 cinema the double double dc 2015 watches 2 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.959
 presented and what the features are 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.000
 You are now experiencing a bigger one 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:19.580
 feature in my opinion are the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.070
 We have new dials 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.410
 now several new dial types 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.730
 and we have timelapse recordings of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.089
 different cities we have now 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.669
 here for example Hong Kong London 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.350
 Shanghai and New York and the runners 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.110
 they adapt to the current 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.610
 24 hours a day and you 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.329
 always have that one initial 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:46.789
 current picture on your watch as well 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.739
 can you still adjust photos so 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.149
 private photos on her watch 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.160
 you have pulled that either you can 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.199
 set that it just fancy or 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.469
 you can watch every time you watch 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.289
 has launched wrist lifts that is one 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.170
 other picture shows as we here and 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.820
 still see 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.380
 another new feature is that one 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.299
 Now use the apple as an alarm clock 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.549
 as you can see on the picture 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.500
 Just put it on the side 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.409
 then the power on and the top two 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 keys so the digital crown serves as 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.610
 news button and the other button i know 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.100
 Not at all like the right name for it 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.320
 is just serves as a baker 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.750
 turn off that in my opinion 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.329
 Best or biggest feature on Roger S2 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.670
 is that there are now native apps 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.930
 on the watch app that minimizes 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.840
 not only the delay and the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.850
 performance of apps but also offers 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.310
 developers to program their own apps 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.140
 For example, here below you can 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.479
 When you play golf you can beat it 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:49.000
 speed can be measured by the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.000
 accelerometer in the apple watch 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.299
 smaller innovations are also still 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.759
 that they answer now on e-mails 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.829
 You can do this with siri 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.229
 as mentioned in the last video 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:01.640
 Apple Maps now also offers the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.960
 public transport 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.719
 You can do that now on the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.640
 adwords has ads as well 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.750
 also received a little update 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.830
 and can now go to more 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.830

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.160
 All new features were released 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.630
 waters in the autumn is likely 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.000
