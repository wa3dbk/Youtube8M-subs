the project that we're doing here at CJ
is

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
is

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.779 
is
filling<00:00:36.609> in<00:00:36.760> some<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.179> the<00:00:37.269> characters<00:00:37.989> and

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
filling in some of the characters and

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:43.350 
filling in some of the characters and
fashions<00:00:39.789> from<00:00:40.000> above<00:00:40.390> and<00:00:41.260> I'm<00:00:41.530> working<00:00:41.739> on

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
fashions from above and I'm working on

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.180 
fashions from above and I'm working on
a<00:00:43.420> mermaid

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
a mermaid

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.370 
a mermaid
so<00:00:45.670> I<00:00:45.700> got<00:00:46.270> a<00:00:46.300> few<00:00:46.510> other<00:00:46.570> patterns<00:00:47.079> already

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
so I got a few other patterns already

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.550 
so I got a few other patterns already
filled<00:00:47.590> in<00:00:47.770> you<00:00:47.950> can<00:00:48.100> see<00:00:48.280> how<00:00:48.880> she<00:00:48.940> is<00:00:49.560> open

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
filled in you can see how she is open

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.310 
filled in you can see how she is open
and<00:00:50.770> lots<00:00:51.310> of<00:00:51.400> areas<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.910> work<00:00:52.030> on<00:00:52.239> and<00:00:53.230> I'm

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
and lots of areas to work on and I'm

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.310 
and lots of areas to work on and I'm
going<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.470> work<00:00:53.620> on<00:00:53.770> one<00:00:53.980> called<00:00:54.430> printf<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320 
going to work on one called printf and

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.070 
going to work on one called printf and
it<00:00:56.530> starts<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.970> just<00:00:58.180> basically<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:58.629> swirl

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
it starts it's just basically a swirl

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.369 
it starts it's just basically a swirl
but<00:00:59.590> it<00:00:59.680> has<00:00:59.830> a<00:00:59.860> little<00:01:00.190> skip<00:01:00.580> in<00:01:00.790> it<00:01:00.940> that

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but it has a little skip in it that

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.219 
but it has a little skip in it that
makes<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.500> form<00:01:02.769> like<00:01:02.920> a<00:01:02.949> little<00:01:03.190> highlight<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
makes it form like a little highlight so

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.750 
makes it form like a little highlight so
I<00:01:05.290> start<00:01:05.560> out<00:01:05.680> with<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:06.100> little<00:01:06.220> C<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:06.640> the

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
I start out with a little C in the

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.570 
I start out with a little C in the
middle<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.390> then<00:01:07.510> I<00:01:07.600> jumped<00:01:07.990> with<00:01:08.110> my<00:01:08.260> pen<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
middle and then I jumped with my pen and

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.760 
middle and then I jumped with my pen and
I<00:01:09.729> continue<00:01:10.150> around<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:11.020> same<00:01:11.229> spot<00:01:11.530> I

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
I continue around in the same spot I

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.580 
I continue around in the same spot I
jump<00:01:12.009> again<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.360> then<00:01:13.509> continue<00:01:13.869> around<00:01:13.900> and

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
jump again and then continue around and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.240 
jump again and then continue around and
the<00:01:14.740> last<00:01:14.920> time<00:01:15.220> I<00:01:15.490> got

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the last time I got

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.090 
the last time I got
and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.060> keep<00:01:18.180> filling<00:01:18.510> in<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:19.440> swirls

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
and I just keep filling in little swirls

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.910 
and I just keep filling in little swirls
like<00:01:20.280> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.380 

and<00:01:23.100> then<00:01:23.310> when<00:01:23.550> I<00:01:23.580> start<00:01:23.940> to<00:01:24.060> run<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and then when I start to run out of

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.580 
and then when I start to run out of
space<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:24.930> they're<00:01:25.020> starting<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.350> bump

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
space where they're starting to bump

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.040 
space where they're starting to bump
together<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.490> next<00:01:26.760> bunch<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> swirls<00:01:27.600> will

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
together the next bunch of swirls will

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.590 
together the next bunch of swirls will
have<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:28.590> skip<00:01:28.830> in<00:01:28.979> them

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.880 

when<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> bump<00:01:33.930> into<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.500> those<00:01:34.590> swirls

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
when I bump into one of those swirls

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.999 
when I bump into one of those swirls
that<00:01:35.159> Barbie<00:01:35.430> done<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.420> jump<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:37.009> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that Barbie done I just jump over it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.440 
that Barbie done I just jump over it
gets<00:01:38.220> anyone

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.660 

so<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.049> ends<00:01:42.259> up<00:01:42.350> looking<00:01:42.530> like<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.100> swirl<00:01:43.460> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
so it ends up looking like that swirl is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.090 
so it ends up looking like that swirl is
behind<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:44.509> swirls<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:44.930> are<00:01:44.990> already<00:01:45.080> there

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.569 

the<00:01:48.490> show

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
the show

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:59.039 
the show
quickly<00:01:50.299> fill<00:01:51.170> in<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.380> bunch<00:01:51.560> more

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.080 

you<00:01:59.380> can<00:01:59.560> also<00:01:59.680> do<00:02:00.039> some<00:02:00.310> little<00:02:00.430> swirls<00:02:00.820> but

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
you can also do some little swirls but

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.389 
you can also do some little swirls but
you<00:02:01.210> get<00:02:01.810> into<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.289> spaces<00:02:02.829> they<00:02:03.070> don't<00:02:03.219> all

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
you get into the spaces they don't all

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:14.220 
you get into the spaces they don't all
have<00:02:03.429> to<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:03.820> high

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.140 

that's<00:02:14.530> pretty<00:02:14.770> good<00:02:14.950> and

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
that's pretty good and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.100 
that's pretty good and
do<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> little<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.750> of<00:02:17.780> color

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
do a little bit of color

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.910 
do a little bit of color
we're<00:02:20.500> using<00:02:20.770> what

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
we're using what

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.470 
we're using what
smarter

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
smarter

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.119 
smarter
it<00:02:24.989> was<00:02:25.110> pretty<00:02:25.349> much<00:02:25.500> anything<00:02:25.709> that<00:02:25.860> you

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
it was pretty much anything that you

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.140 
it was pretty much anything that you
feel<00:02:26.670> comfortable<00:02:26.959> working<00:02:27.959> with

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
feel comfortable working with

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:39.390 
feel comfortable working with
I<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:30.230> for<00:02:30.440> these

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.800 

when<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:39.940> are<00:02:40.239> Christmas

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
when you are Christmas

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.900 
when you are Christmas
these<00:02:43.260> markers<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.739> finer<00:02:44.310> point<00:02:44.610> that's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
these markers have a finer point that's

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:55.699 
these markers have a finer point that's
easy<00:02:45.390> to<00:02:45.510> color<00:02:45.750> in

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.140 

guys<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.220> lot<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.489> trouble<00:02:56.700> of<00:02:56.760> deciding

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
guys have a lot of trouble of deciding

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.119 
guys have a lot of trouble of deciding
what<00:02:57.269> colors<00:02:57.599> to<00:02:57.629> use<00:02:57.959> which<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.290> probably<00:02:58.950> why

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
what colors to use which is probably why

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.710 
what colors to use which is probably why
I<00:02:59.189> really<00:02:59.579> love<00:02:59.790> zentangle<00:03:00.360> because<00:03:00.599> it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
I really love zentangle because it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.330 
I really love zentangle because it's
mostly<00:03:00.989> black<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.409> white<00:03:01.709> so<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.069> don't<00:03:02.250> have

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
mostly black and white so I don't have

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.520 
mostly black and white so I don't have
to<00:03:02.459> think<00:03:02.579> about<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:03.030> but<00:03:03.959> because<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.379> is

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
to think about it but because this is

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.110 
to think about it but because this is
the<00:03:04.620> coloring<00:03:04.980> book<00:03:05.159> we<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.610> color<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.030> in

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
the coloring book we have to color it in

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:31.720 
the coloring book we have to color it in
it<00:03:06.329> makes<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.659> a<00:03:06.720> lot<00:03:06.810> more<00:03:06.989> fun

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.220 

the<00:03:32.209> other<00:03:32.390> thing<00:03:32.569> that<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.720> really<00:03:32.810> love<00:03:33.200> about

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
the other thing that I really love about

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.320 
the other thing that I really love about
sent<00:03:33.739> in<00:03:33.950> go<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:35.209> probably<00:03:35.810> kind<00:03:36.050> of<00:03:36.080> obvious

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
sent in go is probably kind of obvious

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.220 
sent in go is probably kind of obvious
the<00:03:37.720> video<00:03:37.960> here<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:40.210> hides<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.750> lot<00:03:40.780> of<00:03:40.930> your

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
the video here is it hides a lot of your

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.110 
the video here is it hides a lot of your
give<00:03:41.740> me<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.040> shakes<00:03:42.370> when<00:03:42.700> you're<00:03:42.880> drilling

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
give me and shakes when you're drilling

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.670 
give me and shakes when you're drilling
which<00:03:43.780> mine<00:03:44.020> does<00:03:44.230> because<00:03:44.710> I<00:03:44.950> get<00:03:45.250> nervous

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.199 

it<00:03:47.859> just<00:03:48.040> blends<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:48.609> by<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.849> time<00:03:49.060> you're

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
it just blends in by the time you're

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.550 
it just blends in by the time you're
done<00:03:49.239> with<00:03:49.390> your<00:03:49.599> drawing<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:50.079> want<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.409> see

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
done with your drawing you want to see

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.539 
done with your drawing you want to see
all<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.859> little<00:03:50.950> shapes<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:56.489> steal<00:03:57.489> a

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
all the little shapes and and steal a

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.309 
all the little shapes and and steal a
little<00:03:57.640> bit<00:03:57.819> of<00:03:57.969> the<00:03:58.209> ink<00:03:58.480> pens<00:03:58.780> pencils<00:03:59.019> these

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
little bit of the ink pens pencils these

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.110 
little bit of the ink pens pencils these
are<00:03:59.500> really<00:03:59.769> really<00:03:59.950> fun<00:04:02.579> new<00:04:03.579> car<00:04:03.790> buffs<00:04:04.000> I

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
are really really fun new car buffs I

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.730 
are really really fun new car buffs I
love<00:04:04.299> purple

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.700 

so<00:04:07.250> these<00:04:07.400> pencils<00:04:07.910> are<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.720> lot<00:04:08.960> like<00:04:09.140> regular

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
so these pencils are a lot like regular

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.350 
so these pencils are a lot like regular
watercolor<00:04:09.980> pencils<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:10.970> can<00:04:11.120> use<00:04:11.210> them

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
watercolor pencils and you can use them

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.780 
watercolor pencils and you can use them
just<00:04:11.480> as<00:04:11.810> regular<00:04:12.170> colored<00:04:12.680> pencils<00:04:13.160> colored

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 
just as regular colored pencils colored

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.030 
just as regular colored pencils colored
areas<00:04:14.330> but<00:04:15.140> what's<00:04:15.320> really<00:04:15.440> amazing<00:04:15.740> about

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
areas but what's really amazing about

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.040 
areas but what's really amazing about
them<00:04:16.370> is<00:04:16.490> that<00:04:16.580> when<00:04:16.730> you<00:04:16.820> wet<00:04:17.030> them<00:04:17.300> the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.050 
them is that when you wet them the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.479 
them is that when you wet them the
colors<00:04:18.380> get<00:04:18.590> super<00:04:19.220> great

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.070 

and<00:04:21.609> it<00:04:21.729> also<00:04:22.000> makes<00:04:22.240> it<00:04:22.330> easy<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.600> blend<00:04:22.930> them

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
and it also makes it easy to blend them

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:33.659 
and it also makes it easy to blend them
together

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.679 

and<00:04:34.120> if<00:04:34.479> you<00:04:34.629> press<00:04:34.840> harder<00:04:35.349> you<00:04:36.310> get<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> much

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
and if you press harder you get a much

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.059 
and if you press harder you get a much
obviously<00:04:37.689> a<00:04:37.749> much<00:04:37.900> darker<00:04:38.169> color<00:04:38.710> there<00:04:38.919> but

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
obviously a much darker color there but

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.429 
obviously a much darker color there but
also<00:04:39.219> when<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.550> wet<00:04:39.789> them<00:04:40.030> it'll<00:04:40.659> be<00:04:40.840> super

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
also when you wet them it'll be super

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:46.549 
also when you wet them it'll be super
intense

00:04:46.549 --> 00:04:46.559 

00:04:46.559 --> 00:04:48.559 

so<00:04:46.649> this<00:04:46.799> is<00:04:46.949> using<00:04:47.609> a<00:04:47.789> water<00:04:47.969> brush<00:04:48.179> here<00:04:48.449> it

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
so this is using a water brush here it

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.029 
so this is using a water brush here it
just<00:04:48.719> has<00:04:48.869> the<00:04:49.019> water<00:04:49.199> in<00:04:49.379> the<00:04:49.469> handle<00:04:49.889> which

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
just has the water in the handle which

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:51.169 
just has the water in the handle which
is<00:04:50.189> really<00:04:50.459> nice<00:04:50.549> because<00:04:50.609> then<00:04:50.939> you<00:04:51.029> don't

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:51.179 
is really nice because then you don't

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:52.699 
is really nice because then you don't
end<00:04:51.299> up<00:04:51.389> with<00:04:51.449> cups<00:04:51.809> of<00:04:51.989> dirty<00:04:52.169> water<00:04:52.409> that<00:04:52.499> you

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:52.709 
end up with cups of dirty water that you

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.970 
end up with cups of dirty water that you
can<00:04:52.859> knock<00:04:52.979> over

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.659 

like<00:04:56.550> magic<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:57.540> courgettes<00:04:57.960> super<00:04:58.590> great

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
like magic the courgettes super great

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.129 
like magic the courgettes super great
and<00:05:00.879> then<00:05:01.000> here<00:05:01.270> with<00:05:01.419> this<00:05:01.509> blue

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.929 

I<00:05:04.199> think<00:05:04.800> that's<00:05:04.919> magic<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:08.520> lawyers<00:05:08.669> can

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:08.939 
I think that's magic like lawyers can

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.860 
I think that's magic like lawyers can
just<00:05:09.090> blend<00:05:09.210> together

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
just blend together

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.450 
just blend together
and<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.320> other<00:05:11.500> thing<00:05:11.740> that's<00:05:11.860> magic<00:05:12.310> about

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
and the other thing that's magic about

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.870 
and the other thing that's magic about
inktense<00:05:12.880> pencils<00:05:13.449> is<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:14.020> once<00:05:14.290> they<00:05:14.470> dry

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
inktense pencils is that once they dry

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.090 
inktense pencils is that once they dry
the<00:05:15.880> colors<00:05:16.300> are<00:05:16.690> permanent<00:05:17.440> so<00:05:17.680> that's<00:05:17.980> why

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
the colors are permanent so that's why

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.070 
the colors are permanent so that's why
it's<00:05:18.220> called<00:05:18.310> ink<00:05:18.669> tents

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.409 

bright<00:05:21.620> colors<00:05:21.860> on<00:05:22.129> the<00:05:22.220> permanents<00:05:22.729> like<00:05:22.940> on

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
bright colors on the permanents like on

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.930 
bright colors on the permanents like on
the<00:05:23.599> shoe<00:05:23.930> that<00:05:24.080> I've<00:05:24.229> got<00:05:24.410> here<00:05:24.770> I<00:05:24.979> used<00:05:25.849> the

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
the shoe that I've got here I used the

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.900 
the shoe that I've got here I used the
same<00:05:26.240> blue<00:05:26.569> and<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.379> put<00:05:27.710> yellow<00:05:27.949> and<00:05:28.729> when<00:05:28.879> I

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
same blue and I put yellow and when I

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.240 
same blue and I put yellow and when I
wet<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.720> yellow<00:05:30.199> it<00:05:30.470> didn't<00:05:30.800> pick<00:05:30.949> up<00:05:31.099> the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
wet the yellow it didn't pick up the

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.879 
wet the yellow it didn't pick up the
blue<00:05:31.460> normally<00:05:32.210> with<00:05:32.470> watercolor<00:05:33.470> pencils

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
blue normally with watercolor pencils

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.290 
blue normally with watercolor pencils
the<00:05:34.099> blue<00:05:34.250> would<00:05:34.430> have<00:05:34.520> smeared<00:05:34.819> into<00:05:35.060> the

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
the blue would have smeared into the

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:41.790 
the blue would have smeared into the
yellow<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.690> farmed<00:05:35.960> green

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.690 

I'll<00:05:42.250> show<00:05:42.430> you

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.370 

a<00:05:48.290> sample<00:05:49.290> that<00:05:49.410> I<00:05:49.530> got<00:05:49.710> finished<00:05:49.950> here
