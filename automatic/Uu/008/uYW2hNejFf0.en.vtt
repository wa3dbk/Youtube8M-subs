00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.049
 for the roads friend already spat with the 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:09.560
 pri couple dot org I have them I'm going to 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:15.769
 tell them this week a couple of 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:19.130
 doubles leave a pj and in it we live a 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.710
 very interesting law that has been spoken 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.950
 a lot but I do not know if people 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.080
 understands 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.750
 Leviticus 25 37 says if your brother is 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.000
 needed that is not to your help 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 lend you money without interest what for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 course it makes us ask 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 they are allowed to lend money 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.550
 interest if for example with that money in 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 the bank and the bank is your agent because 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.540
 the bank lends money to another cobra of 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.990
 pay it therefore indirectly you 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.140
 You are charging interest too if you are 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.690
 allowed to receive interest in fact 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.790
 we for example know that the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.620
 Islam is forbidden 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.250
 and yet this is managed in a 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:11.260
 creative way of doing it by saying that 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 the loan is not a loan is a 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.090
 investment in a business and the people who 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.290
 pay is not paying interest but 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.560
 the share of the investor 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.700
 but as we Jews understand 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.730
 what it says will lend money to you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.050
 brother 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.550
 Jews online achieve two ways 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.550
 the first is that 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.450
 everything we have our health 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.040
 our strength the money 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.380
 our intelligence the money that comes 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.940
 us the universe we receive 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.010
 by the grace of god 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.320
 we do not own our 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.150
 money we are only 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.300
 guardians of the money actually is 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.450
 God then when we pay 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.659
 money to someone 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.750
 the money is not mine is from god is not 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.890
 allowed that I benefited from the 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.869
 someone else's money 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.190
 then as god, lend me money to 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.220
 me without interest 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.010
 I have to lend it to someone else without 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.900
 interest also another Jew is the 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 most basic answer is a 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.460
 concentration a little more complex and a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.130
 second level which is 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:27.500
 we are all selfish all 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.450
 we seek our advantage all of us 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.940
 we passed thinking 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.569
 what is the cost-benefit if it is worth 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.319
 worth it if it's not worth it and what side 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.069
 is not saying is that 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.099
 when you help someone you have to 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.060
 help him for helping him not to win 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.299
 interest 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.340
 if you want to fulfill the letter of the Torah 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.710
 it has to be without interest because 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.780
 this tells us that 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.940
 and you're helping him for him when you give him 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.810
 advice you give your time gives you what 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.730
 you give more based on not on you 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.010
 lend money you lend you power not for 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.290
 you not to gain interest 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.720
 and this is the idea and of course how much 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.569
 the more we leave the more we give in a 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.189
 most longed for best we felt about 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.189
 ourselves more 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.980
 strengthened we felt more 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:31.030
 I think it 's the more you give without 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.730
 expect nothing more to receive in return 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.640
 finally I will say that in my opinion 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.420
 my opinion of several rabbis if you are 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.520
 allowed to lend for you always and 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.680
 when you do not believe 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.770
 than to make a loan to someone for 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.380
 internet is the same and it is done 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.760
 what the Torah says without interest if you 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.350
 you want to say I'm going to meet a 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.830
 mitzvah I will make a loan without 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.350
 interest 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.810
 that is a loan with interest is because 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.970
 already 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.840
 as long as it is honest of legitimate 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.420
 It's not a sin, it's not wrong, but it's not a 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.760
 same and we finally have to 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.730
 say in our life how much minister 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.200
 we want to be how much we have to look 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.320
 our own interest our own 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.320
 profits also being Jewish is not easy 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.120
 intellectually he demands a lot with this 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.480
 that it was a bit Jewish but those that 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 we are what we enjoy milestone rabbis of 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.950
 sugar with a is in us all the 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.560
 many other things that PRI members 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.560
 offers to call me
