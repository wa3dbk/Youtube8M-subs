hi<00:00:01.170> my<00:00:01.380> name<00:00:01.560> is<00:00:01.589> David<00:00:02.040> Morrison<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.669> also<00:00:03.149> go

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
hi my name is David Morrison I also go

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.010 
hi my name is David Morrison I also go
by<00:00:03.780> dead<00:00:04.230> warm<00:00:04.500> Oh<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:05.120> this<00:00:06.120> tutorial<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.960> will

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
by dead warm Oh in this tutorial I will

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.830 
by dead warm Oh in this tutorial I will
show<00:00:07.440> you<00:00:07.980> how<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.250> create<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.880> box<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.780> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
show you how to create a box with a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.009 
show you how to create a box with a
hinge<00:00:10.280> so<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.400> when<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.639> drop<00:00:11.969> another<00:00:12.150> box

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
hinge so that when you drop another box

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.609 
hinge so that when you drop another box
on<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.650> rotates<00:00:14.370> around<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:15.120> hinge<00:00:15.619> this

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
on it it rotates around that hinge this

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.330 
on it it rotates around that hinge this
is<00:00:16.770> done<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.310> blender<00:00:17.730> game<00:00:18.300> engine<00:00:19.340> so

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
is done in the blender game engine so

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:31.100 
is done in the blender game engine so
let's<00:00:20.760> start<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.529> the<00:00:22.529> default<00:00:22.890> scene

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.550 

and<00:00:31.340> duplicate<00:00:32.340> your<00:00:32.550> default<00:00:33.000> cube<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.750> move

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:34.560 
and duplicate your default cube and move

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.110 
and duplicate your default cube and move
it<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.310> Z<00:00:35.580> direction<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:38.970> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
it up in the Z direction and take the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.980 
it up in the Z direction and take the
lower<00:00:39.330> cube<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.370> scale<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.400> in<00:00:41.810> the<00:00:42.810> Z

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
lower cube and scale it in the Z

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.510 
lower cube and scale it in the Z
direction<00:00:44.540> make<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:45.630> a<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.750> bit<00:00:45.930> smaller

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
direction make it a little bit smaller

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:54.830 
direction make it a little bit smaller
and<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> z<00:00:49.620> axis<00:00:51.440> then<00:00:52.440> let's<00:00:52.739> scale<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.400> up<00:00:53.840> in

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
and the z axis then let's scale it up in

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
and the z axis then let's scale it up in
the<00:00:55.379> x<00:00:55.650> and<00:00:55.890> y<00:00:56.070> direction<00:00:56.129> by<00:00:56.730> holding<00:00:57.030> down

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the x and y direction by holding down

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:09.330 
the x and y direction by holding down
shift<00:00:57.180> Z

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.029 

now<00:01:09.969> let's<00:01:10.210> look<00:01:10.390> at<00:01:10.600> it<00:01:10.750> from<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.200> top<00:01:11.649> view

00:01:12.029 --> 00:01:12.039 
now let's look at it from the top view

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.779 
now let's look at it from the top view
move<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.820> smaller<00:01:13.149> cube<00:01:13.539> over<00:01:14.159> to<00:01:15.159> one<00:01:15.310> corner

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:15.789 
move the smaller cube over to one corner

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:24.230 
move the smaller cube over to one corner
and<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:21.729> switch<00:01:22.329> to<00:01:22.689> your<00:01:22.869> physics<00:01:23.679> buttons

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and now switch to your physics buttons

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.209 
and now switch to your physics buttons
but<00:01:25.240> before<00:01:25.479> we<00:01:26.079> do<00:01:26.229> that<00:01:26.259> we<00:01:26.500> need<00:01:26.679> to<00:01:26.890> switch

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219 
but before we do that we need to switch

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.359 
but before we do that we need to switch
to<00:01:27.429> the<00:01:27.520> blender<00:01:27.850> game<00:01:28.179> engine<00:01:28.649> and<00:01:29.649> change

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
to the blender game engine and change

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.779 
to the blender game engine and change
that<00:01:30.579> small<00:01:30.969> cube<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.159> rigid<00:01:33.640> body<00:01:34.649> and<00:01:35.789> I

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
that small cube to a rigid body and I

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.569 
that small cube to a rigid body and I
like<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.270> use<00:01:37.450> the<00:01:37.810> convex<00:01:38.469> hull<00:01:38.619> collision

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
like to use the convex hull collision

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.630 
like to use the convex hull collision
bounds<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.289> seem<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.439> get<00:01:41.590> better<00:01:41.860> results<00:01:42.189> with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
bounds I seem to get better results with

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.660 
bounds I seem to get better results with
that<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.679> take<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.039> larger<00:01:45.250> box<00:01:45.640> or<00:01:46.539> let's

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
that and take the larger box or let's

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080 
that and take the larger box or let's
call<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.849> a<00:01:49.000> board<00:01:50.459> change<00:01:51.459> that<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.880> a<00:01:51.909> rigid

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
call it a board change that to a rigid

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
call it a board change that to a rigid
body<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.860> change<00:01:54.219> its<00:01:54.459> collision<00:01:55.239> bounds<00:01:55.840> to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
body and change its collision bounds to

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.690 
body and change its collision bounds to
convex<00:01:56.770> hull<00:01:58.739> and<00:01:59.739> if<00:01:59.890> we<00:02:00.039> hit<00:02:00.189> p<00:02:00.459> on<00:02:00.670> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
convex hull and if we hit p on the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.839 
convex hull and if we hit p on the
keyboard<00:02:01.860> that'll<00:02:02.860> start<00:02:03.099> the<00:02:03.280> blender<00:02:03.640> game

00:02:03.839 --> 00:02:03.849 
keyboard that'll start the blender game

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:08.789 
keyboard that'll start the blender game
engine<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:05.099> they<00:02:06.099> both<00:02:06.280> fall<00:02:07.799> forever

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
engine and they both fall forever

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:11.069 
engine and they both fall forever
because<00:02:09.429> we<00:02:09.610> have<00:02:09.759> no<00:02:09.940> constraints<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:10.780> any<00:02:10.929> of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
because we have no constraints on any of

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.500 
because we have no constraints on any of
them<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> let's<00:02:12.519> go<00:02:12.700> to<00:02:12.760> our<00:02:12.849> constraint

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
them so let's go to our constraint

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.800 
them so let's go to our constraint
buttons<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.940> board<00:02:17.430> add<00:02:18.430> a<00:02:19.389> rigid

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
buttons and on the board add a rigid

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.030 
buttons and on the board add a rigid
body<00:02:19.840> joint<00:02:21.209> constraint<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:23.410> change<00:02:23.799> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
body joint constraint and change the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.750 
body joint constraint and change the
pivot<00:02:24.430> type<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:25.420> hinge<00:02:26.430> now<00:02:27.430> let<00:02:27.639> me<00:02:27.670> hit<00:02:27.880> play

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
pivot type to hinge now let me hit play

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.270 
pivot type to hinge now let me hit play
the<00:02:30.760> board<00:02:31.000> pivots<00:02:31.510> around<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:34.090> x-axis

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the board pivots around the x-axis

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.680 
the board pivots around the x-axis
notice<00:02:36.280> how<00:02:36.400> it<00:02:36.519> comes<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:37.030> an<00:02:37.090> abrupt<00:02:37.180> stop

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
notice how it comes to an abrupt stop

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.740 
notice how it comes to an abrupt stop
there<00:02:38.220> let's<00:02:39.220> change<00:02:39.700> that<00:02:40.030> by<00:02:40.269> changing<00:02:40.540> some

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there let's change that by changing some

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.620 
there let's change that by changing some
settings<00:02:40.959> in<00:02:42.150> our<00:02:43.150> world<00:02:43.450> buttons<00:02:45.480> go<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
settings in our world buttons go to the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.599 
settings in our world buttons go to the
world<00:02:46.840> buttons<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.620> look<00:02:48.130> down<00:02:48.310> at<00:02:48.459> your

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
world buttons and look down at your

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.259 
world buttons and look down at your
physics<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.359> activation<00:02:50.019> section<00:02:51.269> change

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
physics the activation section change

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.890 
physics the activation section change
that<00:02:52.510> time<00:02:52.810> factor<00:02:55.290> 20<00:02:57.120> now<00:02:58.120> when<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.450> hit<00:02:58.569> p

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
that time factor 20 now when we hit p

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.569 
that time factor 20 now when we hit p
and<00:02:59.669> watch<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.940> game<00:03:00.970> engine<00:03:02.280> you'll<00:03:03.280> notice

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
and watch the game engine you'll notice

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.330 
and watch the game engine you'll notice
that<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.790> board<00:03:04.090> continues<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.959> rotate<00:03:06.720> until

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
that the board continues to rotate until

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.330 
that the board continues to rotate until
it<00:03:09.340> runs<00:03:09.489> out<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.760> momentum<00:03:10.329> I<00:03:11.310> think<00:03:12.310> that

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
it runs out of momentum I think that

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.659 
it runs out of momentum I think that
looks<00:03:12.549> much<00:03:12.819> better<00:03:13.680> hit<00:03:14.680> escape<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.400> get<00:03:15.549> out

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
looks much better hit escape to get out

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.540 
looks much better hit escape to get out
of<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.849> blender<00:03:15.940> game<00:03:16.269> engine
