 Legend has it that many years ago 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.420
 in a town north of mexico he lived 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 a young woman who loved 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.120
 cats the money I earned working 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.980
 used to buy him as many things 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.870
 it came to mind to take care 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.850
 feed and consent to these animals 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.160
 this young woman was always surrounded 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.530
 from a crowd of them when I looked at 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.230
 one abandoned on the street without thinking 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 he took it to his house all the 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.510
 neighbors were aware of their 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.270
 excessive love for these creatures for 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.450
 this reason derogatively the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.250
 they called the woman of the cats 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.619
 one night when she was sleeping 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.500
 deeply sharp blows on his 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.119
 window made him wake up 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.070
 startled she thought it was about 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.729
 some of his neighbors that he needed 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.039
 comment or ask for something stood up and 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.410
 seeing through the window was surprised 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.930
 because when removing the curtains there was no 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.569
 no person but a black cat that 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 he was staring at her with his bright 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.360
 yellowish eyes without hesitation or a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.299
 second opened the window to leave it 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.549
 pass the cat approached purring and 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.940
 she is delighted she caressed him for a few 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.329
 moments he lay down and little by little he came back 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.329
 to sleep 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.340
 the days went by and the black cat 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.170
 he became the most adorable of all 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.290
 the cats that were with that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.610
 woman followed her wherever she went and even 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.830
 He slept beside her , but the young woman 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.590
 he realized that the other cats started 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.260
 to move away and some left their 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.360
 house she did not understand the reason and that 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.210
 it gave birth to a deep 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.190
 sadness because every day had less 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.190
 cats making him company 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.299
 of all these cats she had 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.799
 preference for a cat in particular to 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.230
 the one that had raised since the 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.030
 found abandoned on the street with the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.550
 fear that it would also move away 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.680
 He decided to dedicate more of his time 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.740
 one afternoon that the woman came from her 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.200
 work with a huge regret he realized 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.510
 that only two cats approached him 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.200
 lanata the one I had raised since I was little 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.480
 black cat and the cat lifted the 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.990
 hugged and noticed that the black cat 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.970
 this bothered her the woman realized 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.190
 and it caused a frightening fear and 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.350
 frivolous when observing that the eyes of that 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.030
 black cat began to put on a 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.030
 intense red tone 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.519
 in the next night while serving him 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.349
 food to his cat the black cat arrived 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:58.080
 approaching with anger and getting wet 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.510
 strongly with claim tone to 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.909
 to notice this the woman tried to 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.739
 raise the cat but the annoying cat 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.140
 he threw himself on the cat fighting 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.870
 fiercely desperate for not being able 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.239
 separate them the woman ran to look for something 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.700
 with which to move away the black cat when returning 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.639
 he found a bloody scene 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.010
 and disturbing since the black cat with 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.639
 all the calm my claws to have 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.220
 smashed the cat the young in a 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.380
 crying disconsolate irritable took the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.050
 broom chasing the cat hitting it 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.419
 and threw him out on the street for several 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.030
 nights the black cat have done to the 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.910
 woman to try to get into the 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.400
 window meowing insistently 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.460
 waiting for the young woman to return to 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.979
 allow entry 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.710
 one afternoon when the girl returned to her 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:51.289
 house found the cat prostrate in his 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.599
 room she was tony is by the 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.270
 terror that caused him to look at him for his 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.870
 big and fearsome incandescent eyes 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.789
 the body of the cat was different was 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.479
 strangely bigger with a posture 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.190
 as who dominates the situation 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:10.039
 trying to overcome the woman the 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:13.849
 black cat stared as 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.340
 a feline stalking its prey the jump 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:18.770
 over it nailing her nails 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.660
 face and tearing it again and again 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.729
 biting his neck and his 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.639
 face as quickly scratched 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.610

 young and he squeezed until she did not put 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.030
 more resistance and she 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:42.240
 stopped breathing 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.750
 the cat after this jumped out the window and 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.190
 disappeared in the middle of the night nobody 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.920
 he would have known about the death 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.890
 fateful of the young woman if the other cats 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.870
 they would not have returned to the house when 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.600
 mind that she was inert 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.390
 meow on in a long and frightening 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.160
 crying the sinister sound of so many 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.120
 cats caused the neighbors to 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.790
 will approach the house of the young 

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:11.060
 the woman's face had the 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:13.880
 expression of a gruesome death the 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.889
 open eyes torn by sharp ones 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.500
 black cat nails hair 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:20.530
 disturbed and blood puddles that 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:24.220
 He came out of the wounds in his neck 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.220
 shoulders and arms 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.879
 the house was closed and never again 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:33.860
 to be inhabited it is said that they live there 

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:37.279
 some cats that at night do 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.339
 listen to their pitiful moved around 

00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:43.550

 day nobody has ever seen them 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.249
 exception of a black cat that appears 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:53.389

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:03.430
 Once a cat crosses your path
