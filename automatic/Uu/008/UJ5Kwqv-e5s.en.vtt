00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.179
 in Russia Alexey Vasilyev 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.049
 in this series we'll talk about racing 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.920
 Kiev, I will reveal little tricks 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920
 who could not put out 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 poster on which limited st 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.060
 territory 3 ha 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.510
 as a rule in the place where you belong to 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.779
 lap time has a turn 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.590
 so going to the fastest lap 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.589
 are starting 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.439
 using press speed going out to 

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 beginning serif 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.670
 as widely as possible open the secret to 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.829
 those periods are starting to return to 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:44.960
 the perfect trajectory I myself have you started 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.489
 the circle will be greater than the maximum 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 speed than in the usual room 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.920
 same glaring fast lap 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.530
 forget about which turn after five 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.690
 days do not go away and in the thought and cut and 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.960
 tracks so as to slip the loop floor 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.060
 shortest path 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.660
 you will get the most money 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.030
 trails which will greatly affect 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.770
 shortening the lap time 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.570
 very important thing for lap time this 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.560
 tire pressure as a rule 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.710
 initially has its specific 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.310
 the mechanics parameters it produced are produced 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.290
 there for years tire pressure for their cards 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 for your track 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.680
 let's say if the wheel is very pumped 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.799
 a small stain will quickly warm up 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.510
 contact and how to start 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.670
 float behind the wheel 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.740
 very low pressure it will give 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.290
 great resistance 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.810
 rolling how you will lose very much 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:36.430
 time on 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.910
 direct energy will be absorbed by the wheel 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.560
 there will be no acceleration but tire pressure 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.340
 very help you 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 if you can negotiate with 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.560
 mechanics who in the case when all 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.930
 I chose the nuances at the circuit 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.060
 you have the perfect ideal trajectory 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.040
 District time but if you ask 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.880
 mechanics a little bit later pressure 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.670
 a couple of tenths it will add to you 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.330
 on the control races on 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:03.890
 the first two laps 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.250
 increase in time of course then the wheel 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.859
 warms up and time will drain 

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:10.619
 the first two laps you'll have 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.619
 significantly strengthened turned out 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.640
 very helpful forever 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.269
 the right of rivals when on the track there 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.760
 on after turning with a 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.659
 slow speed 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.979
 prepare yourself to attack 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.269
 as close as possible bumper 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.509
 in front of the car if it were not for these paid 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:31.909
 rear bumper 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.329
 at the moment of its maximum 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.019
 braking 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.319
 light touch on progress past this 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.689
 turning 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.499
 remember this is literally moving further than 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:43.069
 entrance 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.579
 open I give you my word 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:46.869
 which you can ben peoples but by this 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.519
 the bank itself 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.480
 bundles 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.459
 speedy product at that moment when 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.030
 man dissolves the cards in order to 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.409
 go to a wide pretoria of call 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.619
 gate return works in Kiev 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:02.059
 quietly body start give out 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.289
 if you push it down so he 

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:06.349
 touches folk robbers with him 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.349
 noticeably falls at a speed of 2 August 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:12.599
 you can outrun your opponent by 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.480
 more speed but so recession situation 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.560
 that around him down the street begins his 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.419
 pushing 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.249
 how to start in front of you stop 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:22.749
 Sabirov did not bring, and now this years before 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:24.889
 moment as the map will be across the road 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.719
 he will immediately be an obstacle for you 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.820
 on the tracks you 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.050
 definitely can not deploy it because 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.490
 that you will immediately be excluded from 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.390
 competition slightly started to give 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.020
 to man 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.340
 let him hide his password 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.020
 turns out to be turned out if you 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.840
 him at this moment releases him again 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.860
 then appears on his wheels and he 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.169
 goes to the other side of the garden 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:46.999
 thereby it was provoked on 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:49.379
 do not make a mistake 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.629
 snap turn away let it go 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:53.679
 he will clean up 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:55.919
 I shared my secrets with us 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.509
 but treat them lightly it's just 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.149
 council illegally 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:02.859
 you will find yourself on the track 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.859
 Let this path after that arbitrators base 

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.779
 you yourself are working rushing 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:09.690
 train 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.440
 number of kilometers always 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.999
 recalculation for the result 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.169
 loss failures don't stop you 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.680
 work on yourself 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.069
 before winning 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:19.459
 provide power to Russia
