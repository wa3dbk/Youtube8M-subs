 educate tina the education dream number 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.429
 one of Latin America in this video we're going 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.429
 to work with a very tool 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.760
 interesting math that is the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.840
 scribe 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.040
 screen 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.040
 of eratosthenes 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:28.060
 Eratosthenes sieve is active is a 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.400
 algorithm that allows us to find all 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.540
 the prime numbers less than a number 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.240
 natural given for example in this video 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.610
 let's see what the data screen would look like 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.120
 you have for the first 100 numbers 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.940
 natural to build this screen what 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 first that is done is to cross out the number 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.960
 we cross out to number one then 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.600
 round the next number in this 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.989
 case 2 and we write it aside 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.989
 let's find it here the side what 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:06.460
 we notice the 2 what we are going to do now 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.760
 is to cross out all the multiples of 2 is 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.870
 say all the even numbers are going to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.980
 be crossed out 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.790
 they will be roofed in this way 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.330
 the even numbers are columned like this 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 therefore we are going to cross them out 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.350
 all even numbers 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.360
 meanwhile he told them that it was all 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:39.960
 you were a mathematician and astronomer 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:45.490
 Greek who lived between the years 200 76 and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.060
 194 before Christ and it was he who had 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.220
 the idea of making this interesting and 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.880
 extremely useful algorithm 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.850
 then we finished then to mark 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.400
 all multiples of 2 is a great 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.370
 number of numbers all multiples 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.830
 of 2 that are between 2 is worth the 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.979
 redundancy without striking it and the 100 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.220
 once we do that we select or 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.960
 round up the next number that you 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.230
 follow is to say the next one that is us 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.920
 crossed out in this case is 3 and what 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.000
 let's do then it is to cross out all 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:36.060
 multiples of 3 for example 9 on 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:39.569
 15 the 21 and the 27 the 33 the 39 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.130
 we are going to cross out also 42 is 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.110
 canceled we lasted 45 No 48 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.819
 it is also already canceled, that is, if 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.950
 the numbers are not crossed out 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:58.590
 we cross out again clear is the 51 the 54 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:04.290
 it is already crossed out on page 57, crossed out 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.750
 63 we cross it now the 66 is already 69 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.830
 we cross it out and so we will continue 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:14.720
 treating all multiples of 3 that 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.740
 have not yet been canceled 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:25.520
 of this form of 31 we lack the 87 the 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:28.460
 93 and 99 very well the first numbers 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.470
 they are always the hardest or most 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.490
 long 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.940
 then we round up the number that 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:37.400
 follow the 4 is crossed out therefore 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.640
 we take the 5 and cancel all 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.620
 multiples of 5 the multiples of 5 are going to 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.280
 be all those that end in zero or in 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.500
 5 therefore all these are going to 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.050
 cancel 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.210
 and of course we are writing 5 to a 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.840
 cost then we mark the 7 and cancel 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:04.220
 all its multiples those that are no longer 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.880
 crossed out clear is such is the case 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.880
 of the 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:16.150
 49 we fought in this case the 49 the 77 and 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.359
 the 91 which are the only multiples of 7 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.549
 that had not yet been crossed out 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.900
 to the next number that is not crossed 8 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.970
 9 and 10 we do not follow with 11 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.490
 we select the 11 and we throw you now 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.220
 all multiples of 11 that have we 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.770
 been crossed out with the multiples of 11 already 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.729
 they were all crossed out in their entirety 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:43.099
 that's why we went to 13 we wrote down here 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.749
 we miss all the multiples of 13 that 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:46.819
 they are not crossed out in this case they are already 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.889
 all crossed out and the numbers that we 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:52.629
 you were left to be able to 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:56.469
 check already are all their multiples 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.659
 at least those that are between 1 and 100 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:02.749
 crossed out the numbers that remained 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:05.860
 here in blue all these numbers that we 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:08.060
 they are rounded in blue they are going to be 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.270
 numbers 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.460
 cousins all these those who are blue 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.840
 those that we will continue to find that are 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.800
 the calls 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.800
 numbers 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.590
 cousins 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.970
 and this is the way to work with the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.550
 screening of eratosthenes to know the 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:34.039
 prime numbers less than a number 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.039
 natural given in this case the 100 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:40.479
 educational I recommend the following 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.479
 videos so you can keep learning
