00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:12.420
 I wonder if beer made in Japan and beer made in China have the same taste 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:17.719
 Aircraft crew to direct the beer in Japan and Japanese brands such as beer cans 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.719
 I compared the taste of bottled beer and bottled Chinese beer . 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:39.120
 3 Monthly beer experts compared the world beer in three stages 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:44.719
 The difference in color and bubble disappearance , beer flavor and carbonate disappear 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.719
 I checked everything from beer to taste . 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.790
 c If the sum is the same 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 Well 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:04.290
 I felt a lot more aroma than a white pearl and pearl beer 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.980
 And bitter taste lasts longer than beer. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:15.390
 This beer is about a beer and it looks like it's weaker than an aroma. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:21.600
 If you like bass beer 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.100
 Very little bit of that hop-bitter flavor other than the special I have spoken to me 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 I did not feel it. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.170
 At the end, it tasted a bit tasteless 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.710
 I now wanna be a little different beer for this and some a and b 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710
 I thought. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 If you put together the words of three experts, 300 of the Japanese brands and Yes Bonsan 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:46.759
 The taste of beer is different. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.759
 Why do I see this difference? I checked with the vendor . 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.040
 we to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.050
 no 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.590
 Another Japanese brand hue 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 This white pear is also selling pure pearls from Korea. 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:22.410
 Two beers of the same brand but different origin 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.410
 I also compared the incense of the three experts to the collapse of the white scorpion . 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.300
 In the case of d beer, it is not the fragrant aroma of barley malt, 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.989
 I do not go into the other 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.010
 Late personnel was even gives towards what some subtle enough while Bouquets 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.989
 I do it. 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:49.510
 Feeding natdago the heavy charges or revenue if it tastes a little sick nam 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:55.540
 It 's a big difference between a weak one and a master one . 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.450
 a At the end of a beer, the taste is bitter, 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.950
 Beer containing a lot of bitter b cup 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.939
 It has appeared in 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.769
 Oh, our beer. 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:13.329
 Please listen to the same mat again was not a difference between stocks Denmark 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.970
 If we put together the words of three times experts, we can say that 300 Japanese and 300 Japanese 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.650
 The taste of white is completely different. 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 Taste of Japan than China 300000000000000 300 shares and flavor much tougher plain Mira 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.390
 Why this difference I 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:35.490
 What I suffered, because we're not in the audience. He hanggan Hansarang Mac 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.250
 And performing the time rice is then 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:45.180
 Many of the following companies 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.560
 The quality of beer is different because 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.890
 But that environmental factors can have me do differ because of the different water 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.890
 Will
