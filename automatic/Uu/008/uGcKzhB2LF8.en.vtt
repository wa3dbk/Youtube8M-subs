00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.660
 the pleasure of meeting franca sozzani are part of me 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.129
 note on blogospheres 

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.480
 lost without being able to celebrate 40 years 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.139
 audiblog a man 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:19.000
 has created three covers adopts the special number tries to tell how 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.780
 archived this the idea of ​​creating these between covers did not come 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.150
 celebrative 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.149
 meanwhile, at the age of 40, you are 50 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:29.399
 so many things have happened that 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.309
 grouping and down meaning was very difficult 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.300
 I wanted to do a book but I feel like a book that ends right away 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.750
 meteogiornale can go to many ancona 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.200
 here is a circulation my superior mind 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.920
 and I liked the idea of ​​putting tx200 characters then because they are not many 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.240
 in my opinion these 40 years are represented by those who for the skill that for it 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.870
 style 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180
 ok, afterlife 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.320
 away from their own personality all however not really style because also 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.080
 woody allen's hat can only be woody allen led 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.820
 so instead of making a fashion journal, do a fashion journey 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.200
 style path 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.610
 important characters' mattress 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.940
 at this point grouped the music percentage 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.480
 there is one of those in the cinema 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.110
 the most iconic ones of the past those of today and then the opposites divided 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 so 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.270
 a woman who equips 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.490
 that still creates the style in Italy the trends in Italy with man and babou 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.220
 woman. I haven't had it for a year 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 she loved fashion over the past twenty years 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 I must say that if the woman that the man in a radical way 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.049
 the anna woman had stories in mind of the pelatone in love evolution 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.649
 of fashion we want to change interprets the couple in fashion 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.570
 well then all that happened we say also in the market then from 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.230
 great fashion designer, so events have happened, I would say 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.680
 quite important 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.930
 in terms of style it has changed enormously because it is no longer agitated 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:59.770
 free 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.770
 decides to invest according to which it no longer has 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.720
 not all problems issuu if it is really fashionable 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.419
 to follow while being one that loves the bike 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.419
 man in my opinion is better last year and a half ho 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.879
 it has never been a fashionable saw 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.290
 but let's say that in certain periods in the 1980s 90% started out much more 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.309
 subject to the act a certain type of people however felt the motta today 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:35.140
 nietzche much less this thing the man indeed s of fashion not in fashion - in fashion 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.309
 they mostly speak the style of others 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.979
 and other men 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.649
 and don't care what exactly that dress is exactly what that is 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:43.129
 already 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.209
 but while the woman is there 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.339
 bellomo and more the style of another then try to follow to see with me 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.180
 what is it that makes it interesting here is more and more 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.899
 motivation for a man 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.719
 here we are online network - and chia 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:03.930
 a community of fashionista bloggers is very active 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.789
 fashion shows in ear the champion 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:10.699
 explains the difference in Italy that is a little less developed respects mine 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.689
 liked to rate positively 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.299
 and the beauty of the blog log in now does a little what it wants 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.949
 and therefore he writes what he wants and devotes himself to bears away 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.229
 exact time by feet alone is a bit 

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:28.269
 it is a fact that fashion is definitely a very media part I am interested in here 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.829
 it is very clear that 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.889
 can give a lot of space 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:36.589
 d block rocker italy I see that there are many because I am stronger 

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:38.169
 I saw myself 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.389
 more than 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.719
 also in a not very positive way 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:45.719
 if different from 15 and I must say that 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.559
 me also because then for the fear that does not see them they send me oh my God 

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.919
