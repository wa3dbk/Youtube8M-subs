00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:37.270 
all the way but I do just to kind of get
it<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.660> of<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.780> way<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:25.930> filming<00:02:26.440> at<00:02:26.710> least

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.869 

and<00:02:38.280> now<00:02:38.519> your<00:02:38.700> tensioner<00:02:39.739> plane<00:02:40.739> easily<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.819> a

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
and now your tensioner plane easily is a

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.869 
and now your tensioner plane easily is a
10<00:02:42.239> millimeter<00:02:42.810> bolt<00:02:43.170> right<00:02:43.349> here<00:02:43.879> 10

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
10 millimeter bolt right here 10

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.610 
10 millimeter bolt right here 10
millimeter<00:02:45.269> socket<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:45.780> ratchet<00:02:48.379> okay<00:02:49.379> and

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
millimeter socket and ratchet okay and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.960 
millimeter socket and ratchet okay and
speed<00:02:49.830> up<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.040> little<00:02:50.190> bit<00:02:50.310> through<00:02:50.549> removing

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
speed up a little bit through removing

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.729 
speed up a little bit through removing
that<00:02:51.090> bolt

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.990 

we'll<00:02:56.739> come<00:02:57.069> down

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
we'll come down

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.770 
we'll come down
on<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.180> tensioner<00:03:00.600> comes<00:03:00.900> off

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
on the tensioner comes off

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.970 
on the tensioner comes off
there's<00:03:03.780> nothing<00:03:04.110> wrong<00:03:04.230> with<00:03:04.290> my<00:03:04.500> tensioner

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
there's nothing wrong with my tensioner

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.740 
there's nothing wrong with my tensioner
even<00:03:05.850> though<00:03:05.940> it's<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.120> little<00:03:06.180> corroded<00:03:06.690> it

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
even though it's a little corroded it

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
even though it's a little corroded it
actually<00:03:06.990> looks<00:03:07.140> fairly<00:03:07.230> new<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:08.700> seen<00:03:08.880> a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
actually looks fairly new just seen a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.020 
actually looks fairly new just seen a
little<00:03:09.000> bit<00:03:09.240> of<00:03:09.390> weather<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:11.310> put<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.670> back<00:03:11.820> on

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
little bit of weather so put it back on

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.200 
little bit of weather so put it back on
it's<00:03:12.180> pretty<00:03:12.360> easy<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.780> thread<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.530> bolt<00:03:13.860> in

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
it's pretty easy I thread the bolt in

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.180 
it's pretty easy I thread the bolt in
start<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.330> bolt<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.840> then<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.800> tensioner

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
start the bolt and then the tensioner

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.540 
start the bolt and then the tensioner
does<00:03:17.340> have<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.550> little<00:03:18.890> knob<00:03:19.890> right<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.400> that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
does have a little knob right here that

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.810 
does have a little knob right here that
goes<00:03:20.580> into<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.240> block<00:03:21.990> to<00:03:22.260> locate<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.820> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
goes into the block to locate it and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:41.119 
goes into the block to locate it and
tighten<00:03:24.720> up<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.080> bolt

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:41.129 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.539 

and<00:03:42.129> take<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.579> about<00:03:42.790> 20<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.209> 25<00:03:43.540> foot-pounds

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.349 

okay<00:03:48.549> I'm<00:03:48.639> not<00:03:48.730> going<00:03:48.849> to<00:03:48.939> be<00:03:48.999> able<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.209> really

explain what I'm doing I'm going to take

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.280 
explain what I'm doing I'm going to take
a<00:03:54.129> loop<00:03:54.430> like<00:03:54.730> this<00:03:54.879> I'm<00:03:55.810> going<00:03:55.959> to<00:03:56.019> put<00:03:56.200> it

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
a loop like this I'm going to put it

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.839 
a loop like this I'm going to put it
down<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:57.150> around<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.849> air-conditioning

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849
