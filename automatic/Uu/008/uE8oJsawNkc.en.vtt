00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 and hello to you mystic and lagger 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.910
 before today will be such a little bit 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.809
 sad and video as i think you know 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.940
 already there or channel blocked it was 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.580
 the third complaint is already on my channel and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.359
 proper third complaint as always not 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.789
 for what 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.740
 Well, as always, the first is okay 2 2 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.630
 complaints were you could say no matter how for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.060
 what it is there are just some people 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.949
 tried and did nâ€™t even know who sort of 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 I did not quarrel with anyone 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.360
 normal relationship but the first two 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.829
 strike was for the store for advertising 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.360
 shops i actually after that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.450
 deleted all links to stores 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 but for the third time it's just not for anything 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.969
 literally no wonder you martin too 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.050
 show you what youtube wrote to me like that 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 youtube community members tagged 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.590
 one or more of your videos like 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.719
 unacceptable that is, just someone came in 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.180
 on the video by clicking on the box and says they say 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.300
 dude i don't want that video to watch here 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.059
 there is such a design x-ray dislike 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.949
 like oli thinks why don't i 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.650
 ask friends to throw him too 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.630
 here these complaints and let his channel see 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.479
 block there are any such 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.720
 dear logical and simple youtube from that 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.960
 that many grooves filed a complaint 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.330
 I took it that is, they I do not know, too, for 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 so that we are not written here 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.369
 nearest china just after 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.009
 reviewing material violates our 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.400
 principle this is very interesting what 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.790
 there may be a card violation 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.939
 what that is, right there was the first 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.710
 written shtapu emptiness there spam and something 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.659
 such we learned and said that it was like 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.610
 because the store is not even written here 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.890
 it is that he is in Russia, that is, here 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.540
 people just left complaints and actually 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.990
 there is a spare canal camp no noise 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.850
 in general, now terribly certainly not the second 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.259
 the channel which, if it does not work 1 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.800
 restore then we will all videos 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.660
 pour on the second channel that is 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.490
 nothing will change the video will 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.560
 the next will just go out 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.580
 already on the second channel, even if we can not 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 1 I really hope that we can 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.390
 we can personally restore your squeeze here 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.390
 the camp does not need such here is something very 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.760
 Well, maybe because the channel 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.120
 blocked and nothing to say 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.930
 write a vegetable garden shocked because 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 repeated 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.600
 or shorter than serious violations 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.640
 community guidelines or complaints about 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.730
 violations of these are all due to the principles 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 the community that is supposedly something in my 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.790
 video maybe even filed an application like 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.670
 that I don't have subtitles 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.290
 it would be completely nonsense and this is not me 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.760
 I can even in that hour on the channel yes now 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 I try they do not need that is from this yet 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.100
 I will go out then he just writes to me on the main 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.800
 type page your account is blocked 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.690
 forever everything is just so red 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.000
 strip like this and nothing more 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 No, and let's not remove the account and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.320
 throw immediately to another account or there 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.989
 on empty some 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.410
 that is, I can't even go to see 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.060
 exactly 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.070
 that there I can not complain decreased 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.380
 to appeal against this complaint, I can not 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.750
 because my channel is blocked they 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.489
 can go to him talk to 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.110
 affiliate will say that there is of course that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.709
 unlock they will contact with youtube 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.510
 asks what happened 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.120
 I suggest in general we do not panic and 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.640
 it seems to me that itâ€™s already gone 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:39.750
 there seven years ago and for these 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.480
 signals in 34 posts still on mystic 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.770
 banned 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.200
 communities 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:52.270
 what kind of people do alarmists turn out to be 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:04:00.220
 I'll write down all this already know everything is fun for me 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:04:02.320
 telly watched look I'll go who 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.050

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.180
 channel good evening channel is blocked we 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.250
 justify your day go here soon

 I drink I will fall on the street I will sleep 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.170
 in fact, in short, do not cry 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.150
 panic ie either unlock 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.580
