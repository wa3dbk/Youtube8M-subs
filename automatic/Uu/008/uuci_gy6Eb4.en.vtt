 this case we have a telephone from the 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.869
 Movistar company so we 're going to 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.869

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.840
 invalid the warranty does not cause any 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.890
 failure does not erase any data that could 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 have the phone 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.500
 that is to say that the phones of the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.000

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.430
 release them so please do not we 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.100
 make requests and of course if 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.350
 you have a phone with some block 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.190
 of email for lost theft either 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.190
 we can serve them 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.800
 the first thing that will ask us now is the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.080
 option is the release code in 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.390
 this card is like that because it does not have 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.160
 pin code if it had pin code it would be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.140
 the first thing that we would ask this card 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.570
 I have put Vodafone as it does not have 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.390
 pin code will jump us directly 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 At this rate you see some gray screen 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.510
 that puts us to insert the pin of the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.070
 lock that is the release code 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.040
 so we click on the white square 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.430
 for him is to speak open the keyboard and 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.140
 we mark the liberation game 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 logically this code that I'm 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.210
 putting only voucher for this phone 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.759
 we close the keyboard and click on 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.759
 to unlock 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.939
 I have expose unlocked network and up 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.039

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.539
 main and it's already released and ready 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.539
