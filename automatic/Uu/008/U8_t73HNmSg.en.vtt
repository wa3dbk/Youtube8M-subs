00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.940 
percent so far ok this guy is a pretty
good<00:03:40.450> defense<00:03:40.630> where<00:03:41.019> am<00:03:41.109> I<00:03:41.200> not<00:03:41.320> doing<00:03:41.500> well<00:03:41.650> I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
good defense where am I not doing well I

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.680 
good defense where am I not doing well I
didn't<00:03:42.519> lure<00:03:42.640> out<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.820> archer<00:03:43.150> queen<00:03:43.359> so

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
there's a fail forty-one percent I think

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.930 
there's a fail forty-one percent I think
that's<00:03:47.380> oh<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.620> still<00:03:47.950> got<00:03:48.100> some<00:03:48.280> archers<00:03:48.640> cool

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
that's oh I still got some archers cool

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.460 
that's oh I still got some archers cool
maybe<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.299> can<00:03:49.450> pick<00:03:49.600> off<00:03:49.750> something<00:03:50.140> make<00:03:50.350> it

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
maybe I can pick off something make it

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.890 
maybe I can pick off something make it
back<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:50.920> can<00:03:51.820> get<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.030> safely

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:01.890 

can<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.020> get<00:03:56.080> that<00:03:56.349> now<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:58.120> guess<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.319> yes<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.870> I

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
can I get that now I guess that yes so I

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.420 
can I get that now I guess that yes so I
can<00:04:02.140> pick<00:04:02.260> off<00:04:02.410> some<00:04:02.560> buildings<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.010> get<00:04:03.160> fifty

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
can pick off some buildings to get fifty

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.290 
can pick off some buildings to get fifty
percent<00:04:03.700> likely<00:04:04.120> hope<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.319> hope<00:04:06.120> yeah<00:04:07.120> that's

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
percent likely hope I hope yeah that's

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.580 
percent likely hope I hope yeah that's
trigger<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.629> fifty<00:04:07.900> percent<00:04:08.170> right<00:04:08.349> there

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
trigger this fifty percent right there

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.470 
trigger this fifty percent right there
I'm<00:04:09.340> gonna<00:04:09.459> put<00:04:09.670> down<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.819> couple<00:04:10.060> more<00:04:10.300> to<00:04:10.360> make

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
I'm gonna put down a couple more to make

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.229 
I'm gonna put down a couple more to make
it<00:04:10.510> a<00:04:10.599> little<00:04:10.750> faster<00:04:10.930> oh<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:15.700> hope<00:04:15.940> that<00:04:16.120> gives

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
it a little faster oh I hope that gives

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.490 
it a little faster oh I hope that gives
if<00:04:16.479> that<00:04:16.630> gives<00:04:16.750> us<00:04:16.959> forty-nine<00:04:17.350> percent

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
if that gives us forty-nine percent

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.469 
if that gives us forty-nine percent
that's<00:04:17.739> gonna<00:04:17.919> suck<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:18.579> we<00:04:18.639> got<00:04:18.760> 23<00:04:19.150> seconds

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
that's gonna suck so we got 23 seconds

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.300 
that's gonna suck so we got 23 seconds
left<00:04:19.630> on<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:19.840> attack<00:04:20.169> I<00:04:20.470> think<00:04:20.979> what<00:04:21.100> I<00:04:21.130> could

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
left on this attack I think what I could

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.350 
left on this attack I think what I could
have<00:04:21.340> done<00:04:21.430> better<00:04:21.639> his<00:04:21.820> attack<00:04:22.090> from<00:04:22.240> a

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
have done better his attack from a

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.460 
have done better his attack from a
different<00:04:22.630> side<00:04:22.750> because<00:04:23.139> there<00:04:23.260> was<00:04:23.350> like

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
different side because there was like

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.219 
different side because there was like
three<00:04:23.800> layers<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.070> walls<00:04:24.340> over<00:04:24.610> here<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.229> think

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
three layers of walls over here I think

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.570 
three layers of walls over here I think
I<00:04:26.290> could<00:04:26.410> attack<00:04:26.710> them<00:04:26.860> here<00:04:27.040> was<00:04:27.190> main<00:04:27.400> damage

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I could attack them here was main damage

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.129 
I could attack them here was main damage
