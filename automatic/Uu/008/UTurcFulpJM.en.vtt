00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.779
 men remember that blue 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.550
 squeak of the season therefore 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.190
 refuse the abundance of black things 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.429
 apply dark blue because dark blue 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 things fit very well not 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.880
 Only fashion on denim and denim 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.210
 which will certainly be one of the important 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.560
 items of your wardrobe but with all 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 summer things 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.090
 namely shirts so in the mountains so in 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.989
 cage and stripes 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.870
 the most popular and fashionable drawings for 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 men this summer do not forget about the jackets 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.370
 blu zones cardigans that are always yours 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.829
 will decorate 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.550
 Today's sports trend is very 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.300
 is strong 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.329
 that is why such a large selection of sneakers 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 exists for men and you can them 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.170
 always mix with your summer shoes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.899
 with your summer pants with your 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.329
 summer jeans 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.080
 Of course do not forget that in the summer we are all 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.229
 so we try to tan and brighter 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 colors on a tanned body always look 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.950
 very good selection of men's accessories 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.100
 perhaps less voluminous than women's choices 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.869
 but a well-chosen men's belt 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 Shoulder bag 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.770
 well and of course often fashionable bright socks 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.860
 which can be worn for example in the evening not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.090
 yet we wear shoes barefoot 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:39.350
 will also be a very good addition to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.350
 your summer wardrobe
