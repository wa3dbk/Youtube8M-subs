when<00:00:44.720> that<00:00:44.870> moment<00:00:45.019> comes<00:00:45.229> I<00:00:45.589> basically<00:00:45.920> just

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
when that moment comes I basically just

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.130 
when that moment comes I basically just
point<00:00:46.400> and<00:00:47.000> click<00:00:47.059> away<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:49.809> 99%<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.839> the<00:00:50.930> time

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
point and click away and 99% of the time

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.410 
point and click away and 99% of the time
it's<00:00:51.530> always<00:00:51.890> focused<00:00:52.339> not<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.790> big<00:00:53.000> reason<00:00:53.299> why

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420
