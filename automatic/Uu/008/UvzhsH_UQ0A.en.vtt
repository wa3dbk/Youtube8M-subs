so<00:00:04.680> what<00:00:04.980> made<00:00:05.130> us<00:00:05.279> think<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.609> dogs<00:00:05.879> might<00:00:06.330> be

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
so what made us think that dogs might be

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.660 
so what made us think that dogs might be
able<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.750> smell<00:00:06.990> cancer<00:00:07.319> well<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.370> story

cancer<00:00:17.869> now<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> story<00:00:19.230> started<00:00:19.560> for<00:00:19.740> me<00:00:19.770> when

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
cancer now the story started for me when

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.010 
cancer now the story started for me when
a<00:00:20.130> friend<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.580> mine<00:00:20.730> had<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.060> experience<00:00:21.359> and

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
a friend of mine had this experience and

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
a friend of mine had this experience and
her<00:00:22.199> dog<00:00:22.410> warned<00:00:22.949> of<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> malignant<00:00:23.580> melanoma

two occasions and it got us thinking

two occasions and it got us thinking
could<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.009> actually<00:00:32.309> trained<00:00:33.090> dogs<00:00:33.480> to

could we actually trained dogs to

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.770 
could we actually trained dogs to

complete<00:02:05.920> no<00:02:06.280> kennel<00:02:06.730> policy<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.780> all<00:02:07.990> our

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
complete no kennel policy so all our

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.050 
complete no kennel policy so all our
dogs<00:02:08.500> live<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:08.950> homes<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.520> families<00:02:10.030> and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
dogs live in homes with families and

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.450 
dogs live in homes with families and
just<00:02:10.540> come<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.869> work<00:02:11.020> monday<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.560> friday<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
just come to work monday to friday and

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.020 
just come to work monday to friday and
have<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.760> weekend<00:02:13.150> off<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.640> there<00:02:15.790> are<00:02:15.850> two

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
have the weekend off so there are two

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.910 
have the weekend off so there are two
ways<00:02:16.060> in<00:02:16.330> which<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:17.020> dogs<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.740> make

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
ways in which the dogs are going to make

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.590 
ways in which the dogs are going to make
a<00:02:17.950> huge<00:02:18.040> difference<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.180> way<00:02:19.330> which

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
a huge difference to the way which

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.980 
a huge difference to the way which
cancer<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.260> diagnosed<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> future

that<00:02:25.210> mimics<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.810> dog's<00:02:26.020> nose<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:27.130> means<00:02:27.460> that

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
that mimics a dog's nose this means that

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.940 
that mimics a dog's nose this means that
it<00:02:28.060> could<00:02:28.300> change<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:28.840> way<00:02:29.230> cancer<00:02:29.710> is

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
it could change the way cancer is

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.700 
it could change the way cancer is
screened<00:02:30.460> in<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> future<00:02:31.650> using<00:02:32.650> a
