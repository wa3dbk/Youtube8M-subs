00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
these the hollow ones so this is the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
these the hollow ones so this is the
deal<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.699> going<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.180> right<00:01:00.239> now<00:01:00.449> each

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
deal that I have going on right now each

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.170 
deal that I have going on right now each
one<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> these<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.829> dollar<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.850> comes

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
one of these is a dollar and it comes

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.770 
one of these is a dollar and it comes
sleeved<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.809> everything<00:01:04.379> sleeves<00:01:04.860> cut<00:01:05.189> in

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
sleeved and everything sleeves cut in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.240 
sleeved and everything sleeves cut in
and<00:01:07.430> it's<00:01:08.810> their<00:01:09.810> dollar<00:01:10.080> each<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.890> it's

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and it's their dollar each and it's

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.179 
and it's their dollar each and it's
three<00:01:11.670> for<00:01:11.880> 250<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:14.010> pretty

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
three for 250 so I think that's pretty

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
three for 250 so I think that's pretty
cool<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.850> mean<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
cool because I mean it's my time and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.060 
cool because I mean it's my time and
they<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.680> look<00:01:16.830> pretty<00:01:17.070> nifty<00:01:18.020> but<00:01:19.020> these<00:01:19.740> i

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
they just look pretty nifty but these i

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.410 
they just look pretty nifty but these i
think<00:01:20.280> i'm<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.729> for<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.210> more

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
think i'm going to do for a little more

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.120 
think i'm going to do for a little more
because<00:01:21.720> they're<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.740> really

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
because they're really really really

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
because they're really really really
time<00:01:23.490> consuming<00:01:23.869> I<00:01:24.869> want<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:25.950> like<00:01:26.159> two

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
time consuming I want to do like two

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
time consuming I want to do like two
dollars<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.360> three<00:01:28.350> four<00:01:29.570> five<00:01:30.570> bucks<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
dollars and three four five bucks you

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.330 
dollars and three four five bucks you
know<00:01:33.470> there's<00:01:34.470> just<00:01:34.530> they're<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.130> time

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
know there's just they're really time

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.609 
know there's just they're really time
consuming<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.200> they<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> while<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.770> make

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
consuming and they take a while to make

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
consuming and they take a while to make
but<00:01:40.619> i<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.369> pretty<00:01:41.549> cool

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
but i think that they look pretty cool

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.340 
but i think that they look pretty cool
once<00:01:42.150> i<00:01:42.270> get<00:01:42.450> better<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.810> making<00:01:42.960> hollow

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
once i get better at making hollow

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.050 
once i get better at making hollow
