hello<00:00:01.530> youtubers<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.399> microcurrent<00:00:03.210> fans<00:00:03.270> um

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
hello youtubers and microcurrent fans um

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.480 
hello youtubers and microcurrent fans um
today<00:00:05.609> I<00:00:06.060> wanted<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.600> talk<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.490> these

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
today I wanted to talk about these

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.839 
today I wanted to talk about these
microcurrent<00:00:09.300> gloves<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:10.019> I've<00:00:10.139> been<00:00:10.290> using

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
microcurrent gloves that I've been using

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.240 
microcurrent gloves that I've been using
I<00:00:11.849> am<00:00:12.690> loving<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:13.650> gloves

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
I am loving these gloves

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.390 
I am loving these gloves
they<00:00:14.849> are<00:00:15.089> super<00:00:15.509> conductive<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.980> wasn't

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
they are super conductive which I wasn't

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.279 
they are super conductive which I wasn't
sure<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:17.789> they<00:00:17.970> would<00:00:18.180> be<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.690> know<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> didn't

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
sure if they would be you know I didn't

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:20.840 
sure if they would be you know I didn't
I'm<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:19.830> really<00:00:20.130> even<00:00:20.250> sure<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.699> they're

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
I'm not really even sure what they're

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.460 
I'm not really even sure what they're
made<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.650> feels<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:24.140> poly<00:00:25.140> cotton

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
made of but it feels like a poly cotton

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.630 
made of but it feels like a poly cotton
mix<00:00:26.369> blend<00:00:29.330> but<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.900> my<00:00:31.080> machine<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:32.009> has

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
mix blend but you know my machine it has

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.959 
mix blend but you know my machine it has
you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.750> color<00:00:34.320> Gym<00:00:34.800> sound<00:00:35.219> frequency

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you know so color Gym sound frequency

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.319 
you know so color Gym sound frequency
generator<00:00:36.390> with<00:00:36.840> microcurrent<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.700> it<00:00:38.700> has

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
generator with microcurrent and it has

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.959 
generator with microcurrent and it has
sounds<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.770> hear<00:00:41.129> what<00:00:41.340> I'm<00:00:41.430> connected

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
sounds so I can hear what I'm connected

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.889 
sounds so I can hear what I'm connected
or<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.300> goes<00:00:42.390> wee<00:00:42.629> woo<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.350> I've<00:00:43.920> never

00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:44.899 
or not it goes wee woo and I've never

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.209 
or not it goes wee woo and I've never
heard<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.289> disconnect<00:00:46.649> with<00:00:46.920> these<00:00:47.070> it's

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
heard it like disconnect with these it's

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.069 
heard it like disconnect with these it's
always<00:00:47.550> connected<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> conductivity<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
always connected so the conductivity is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
always connected so the conductivity is
really<00:00:49.440> good<00:00:49.879> I<00:00:51.050> ordered<00:00:52.050> these<00:00:52.230> from<00:00:52.920> China<00:00:53.460> I

year old

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
year old
I<00:01:58.170> don't<00:01:58.680> cuss<00:01:58.860> anymore<00:02:01.460> at<00:02:02.460> least<00:02:02.670> not

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
I don't cuss anymore at least not

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.940 
I don't cuss anymore at least not
advertently<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.259> um<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:06.079> went<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.229> spectacular

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
advertently but um I went to spectacular

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.190 
advertently but um I went to spectacular
research<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.880> try<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.090> find<00:02:10.210> a<00:02:10.570> way<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.750> connect

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
research to try to find a way to connect

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.120 
research to try to find a way to connect
this<00:02:11.440> because<00:02:11.950> mine<00:02:12.780> my<00:02:13.780> cables<00:02:14.740> don't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
this because mine my cables don't

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.040 
this because mine my cables don't
connect<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.850> at<00:02:16.000> all<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.600> what<00:02:16.690> I<00:02:16.750> ended

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
connect this at all and so what I ended

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.980 
connect this at all and so what I ended
up<00:02:17.200> doing<00:02:17.260> you<00:02:17.950> can<00:02:18.070> see<00:02:18.310> these<00:02:18.660> what<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.690> ended

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
up doing you can see these what I ended

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
like so I stick them up underneath here

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.770 
like so I stick them up underneath here
into<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.650> crook<00:02:36.640> right<00:02:36.850> here<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.510> work

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
into the crook right here and I work

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.850 
into the crook right here and I work
like<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.430> which<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:40.120> know<00:02:40.810> it's<00:02:41.140> fine<00:02:41.470> I

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
mean these things these cords are pretty

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.690 
mean these things these cords are pretty
long<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.710> you<00:02:45.070> know<00:02:45.190> I<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:45.520> have<00:02:45.640> a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
long and so you know I don't have a

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.980 
long and so you know I don't have a
problem<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.180> wrapped<00:02:46.510> them<00:02:46.600> behind<00:02:46.840> my

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
problem I just wrapped them behind my

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.560 
problem I just wrapped them behind my
head<00:02:47.140> or<00:02:47.380> whatever<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.700> works<00:02:48.850> great<00:02:48.940> and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
head or whatever and it works great and

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.150 
head or whatever and it works great and
so<00:02:51.960> yeah<00:02:52.960> I'm<00:02:53.050> having<00:02:53.380> a<00:02:53.410> lot<00:02:53.620> of<00:02:53.650> fun<00:02:53.920> with

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.910 
so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with
them<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.880> what<00:02:55.630> I've<00:02:55.720> also<00:02:55.810> discovered<00:02:56.230> is<00:02:56.740> if

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
them and what I've also discovered is if

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.100 
them and what I've also discovered is if
you<00:02:57.100> start<00:02:57.460> out<00:02:57.670> with<00:02:57.730> lymph<00:02:58.360> drainage<00:02:58.540> moves

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you start out with lymph drainage moves

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.670 
you start out with lymph drainage moves
that<00:02:59.800> not<00:03:00.790> only<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.120> the<00:03:01.270> treatment<00:03:01.680> far

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
that not only is the treatment far

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.850 
that not only is the treatment far
better<00:03:03.240> but<00:03:04.240> it's<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:08.290> know<00:03:08.320> doing<00:03:08.680> lymph

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
better but it's you know doing lymph

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.950 
better but it's you know doing lymph
drainage<00:03:09.040> with<00:03:09.400> these<00:03:09.550> gloves<00:03:09.790> on<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.540> like

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
drainage with these gloves on is like

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.530 
drainage with these gloves on is like
you<00:03:11.590> know<00:03:11.710> lymph<00:03:12.040> drainage<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.550> steroids<00:03:13.270> it's

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
you know lymph drainage on steroids it's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.540 
you know lymph drainage on steroids it's
great<00:03:13.930> and<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:16.530> learned<00:03:17.530> my<00:03:18.190> lymph<00:03:18.430> drainage

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
great and so I learned my lymph drainage

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.080 
great and so I learned my lymph drainage
just<00:03:19.420> from<00:03:19.980> some<00:03:20.980> ton<00:03:21.700> of<00:03:21.730> Dermalogica

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
just from some ton of Dermalogica

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.240 
just from some ton of Dermalogica
classes<00:03:22.750> that<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.930> took<00:03:23.050> and<00:03:23.590> they<00:03:23.950> teach<00:03:24.130> it

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
classes that I took and they teach it

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.220 
classes that I took and they teach it
the<00:03:24.430> IDI<00:03:24.790> they<00:03:25.300> teach<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.690> doctor<00:03:25.990> water

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
the IDI they teach the doctor water

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.910 
the IDI they teach the doctor water
method<00:03:27.270> at<00:03:28.270> the<00:03:28.330> IDI<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.290> they<00:03:29.380> have<00:03:29.530> classes

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
method at the IDI and they have classes

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.230 
method at the IDI and they have classes
that<00:03:30.040> roll<00:03:30.280> around<00:03:30.430> once<00:03:30.700> or<00:03:30.820> twice<00:03:31.030> a<00:03:31.210> year

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
that roll around once or twice a year

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.520 
that roll around once or twice a year
that<00:03:31.750> are<00:03:31.960> more<00:03:32.200> in-depth<00:03:32.530> but<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:34.320> don't<00:03:35.320> do

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
that are more in-depth but I don't do

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.830 
that are more in-depth but I don't do
anything<00:03:35.800> super<00:03:36.580> super<00:03:37.030> in-depth<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.600> spend

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
anything super super in-depth I spend

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.710 
anything super super in-depth I spend

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
pretty soft for the client and what

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.380 
pretty soft for the client and what
you'll<00:03:45.940> want<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.240> do<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:47.320> put<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.970> know<00:03:49.000> I

you'll want to do is you put you know I
would<00:03:49.630> brush<00:03:50.050> I<00:03:50.350> mean<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.710> try<00:03:50.980> to<00:03:51.010> put<00:03:51.450> a

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
would brush I mean I try to put a

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.380 
would brush I mean I try to put a
conductive<00:03:53.560> glove<00:03:53.710> on<00:03:53.860> these<00:03:54.060> jo-jo<00:03:55.060> in<00:03:55.240> these

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
conductive glove on these jo-jo in these

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.830 
conductive glove on these jo-jo in these
gloves<00:03:55.720> first<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.710> would<00:03:57.010> probably<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:58.450> what<00:03:58.810> I

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
them on put on my vinyl gloves put these

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.980 
them on put on my vinyl gloves put these
over<00:04:04.510> them<00:04:04.930> insert<00:04:05.650> these<00:04:05.890> and<00:04:06.310> away<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> go<00:04:07.420> but

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
over them insert these and away I go but

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.260 
over them insert these and away I go but
I<00:04:08.020> have<00:04:08.290> painted<00:04:08.620> on<00:04:09.040> you<00:04:09.490> know<00:04:09.580> my<00:04:09.700> conductive

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
I have painted on you know my conductive

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.620 
I have painted on you know my conductive
mask<00:04:10.540> before<00:04:11.020> I<00:04:11.230> even<00:04:11.410> start<00:04:11.860> because<00:04:12.790> they

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
mask before I even start because they

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.229 
mask before I even start because they
will<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:14.020> absorb<00:04:14.260> all<00:04:15.010> your<00:04:15.040> conductive<00:04:15.880> gel

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
will just absorb all your conductive gel

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.150 
will just absorb all your conductive gel
and<00:04:16.509> if<00:04:16.720> you're<00:04:16.870> using<00:04:17.049> expensive<00:04:17.500> stuff<00:04:17.889> like

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.770 

they<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:22.479> just<00:04:22.690> absorbs<00:04:23.050> at<00:04:23.199> all<00:04:23.319> so<00:04:24.660> you<00:04:25.660> know

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
they it just absorbs at all so you know

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.469 
they it just absorbs at all so you know
definitely<00:04:26.580> put<00:04:27.580> that<00:04:27.699> on<00:04:27.819> first<00:04:28.120> with<00:04:28.389> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
definitely put that on first with the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.969 
definitely put that on first with the
with<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.870> brush<00:04:29.199> and<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:31.259> yeah<00:04:32.259> and<00:04:32.530> then<00:04:32.710> I<00:04:32.800> go

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
with a brush and so yeah and then I go

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.089 
with a brush and so yeah and then I go
and<00:04:33.160> I<00:04:33.220> do<00:04:33.280> my<00:04:33.430> holding<00:04:33.970> movements<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:35.710> do

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
and I do my holding movements and I do

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:40.430 
and I do my holding movements and I do
try<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.610> change<00:04:37.030> up<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:39.280> different<00:04:39.639> muscle

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
try to change up the different muscle

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.640 
try to change up the different muscle
lifting<00:04:41.699> patterns<00:04:42.699> each<00:04:43.120> time<00:04:43.479> to<00:04:43.960> keep<00:04:44.289> the

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
lifting patterns each time to keep the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.860 
lifting patterns each time to keep the
muscles<00:04:45.009> guessing<00:04:45.460> as<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.699> what's<00:04:45.940> coming<00:04:46.240> and

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
muscles guessing as to what's coming and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.980 
muscles guessing as to what's coming and
that<00:04:47.050> tends<00:04:47.259> to<00:04:47.349> work<00:04:47.440> really<00:04:47.710> well<00:04:47.830> for<00:04:47.979> me

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
that tends to work really well for me

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.040 
that tends to work really well for me
what<00:04:49.990> else<00:04:50.759> yeah<00:04:51.759> so<00:04:52.120> these<00:04:52.389> these<00:04:52.780> gloves

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
what else yeah so these these gloves

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.310 
what else yeah so these these gloves
work<00:04:53.349> really<00:04:53.590> well<00:04:53.830> I'm<00:04:54.630> pretty<00:04:55.630> satisfied

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
work really well I'm pretty satisfied

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.430 
work really well I'm pretty satisfied
with<00:04:56.349> them<00:04:56.860> Oh<00:04:57.180> disinfecting<00:04:58.180> them

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
with them Oh disinfecting them

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.520 
with them Oh disinfecting them
disinfecting<00:04:59.440> them<00:04:59.590> is<00:04:59.830> tough<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:02.020> need<00:05:02.169> to

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
disinfecting them is tough you need to

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.820 
disinfecting them is tough you need to
run<00:05:03.099> them<00:05:03.340> through<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.849> washer<00:05:04.449> I<00:05:04.690> would<00:05:05.650> not

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
run them through the washer I would not

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.740 
run them through the washer I would not
put<00:05:06.009> them<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.280> dryer<00:05:06.550> so<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.479> to<00:05:07.599> let

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
put them in the dryer so you have to let

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.200 
put them in the dryer so you have to let
them<00:05:07.930> air<00:05:08.169> dry<00:05:08.229> between<00:05:08.919> each<00:05:09.130> client<00:05:09.789> and<00:05:09.940> so

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
them air dry between each client and so

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.700 
them air dry between each client and so
that's<00:05:10.389> why<00:05:10.509> I've<00:05:10.630> ordered<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:11.380> just<00:05:11.560> keep

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
that's why I've ordered it just keep

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.710 
that's why I've ordered it just keep
ordering<00:05:12.070> more<00:05:12.310> where<00:05:12.460> bears<00:05:12.729> because<00:05:13.000> as<00:05:13.210> my

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
ordering more where bears because as my

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.510 
ordering more where bears because as my
microcurrent<00:05:14.380> business<00:05:14.710> gets<00:05:14.949> busier<00:05:15.370> and

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
microcurrent business gets busier and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.930 
microcurrent business gets busier and
busier<00:05:15.550> I<00:05:16.150> have<00:05:16.900> to<00:05:17.080> have<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.710> know<00:05:17.860> six<00:05:18.639> pairs

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
busier I have to have you know six pairs

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.580 
busier I have to have you know six pairs
of<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.210> day<00:05:19.360> or<00:05:19.539> five<00:05:19.990> pairs<00:05:20.259> of<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.500> day

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
of the day or five pairs of the day

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.310 
of the day or five pairs of the day
ready<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.789> dry<00:05:22.449> and<00:05:22.690> clean<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.199> everything

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
ready and dry and clean and everything

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:30.950 
ready and dry and clean and everything
so<00:05:24.060> so<00:05:25.060> that's<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.389> little<00:05:25.690> tricky<00:05:27.870> yeah<00:05:28.870> so<00:05:29.729> $35

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
so so that's a little tricky yeah so $35

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.379 
so so that's a little tricky yeah so $35
big<00:05:31.960> camel<00:05:32.259> 77<00:05:33.250> pretty<00:05:33.940> happy<00:05:34.330> with<00:05:34.509> them<00:05:35.159> I

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
big camel 77 pretty happy with them I

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.670 
big camel 77 pretty happy with them I
know<00:05:37.389> that<00:05:37.630> they<00:05:37.750> are<00:05:37.780> there's<00:05:38.320> I<00:05:38.500> think

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
know that they are there's I think

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.270 
know that they are there's I think
there's<00:05:38.830> another<00:05:39.070> company<00:05:39.639> that<00:05:39.669> makes<00:05:41.280> these

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
there's another company that makes these

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.010 
there's another company that makes these
gloves<00:05:42.610> that<00:05:42.849> don't<00:05:43.150> know<00:05:43.270> how<00:05:43.389> much<00:05:43.570> the<00:05:43.750> cost

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
gloves that don't know how much the cost

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.480 
gloves that don't know how much the cost
but<00:05:44.380> they<00:05:44.500> have<00:05:44.680> to<00:05:44.800> have<00:05:44.949> I<00:05:45.099> think<00:05:45.159> they<00:05:45.370> have

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
but they have to have I think they have

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.680 
but they have to have I think they have
like<00:05:45.580> four<00:05:45.880> channels<00:05:48.090> these<00:05:49.090> are<00:05:49.509> only

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
like four channels these are only

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.540 
like four channels these are only
working<00:05:49.930> on<00:05:50.199> one<00:05:50.500> channel<00:05:50.770> you<00:05:51.130> know<00:05:51.280> so

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
working on one channel you know so

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.969 
working on one channel you know so
you're<00:05:51.699> I<00:05:52.210> wish<00:05:52.599> it<00:05:52.810> were<00:05:52.900> a<00:05:52.960> big<00:05:53.229> sheet<00:05:53.710> of

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
you're I wish it were a big sheet of

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.680 
you're I wish it were a big sheet of
energy<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.550> went<00:05:54.759> straight<00:05:55.060> across<00:05:55.180> like

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
energy that went straight across like

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:57.089 
energy that went straight across like
this<00:05:55.900> from<00:05:56.229> when<00:05:56.590> I<00:05:56.620> was<00:05:56.770> working<00:05:56.979> on<00:05:57.009> my

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
this from when I was working on my

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.890 
this from when I was working on my
clients<00:05:57.460> but<00:05:57.909> it's<00:05:58.090> really<00:05:58.270> not<00:05:58.479> it's<00:05:58.539> just

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
clients but it's really not it's just

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.749 
clients but it's really not it's just
one<00:05:59.110> single<00:05:59.380> stream<00:05:59.800> of<00:05:59.979> energy<00:06:00.130> that's<00:06:00.520> going

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
one single stream of energy that's going

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.089 
one single stream of energy that's going
across<00:06:00.849> and<00:06:01.509> there's<00:06:02.110> another<00:06:02.409> guy<00:06:02.650> on<00:06:02.680> eBay

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
across and there's another guy on eBay

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.480 
across and there's another guy on eBay
that<00:06:03.280> talks<00:06:03.520> about<00:06:03.729> this<00:06:04.210> I<00:06:05.250> can't<00:06:06.250> remember

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
that talks about this I can't remember

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.459 
that talks about this I can't remember
his<00:06:06.759> name<00:06:06.789> but<00:06:07.330> it's<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.930> really<00:06:08.199> fascinating

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.469 
his name but it's a really fascinating

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.980 
his name but it's a really fascinating
video<00:06:09.099> where<00:06:09.370> he<00:06:09.460> has<00:06:09.610> an<00:06:09.759> argon<00:06:10.150> glass<00:06:10.539> glow

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
video where he has an argon glass glow

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.610 
video where he has an argon glass glow
and<00:06:11.380> he<00:06:12.099> shows<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:12.880> like<00:06:13.719> with<00:06:13.990> microcurrent

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
and he shows you like with microcurrent

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.390 
and he shows you like with microcurrent
wands<00:06:15.780> he'll<00:06:16.780> turn<00:06:16.960> them<00:06:17.139> sideways<00:06:17.409> how<00:06:18.190> much

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 
wands he'll turn them sideways how much

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.550 
wands he'll turn them sideways how much
energy<00:06:18.580> is<00:06:18.880> actually

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
energy is actually

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.200 
energy is actually
acting<00:06:19.950> from<00:06:20.190> one<00:06:20.340> point<00:06:20.550> to<00:06:20.639> the<00:06:20.730> other<00:06:20.790> and

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
acting from one point to the other and

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.210 
acting from one point to the other and
it's<00:06:21.360> it's<00:06:21.930> not<00:06:22.169> a<00:06:22.200> sheet<00:06:22.560> of<00:06:22.680> energy<00:06:23.040> like

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
it's it's not a sheet of energy like

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.430 
it's it's not a sheet of energy like
we're<00:06:23.370> hoping<00:06:23.790> it's<00:06:24.060> one<00:06:24.419> single<00:06:24.780> stream<00:06:25.260> of

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
we're hoping it's one single stream of

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.310 
we're hoping it's one single stream of
microcurrent<00:06:26.160> so<00:06:27.030> with<00:06:27.540> that<00:06:27.660> in<00:06:27.870> mind<00:06:28.080> you

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
microcurrent so with that in mind you

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.640 
microcurrent so with that in mind you
know<00:06:28.440> it<00:06:28.530> makes<00:06:28.710> it<00:06:28.889> much<00:06:29.100> easier<00:06:29.460> to<00:06:30.030> to<00:06:30.810> you

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
know it makes it much easier to to you

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.670 
know it makes it much easier to to you
know<00:06:31.680> pinpoint<00:06:32.370> where<00:06:32.820> you're<00:06:32.970> working<00:06:33.680> and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
know pinpoint where you're working and

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.800 
know pinpoint where you're working and
it<00:06:34.800> just<00:06:34.980> clicks<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:36.000> makes<00:06:36.240> it<00:06:36.480> made<00:06:36.660> more

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 
it just clicks that makes it made more

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.080 
it just clicks that makes it made more
sense<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.200> me<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:37.800> I<00:06:38.040> found<00:06:38.250> that<00:06:38.400> a<00:06:38.700> couple

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
sense to me and I found that a couple

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.270 
sense to me and I found that a couple
years<00:06:39.360> ago<00:06:39.540> when<00:06:39.690> they<00:06:39.750> first<00:06:39.960> put<00:06:40.050> it<00:06:40.260> up<00:06:40.380> Wow

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.280 
years ago when they first put it up Wow
