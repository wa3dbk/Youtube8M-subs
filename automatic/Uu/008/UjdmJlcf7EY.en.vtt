00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
is basically it in line and you get

three<00:00:54.280> shots<00:00:54.310> and<00:00:55.000> then<00:00:55.720> and<00:00:56.110> then<00:00:56.650> you<00:00:56.739> just

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
three shots and then and then you just

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.500 
three shots and then and then you just
rotate<00:00:57.280> back<00:00:57.520> so<00:00:57.700> you<00:00:57.790> got<00:00:57.910> three<00:00:58.060> shots<00:00:58.360> are

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
rotate back so you got three shots are

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.940 
rotate back so you got three shots are
out<00:00:58.660> they<00:00:58.840> rotate<00:00:59.200> to<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.350> back<00:00:59.500> line<00:00:59.710> three

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
out they rotate to the back line three

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.149 
out they rotate to the back line three
shots<00:01:00.190> rotate<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.700> the<00:01:00.730> back<00:01:00.910> one
