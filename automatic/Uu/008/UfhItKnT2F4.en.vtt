00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 title of ff like a rainbow of 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.589
 delete them 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.050
 I look for something I can do too 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.670
 do other things when you wait and no 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.790
 then have technical equipment to hand 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.250
 you sure look around too often or 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.699
 I look closely at the photo 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 finally he is back there texas four 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 months I am so happy that he is 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.590
 is back again 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.240
 He looked at 3 47 kammer tonight 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.700
 could not pick it up 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.980
 this time, exceptionally, hunting was done with 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.960
 the photo and now he was talking about has 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.350
 I have not noticed that is not 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 bad 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.829
 he is back and from now on I will 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.649
 him around me again around the clock 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.149
 have and that's wonderful 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.520
 I waited four months 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 It was like a lot of me 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 one is actually missing a smaller one 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.020
 part of when I hopped with them so looked 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.199
 but it has already made a lot of difference 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:04.140
 I grinned slightly so I look around 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.479
 and see felix yellow immediately associate 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.600
 i know this color with the musician i know 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.150
 neither but it is just this 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.710
 color fits you i see felix exactly 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.970
 occasion my view blurred 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.689
 while i have the reason for that 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.110
 think yellow is a happy color 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.430
 felix is always happy most of the time 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.460
 Of course he has his sad too 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 1000 but actual steles unbelievable 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.030
 clear man clearly yes is clearly felix 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.490
 never is he in his actions 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.000
 ideas or in his music indistinct 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.909
 or incomprehensible was that fits 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.399
 Felix also radiates tremendous warmth 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.780
 from what do you believe why with him 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.970
 always feel so good 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.670
 I let my wander further away and 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 you way and style two opposites the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.689
 but could not live without each other 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.540
 or for me the two are easy 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.890
 together as before and I will 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.829
 one of them would be very empty 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.180
 feel when the others are not there 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.869
 which color fits well with both of them 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.000
 Rick is chaotic but think logically 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.330
 sometimes confused or sour but always 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.310
 nice and nice 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.890
 but it is by no means balanced 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.770
 maybe you will fit the color red red 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.840
 is warm, red and alive 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.920
 chaotic fits like a fist on the eye 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.200
 red is always active well sleeps 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.790
 Half the day but there is always there 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.830
 with a full heart if a project 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 has and keeps it to the end 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.020
 fits through red 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.600
 Steve is probably greenish green then 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.340
 is quiet green drakes favorite color 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.790
 I think that suits me too 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.770
 Theory green is always fresh and lively 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.600
 awake steve is green 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.700
 I let my eyes back through that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.760
 office wander in the one dissolved 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.810
 solemn mood prevails I see yes 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.300
 costume blue or jako has her ideas jako 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.980
 is crazy in a positive sense 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.860
 sometimes the color blue comes to me too 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.959
 sometimes completely surreal before hunting 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.420
 his thought world or blurred 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.190
 but it's also determined by his music 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.010
 with it or jack is calm as water 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:20.489
 blue water like battery deep 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.590
 water blue water 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.840
 man i'm really good at colors too 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.130
 to assign to ring 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.440
 my gaze glides forward three steps 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.480
 and lands at foto foto all at once 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.980
 his eyes are directly in my eyes 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.780
 eyebrows shoot up and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.370
 his level terrified mouth 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.269
 is getting further and further into one 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.150
 huge grin 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:45.880
 photo white radiant innocent calm 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.910
 orange sunny and warm purple 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:52.989
 profoundly passionate red 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:56.170
 Everything he does and likes blue yellow green 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.269
 frodo is as infinite as in the rainbow 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.320
 versatile is photo like a gradient 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.060
 a rainbow a rainbow actually 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.070
 every person would have so many pages 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.560
 that you can not just assign a color 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.620
 could or with a little bad 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.630
 certain are my eyes briefly down 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.330
 also felix jacobs who were hungry like 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.700
 rainbows but that was only with me 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.650
 thoughts on frodo became clear 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.630
 made my world clearer and more colorful 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.390
 no wonder that I missed you so much 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.680
 he let me see things clearly 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.750
 and look through 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.639
 without a photo something is missing without being happy 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.289
 I do not have the same I him 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.310
 missing 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.500
 I'm going to take a few steps in his 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.210
 direction as it finally turns out 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.130
 a grinning rigid can solve and 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.900
 with fast steps towards me 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:46.300
 flo motto no I'm so crazy 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.520
 misses flea with these words he pulls 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.060
 me in a heartfelt warm hug so 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.850
 beautiful 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:57.729
 Photo as beautiful as a rainbow 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.289
 I really found this to link such 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.520
 always in the description hope it has 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.050
 you like it more behind 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.599
 above if otherwise write me 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.310
 Comments why you can not others 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.500
 Suggestions make which ff me as 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.940
 wants to read aloud next and then listen 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.940
