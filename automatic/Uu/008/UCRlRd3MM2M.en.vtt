just two good squeezes in my measurement

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.460 
just two good squeezes in my measurement
and<00:02:57.050> some<00:02:58.050> molasses<00:02:59.600> anytime<00:03:00.600> pretty<00:03:01.290> much

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
and some molasses anytime pretty much

tablespoon of cornstarch and just
