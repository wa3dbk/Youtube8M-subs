milligrams<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> caffeine<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.899> that's

milligrams of caffeine now that's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.170 
milligrams of caffeine now that's
roughly<00:00:46.379> equal<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> amount<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.640> caffeine
