00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.840
 this time it will really succeed is not one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.519
 joke 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.790
 okay i trust the big 9 in rows 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.799
 more than normal girl so watch 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.880
 I will conduct my first episode of the blog 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.279
 so with the front hand first bet 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 of the excuse my blog have been 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.599
 committed I have been around I am 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 a little pulled I just didn't travel and I have 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.590
 just thought of the content to bring you 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.809
 in the first episode of the blog 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.730
 and what is the thing I want you to do 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.420
 pass down that I want me what I want 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.710
 speak 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.059
 I was in the United States as you have 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.260
 saw I actually made this a blog 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.809
 it's not really the first episode because 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 actually I had already shot an episode 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 I was from the United States 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 I played with artists , I did it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.020
 said why not make a bet where 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.670
 I compare the Italian public with 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.440
 international audience I made myself 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.449
 account that the habits of the public that 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.760
 listen to music in the united states will be 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.789
 quite different from the Italian public 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.129
 for example, there is no first thing 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 refrain there is no applause to return 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.659
 the first refrain in the songs 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.880
 if you look at yourself or if you listen to sanremo o 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 any manifestation especially 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.619
 television at the first refrain part 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 always the applause of the public how to say 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.280
 goes finally makes us be cabbage of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
 refrain because we broke the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.030
 scales of the stanza that the public 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.009
 Italian wants the engraving wants the refrain 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.790
 in now the chorus call it what you want 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.590
 wants the melody that fired after a few 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.970
 seconds and the Italian public for 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.920
 this is forgiven even if to me 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.659
 disturbs a little that while 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.280
 above all from me the viewer me 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.450
 disturbed if that applauds me in front 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.670
 because he wants to hear the song 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.350
 ok and in the same thing the roof ea 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.869
 sanremo indeed this perhaps is also part 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.149
 of the show second thing than maybe from the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.530
 musical point of view makes little sense e 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.009
 I've never seen them see you anymore 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.899
 an application and also philosophical to the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.329
 real musical life for example the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.240
 song, best wishes to you, seeing that 130 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.759
 you will be the same all over the world yes 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 it's the same but now I'll let you hear the two 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.030
 versions of best wishes to you first 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.300
 the Italian one 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.890
 and then let's call it international 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.480
 however with the third always Italian 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.980
 here you just have to notice a slight one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.000
 Unlike the arrangements we do 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:26.600
 wishes to mirko even if one 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:35.150
 birthday at 20 for the agreements 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:38.180
 best wishes to you, best wishes to you 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.180
 best wishes 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.180
 mirko 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.510
 to you 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:53.410
 and so far you Italic guitarists 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.160
 indeed guitar okay nothing no 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.019
 mistaken 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.989
 torchlight is fine you have the voice rock e 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.849
 ai va well i do it in version 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.590
 American for what I heard 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:04.590
 the text is always Italian 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:15.560
 best wishes to you, best wishes to you 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.090
 best wishes 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.090
 a mirko 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.130
 best wishes 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.130
 fiat 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:35.620
 you felt the difference, not the pause 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:39.370
 the mirko company is the raspberry 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.269
 best wishes to you 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.150
 even there I found an explanation 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:47.049
 almost almost anthropological philology exists 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.579
 the Italian or wants to sing it all in one 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.170
 breath all the way because he wants to go 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.090
 to eat the honey cake scrub 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.500
 nothing of the song's music 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.290
 the song is just for kids 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.940
 to push the American's candles 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.400
 instead it takes a little more blues than the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.709
 take over some of their vibration 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:10.500
 of sol.co we wait and let's take a break 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.500
 couple of many quarters 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.700
 I noticed it because he did one 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:20.240
 beautiful figure of shit no to a birthday 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.070
 I gave myself an explanation which i 

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.000
 our desserts are hearts they make 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.040
 shit so remember if you want to do 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.820
 a bit of a remix and the song the fight 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.850
 agony 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.100
 take a break third difference is 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.630
 this is the last one but I put it 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.850
 last but not least because 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.250
 I had to put it first but the third 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.610
 difference is like the Italian public 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.080
 Helium's bassist beats of time 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.420
 and the strained stories has already made a video 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.800
 I am therefore breathing in his video 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.420
 we need to pass this down 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.420
 habit the Italian public continues 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.330
 to beat the time on the 1 and on three not 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.010
 beat time on the moons on 3 and you me 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.720
 say what it means to beat time 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.670
 then on I took at a iii 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.400
 song that everyone here knows about 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.170
 you who have a really explicit time 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:12.500

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:14.270
 get lucky daft punk feel the time the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.370
 Italian public where time will beat 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.370
 the Italian public but among the time here 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:33.260

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.090
 beaten not only on get lucky but 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:53.870

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.310
 on 2 out of 4 on all the music is not 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.720
 hard enough to just think look 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.850
 the drummer the snare drum when 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.380
 beat the vehicle with which a hand 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.960
 left you beat the time there 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.960
 so I recommend scouts I turn to

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.760
 Monday 3 that beats the time on 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.670

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:31.780
 of Italy especially beat the time 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:34.490
