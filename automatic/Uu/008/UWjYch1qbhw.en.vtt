 Y 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.970
 the action 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.619
 i 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.619
 what 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.079

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 hello how are you today I'm going to show you 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.420
 how to make a super easy pendant and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 Many people asked me what I do with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.090
 the newspaper spheres that 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.060
 I taught to do as you see here I have 5 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.060
 spheres or balls in newspaper 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.530
 Now I'm going to drill the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.260
 another side for those who did not see the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.810
 video how to make these balls I 'm going 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.380
 to leave the link of how to do it here 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380
 above 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:24.550
 Here I have the balls that I am going to use and 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.550
 also some small tubes of newspaper 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.380
 Now I'm going to crush my 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.380
 newspaper paper tubes 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:49.909
 and so I'm going to start rolling in 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.909
 fiber 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 let's keep rolling trying to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.380
 that is well neat 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.340
 here I have all my pieces finished 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.960
 now I'm going to grab my acrylic and I'm going to 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.710
 paint all the pieces I chose a red 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.710
 oxide 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:46.770
 here I have everything painted left to dry and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.190
 I see if you need to give two hands of 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.190
 painting 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.410
 once dry varnish masters with varnish in 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.410
 aerosol 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.240
 When the varnish is still wet 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.370
 we put golden or silver glitter 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.370
 that depends on the taste of each one 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.580
 Here I have them dry and with the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.580
 purpurin 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.870
 I had a cord cited black so I 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.319
 liked to arm with this cord the 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.319
 pendant 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.970
 and so I start to put my pendant together 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.750
 here not even a part 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:24.079
 now I 'm going to put the cord a bit 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.079
 longer 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:39.170
 and so I keep putting my pendant together I do not know if 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.750
 see that I made a few knots to the cord is 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.260
 so that the next little balls do not 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.260
 run 

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:51.789
 Here I have it finished it's very 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:56.639
 cute is super easy and fast to make and 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.639
