00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.519
 hello on this beautiful autumn day 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.850
 Welcome to our 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:57.339
 youtube-channel what I give you today 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:00.399
 we would like to introduce our jpg 60 after 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.670
 15 years nordschleife and all 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.950
 I have my own car tunings again 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.890
 found old love and a corrado 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.720
 according to all possible rules of art 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.080
 ready 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.470
 I always read a lot of what you can on the internet 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.569
 Regarding braking engine what do I know 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.460
 interior design makes all possible 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.590
 and there are thousands of different ones 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.670
 paths that lead up the routes the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.310
 we elected 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.720
 I would like to have all installed here 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.720
 I introduce in detail and also 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.890
 a little bit as an instruction that everyone 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.569
 this for his own project 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.299
 can involve so much as 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.399
 First I go around shows you 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.490
 Something I ever planned here 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.619
 have realized and is important to 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.380
 know that everything I have at this 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.360
 Has installed vehicle only one 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.710
 sense and purpose and that is performance 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.329
 that means optical things or I know 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.979
 not what you can do with tuning 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.710
 it's also a lot about special beauty 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.539
 and who can write something and I know 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.179
 not what that is for me everything 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.959
 irrelevant to me is right that the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:17.859
 best possible performance is possible yes 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:20.140
 so roughly koran 460 90s model in 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.400
 black course corresponding 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.090
 Tires and rims for the 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.489
 appropriate 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.760
 accordingly had the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.700
 fender 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.440
 be changed in the front I think now 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.200
 quite good to see the whole bumper 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.849
 opened up we needed as possible 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.440
 a lot of air is a big intercooler 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.410
 we'll go into detail about that in a moment 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.879
 on it an oil cooler of the water cooler 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.190
 I also want to have used and 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.530
 such stories that is to the front 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.709
 moser course including gets even 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.690
 To brake system you can already see Porsche 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.580
 everything big in green is everything 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:56.989
 taste thing the green has stopped 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:01.640
 thought good looks otherwise 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:03.079
 relatively original in the interior is the 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.010
 whole accordingly Spartan 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.269
 However, it is equipped that way 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.680
 I quite with the vehicle too 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.660
 wants to go in the morning and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.400
 perhaps one sets out to work 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.810
 or even round for fun in it wants 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 accordingly, that's not all 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.790
 been taken out 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.170
 to see the steering wheel is the seats 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.390
 comply with a decent 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.790
 roll bar on the cage I have 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.650
 waived because the one and get out 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.850
 then only gets more complicated 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.850
 a bit of musician still built 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.610
 no
