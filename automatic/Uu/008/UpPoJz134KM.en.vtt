00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 Professionals and welcome to unboxing 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.670
 the razer naga 2014 yes now like 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 be some 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.630
 that's what warmed up that is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.190
 that's what we're going to get 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 We'll just pack it 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.590
 out and will see what's in the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 packaging content that is for 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 one of course the mouse and you will 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.630
 see or the cellar will see 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:34.380
 she looks a little different there is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.140
 Of course, a lot of paperwork such as 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:45.120
 example beautiful racer sticker 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:52.190
 then as usual from the ceo a nice 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.800
 little book and the quick start guide like this 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 your side and let's come to the house 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.550
 and you see it looks quite different 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.250
 out than the razer naga 2012 we yes 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.659
 even in the test they had one 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.659
 I would like to say something completely different 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.780
 replaceable side panels we have 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.759
 not here anymore so they go here 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.680
 no longer off for it is relatively very 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:23.460
 wide that was also with the razer naga 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.439
 2012 the part that really works best for me 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 I liked the three of them 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.159
 you could be so stuck to it and 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.860
 somehow they have listened to me 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.630
 I believe and have implemented this 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.939
 for the 2014 version 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.640
 There is a really nice here 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.000
 yes handy rubber for the little one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.170
 finger and I have to say she feels 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.649
 extremely good 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.390
 that is such a rough plastic and on the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.210
 top it tackle rough again 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.280
 it almost feels like 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 I would like to say sandpaper but that 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.329
 is not a negative but it feels 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.040
 I have to be very happy 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.770
 say so you really have the mouse 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.829
 really firm in hand what is there 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 even more or what is still neustadt only 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.920
 the shape here it is these twelve mmo 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.470
 grope 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.560
 now mechanical is yes that is one 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:20.050
 have great novelty mechanical buttons 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.260
 now also in the mice 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.520
 held 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.420
 first now at the razer naga 2014 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.459
 the mausrad is not new yet 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.950
 just before back and clickable is but 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.560
 also tiltable that I find very good who 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.140
 often with photoshop or others 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 editing program works for that's it 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.380
 Definitely a nice extension 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 the razer camp otherwise she sees 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.380
 Of course a bit different in the front, too 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.819
 out has a bit of the style of 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:55.489
 the euro bus is otherwise available 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.580
 Of course a little more than two 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.580
 meter long usb cable what that is 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:07.459
 not so stiff but really 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:10.250
 very not so stiff as you would otherwise 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.040
 actually knows very well about his 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.480
 end a gold plated usb plug itself 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.190
 and we exclude just once and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.890
 will see what's going on there 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.239
 nice lights when you see it 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.090
 and that's the mausrad then 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:34.100
 the pulsating razer logo here at the back 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:38.720
 and of course the 12 mm optimized 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:42.260
 keys as well as fraser call on the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:47.600
 bottom we have then the eight 1200th 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:52.609
 dpi resolving mouse sensor and 3 remains 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.920
 it so it should actually be now 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:56.500
 have been 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.970
 otherwise I would simply 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.459
 further refer to the review the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.720
 Of course, it will come 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.160
