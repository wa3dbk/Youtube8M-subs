00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
favorite player he's got such an amazing

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.020 
favorite player he's got such an amazing
close<00:02:38.270> control<00:02:38.660> dribbling<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.920> know<00:02:40.070> first

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
close control dribbling you know first

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.550 
close control dribbling you know first
touch<00:02:41.270> everything<00:02:41.690> about<00:02:42.050> him<00:02:42.230> there<00:02:42.410> is

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
touch everything about him there is

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560 
touch everything about him there is
perfect<00:02:42.770> he's<00:02:43.190> actually<00:02:43.460> fairly<00:02:44.030> decent

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
perfect he's actually fairly decent

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.570 
perfect he's actually fairly decent
defensively<00:02:45.020> I<00:02:45.110> think<00:02:45.380> his<00:02:45.560> defending<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.430> one

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
defensively I think his defending is one

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.790 
defensively I think his defending is one
of<00:02:46.670> his<00:02:46.760> worst<00:02:46.940> stats<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:47.660> still<00:02:47.900> above

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
of his worst stats and it's still above

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.410 
of his worst stats and it's still above
70<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.280> think<00:02:49.520> it<00:02:49.610> could<00:02:49.730> be<00:02:49.820> over<00:02:49.850> his<00:02:50.030> head<00:02:50.120> in

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
70 I think it could be over his head in

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.850 
70 I think it could be over his head in
or<00:02:50.540> his<00:02:50.630> defending<00:02:51.050> which<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.350> worse<00:02:51.620> than

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
or his defending which is worse than

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.280 
or his defending which is worse than
it's<00:02:52.100> a<00:02:52.160> book<00:02:52.310> celery<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.820> was<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:53.780> fog<00:02:54.020> card

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.530 
it's a book celery I was in fog card
there<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> think<00:02:55.370> he's<00:02:55.520> heading<00:02:56.000> with<00:02:56.150> 68

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
there I think he's heading with 68
