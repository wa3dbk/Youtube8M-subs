00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:18.650
 and then people are the blog of daniel esse 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.540
 video will be fast because the chapter 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.820
 It was really magical that more people are going 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:28.100
 speak here is clear about the cavendish 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.810
 on the tub of the future to say that 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.980
 this video will really be fast and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.410
 Let's start this video right away because I 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.550
 I want to confirm that I am certain that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.040
 it will be fast 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.580
 now the first thing that got what 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.710
 strange in the speech in that narrator is that 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.559
 He says someone is getting up. 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.150
 So I was thinking about the area he spoke to. 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.320
 at the end of the previous chapter 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.570
 I was wondering how someone who 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.600
 what happened is that someone has a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.150
 I'm going to suicide. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.549
 make the pokÃ©mon explode and 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.840
 destroyed everyone around then 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.710
 I was thinking of something like that 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.420
 suicide technique and there that person in the case 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.479
 who would have this technique would have 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:19.370
 bear the very damage it would cause 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.260
 yourself and stand up until I found this 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.310
 that even I thought it would not make sense 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.160
 if it really happened and the other 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.880
 option was that when he says someone is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.960
 getting up I was just thinking 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.010
 in something similar what really 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.990
 It happened 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.350
 What really happened placid 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.020
 cavendish that someone would have someone 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.620
 show a Rotterdam tennis shoe and haia 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.300
 I got out of destroying everybody and the cardigan. 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.130
 with your speed with your rock of 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.400
 note that it has possibly by 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.980
 that I stay said she really has 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.040
 she could have foreseen the diverted 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.330
 blow that turns and deviated and still 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.470
 have taken a hit 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.420
 only that the blow was not fatal like that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:14.030
 she faints that no one died nor op 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:15.349
 but then it would have to be the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.310
 person who was standing up clearly 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.290
 would be a cardigan 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.150
 only there would be someone else standing 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.319
 still the person who caused this 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.319
 everything is 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.620
 in the end it turned out that it was something stage 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.280
 Almost choose further that but 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.580
 was not 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.100
 and another thing the people were posting 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:44.220
 very who is this middles such that he 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.670
 was the father of the but the way he lost 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.680
 so it is unlikely that it is not the 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.450
 father 's true pain as I was 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.430
 posting even that being that he was 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.500
 it is not because the face is identical 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.140
 other three pictures in last review 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.480
 which was identical then I got the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.670
 if here the caracas can only be 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.760
 from that guy it turned out that it was not 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.810
 that shit shit that such a post early 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:16.290
 but nobody expected anyone expected 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.570
 exactly what happened 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.470
 nobody expected the car to be 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.970
 in the car in which he when sleeping active 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.310
 one doubt another person 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.920
 personality that leaves twice 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 stronger and than with killer instinct 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.500
 coming out adv 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.230
 everybody admin nobody 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.240
 I was waiting for nobody, nobody, nobody 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.940
 nobody said anything about this nobody 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:46.790
 I hope this is really one more time 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.790
 surprised us with that from there and 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:53.400
 earned is precisely because money said 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.070
 When she fought against the next luf is 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.170
 I know I probably do not have it 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.590
 so it is important not to always talk 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.230
 stronger is the one who wins a fight and was 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.560
 exactly what happened to the trash car 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:13.350
 even very likely the strongest 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.180
 that the cardigan has just won 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.580
 huh 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.760
 ended up winning the battle there in the 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.430
 met but does not mean that she 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.010
 defeated the cavendish that she really 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:30.380
 did not defeat in the final and left as 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.669
 winner beauty just a detail so ae 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.610
 Another thing that is about this bid is 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.719
 precisely that the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:42.229
 under him said that the ostentatious 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:44.750
 mouth to fish tail now I want 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:48.610
 forget the name of a long duo 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.599
 his personality the mouth 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:55.520
 anyway it does not matter now that he stays 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.419
 twice as strong I was asked 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.060
 if this guy was already so powerful he could not 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.009
 because you actually stopped your head in the 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.979
 so he was able to suspend the 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.870
 world day only with the sword in the 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.360
 sword without being able to stop the head in the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.849
 and virtually suspend the body. 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.039
 john in the air just hold on the sword so 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.930
 with the sword 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.889
 so they came as well 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.810
 impressive 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.409
 Only now and I've been thinking like this. 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.180
 powder 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:30.740
 I want to leave it open like this 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.810
 You'll argue that he's a guy. 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.569
 he destroyed everyone in a matter of 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:40.520
 seconds practically everyone falls 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:42.949
 one after another so maybe level 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.750
 serum level that I may have even up to 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:50.150
 Flemish, I do not know where he is. 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:53.740
 The usual time does not know but it even reminded me. 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.440
 a little hard that these events 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.740
 or not until actually, but it's a 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:04.550
 somewhat similar right not the cause but the 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.639
 Consequently, let us say that in the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.779
 end the guy leaves cutting everybody 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:13.069
 crazy 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:16.550
 so that everyone from the 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:19.819
 curu he had the power if it is right 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.800
 which was similar to the serum that was said 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.240
 from here it's very much the same 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.169
 the others being that he had not 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.400
 control, therefore, allied and 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:31.189
 friend was not even there 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.740
 in case of cavendish he sleeps creates a 

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:36.169
 active person a double personality and 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:41.120
 get defeated on a site brings a whole 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:43.399
 world as well as relationship curve and is 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.790
 basically this very fast video should 

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:49.660
 have pleased or ten minutes with certainty 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.830
 even for you it will be good until 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.280
 balance things because the video 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:58.730
 past was a bad video that already made 34 for 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.800
 35 minutes so enjoy it here I go 

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.200
 leave this video on the screen if you 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.090
 I want to watch, I'm going to advertise 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.070
 I'm doing video advertising. 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.510
 person arises because many people 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.330
 many people do this 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.580
 then in this case here watch this 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.460
 video watch this video even because 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.670
 did some work to organize the 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.500
 ideas do not schedule to see without doing are 

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.200
 almost nothing but putting the image in the 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:27.380
 screen on the part of the 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.380
 organization of ideas then confirm 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:34.940
 It's really cool, it's really cool, and it's 

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.440
 This you do not know the channel let 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.420
 your comment on the chapter and 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.710
 check out a video that will be on the screen 

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.710
 in shows so far
