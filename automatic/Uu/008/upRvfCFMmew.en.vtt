is coming in the mail and then I could

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.910 
is coming in the mail and then I could
also<00:00:19.920> use<00:00:20.070> some<00:00:20.340> dual<00:00:20.490> lands<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.680> some<00:00:22.680> shock

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
also use some dual lands and some shock

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.960 
also use some dual lands and some shock
lands<00:00:23.369> um<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:26.480> have<00:00:27.480> 10<00:00:27.750> just<00:00:28.220> basic<00:00:29.220> islands

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
lands um so I have 10 just basic islands

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.959 
lands um so I have 10 just basic islands
10<00:00:30.210> basic<00:00:30.599> swamps<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.090> let's<00:00:33.840> get<00:00:34.050> started

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
10 basic swamps and let's get started

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.880 
10 basic swamps and let's get started
first<00:00:35.969> card<00:00:36.329> traumatized<00:00:36.960> target<00:00:37.710> player

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
first card traumatized target player

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
first card traumatized target player
puts<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.280> top<00:00:38.460> half<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.910> his<00:00:39.030> or<00:00:39.180> her<00:00:39.210> library

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
puts the top half of his or her library

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
puts the top half of his or her library
rounded<00:00:40.140> down<00:00:40.260> into<00:00:40.680> his<00:00:41.010> or<00:00:41.219> her<00:00:41.309> graveyard

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
rounded down into his or her graveyard

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.049 
rounded down into his or her graveyard
so<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.440> main<00:00:43.620> combo<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.309> with

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so this is the main combo this with

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.979 
so this is the main combo this with
haunting<00:00:45.750> echoes<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:47.510> have<00:00:48.510> four<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.840> these

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
haunting echoes I have four of these

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
haunting echoes I have four of these
because<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:50.039> look<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.059> as<00:00:51.270> soon

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because I I look to get this off as soon

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.299 
because I I look to get this off as soon
as<00:00:51.539> possible<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> mill<00:00:53.010> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
as possible so that it can mill the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.819 
as possible so that it can mill the
greatest<00:00:53.640> amount<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> cards<00:00:54.530> without<00:00:55.530> waiting

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
greatest amount of cards without waiting

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.939 
greatest amount of cards without waiting
too<00:00:56.039> long<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.710> those<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.410> haunting

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
too long so for those and then haunting

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.520 
too long so for those and then haunting
echoes<00:01:02.239> exile<00:01:03.239> all<00:01:03.510> cards<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.110> target

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
echoes exile all cards from target

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
echoes exile all cards from target
player's<00:01:04.739> graveyard<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.640> other<00:01:06.030> than

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
player's graveyard are the other than

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.990 
player's graveyard are the other than
non-basic<00:01:06.689> lands<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.920> each<00:01:08.040> card<00:01:08.310> exile<00:01:08.760> this

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
non-basic lands for each card exile this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
non-basic lands for each card exile this
way<00:01:09.180> search<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.869> players<00:01:10.110> library<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.920> all

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
way search that players library for all

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
way search that players library for all
cards<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> same<00:01:12.030> name<00:01:12.270> as<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.510> card

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
cards with the same name as that card

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.469 
cards with the same name as that card
and<00:01:13.200> exiled<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.850> they<00:01:15.000> offer<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and exiled them then they offer the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.320 
and exiled them then they offer the
library<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> look<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.610> do<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.909> after

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
library so I look to do this after

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.190 
library so I look to do this after
traumatized<00:01:19.520> as<00:01:20.520> most<00:01:20.759> people<00:01:21.060> run<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:22.080> know

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
traumatized as most people run you know

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.020 
traumatized as most people run you know
three<00:01:22.530> or<00:01:22.560> four<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:22.860> each<00:01:23.009> card<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.820> deck

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
three or four of each card in their deck

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.340 
three or four of each card in their deck
so<00:01:24.900> after<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.229> mill<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.040> half<00:01:26.400> their<00:01:26.670> library<00:01:27.350> get

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so after I mill a half their library get

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
so after I mill a half their library get
this<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:29.390> mill<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.479> down<00:01:30.630> even<00:01:30.810> more<00:01:32.270> mine

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this out mill it down even more mine

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.560 
this out mill it down even more mine

graveyard so that's pretty sick two of

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.050 
graveyard so that's pretty sick two of
those<00:01:51.470> memory<00:01:52.470> erosion<00:01:53.100> whenever<00:01:53.939> an

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
those memory erosion whenever an

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
those memory erosion whenever an

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the top two cards of his or her library

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.219 
the top two cards of his or her library
into<00:01:58.500> his<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:58.770> her<00:01:58.860> graveyard<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:00.450> even<00:02:01.049> if<00:02:01.140> I

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
into his or her graveyard so even if I

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.530 
into his or her graveyard so even if I
counter<00:02:01.740> whatever<00:02:02.670> card<00:02:03.060> they're<00:02:03.270> playing

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
counter whatever card they're playing

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.649 
counter whatever card they're playing
they<00:02:04.170> still<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.710> mill<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.509> they

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
they still have to mill to because they

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.669 
they still have to mill to because they
casted<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.290> spell<00:02:07.590> he<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.340> got<00:02:08.489> countered

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
casted the spell he just got countered

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.009 
casted the spell he just got countered
so<00:02:10.679> two<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.890> those

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
so two of those

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.570 
so two of those
