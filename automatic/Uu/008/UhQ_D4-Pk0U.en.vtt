also some bonus noises but getting them

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
also some bonus noises but getting them
is<00:01:29.009> pretty<00:01:29.340> convoluted<00:01:30.240> hit<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.020> button

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
is pretty convoluted hit the button

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
twice and then hold it down to get a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.149 
twice and then hold it down to get a
laser<00:01:33.869> noise

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.850 

next<00:01:41.159> hit<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> button<00:01:41.939> three<00:01:42.450> times<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.229> Ben

hold<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.880> get<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.210> glitchy<00:01:45.689> sound<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:53.030> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
hold it down to get a glitchy sound I do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210 
hold it down to get a glitchy sound I do
like<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> bonus<00:01:54.869> noises<00:01:55.470> especially<00:01:56.070> the

like the bonus noises especially the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.460

malfunctioning one which is heard often

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.590 
malfunctioning one which is heard often
in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.680> show<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.610> there<00:01:59.759> wasn't<00:02:00.180> an<00:02:00.270> easier

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
in the show but there wasn't an easier

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.050 
in the show but there wasn't an easier
way<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.810> trigger<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.369> upside<00:02:02.700> I<00:02:03.000> do

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
way to trigger them on the upside I do

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.539 
way to trigger them on the upside I do
like<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.869> LED<00:02:04.409> lights<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.920> response<00:02:05.310> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
like how the LED lights in response to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.430 
like how the LED lights in response to
the<00:02:05.670> pitch<00:02:05.940> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> sound<00:02:06.360> effects<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.229> good

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the pitch of the sound effects so good

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.279 
the pitch of the sound effects so good

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.080 
the first place now the bad news aside
from<00:02:48.900> that<00:02:48.959> it's<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.739> same<00:02:50.010> toy<00:02:50.370> made<00:02:50.760> four

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
from that it's the same toy made four

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.560 
from that it's the same toy made four
years<00:02:51.120> ago<00:02:51.780> which<00:02:52.230> was<00:02:52.260> very<00:02:52.920> problematic<00:02:53.570> the

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
years ago which was very problematic the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.509 
years ago which was very problematic the
extra<00:02:54.900> sound<00:02:55.170> effects<00:02:55.500> were<00:02:55.709> known<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.040> burn

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
extra sound effects were known to burn

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.940 
extra sound effects were known to burn
out<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.970> sound<00:02:57.239> chip<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> toy<00:02:57.959> probably

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
out the sound chip in the toy probably

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.470 
out the sound chip in the toy probably
from<00:02:59.130> how<00:02:59.310> many<00:02:59.459> times<00:02:59.730> he<00:02:59.910> had<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> hit<00:03:00.359> the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
from how many times he had to hit the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440 
from how many times he had to hit the
button<00:03:00.810> also<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.859> spring<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.730> powerful

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
button also the spring is so powerful

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.900 
button also the spring is so powerful
releasing<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.440> wears<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.100> latch<00:03:05.400> holding

releasing it wears on the latch holding

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.330 
releasing it wears on the latch holding
in<00:03:06.030> place<00:03:06.060> meaning<00:03:06.959> eventually<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.799> won't<00:03:08.130> be

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
in place meaning eventually it won't be

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.449 
in place meaning eventually it won't be
able<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.730> retract<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:10.320> was<00:03:10.590> going<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> admit

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
able to retract and I was going to admit

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.520 
able to retract and I was going to admit
that<00:03:11.670> only<00:03:11.910> time<00:03:12.359> would<00:03:12.630> tell<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.260> gold

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that only time would tell if the gold

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.080 
that only time would tell if the gold
plastic<00:03:13.829> was<00:03:14.280> actually<00:03:14.640> going<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.940> be

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
plastic was actually going to be

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.979 
plastic was actually going to be
problematic<00:03:15.739> however<00:03:16.739> as<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:18.390> was<00:03:18.600> writing

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
problematic however as I was writing

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.050 
problematic however as I was writing
this<00:03:19.290> script<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.070> am<00:03:20.280> reading<00:03:20.640> right<00:03:21.030> now

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
this script that I am reading right now

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.099 
this script that I am reading right now
I<00:03:21.690> looked<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.500> screwdriver<00:03:22.980> over<00:03:23.430> again<00:03:23.760> and

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
I looked the screwdriver over again and

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.190 
I looked the screwdriver over again and
found<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.940> crack<00:03:27.299> was<00:03:27.540> caused<00:03:27.840> from

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
found this this crack was caused from

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.470 
found this this crack was caused from
twisting<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.799> toy<00:03:28.980> open<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.640> examine<00:03:30.239> that's

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
twisting the toy open to examine that's

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.420 
twisting the toy open to examine that's
how<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.840> get<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> battery<00:03:31.650> compartment<00:03:31.709> I

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
how you get to the battery compartment I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.930 
how you get to the battery compartment I
did<00:03:33.060> that<00:03:33.239> maybe<00:03:34.079> four<00:03:34.890> times<00:03:35.220> for<00:03:35.760> this

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
did that maybe four times for this

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.559 
did that maybe four times for this
review<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:37.200> damage<00:03:37.799> is<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.370> result<00:03:38.569> so

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
review and this damage is the result so

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.509 
review and this damage is the result so
between<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.079> fragile<00:03:40.410> plastic<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
between the fragile plastic and the

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.340 
between the fragile plastic and the
powerful<00:03:41.910> Springfield<00:03:42.569> this<00:03:42.900> might<00:03:43.140> be<00:03:43.319> a

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
powerful Springfield this might be a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.039 
powerful Springfield this might be a
shrapnel<00:03:43.799> launcher<00:03:44.549> one<00:03:44.760> day<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.390> an

issues they knew about four years ago

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.970

which<00:04:13.060> means<00:04:13.390> the<00:04:13.690> price<00:04:13.959> is<00:04:14.170> an<00:04:14.290> even<00:04:14.590> bigger
