we're<00:04:28.040> actually<00:04:28.190> in<00:04:28.610> now<00:04:28.850> would<00:04:29.180> have<00:04:29.300> held

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
we're actually in now would have held

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.390 
we're actually in now would have held
that<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:30.560> Bell<00:04:30.770> look<00:04:30.979> they<00:04:31.070> were<00:04:31.160> talking

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
that the Bell look they were talking

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.760 
that the Bell look they were talking
about<00:04:31.580> it<00:04:32.270> was<00:04:32.360> going<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.630> be<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> five<00:04:33.139> turn<00:04:33.620> and

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
about it was going to be a five turn and

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.490 
about it was going to be a five turn and
wait<00:04:33.919> bell<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:35.240> it<00:04:35.540> although<00:04:35.750> would<00:04:36.110> have<00:04:36.229> held

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
wait bell so it although would have held

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.800 
wait bell so it although would have held
about<00:04:36.889> there<00:04:37.250> was<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.370> lot<00:04:37.460> more<00:04:37.760> mechanism<00:04:38.660> to

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
about there was a lot more mechanism to

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.870 
about there was a lot more mechanism to
go<00:04:38.960> with<00:04:39.199> it<00:04:39.350> and<00:04:39.530> for<00:04:40.220> one<00:04:40.370> reason<00:04:40.580> or<00:04:40.820> another

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
go with it and for one reason or another

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.850 
go with it and for one reason or another
has<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.330> say<00:04:41.660> they<00:04:41.870> decided<00:04:42.410> against<00:04:42.710> that

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
has to say they decided against that

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.890 
has to say they decided against that
because<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.850> would<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.389> would<00:04:44.539> have<00:04:44.660> caused

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
because it would it would have caused

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.409 
because it would it would have caused
problems<00:04:45.520> and<00:04:46.520> they<00:04:46.760> went<00:04:46.970> to<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.210> with

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
problems and they went to it with

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.140 
problems and they went to it with
all-electronic<00:04:48.199> which<00:04:48.979> was<00:04:49.160> like<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.610> mean

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
all-electronic which was like I mean

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.029 
all-electronic which was like I mean
because<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.690> was<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.930> first<00:04:50.960> electric<00:04:51.770> clock

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
because it was the first electric clock

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.340 
because it was the first electric clock
in<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.250> country<00:04:52.639> anyway<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.750> stands<00:04:54.139> to

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
in the country anyway it stands to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.080 
in the country anyway it stands to
reason<00:04:54.380> that<00:04:54.770> yeah<00:04:55.100> we<00:04:55.190> could<00:04:55.460> go<00:04:55.610> electronic

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
reason that yeah we could go electronic

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.409 
reason that yeah we could go electronic
it's<00:04:56.840> a<00:04:56.960> hammer<00:04:57.199> action<00:04:57.470> on<00:04:57.979> a<00:04:58.070> like<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.030> piano

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
it's a hammer action on a like a piano

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.340 
it's a hammer action on a like a piano
wire<00:04:59.860> with<00:05:00.860> a<00:05:00.889> pickle<00:05:01.340> at<00:05:01.850> the<00:05:01.970> end<00:05:02.120> which<00:05:03.110> then

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
wire with a pickle at the end which then

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.400 
wire with a pickle at the end which then
transports<00:05:04.070> up<00:05:04.220> to<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.729> roof<00:05:04.990> big<00:05:05.990> speakers

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
transports up to the roof big speakers

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.740 
transports up to the roof big speakers
on<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.680> roof<00:05:06.889> which<00:05:07.370> then<00:05:07.699> sounds<00:05:08.419> like<00:05:08.600> the

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
on the roof which then sounds like the

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.980 
on the roof which then sounds like the
bells<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.889> first<00:05:10.280> actually<00:05:10.760> struck<00:05:11.210> on<00:05:11.930> the
