00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello everyone with you Vlad and you looked 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.799
 on I would creep more precisely with you not I as a matter of fact 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.500
 my hands with the lightning conductor hands 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.070
 you guys are already too zadolbali these forever 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.619
 tearing wires that bend here 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.310
 interrupted and generally pretty close 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.260
 Tili uncomfortable standard wire from 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.730
 apple, in principle, it can connect 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.630
 them just sync your 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.869
 devices with a computer but it is not very 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.649
 convenient to talk about today more convenient 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.770
 wire from belkin and i think this wire 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:47.100
 Just much steeper standard Well 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:48.899
 chased actually standard wire 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 ship in a bit tomorrow at 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.850
 condition and i have one such 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.860
 the wire that used it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.239
 there is straight close to the computer but today 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 it will be about such a wonderful 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.309
 cameleon is designed as a cable from old 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 landline phones that is it so 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.930
 drawn out or is it convenient than that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 it takes a little space for example you need 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.549
 for the phone you can stretch it like this 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.640
 very very comfortable let's see 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.710
 how does it work activities but also 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.409
 we just turn off the usual loping 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 Belkin certified and link where I 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.950
 ordered leave in the description to sat not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.350
 I know he really is not original 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.330
 but I think that the original box is me 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.200
 immediately threw in there just lay pro and everything 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.110
 and stick beat become one-sided like 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.820
 On newer cables, well, that's all these 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.800
 places are small and like this 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.950
 stretch 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.900
 and here I have it in my monitor 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.910
 in fact much more convenient that is with the monitor 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.280
 to synchronize with the computer I 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.980
 as namely through this new one 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.720
 convenient to wire at night black shorter 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.810
 ail some advantages buy here such 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.310
 wires and i plan to replace all my 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.820
 wires are like that 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.970
 and also shake our pins too 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.980
 so these wires basically go off well 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.770
 and in exactly one week I will tell you how 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.470
 improve and here are these wires if they have 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.770
 you are washed here it happens it breaks 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.290
 are torn by the present case and I will tell you how I am 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.590
