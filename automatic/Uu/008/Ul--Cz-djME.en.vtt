 guava orange jaric 10 two ways to be able to do it once by tracking the skin 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.600
 of the orange on one side preferably very thin to prevent 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.410
 the white part is based and the shell inside this is the preparation 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.730
 then inside an app they have let it have edges and to retain the juice 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.699
 we are rotating the skin of the orange and we leave all the white part of the skin 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.920
 I believe in the same orange exactly josé this way the donkey giving joly of 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.670
 done this way the bartolo we will prevent the transfer of these 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.120
 thin enough to remove only the skin what the bitterness 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.290
 efe practically annulled already with that we already have a very important point in 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.250
 the combat we could say the amarok and now tremendous fight that will oppose the 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.800
 reduce at sea the guard exactly I do not know what we're going to be 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.059

 another way is with the knife with the bushido master removing the earth from the 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.610
 orange 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.480
 always trying to leave the white part 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.020
 in the orange but with the knife we ​​agree that it is a little more 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.039
 complicated 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.840
 and surely to go more straight 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.940
 p this part holland of the orange 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.240
 then the shell is going to be a bit more bitter surely 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.350
 preparation and we do it this way we have not already invented a fighter 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.880
 orange the automatic expense of the automatic potato viti 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.439
 of orange and not those that open the orange otherwise the mare can remove it 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.180
 right we do it of how should Kameni be thrown to the touch 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.490
 exactly vueling and a cat candle that we have the lacquer caritas that we got 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.840
 let's say with the knife what we are going to do is cut the headquarters in this way 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020
 He finished cutting very fine inks 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.190
 and thin 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.440
 of him here he to go preparing then it is jam that we are going to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 do 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.160
 Float as they say, cutting 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.630
 there is practically no receipt of the white part the ararat on the skin 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.459
 but he is a great fighter a great ice cream fighter of orange hahahahahaha 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.330
 the way 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.050
 well with that we have it there then part of our preparation but what 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.720
 we are going to do the orange and in charge of the dra we will use 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.700
 as well 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.160
 and for that we're going to need to remove 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.300
 all the white part of the orange in this way we are removing with the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.690
 knife because we do not want burning percent old waste if our 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.340
 oranges to just avoid this bitter part this bitter taste of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.210
 that many are enemies and many do not mind when something will please him 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.310

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.310
 same happens with the legend that the tsje tal perez has qualified the regions 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.489
 state ashton and that's what I like been flying about tastes there's nothing or 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.270
 also with the lizard psychology to please third parties not to eat it because 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.280
 it's very bitter but it came to others it really seems like a version 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.050
 digital 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.820
 extraordinary bonilla we have our orange 0 let's see also we are going to 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.640
 dedicate that will give the divisions of the orange within the preparation 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.310
 then we go out low cycles 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.250
 in this way it will be called jomaa vivo changes habitué prize of monaco 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.329
 madrid we have exactly got it down to vigo and in this way all the peace 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.299
 part of the orange that was leaving us bitter taste inside our preparation 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.310
 physical is excluded assets measure omen but what do we do with all 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.129
 relationship as much as eating clear who will guarantee that orange we leave it 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.949
 they booked people in a bowling alley was what we eat perfectly good that's what 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.309
 that we are going to have then we have the inner part of the orange and we have 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:43.769
 the orange peels 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.049
 along with the percent juice in this star and macao volume already 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.239
 we take it directly to fire, it is also necessary that the work be 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.499
 hot we start with the preparation since that is the cold basin we're going to 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.579
 add a little water because if you are not going to burn it but then 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.269
 let's reduce until all the water evaporates practically and 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.809
 only that for a hundred concentrated the juice of the Japanese orange to your letter 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.419
 that we are going to add at that moment to your house and the ingredients that we are going to 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.709

 de coriandro españa made pieces and tiny feminist artists that 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.090
 conceive as we said anywhere practically we can break it 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.229
 a little if we want with the mortar with a pure knife was moscone riereta 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.590
 whole mind and in it a citrus flavor sink aromas reminiscent of farms 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.500
 just locked so they're going to combine very well they were going to make a 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.600
 heap the taste 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.770
 of our mermen demands to leave what slowly decreases according to 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.710
 go slowly reducing until everything is clear and quito is formed with 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.340
 the texture a jam that everyone knows ridao starlite are 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.879
 Approximately 40 minutes of cooking 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:56.509
 and to face the arc 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.150
 keep in mind that the bottle we do not have to use as we do that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.180
 or goods in water you have fission for about three minutes or 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.849
 in the oven on a tray also 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.780
 we can do it three minutes the caps also have to go to the physical furnace 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:16.479
 comes the other puts water or if I can not do it in the microwave in a month in a 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.159
 mold suitable for microwaves we put the jars with a little water and what 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:25.419
 we take a maximum power microwave about 40 seconds a 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.279
 minute per bottle to avoid that they want it to be because if they can not be 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.389
 break and even little happened although you can not get admired and as you want is 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.110

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.219
 small computer kettle or put the caps there and sterilize virtue 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.739
 how much 

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:48.359
 g sterilized by the heat method with a spray with spirit roxy theater 

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:50.879
 I love if we let the alcohol go away that's why it will prevent them from remaining 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.999
 perfectly lilian soto - I repeat forward more
