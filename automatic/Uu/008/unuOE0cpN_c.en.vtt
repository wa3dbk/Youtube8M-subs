dollars which is really really expensive

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.280 
dollars which is really really expensive
in<00:00:43.670> fact<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.149> cost<00:00:44.360> the<00:00:44.510> same<00:00:44.690> amount<00:00:44.750> at

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
in fact that cost the same amount at

in fact that cost the same amount at
this<00:00:45.710> particular<00:00:46.010> phone<00:00:46.570> now<00:00:48.309> basically<00:00:49.309> this

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
this particular phone now basically this

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.290 
this particular phone now basically this
is<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.300> Z<00:00:50.540> grip<00:00:50.780> iPhone<00:00:51.290> pro<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.120> reason

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
is the Z grip iPhone pro so the reason

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.819 
is the Z grip iPhone pro so the reason
why<00:00:53.510> it's<00:00:53.690> pro<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.140> because<00:00:54.410> there<00:00:54.559> will<00:00:54.680> be<00:00:54.800> a

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
why it's pro is because there will be a

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.530 
why it's pro is because there will be a
consumer<00:00:55.520> version<00:00:55.730> that<00:00:56.059> will<00:00:56.149> be<00:00:56.329> less

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
consumer version that will be less

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.410 
consumer version that will be less
coming<00:00:57.320> out<00:00:57.440> soon<00:00:57.850> there's<00:00:58.850> not<00:00:59.000> actually<00:00:59.180> a

this is my iphone 3gs this orbit the 3g

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.319 
this is my iphone 3gs this orbit the 3g
is<00:03:13.959> what<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.739> 3g<00:03:15.070> as<00:03:15.160> well<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.400> guess<00:03:15.700> there's

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
is what the 3g as well I guess there's

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.140 
is what the 3g as well I guess there's
no<00:03:16.510> video<00:03:16.780> recording<00:03:17.200> capabilities<00:03:17.850> on<00:03:18.850> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
3g so to install it it's pretty simple

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.810 
3g so to install it it's pretty simple
you<00:03:22.120> just<00:03:22.209> drop<00:03:22.570> it<00:03:22.690> into<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:23.019> cradle<00:03:23.820> one

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
you just drop it into the cradle one

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.690 
you just drop it into the cradle one
side<00:03:25.090> push<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:25.959> in<00:03:26.110> a<00:03:26.200> little<00:03:26.230> bit<00:03:26.590> there's<00:03:27.519> no

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
side push it in a little bit there's no

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.840 
side push it in a little bit there's no
definite<00:03:28.120> snap<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.950> when<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.489> it's<00:03:30.700> on

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
definite snap but when you think it's on

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.980 
definite snap but when you think it's on
it's<00:03:31.090> on

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
it's on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.990 
it's on
and<00:03:32.110> this<00:03:33.100> will<00:03:33.250> work<00:03:33.430> with<00:03:33.610> an<00:03:33.760> invisible

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
and this will work with an invisible

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.060 
and this will work with an invisible
shield<00:03:34.300> their<00:03:34.810> stuff<00:03:35.080> along<00:03:35.530> those<00:03:35.740> lines

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
shield their stuff along those lines

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.180 
shield their stuff along those lines
because<00:03:36.850> it's<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.270> same<00:03:37.480> thing<00:03:37.830> it<00:03:38.830> or<00:03:39.070> it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
because it's the same thing it or it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.150 
because it's the same thing it or it
allows<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.230> I'll<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:41.380> switch<00:03:41.710> this<00:03:41.860> into

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
allows it so I'll just switch this into

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.730 
allows it so I'll just switch this into
a<00:03:42.190> recording<00:03:42.610> mode<00:03:43.140> and<00:03:44.140> go<00:03:44.260> ahead<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.560> start

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
a recording mode and go ahead and start

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:50.550 
a recording mode and go ahead and start
recording<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.660> really<00:03:49.840> gives<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.380> lot

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
recording and it really gives you a lot

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.060 
recording and it really gives you a lot
more<00:03:50.620> control<00:03:51.220> over<00:03:51.640> your<00:03:52.570> shop<00:03:55.050> makes<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:56.230> you

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
more control over your shop makes it you

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.160 
more control over your shop makes it you
capable<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.730> holding<00:03:58.390> everything<00:03:58.840> much<00:03:59.140> more

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
capable of holding everything much more

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.290 
capable of holding everything much more
snake<00:03:59.650> particularly<00:04:00.460> when<00:04:00.760> you're<00:04:00.910> walking

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.530 

and<00:04:07.740> what's<00:04:08.740> really<00:04:08.860> cool<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.190> also<00:04:09.640> it<00:04:10.450> was

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
and what's really cool is also it was

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.120 
and what's really cool is also it was
designed<00:04:10.870> so<00:04:11.080> it<00:04:11.110> could<00:04:11.380> be<00:04:11.410> fooled<00:04:11.770> held

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
designed so it could be fooled held

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.550 
designed so it could be fooled held
upside<00:04:12.400> down<00:04:12.880> as<00:04:13.060> well<00:04:13.300> hold<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.230> upside<00:04:14.380> down

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
upside down as well hold it upside down

your<00:04:44.039> iphone<00:04:44.430> 3gs<00:04:44.939> again<00:04:45.449> the<00:04:45.599> 3g<00:04:45.960> will<00:04:46.169> fit

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
your iphone 3gs again the 3g will fit

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.439

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
but technically the 3g does not have

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.110 
but technically the 3g does not have
video<00:04:48.719> recording<00:04:49.139> capabilities<00:04:49.759> so<00:04:50.759> you

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
video recording capabilities so you

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.510 
video recording capabilities so you

optical image stabilization works where

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.240 
optical image stabilization works where
if<00:05:31.169> there's<00:05:31.289> a<00:05:31.409> little<00:05:31.529> bit<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.740> movement<00:05:31.979> it

if there's a little bit of movement it

if there's a little bit of movement it
just<00:05:32.430> moves<00:05:32.699> instead<00:05:33.330> of<00:05:33.360> shuttering<00:05:34.580> so<00:05:35.580> it's

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
just moves instead of shuttering so it's

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.809 
just moves instead of shuttering so it's
just<00:05:36.000> basically<00:05:36.349> steel<00:05:37.349> there's<00:05:37.979> no<00:05:38.159> wall<00:05:38.520> or

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
gel or anything like that that decreased

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.180 
gel or anything like that that decreased
stabilization<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.300> even<00:05:42.840> if<00:05:42.930> you<00:05:43.710> know<00:05:43.830> you

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
stabilization so even if you know you

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.339 
stabilization so even if you know you
have<00:05:44.430> this<00:05:44.610> you<00:05:45.089> can't<00:05:45.330> hold<00:05:45.479> your<00:05:45.690> hand<00:05:45.750> still
