00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
miners were chanting late today

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:28.640 
miners were chanting late today
Chili's<00:00:10.260> you're<00:00:10.410> gonna<00:00:10.500> you're<00:00:10.740> gonna<00:00:10.830> be<00:00:27.650> all

Chili's you're gonna you're gonna be all
the<00:00:28.949> way<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:30.080> every<00:00:31.080> floor<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.470> gets<00:00:31.679> worse<00:00:31.920> so

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
the way and every floor it gets worse so

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090 
the way and every floor it gets worse so
what<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.360> do<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.750> pull<00:00:34.020> one<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.920> three

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
what we do is we pull one of the three

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.010 
what we do is we pull one of the three
quarter<00:00:35.370> inch<00:00:35.520> plates<00:00:35.790> off<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.719> use<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
quarter inch plates off we use the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.020 
quarter inch plates off we use the
deflector<00:00:37.500> fashioning<00:00:37.980> system<00:00:38.370> through<00:00:38.610> here

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
deflector fashioning system through here

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
deflector fashioning system through here
and<00:00:39.230> that<00:00:40.230> relieves<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.800> pressure<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.309> we

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
and that relieves that pressure and we

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.940 
and that relieves that pressure and we
do<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.700> every<00:00:41.730> floor<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.379> happens<00:00:43.770> is

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
do that every floor and what happens is

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.940 
do that every floor and what happens is
you<00:00:44.340> get<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> level<00:00:44.910> floor<00:00:45.440> every<00:00:46.440> level<00:00:46.770> that

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you get a level floor every level that

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.369 
you get a level floor every level that
you<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.250> up<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.360> sound<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.870> broken<00:00:49.110> as

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
you go up and the sound is broken as

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
you go up and the sound is broken as
well<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> sound

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
well because you don't have the sound

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
well because you don't have the sound

lutely<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.780> framing<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.950> stress-free<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
lutely the framing is is stress-free and

lutely the framing is is stress-free and
that's<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.570> concept<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.619> build<00:01:10.860> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
that's our concept is that you build the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.050 
that's our concept is that you build the
structural<00:01:12.510> elements<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.470> building<00:01:14.060> do

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
structural elements of your building do

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
structural elements of your building do
what<00:01:15.210> they're<00:01:15.360> supposed<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> do<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.500> non

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what they're supposed to do and the non

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.170 
what they're supposed to do and the non
structural<00:01:17.040> components<00:01:17.729> as<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> building

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
structural components as a building

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.340 
structural components as a building
don't<00:01:18.780> interfere<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.650> that

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
don't interfere with that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.140 
don't interfere with that
the<00:01:22.350> next<00:01:22.680> step<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.400> install<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.000> F

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
the next step is to install the F

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.930 
the next step is to install the F
corners<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.290> sheetrock<00:01:25.590> lid<00:01:26.130> panel<00:01:26.370> it's

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
corners on the sheetrock lid panel it's

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:46.429 
corners on the sheetrock lid panel it's
fast<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.780> easy

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.289 

so<00:01:47.439> what<00:01:47.560> we<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.799> here<00:01:48.040> is<00:01:48.130> the<00:01:48.310> collector<00:01:49.090> at

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
so what we have here is the collector at

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.210 
so what we have here is the collector at
the<00:01:49.390> corner<00:01:49.750> it<00:01:50.290> carries<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.649> load<00:01:50.770> of<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
the corner it carries the load of the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.820 
the corner it carries the load of the
board<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.759> secures<00:01:52.210> it<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.450> walls<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.170> not

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the ceiling or a trust it will be lifted

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.040 
the ceiling or a trust it will be lifted
up<00:02:04.240> due<00:02:04.840> to<00:02:04.869> trust<00:02:05.350> deflection<00:02:05.979> and<00:02:06.369> it<00:02:06.759> works

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
up due to trust deflection and it works

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.600 
up due to trust deflection and it works
perfectly<00:02:08.050> with<00:02:08.410> the<00:02:08.530> deflector<00:02:08.979> fastening

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
perfectly with the deflector fastening

perfectly with the deflector fastening
system<00:02:09.970> for<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.209> walls

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.190 

all<00:02:24.030> right<00:02:24.240> what<00:02:24.420> we've<00:02:24.540> done<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.840> we've<00:02:25.020> hung

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
all right what we've done is we've hung

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
all right what we've done is we've hung
a<00:02:25.230> sheet<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.620> drywall<00:02:25.890> on<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.460> ceiling<00:02:26.850> here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
a sheet of drywall on the ceiling here

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.850 
a sheet of drywall on the ceiling here
and<00:02:27.420> we've<00:02:27.750> attached<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.200> deflector<00:02:28.680> F

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
and we've attached the deflector F

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.990 
and we've attached the deflector F
corner<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.490> ends

corner to the ends

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.360 
corner to the ends
we've<00:02:30.690> securely<00:02:31.260> fastened<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.190> wall

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
we've securely fastened it to the wall

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.180 
we've securely fastened it to the wall
and<00:02:32.700> then<00:02:33.300> we<00:02:33.570> have<00:02:33.810> put<00:02:34.140> no<00:02:34.320> fasteners<00:02:34.920> here

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and then we have put no fasteners here

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.630 
and then we have put no fasteners here
within<00:02:35.610> 16<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.330> 24<00:02:36.750> inches<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.710> wall<00:02:37.980> what

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.960 
to the roof and that is going to cause
us<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.260> lot<00:04:50.290> of<00:04:50.530> problems<00:04:50.980> basically<00:04:51.520> what's

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
us a lot of problems basically what's

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.790 
us a lot of problems basically what's
going<00:04:52.300> on<00:04:52.450> here<00:04:52.750> is<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:53.200> this<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.650> our

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
going on here is that this is our

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.010 
going on here is that this is our
deflector<00:04:54.040> fastening<00:04:54.700> system<00:04:55.030> at<00:04:55.120> work<00:04:55.300> it's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
deflector fastening system at work it's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.330 
deflector fastening system at work it's
time<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.320> use<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:56.620> thing<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:56.980> how<00:04:57.100> does<00:04:57.220> it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
time to use this thing so how does it

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.760 
time to use this thing so how does it
work<00:04:57.460> what<00:04:57.940> we<00:04:58.150> have<00:04:58.330> right<00:04:58.930> simply<00:04:59.410> we've<00:04:59.560> got

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
work what we have right simply we've got

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.880 
work what we have right simply we've got
a<00:04:59.800> drill<00:05:00.490> bit<00:05:00.669> here<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.510> our<00:05:01.780> extension<00:05:02.440> this

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
a drill bit here in our extension this

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.680 
a drill bit here in our extension this
allows<00:05:03.190> me<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.400> stand<00:05:03.700> on<00:05:03.940> the<00:05:04.090> ground<00:05:04.330> so<00:05:04.630> I

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
allows me to stand on the ground so I

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.530 
allows me to stand on the ground so I
can<00:05:04.870> reach<00:05:05.020> all<00:05:05.290> of<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.500> top<00:05:05.770> plates<00:05:06.100> and<00:05:06.540> you

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
can reach all of the top plates and you
