37m I believe and I'll show you what
we've<00:00:32.369> done<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.669> far<00:00:33.589> the<00:00:34.589> power<00:00:34.800> supply<00:00:35.129> was

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
we've done so far the power supply was

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:37.970 
we've done so far the power supply was
suspect<00:00:35.550> here<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:37.019> drives<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.440> lamps<00:00:37.829> in

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
suspect here as it drives the lamps in

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.380 
suspect here as it drives the lamps in
the<00:00:38.190> inverter<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.699> everything<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.210> and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
the inverter and everything here and

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
the inverter and everything here and
here<00:00:40.350> are<00:00:40.499> two<00:00:40.649> connections<00:00:41.129> for<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> power

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
here are two connections for the power

well let me go back to the power supply
this<00:00:57.870> power<00:00:58.079> supply<00:00:58.260> although<00:00:58.679> physically

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
this power supply although physically

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.500 
this power supply although physically
physically<00:01:00.449> different<00:01:00.920> we<00:01:01.920> did<00:01:02.269> put<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.389> in

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
physically different we did put it in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.850 
physically different we did put it in
this<00:01:03.690> one<00:01:04.430> as<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> test<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.560> both<00:01:07.560> are

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this one as a test because both are

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.289 
this one as a test because both are
exactly<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.610> want<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.880> make<00:01:09.030> sure<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.270> not

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
exactly I want to make sure we're not

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
exactly I want to make sure we're not
plugged<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.840> both<00:01:10.500> are<00:01:10.619> exactly<00:01:10.979> labeled<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
plugged in both are exactly labeled the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.149 
plugged in both are exactly labeled the
same<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.119> like<00:01:13.399> we<00:01:14.399> have<00:01:16.009> they're<00:01:17.009> both

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
same which I like we have they're both

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.779 
same which I like we have they're both
labeled<00:01:17.640> here<00:01:17.759> it's<00:01:18.270> plus<00:01:18.719> five<00:01:19.579> so<00:01:20.579> you<00:01:20.640> have

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:20.789 
labeled here it's plus five so you have

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.080 
labeled here it's plus five so you have
these<00:01:21.320> plus<00:01:22.320> five<00:01:22.530> leads<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:23.939> have

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
these plus five leads here and we have

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.029 
these plus five leads here and we have
looks<00:01:24.420> like<00:01:24.570> five<00:01:24.810> grounds<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:28.439> 12<00:01:28.740> volts

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:29.039 
looks like five grounds to 12 volts

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.160 
looks like five grounds to 12 volts
three<00:01:29.250> 12<00:01:29.520> volts<00:01:29.789> and<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.359> off<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
three 12 volts and the on and off and

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.389 
three 12 volts and the on and off and
over<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.890> have<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.509> inverter<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:34.399> status

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
over here we have the inverter on status

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.529 
over here we have the inverter on status
etc<00:01:35.579> etc<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.479> some<00:01:37.280> logic<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.180> our<00:01:39.299> power

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
etc etc so some logic here and our power

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.870 
etc etc so some logic here and our power
is<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.100> although<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.430> physically

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
is here although this is physically

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
is here although this is physically
different<00:01:42.359> and<00:01:42.630> does<00:01:42.719> not<00:01:42.840> actually<00:01:43.649> fit<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
different and does not actually fit in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.300 
different and does not actually fit in
this<00:01:44.219> set<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:45.000> did<00:01:45.210> run<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.649> for<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.679> few<00:01:46.890> days<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
this set we did run it for a few days to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.639 
this set we did run it for a few days to
see<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.880> factored<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> symptoms<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
see if it factored the symptoms and it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.649 
see if it factored the symptoms and it
did<00:01:49.859> not<00:01:50.130> so<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.729> looking<00:01:51.030> at<00:01:51.149> either<00:01:51.390> this

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
did not so we're looking at either this

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.859 
did not so we're looking at either this
board<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.979> t-con<00:01:53.429> here<00:01:53.909> now<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.780> I'm

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
board or the t-con here now what I'm

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.109 
board or the t-con here now what I'm
going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> point<00:01:55.229> another<00:01:55.759> snafu<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.939> run

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
going to point another snafu you run

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
going to point another snafu you run
into<00:01:57.450> is<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.229> being<00:01:58.499> a<00:01:58.619> 37-inch<00:01:59.280> although

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
into is this being a 37-inch although

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.660 
into is this being a 37-inch although
the<00:01:59.729> board<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> same<00:02:00.539> model<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:02.159> differs

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
the board is the same model it differs

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.999 
the board is the same model it differs
in<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.450> fact<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.229> has<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.679> added

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
in the fact that it has this added

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.229 
in the fact that it has this added
circuitry<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:07.140> t-con<00:02:07.619> is<00:02:08.000> embedded<00:02:09.000> on

circuitry here the t-con is embedded on
the<00:02:09.479> board<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.259> we

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
on this one it is not so we could put

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.470 
on this one it is not so we could put
that<00:02:15.690> one<00:02:15.870> in<00:02:16.110> here<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.090> just<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.270> the
