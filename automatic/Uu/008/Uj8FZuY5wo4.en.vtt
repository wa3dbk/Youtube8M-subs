taught<00:04:02.520> me<00:04:02.550> all<00:04:02.730> that<00:04:02.850> my<00:04:03.720> coaches<00:04:04.110> will<00:04:04.260> often

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
taught me all that my coaches will often

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.520 
taught me all that my coaches will often
remind<00:04:04.920> me<00:04:05.130> of<00:04:05.160> these<00:04:05.880> two<00:04:06.240> and<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:07.140> way<00:04:07.320> it

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
remind me of these two and the way it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.650 
remind me of these two and the way it
took<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.890> process<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:08.910> a<00:04:09.090> consistent

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
took a process and just a consistent

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.960 
took a process and just a consistent
message<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.310> consistent<00:04:11.310> example<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:11.910> think

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
message and consistent example I think

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.570 
message and consistent example I think
in<00:04:12.330> both<00:04:12.480> cases<00:04:12.840> there<00:04:13.800> was<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.130> trust<00:04:14.400> that

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
in both cases there was some trust that

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.490 
in both cases there was some trust that
had<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.820> be<00:04:14.940> developed<00:04:15.420> and<00:04:15.570> certainly

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
had to be developed and certainly

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.729 
had to be developed and certainly
they're<00:04:16.890> not<00:04:17.310> perfect<00:04:17.730> yet<00:04:17.820> neither<00:04:18.030> am<00:04:18.270> I

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
they're not perfect yet neither am I

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.400 
they're not perfect yet neither am I
but<00:04:19.569> they<00:04:20.569> certainly<00:04:20.840> have<00:04:21.019> turned<00:04:21.289> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
but they certainly have turned the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.930 
but they certainly have turned the
corner<00:04:21.590> and<00:04:21.859> we're<00:04:22.280> very<00:04:22.310> proud<00:04:22.669> of<00:04:22.759> that

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
corner and we're very proud of that

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.420 
corner and we're very proud of that
don't<00:04:23.690> don't<00:04:24.050> give<00:04:24.289> up<00:04:24.470> never<00:04:24.740> quit<00:04:25.130> never

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
don't don't give up never quit never

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.409 
don't don't give up never quit never
quit

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
quit

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.180
