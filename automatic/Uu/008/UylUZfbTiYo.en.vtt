00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 ok we'll do a little trick on 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.330
 Highway 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.850
 the engine the engine at temperature 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:34.400
 normal now I was driving maybe 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:39.550
 30 minutes like his diesel engines and 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.550
 always take a little time 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.000
 so that the engine reaches the 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.600
 normal temperatures before driving 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 very fast 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.670
 the maximum speed of 624 mhz 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.920
 no this 100 kilometers per hour actually 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.770
 and in trip control so they have 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.360
 says the registration number at the beginning 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.040
 and they will understand it's after they 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.680
 will calculate how much time I took 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.369
 to get there then we can not 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.369
 cheat it's 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.450
 this is the engine he is very quiet 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.450
 and does not work well it does not vibrate 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:10.220
 it's like a 15 year old car with 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.220
 364 proof that he 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.910
 OK, thanks
