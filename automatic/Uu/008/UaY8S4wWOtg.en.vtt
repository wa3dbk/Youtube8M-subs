great for shock absorption I wouldn't

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.629 
great for shock absorption I wouldn't
think<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.530> I<00:05:03.950> mean<00:05:04.950> it<00:05:05.070> will<00:05:05.220> give<00:05:05.460> it<00:05:05.580> a

think but I mean it will give it a

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.490 
think but I mean it will give it a
protection<00:05:06.060> but<00:05:06.450> I<00:05:06.479> don't<00:05:07.020> think<00:05:07.140> it's<00:05:07.380> as

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
protection but I don't think it's as

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.700 
protection but I don't think it's as
good<00:05:07.710> as<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.950> full<00:05:08.430> rubber<00:05:11.870> you<00:05:12.870> know<00:05:12.990> anyhow

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
good as a full rubber you know anyhow

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.969 
good as a full rubber you know anyhow
but<00:05:13.919> you<00:05:14.250> can<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.850> mean<00:05:15.240> it<00:05:15.390> can<00:05:16.320> lay<00:05:16.590> down<00:05:16.830> its

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
but you can I mean it can lay down its

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.810 
but you can I mean it can lay down its
back<00:05:17.190> without<00:05:17.490> scratching<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.950> well

back without scratching the well

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.000 
back without scratching the well
definitely<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.450> camera<00:05:21.870> in<00:05:21.960> them<00:05:22.140> but<00:05:22.860> it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
definitely the camera in them but it

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.920 
definitely the camera in them but it
won't<00:05:23.190> scratch<00:05:23.340> the<00:05:23.880> fabric<00:05:24.660> on<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:24.840> back

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
won't scratch the fabric on the back

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.610 
won't scratch the fabric on the back
neither<00:05:25.490> because<00:05:26.490> it<00:05:26.610> does<00:05:26.850> over<00:05:27.620> does

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
neither because it does over does

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:35.659 
neither because it does over does
overlap<00:05:29.310> here<00:05:29.780> so<00:05:30.780> anyhow<00:05:33.140> it's<00:05:34.140> uh<00:05:34.500> I<00:05:34.830> hope

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
overlap here so anyhow it's uh I hope

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:39.380 
overlap here so anyhow it's uh I hope

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
with it I think it was thirty-five

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.570
