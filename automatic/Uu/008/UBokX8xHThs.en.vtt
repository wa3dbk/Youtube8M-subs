00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.740
 misic that expects to lower it shrinks inc 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.530
 mestalla 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.810
 Kenya is always good to be the applications in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.230
 per se 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.900
 and the rest would be the massive memory 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.590
 amex memory 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.590

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
 milicic that I always allowed 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.660
 cord 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.070
 in what country am I in colombia 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.520

 good the selection the premium version 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.100
 the key that is what I do 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.549
 already in common 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.549
 I wanted to test 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 that honest streisand they do not believe that 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:22.119
 that has so good aim and with all that 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 There is like 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:28.119
 no jiang 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.129
 co 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:46.999
 read carefully the grounds very comfortable fast and lion 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.749
 As other live tournaments know, I do not know what Culiacán is going to tell the 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.669
 main screen I was wondering the country was precisely for me 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.540
 show the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.829
 first the main part as the relevant to my country 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.009
 the South American mustang cup stands out 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:04.930
 with the eliminatory 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.229
 and other objects 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:10.239
 and shipping that this is what I like the most we admire the mustang cup 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.649
 for example statistics months in the table of positions 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:18.599
 the calendar 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.229
 and I can see 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:24.519
 two results on each of the smith dates and when one remembers to hear how 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.399
 the match was 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:31.069
 they unite about that someone because of it that giuliana lost bolivia 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:35.699
 I do not know how many years it does not sound very 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.739
 It does not sound very good to me. It is a process that seeks 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.389
 bolivia 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.389
 at home 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.389
 bolivia is married 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.529

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:59.959
 here, to verify that it was a lie what is saying surprise 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.009
 well then what I like the most about this 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.859

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.269
 Live 

00:04:15.179 --> 00:04:18.179

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.370

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.150

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.150

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.960

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.340

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.210
 american press going on things 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.570
 that indicator to reds arrive where the first time two are 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.080
 rán cost 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.800
 nine minutes I guess 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.189
 it is going so that it is not paid menke tied in the psuv they have distributed and 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.600
 if they are green they will be playing at that moment still as sacred because 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.779
 they are on the internet 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.610

00:05:10.609 --> 00:05:13.609
 game is being played that was not finished 

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:17.279
