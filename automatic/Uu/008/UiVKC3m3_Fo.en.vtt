00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
at what this looks like first thing

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.670 
at what this looks like first thing
you're<00:01:01.360> going<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.510> notice<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.020> the<00:01:02.320> swipe

is nice so you'll see you here when I

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.770 
is nice so you'll see you here when I
start<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:14.979> unfold<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.579> screen<00:01:15.909> instead<00:01:16.659> of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
start to unfold the screen instead of

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.359 
start to unfold the screen instead of
just<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.109> standard<00:01:17.439> swipe<00:01:17.799> you<00:01:18.100> get<00:01:18.219> this

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
makes it look really realistic like

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.980 
makes it look really realistic like
you're<00:01:23.859> pulling<00:01:24.069> a<00:01:24.340> curtain<00:01:24.850> back<00:01:25.539> from<00:01:25.899> your

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
you're pulling a curtain back from your

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.520 
you're pulling a curtain back from your
device<00:01:27.389> for<00:01:28.389> those<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.749> that<00:01:28.899> use<00:01:29.200> a

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
device for those of you that use a

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.489 
device for those of you that use a
passcode<00:01:30.310> for<00:01:30.340> your<00:01:30.729> lock<00:01:30.880> screen<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:32.380> be

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
passcode for your lock screen you'll be

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.559 
passcode for your lock screen you'll be
happy<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.799> know<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.069> this<00:01:33.429> tweak<00:01:33.969> also<00:01:34.359> works

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
happy to know that this tweak also works

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.139 
happy to know that this tweak also works
with<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.719> passcode<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.369> basically<00:01:36.939> what's

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
with a passcode so basically what's

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:38.099 
with a passcode so basically what's
going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.359> happen<00:01:37.659> is<00:01:37.749> if<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:37.959> have<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:38.109 
going to happen is if you have a

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.190 
going to happen is if you have a
passcode<00:01:38.380> set<00:01:38.920> when<00:01:39.310> you<00:01:39.959> swipe<00:01:40.959> to<00:01:41.170> unlock

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
passcode set when you swipe to unlock

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.679 
passcode set when you swipe to unlock
it's<00:01:41.859> going<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.069> reveal<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.819> passcode<00:01:43.299> screen

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:43.689 
it's going to reveal the passcode screen

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:44.669 
it's going to reveal the passcode screen
instead<00:01:43.959> of<00:01:44.079> going<00:01:44.229> straight<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.619> the

00:01:44.669 --> 00:01:44.679 
instead of going straight to the

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:46.949 
instead of going straight to the
springboard<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.880> you'll<00:01:46.090> still<00:01:46.329> be<00:01:46.450> secure<00:01:46.869> if

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
springboard so you'll still be secure if

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.709 
springboard so you'll still be secure if
you<00:01:47.049> want<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.259> use<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> passcode<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.450> as<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.630> can

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
you want to use a passcode so as you can

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:51.989 
you want to use a passcode so as you can
see<00:01:49.929> there<00:01:50.170> as<00:01:50.560> soon<00:01:50.709> as<00:01:50.829> you<00:01:51.009> unfold<00:01:51.880> the

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999
