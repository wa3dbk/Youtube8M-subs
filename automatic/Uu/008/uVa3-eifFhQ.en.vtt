today I'm here with a palm treo pro a
really<00:00:07.470> pretty<00:00:07.770> rather<00:00:08.220> exciting<00:00:08.910> smartphone

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510

really pretty rather exciting smartphone
it<00:00:09.780> does<00:00:10.139> resemble<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.740> blackberry<00:00:11.099> bold<00:00:11.280> a

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490

little and that does have similar
features<00:00:13.019> but<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.650> think<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> price<00:00:14.160> point

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
features but I think the price point

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.189 
features but I think the price point
might<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.759> slightly<00:00:15.059> different<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.750> going
