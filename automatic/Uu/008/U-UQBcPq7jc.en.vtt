00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello friends welcome to things from 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.450
 garden in this video let's see how 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.059
 make a very easy fertilizer and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.509
 economic this fertilizer is going to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.400
 provide phosphorus with an essential nutrient 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.580
 so that our plants grow healthy 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.580
 strong and produce many flowers 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.689
 The first thing we are going to do is this 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.630
 campfire where we are going to cook bones and 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.910
 that is the secret of fertilizer 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.010
 just bone ash you 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.230
 I recommend that you put the bones up 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.540
 of a metal tray not as it says 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.140
 me so that later it is easier 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.190
 separate the ashes of bone from the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.530
 wood ash 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.620
 the bones are going to cook until 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.240
 are well white say the greatest 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.360
 possible good time 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:59.790
 once the bones cooled down what 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.450
 what we are going to do is rescue them from the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.770
 the fire 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:10.950
 and what we are going to have is these pieces 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:14.310
 whites are the bones but 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.850
 as you can see 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.079
 and they break down just like that then what 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.159
 we are going to do is put them making a 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:26.219
 mortar 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.219
 montero we can not cut to help 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.729
 is pure phosphorus and calcium / phosphate 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.110
 calcium so it has calcium phosphorus and 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.110
 oxygen and nothing else 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.160
 and it's very good to put the 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.950
 good little plants obviously that's a 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.689
 tiny block that says 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.969
 because to the bones that I had in that 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.259
 moment but you can can any 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.679
 his support so the pig then the 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.679
 cow 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.240
 put the dog why not 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 all right 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.940
 okay 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.069
 well then now with a mortar in a 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 of minipimer is not necessary but 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.140
 it could also be used by a grinder 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.970
 dough 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.459
 i 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.940
 well i 'm the first one i do this 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.620
 and I tell you the truth is not easy I thought 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.780
 that they were going to grind a lot faster 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 I imagine that 4,000 years ago people 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.330
 I had clearer corteo 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.330
 but good 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:07.040
 I was reading about these bones of 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.069
 bone meal you feed this to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.560
 cows 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.640
 and the truth is that I feed a 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.290
 cow bone cow 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.040
 when you put 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.189
 the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.200
 This bone ash you have not got 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:26.620
 It serves to put it in the moment in which the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.530
 need to plan if I keep going 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.510
 planting in spring you have to add 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.980
 is the earth in autumn to give it 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.200
 time to be seen 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 ideal to get a routine and 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 putting these in fall they are called 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.200
 slow-release fertilizers that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.780
 it means that they take a long time to release 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.780
 he played them now ripped the dog 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.500
 for many to release the nutrients 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.500
 then it is also good 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.510
 doing as an accumulation effect 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.510
 of nutrients 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.389
 I dined in nine mines 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.419
 down 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.810
 there may be some technique for the 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.810
 draw 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 Peace is like that 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:39.159
 as in circles layer would be better a 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:39.159
 stone mortar 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.460
 there testing 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.780
 even this is about a spoonful 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.230
 of flour decade of forgiveness a spoonful 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:05:01.450
 of ash for every 20 liters of land 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:04.110
 without or one cup of ash for each meter 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.220
 Square Earth 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.590
 Once you convert bones 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.030
 dust you're simply going to store this 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.710
 ash in a closed jar 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.740
 hermetically so that it does not enter 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:17.050
 humidity and that's it, that's all 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.090
 thanks for watching the video and sharing it 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.450
 I send you a hug and enjoy the 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.450
 Orchard
