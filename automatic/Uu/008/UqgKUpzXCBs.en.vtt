00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:09.240
 of minecraft for the xbox 360 version 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.820
 let's keep playing poor and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.629
 well let's put it here short and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.550
 let's create a new world at random 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.820
 waiting to leave us something good something 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.039
 let it serve you 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.619
 and then more than anything to thank people 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.760
 that continues to support me thank you very much 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.620
 I neglect the channel a bit but 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.020
 but well let's let's continue 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:36.250
 ahead I neglected it because I had to 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.320
 visit my son and my wife and almost not 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.530
 they let me play 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:45.500
 so state Africa so there's that 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.870
 seize gentlemen you have to take advantage 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.710
 and good the seed that has touched us is 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 The next 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.540
 you know that after today I can all 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.180
 say that seed is because it is random 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.550
 in advance I liked that in fact 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.550
 It has a lot of music that configuration 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.130
 I also liked that in view that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.980
 we have a desert in fact there is a 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.910
 village here we have marsh lava area 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.650
 prairie forest and good because it is already 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.979
 profit I think so if it goes for good 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.470
 this sugarcane seed there are 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.260
 the little animals we will see if we can 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 find wheat potatoes or potatoes by 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.110
 who to call 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.619
 for the moment I think carrot is not 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.270
 there are these are potatoes here there is a 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.549
 Blacksmith's house we're going to visit her there 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.420
 that we are going to visit the blacksmith's house 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.780
 and what it contains is apple so what 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.659
 can serve us is that of the meshes and 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.869
 the beak already know that we do not 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.830
 we can go to what is called search 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.530
 minerals 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.550
 after this area would be the lane 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.260
 and there's the marsh lava area and a little 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.560
 of mountain an apology because I was 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.530
 I closed my throat I do not know why 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.150
 and I hope there is a desert temple 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.030
 I like that very much because almost 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.459
 we found interesting things and I give 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.650
 thank you there is a mushroom biome here 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.730
 we hope it works and I do something that yes 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.700
 there is a fuercitas that if any lords 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.769
 and well already after we found the 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.120
 mushroom biome I wish there were 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:33.280
 more land up here and not 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.680
 will waste a lot with water 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.730
 look at jungle this seed can contain 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.390
 we all saw them and it can be gain 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 Come to carrerita that what this is 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.480
 sand 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.890
 I hope there are temples and if there is no 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.020
 temples then it does not matter look in a 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.580
 temple like that I like that and not 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.650
 gentlemen already with the snow we have all 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.380
 the biomes we are going to break bit 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.990
 let's take a position to see and not 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.310
 Do not miss anything, let's go home 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.940
 of him 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.610
 night vision we are divisions and there 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:09.660
 you are gentlemen are we are going to visit here 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.130
 very happily we are going to break here 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.130
 to the cofrecito 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.849
 we are not going to count the reddish stone of the 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.519
 again with the things that have us a 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.549
 diamond koh very good two ingots 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.500
 Bone look, I like the temple more 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.110
 of in the desert because it contains more 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.930
 things and let's remove this that has 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.930
 trap then have more gold ingots 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.510
 We are not very good 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.180
 guÃ¡cala diffusi and good sir we are going to 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.900
 visit and investigate the area that is 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 here arribita would be the one here 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.230
 higher 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.610
 It would be a lot of snow, I hope it's not too much 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.860
 snow because they already know that I do not like and 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.630
 this seed is very very good and few 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.230
 Sometimes good seeds have come out of me 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.900
 shape 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.489
 or the random way really almost 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.980
 it's always about looking for some 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.290
 strange name something curious that you call the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.510
 attention to make it a little bit more 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.250
 original a more original and good idea 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.430
 here as if it extended a lot 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.750
 snow zone but well no way gentlemen 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.700
 we will continue investigating here the 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.370
 swamp 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.079
 like more swamp very good to me I like 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.540
 much the swamp for the same thing that is 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.880
 I like this area a lot and more 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.460
 because there are these leaves I do not do how 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.960
 it's called are called here according to minecraft 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.169
 is called 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:34.610
 where is it I did not break it was what it's called 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.330
 sir who is called where is where is 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.780
 here is epic fail because I do not know where 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:44.990
 there are the small leaves where they are 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.040
 the jadraque bugs are lilac pods 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.440
 bone xd xd 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.440
 both for the pod a pod 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.710
 look up we have stone biome that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.889
 we also have stone bioma very very 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.270
 easy to remove let's go some time what 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.720
 good that there is a bit of 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.190
 of coal and good gentlemen this is part 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.590
 of what are being the shores of 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.770
 the seed we will come to review the part 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.170
 that is here more forest in fact has 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.639
 the tone all the biomes the good 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:22.360
 he also has pumpkins outside 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.610
 and on this side there is 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.169
 you already know that if you investigate this 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.629
 seed and you find yourself some 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.210
 coordinate I would really appreciate it if the 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.069
 you share either a chest of some 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.860
 respawn good more than anything because you're 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:38.620
 seeds that are random never ever 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.210
 looked respawn and well here's more than 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.020
 true 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.569
 I believe that the zone d 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.449
 we would miss the carrot let's hope there 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.099
 another village because one of the disadvantages 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.900
 who had the seed of emma watson is 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.840
 I did not have 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:57.330
 he did not have carrots he's supposed to know 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.630
 an encore to kill them give us the European no 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.840
 is the way to get it but we do not 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.220
 they gave no good sweet potato to me they did not give me 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.560
 some people say yes other than 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.660
 no and I do not know if that works 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.440
 It would be something to investigate well here in the 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.050
 home of him like week village indeed 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.040
 how many villages there are these villages mercy 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.620
 it's not a stone biome would be the one here 

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:25.380
 it would be this investigate a little bit well 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.020
 where is he 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:32.070
 it would be with the bone meat we are going to 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.889
 remove this this is pa pa pa pa pa pa 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.569
 pa 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:39.050
 let's see here 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:41.689
 potato wheat I do not know if the villagers of the 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.729
 change the carrot until it is more 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:46.699
 German potato is pure potato now if we 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.199
 They gave pure sweet potato of puebla but 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.270
 gentlemen I hope you liked the 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.550
 seed we are going to review has jungle 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.580
 It's deserted, although I do not think it has 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.770
 temple in the desert if he had in the 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.229
 jungle also has swamp had 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:02.779
 prairie took mushroom biome area 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:04.099
 snow that is a little more extensive and 

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:06.770

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.969
 you know and I hope you liked it 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.529
