my groin did not hurt me at all today
but<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> think<00:00:59.280> definitely<00:00:59.969> being<00:01:00.780> off<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.500> ice

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
but I think definitely being off the ice

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.439 
but I think definitely being off the ice
for<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> week<00:01:02.160> before<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> came<00:01:02.969> here

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
for a week before I came here

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.600 
for a week before I came here
affected<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.199> mental<00:01:04.710> cycle<00:01:05.129> ittle<00:01:05.309> bit<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
affected my mental cycle ittle bit and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.609 
affected my mental cycle ittle bit and
also<00:01:05.729> my<00:01:06.000> physical<00:01:06.450> shape<00:01:06.689> there's<00:01:07.290> no<00:01:07.409> doubt

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
also my physical shape there's no doubt

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.520 
also my physical shape there's no doubt
that<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.850> stay<00:01:09.060> off<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.240> ice<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.840> can't

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that if you stay off the ice and can't

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.230 
that if you stay off the ice and can't
do<00:01:10.680> any<00:01:10.799> physical<00:01:11.189> activity<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.090> length

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
do any physical activity for that length

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.600 
do any physical activity for that length
of<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:13.409> hard<00:01:13.680> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.890> peak<00:01:14.280> shape

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
of time it's hard to be in peak shape

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.030 
of time it's hard to be in peak shape
but<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.570> gave<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> my<00:01:15.930> best<00:01:16.200> shot<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.650> wasn't<00:01:16.950> my

but I gave it my best shot it wasn't my

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.270 
but I gave it my best shot it wasn't my
best<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.700> I'm<00:01:18.030> disappointed<00:01:18.830> but<00:01:19.830> you

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
learned from mistakes and hopefully I'll

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770

the performance so I wouldn't I wouldn't
venture<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.230> say<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.560> was<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.680> finest

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
venture to say it was the finest

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.920 
venture to say it was the finest
performance<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:39.760> given<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.180> situation<00:02:40.330> in

the<00:02:41.019> moment<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.610> end<00:02:42.790> result<00:02:43.180> I'd<00:02:43.390> have

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the moment and the end result I'd have

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.229 
the moment and the end result I'd have
