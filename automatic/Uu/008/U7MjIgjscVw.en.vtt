so<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> fatling<00:00:13.290> stitch<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.740> used<00:00:13.950> to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
so this is the fatling stitch is used to

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.930 
so this is the fatling stitch is used to
attach<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.120> lining<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.619> cloth<00:00:16.940> we've

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
attach the lining to the cloth we've

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.460 
attach the lining to the cloth we've
basically<00:00:18.150> lining<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.140> with<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> little

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
basically lining on here with a little

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.660 
basically lining on here with a little
bit<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.710> fullness<00:00:19.859> between<00:00:20.340> each<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
bit of fullness between each of the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.480 
bit of fullness between each of the
stitches<00:00:21.199> the<00:00:22.199> loaf<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> tension<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
stitches the loaf the tension of the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.800 
stitches the loaf the tension of the
thread<00:00:23.519> if<00:00:23.820> we<00:00:23.910> didn't<00:00:24.060> want<00:00:24.119> any<00:00:24.269> fullness<00:00:24.630> in

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
thread if we didn't want any fullness in

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.060 
thread if we didn't want any fullness in
here<00:00:24.960> by<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.320> we'd<00:00:25.439> finish<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.890> hand

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
here by the time we'd finish this hand

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.160 
here by the time we'd finish this hand
stitch<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.880> line<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.300> become<00:00:27.570> tight<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
stitch the line would become tight so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.330 
stitch the line would become tight so
it's<00:00:28.260> important<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.680> put<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:28.980> little<00:00:29.099> bit<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it's important to put a little bit of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.339 
it's important to put a little bit of
foulness<00:00:29.519> between<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.019> basting

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
foulness between the the basting

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.700 
foulness between the the basting

stitches then position the needle in

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.459 
stitches then position the needle in

the V indentation would occur along with
the<00:01:26.159> stitches<00:01:26.780> when<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> keep<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.650> stitches
