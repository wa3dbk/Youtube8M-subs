00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.780
 Good morning, why not save money? 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.640
 business in today's environment is an act topic 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.390
 today's videoconference 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:14.579
 nations 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:17.240
 I think that today 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.739
 during the crisis 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.259
 concluding 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.479
 need to save on everything on 

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:22.989
 electricity 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:24.579
 on 

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.430
 online she 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.220
 with the tech company costs must be 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.670
 prone to sequestration 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.290
 for example, what happens in a bank 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.630
 days credit system every two 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.870
 weeks we're going 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.530
 I'm in this task to reduce 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.440
 but the costs 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.100
 I want to boast 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.750
 even percent forehead rubles 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.000
 that the ruble strengthened we reduced costs 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.740
 from the beginning of the year about thirty percent 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.520
 all costs 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.510
 that is, the chamber earlier un how did you say so 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.170
 all options area costs completely 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.250
 cut costs completely save 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.270
 on all this concerns 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.450
 colors 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.120
 internet phone calls and so on and 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.700
 so on sms messages 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.930
 full save it only so we can 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.650
 can't we are in crisis 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.980
 so we feel great in 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.150
 crisis because we live in crisis 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.740
 we have a situation here in '98 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.350
 so I urge you your 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.840
 business save on everything 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.470
 the only thing we do not save 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.090
 and we will never save it 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.960
 staff salary is she motivation 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.200
 staff is corporate what 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.010
 then things 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.460
 that is, the sauna is left from October 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.160
 from that year to October of this year 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.550
 increasing payroll widgets 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.950
 about 40 percent 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.230
 and including 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.070
 taking into account the ruble devaluation 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.680
 why because in order to have 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.970
 best shots 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.990
 gone financial late it's very 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.700
 competitive and we have very happy 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.370
 talented people and charm 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.850
 and meters previous column cases 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.420
 you probably remember there were some 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.299
 our managers engage 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.489
 prompted me so such a valence 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.079
 we always 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.839
 we understand that they should have 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.079
 very good and very financially 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.879
 the percentage is motivated therefore the only thing 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.689
 what business can not save them crisis 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.099
 meanwhile, the west crisis is 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.219
 material motivation and gave it 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.689
 salaries and rituals 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:39.059
 whole 

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.749
 In short, you understand you can not save on 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.399
 people because the most recent teaches 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:44.949
 what can you come up with a crisis 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.049
 just start saving on payment 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.879
 labor of their employees 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.209
 employees yanao and wages this 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.569
 that way is right 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.729
 what's your boat starting 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.309
 drowning hike i mean it's like having 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.789
 using the ship baku brothers islam the whole 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.109
 crew 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.149
 save on everything 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.130
 including 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.110
 toilet paper we never save 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.139
 on their people employees 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.369
 can be cut 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.629
 but not 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.629
 the amount of cargo to reduce wages 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.199
 I think that lower wages 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:21.199
 so not only de motivation is just 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.889
 termination of all relations with his 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.489
 right 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.319
 pay cut 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.459
 relationship to your employees 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.139
 thank you bye
