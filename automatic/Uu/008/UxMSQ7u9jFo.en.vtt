 I find you for a video a little 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.890
 different from usual it's nice 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 I wanted to give you a message 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 positive 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.530
 I wanted to tell you that you have to 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.750
 that you love yourself com helps you 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 I want you to stop 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.350
 compare to others wanting to be a 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.029
 little more like her a little more like 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.010
 him a little less as if there is a no 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.470
 more like that I want you 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.939
 learn to love yourself and if there is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.619
 something to improve is what there is to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.550
 inside of you and not to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 outdoors 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.770
 I want I'm sick of it I know 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.880
 it's super easy to compare 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.739
 to the roads and to tell each other I'm not 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 pretty much I passed as if I 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.070
 speak it's like that look at my hair 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.780
 are too curly look but I do 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.829
 are never smooth I'm not coming I'm coming 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.780
 to do nothing with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.520
 look at my clothes looking at her 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.289
 she dresses well and I 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 dress up superman i'm not fashionable 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.270
 I want to stop you from 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.399
 think like that I want you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.289
 teach an enemy who you are and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 if there is something changed in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.270
 you will be something inside 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 it will be the fact of being even more 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.000
 nice more dishes to forgive more 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.409
 but not to change your hair 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.630
 just to look like someone doubt 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.729
 not suddenly become punk because 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.799
 that's what everybody does or a 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.170
 blow buy some top cigs because 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.360
 that's what's cool no I want that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.659
 you found your own style that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.890
 you find what you like what 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.049
 you really need for you 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.520
 feel good what is your thing is 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.560
 not what is the other thing that is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.689
 cool because believe me what is 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.970
 cool uncertain sick of your city 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.770
 will not be later and in general that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.260
 this is only the period so frankly 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.940
 it's not even worth it 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.280
 matt in question in relation to that and of 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.800
 you're torturing the mind I know it's 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.330
 so easy to say to my 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.240
 intel looks she is so beautiful 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.830
 gone oh oh there ever 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 so be like her but you are 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.870
 largely enough as you are 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.940
 there is no need to change who you lcc 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.840
 here you are you should be issued for 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.460
 who are you 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.620
 so that does not mean that everyone 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.840
 is perfect on the contrary we all have 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.370
 flaws but now I want you 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.680
 stop you torture especially on 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.350
 the appearance is super important 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.760
 to love who we are and believe me we have 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.840
 all complexes 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.310
 we all have little things that we 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.780
 would like to change and there is no harm 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.900
 to work for that there is no harm in 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 take care of yourself for precisely 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 to succeed in loving each other more, but one must not 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.790
 not to torture make efforts that's 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.010
 well especially when the goal is to 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.290
 to love oneself more is to arrive at for example 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.470
 and puts his body or to have a better 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.870
 body one body plus one but it's not 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.450
 good neither for your mind nor for your 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.280
 body of you constantly torture in 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.410
 telling you oh there I'm too bad 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.810
 no, then I want you to stop that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.370
 from today and that you learn to 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.890
 to love you and to take good 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.400
 decisions for your body and for your 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.709
 mind 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.750
 and here I really wanted to 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.880
 say that because I meet people 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.600
 every day who does not feel well 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.510
 in their skin 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.370
 we know important so important 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.440
 of these mines had only one body then 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.250

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.630
