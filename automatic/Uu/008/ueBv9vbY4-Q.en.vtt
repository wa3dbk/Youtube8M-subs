00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
the level of the wine in your bottle it

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.849 
the level of the wine in your bottle it
fills<00:00:30.109> right<00:00:30.350> to<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:30.590> base<00:00:30.800> of<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:32.119> filler

00:00:32.849 --> 00:00:32.859 
fills right to the base of the filler

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:34.930 
fills right to the base of the filler
there's<00:00:33.859> also<00:00:34.039> a<00:00:34.219> little<00:00:34.370> set<00:00:34.670> screw<00:00:34.699> over

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
there's also a little set screw over

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.459 
there's also a little set screw over
here<00:00:35.210> and<00:00:35.449> what<00:00:35.569> this<00:00:35.749> suggests<00:00:35.899> is<00:00:36.379> the

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
here and what this suggests is the

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.479 
here and what this suggests is the
filling<00:00:37.309> rate<00:00:37.659> of<00:00:38.659> the<00:00:38.960> wine<00:00:39.249> so<00:00:40.249> we're<00:00:40.399> going

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
filling rate of the wine so we're going

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.349 
filling rate of the wine so we're going
to<00:00:40.639> insert<00:00:41.359> that<00:00:41.420> into<00:00:42.159> a<00:00:43.159> bottle<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:43.819> then

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
to insert that into a bottle and then

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.590 
to insert that into a bottle and then
the<00:00:44.839> hose<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.409> comes<00:00:45.649> over<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.010> top<00:00:46.600> there's

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
the hose that comes over the top there's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.379 
the hose that comes over the top there's
an<00:00:47.749> overflow<00:00:48.019> hose<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:48.829> we're<00:00:48.979> just<00:00:49.159> just

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.389 
an overflow hose so we're just just

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:52.389 
an overflow hose so we're just just
stick<00:00:50.389> that<00:00:50.510> into<00:00:50.719> another<00:00:51.019> bottle<00:00:51.589> and<00:00:51.769> the

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
stick that into another bottle and the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.309 
stick that into another bottle and the
only<00:00:52.549> thing<00:00:52.789> you<00:00:52.940> need<00:00:52.999> to<00:00:53.120> operate<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:53.749> is<00:00:54.109> you

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
only thing you need to operate it is you

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.649 
only thing you need to operate it is you
push<00:00:54.530> it<00:00:54.679> down<00:00:54.709> to<00:00:55.010> fill<00:00:55.299> when<00:00:56.299> the<00:00:56.479> wine

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:56.659 
push it down to fill when the wine

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:59.459 
push it down to fill when the wine
reaches<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:58.190> base<00:00:58.459> of<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.850> filler<00:00:59.089> that

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
reaches the base of the filler that

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.689 
reaches the base of the filler that
should<00:01:00.469> automatically<00:01:00.979> shut<00:01:01.249> off<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:01.549> it

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
should automatically shut off if it

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.539 
should automatically shut off if it
doesn't<00:01:01.969> automatically<00:01:02.479> shut<00:01:02.809> off<00:01:02.920> then<00:01:03.920> you

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
doesn't automatically shut off then you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.850 
doesn't automatically shut off then you

off<00:01:57.010> see<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:58.570> what<00:01:58.720> I'm<00:01:58.810> gonna<00:01:58.900> do<00:01:59.170> is

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
off see now what I'm gonna do is

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.580 
off see now what I'm gonna do is
probably<00:02:00.460> adjust<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.740> little<00:02:02.890> bit<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.880> get

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
probably adjust that a little bit to get

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.200 
probably adjust that a little bit to get
so<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.710> comes<00:02:06.070> up<00:02:06.250> in<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.430> back<00:02:06.670> of<00:02:06.820> my<00:02:06.910> bottle

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210

just<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.600> little<00:02:07.869> bit<00:02:07.990> further<00:02:11.670> try<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:14.850> no

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
just a little bit further try that no

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.540 
just a little bit further try that no
that's<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:17.650> about<00:02:17.890> where<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.130> want<00:02:18.490> it
