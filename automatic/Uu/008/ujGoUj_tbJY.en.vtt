that way it's not it's ice-cold when

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.310 
that way it's not it's ice-cold when
you're<00:01:59.009> done<00:01:59.130> training<00:01:59.430> and<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.329> used<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.899> stuff

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you're done training and I used to stuff

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.639 
you're done training and I used to stuff
a<00:02:01.619> shaker<00:02:02.479> inside<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.719> a<00:02:03.810> cooler<00:02:04.200> that's<00:02:04.500> what

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
a shaker inside of a cooler that's what

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.870 
a shaker inside of a cooler that's what
you<00:02:04.710> got<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> idea<00:02:05.130> for<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.340> yeah<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.850> I

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
you got the idea for that yeah and I

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.800 
you got the idea for that yeah and I
thought<00:02:06.060> why<00:02:06.210> wouldn't<00:02:06.420> we<00:02:06.479> just<00:02:06.659> make<00:02:06.780> some

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
thought why wouldn't we just make some

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.449 
thought why wouldn't we just make some
had<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.530> may<00:02:07.649> find<00:02:07.920> someone<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.190> make<00:02:08.340> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
had you may find someone to make this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.369 
had you may find someone to make this
you<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.729> looks<00:02:08.879> complicated<00:02:09.209> yeah<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:09.810> own<00:02:10.200> an

send it over to a manufacturer and

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.480 
send it over to a manufacturer and
produce<00:02:16.390> -<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:17.080> is<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.230> this<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.770> prototype

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
produce - this is a this is a prototype

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.970 
produce - this is a this is a prototype
and<00:02:18.880> we<00:02:19.450> expect<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.840> have<00:02:19.990> these<00:02:20.709> available

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
and we expect to have these available

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.130 
and we expect to have these available
for<00:02:21.250> sale<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.700> finished<00:02:22.030> by<00:02:22.120> say<00:02:22.510> fourth<00:02:23.050> of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
for sale and finished by say fourth of

July

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.510 
July
now<00:02:23.620> how<00:02:23.800> much<00:02:23.920> would<00:02:24.100> something<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.430> this

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
now how much would something like this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.880 
now how much would something like this
cost<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:25.120> retail<00:02:25.630> for<00:02:25.780> $29.99<00:02:26.500> that's

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
cost a retail for $29.99 that's

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.559 
cost a retail for $29.99 that's
reasonable<00:02:27.400> now<00:02:27.580> where<00:02:28.090> can<00:02:28.209> you<00:02:28.270> buy<00:02:28.420> them

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
reasonable now where can you buy them

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.750 
reasonable now where can you buy them
we're<00:02:29.560> gonna<00:02:29.650> well<00:02:29.920> we're<00:02:30.010> distributing<00:02:30.550> them
