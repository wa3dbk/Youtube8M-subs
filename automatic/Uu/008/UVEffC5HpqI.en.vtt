SD card you're gonna navigate to it's

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.420 
SD card you're gonna navigate to it's
gonna<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.760> like<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.410> you'll<00:00:52.410> open<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:52.770> se

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
gonna be like this you'll open up se

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.170 
gonna be like this you'll open up se
cell<00:00:54.360> map<00:00:54.570> underscore<00:00:55.289> en<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.030> you'll<00:00:57.030> go

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
cell map underscore en and you'll go

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.110 
cell map underscore en and you'll go
down<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> miscellaneous<00:00:58.020> data<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.559> T<00:00:59.120> open

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
down to miscellaneous data for T open

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.720 
down to miscellaneous data for T open
that<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.230> go<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> textures<00:01:01.859> now<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
that up and go to textures now if you

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.850 
that up and go to textures now if you
notice<00:01:02.940> there's<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.180> lot<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.960> textures<00:01:04.379> that's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
notice there's a lot of textures that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.730 
notice there's a lot of textures that's
because<00:01:05.159> every<00:01:05.519> character<00:01:05.909> has<00:01:06.270> four<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.990> guess

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
because every character has four I guess

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.240 
because every character has four I guess
five<00:01:07.979> five<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.150> battle<00:01:09.780> portraits<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.159> we

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
five five or more battle portraits so we

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
five five or more battle portraits so we
have<00:01:11.340> Mario<00:01:11.670> Mario<00:01:11.909> Mario<00:01:12.150> Mario<00:01:12.570> all<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.590> way

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
have Mario Mario Mario Mario all the way

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.280 
have Mario Mario Mario Mario all the way
down<00:01:13.850> we<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.150> this<00:01:15.470> over<00:01:16.470> 250<00:01:17.430> images<00:01:18.360> to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
down we can see this over 250 images to

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.539 
down we can see this over 250 images to
make<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> really<00:01:19.830> easy<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.159> spot<00:01:20.220> we're

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
make this really easy to spot we're

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.630 
make this really easy to spot we're
gonna<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.909> edit<00:01:21.210> Samus<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.560> um<00:01:25.310> lime<00:01:26.310> one<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
gonna just edit Samus the um lime one I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.590 
gonna just edit Samus the um lime one I
guess<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:29.159> you're<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.600> desired

guess so when you're at the desired
battle<00:01:31.110> portrait<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.280> export<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:35.159> put

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
battle portrait you can export it to put

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.710 
battle portrait you can export it to put
it<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.460> your<00:01:35.549> desktop<00:01:36.860> save<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.540> should<00:01:39.540> pop<00:01:39.659> up

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
it on your desktop save it should pop up

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.460 
it on your desktop save it should pop up

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
let's say a Samus that looks like is all

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.469 
let's say a Samus that looks like is all
black<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.070> looks<00:01:53.280> evil<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.030> want<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.390> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
black and looks evil and you want one of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.910 
black and looks evil and you want one of
the<00:01:54.659> battle<00:01:54.990> portraits<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> look<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.740> way

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
the battle portraits to look that way

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620 
the battle portraits to look that way
make<00:01:56.460> sure<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> use<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:56.939> already<00:01:57.450> made

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
make sure to use your already made

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.060 
make sure to use your already made
texture<00:01:58.110> for<00:01:58.290> reference<00:01:58.740> when<00:01:59.040> you're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
texture for reference when you're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.179 
texture for reference when you're
designing<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.790> new<00:02:00.030> one<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.950> most<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.100> these

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
designing this new one as most of these

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.130 
designing this new one as most of these
will<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> recolor<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> looks<00:02:03.719> good

this<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.320> just<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.620> show<00:02:46.800> you<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:47.100> it's<00:02:47.250> being

this is just to show you that it's being

this is just to show you that it's being
done<00:02:48.060> and<00:02:49.340> obviously<00:02:50.340> when<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.270> do<00:02:51.360> it<00:02:51.480> you'll

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
done and obviously when you do it you'll

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.410 
done and obviously when you do it you'll
do<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> recolor<00:02:52.200> if<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.730> really<00:02:53.970> wanted<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.209> show

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
do a recolor if I really wanted to show

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.320 
do a recolor if I really wanted to show
you<00:02:54.480> something<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.050> could<00:02:55.380> um<00:02:56.270> recolor<00:02:57.270> it

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
you something I could um recolor it

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
you something I could um recolor it
myself<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:57.989> that<00:02:58.020> might<00:02:58.260> be<00:02:58.290> tricky<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.770> show

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
myself but that might be tricky to show

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.400 
myself but that might be tricky to show
you<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.730> actually<00:03:00.150> recolor<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.810> not<00:03:01.140> just

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
you that's actually recolor and not just

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.680 
you that's actually recolor and not just
what<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.070> actually<00:03:02.220> was<00:03:02.640> so<00:03:03.150> big<00:03:03.360> X<00:03:03.510> will

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
what it actually was so big X will

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.590 
what it actually was so big X will
really<00:03:03.900> illustrate<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.500> best<00:03:07.580> this<00:03:11.600> so

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
really illustrate it the best this so

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.990 
really illustrate it the best this so
once<00:03:12.780> you've<00:03:12.930> done<00:03:13.140> your<00:03:13.200> mod<00:03:13.500> of<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:14.000> and

once you've done your mod of this and
you<00:03:15.660> think<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.020> looks<00:03:16.170> pretty<00:03:16.380> cool<00:03:17.390> file<00:03:18.390> save

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
cool if you notice the quality went way

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.970 
cool if you notice the quality went way
down<00:03:54.150> when<00:03:54.510> we<00:03:54.660> put<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.170> in<00:03:55.320> and<00:03:55.500> that's

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
down when we put it in and that's

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.300 
down when we put it in and that's
because<00:03:56.370> we<00:03:56.549> added<00:03:56.820> red<00:03:57.330> and<00:03:58.100> if<00:03:59.100> you've

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
because we added red and if you've

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.610 
because we added red and if you've
watched<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.760> other<00:04:00.230> texture<00:04:01.230> editing

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
watched the other texture editing

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.949 
watched the other texture editing
tutorials<00:04:02.220> you'll<00:04:02.430> know<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.580> each<00:04:03.450> texture

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
tutorials you'll know that each texture

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.530 
tutorials you'll know that each texture
has<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.200> limit<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.310> number<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.820> different

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
has a limit to number of different

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.690 
has a limit to number of different
colors<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.049> by<00:04:07.560> adding<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:08.040> red<00:04:08.370> what<00:04:08.580> we

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
colors so by adding that red what we

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.370 
colors so by adding that red what we
actually<00:04:09.030> did<00:04:09.150> was<00:04:09.180> remove<00:04:09.870> some<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.200> the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
actually did was remove some of the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.020 
actually did was remove some of the
green<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.860> actually<00:04:11.280> removed<00:04:11.579> if<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.910> can

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
green and actually removed if you can

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.420 
green and actually removed if you can
see<00:04:12.180> some<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.660> red<00:04:12.870> shades<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.250> looks

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
see some of the red shades so it looks

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.860 
see some of the red shades so it looks
like<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> really<00:04:14.820> harsh<00:04:15.060> red<00:04:15.360> on<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:15.570> really

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
like a really harsh red on a really

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.870 
like a really harsh red on a really
harsh<00:04:16.140> green<00:04:16.470> this<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.370> so<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.640> it<00:04:17.760> won't

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
harsh green this is so that it won't

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.240 
harsh green this is so that it won't
corrupt<00:04:18.350> me<00:04:19.350> not<00:04:19.500> corrupt<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:19.919> won't<00:04:20.040> freeze
