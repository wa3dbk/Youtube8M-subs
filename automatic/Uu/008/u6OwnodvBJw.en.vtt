along<00:00:24.330> those<00:00:24.420> lines<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:25.050> require<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
along those lines that require me to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.490 
along those lines that require me to
sort<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.859> change<00:00:26.130> my<00:00:26.430> tactics<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.029> bit<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.810> this

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
sort of change my tactics a bit so this

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.599 
sort of change my tactics a bit so this
is<00:00:28.529> where<00:00:28.800> we're<00:00:28.920> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.099> kiss<00:00:29.279> goodbye<00:00:29.460> to

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is where we're going to kiss goodbye to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.160 
is where we're going to kiss goodbye to
this<00:00:29.789> prison<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.779> not<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.900> only<00:00:30.990> reason

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
this prison but it's not the only reason

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.030 
this prison but it's not the only reason
we<00:00:31.980> had<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> lot<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.309> issues<00:00:32.520> with<00:00:32.759> them

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
we had a lot of issues with them

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.530 
we had a lot of issues with them
crashing<00:00:35.040> which<00:00:35.700> hopefully<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.210> be<00:00:36.270> fixed

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
crashing which hopefully will be fixed

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.130 
crashing which hopefully will be fixed
in<00:00:36.780> alpha<00:00:37.050> 7<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.219> would<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.340> good<00:00:38.960> we<00:00:39.960> also

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
in alpha 7 so that would be good we also

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.940 
in alpha 7 so that would be good we also
had<00:00:40.410> some<00:00:41.100> issues<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:42.260> our<00:00:43.260> prison

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
had some issues with them our prison

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
had some issues with them our prison
that<00:00:44.070> wouldn't<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.370> fixable<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> riots

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
that wouldn't be fixable like the riots

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.959 
that wouldn't be fixable like the riots
now<00:00:46.500> they're<00:00:46.770> gone<00:00:46.950> prisoners<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:47.820> many

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
now they're gone prisoners have so many

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
now they're gone prisoners have so many
needs<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.480> won't<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.750> fulfilled<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.590> it's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
needs that won't be fulfilled and it's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
needs that won't be fulfilled and it's
just<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.280> vicious<00:00:50.610> cycle<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just going to be a vicious cycle and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.490 
just going to be a vicious cycle and
we're<00:00:51.420> going<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.600> fall<00:00:51.840> into<00:00:52.050> madness<00:00:52.579> so<00:00:54.500> yeah

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
we're going to fall into madness so yeah

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
we're going to fall into madness so yeah
that's<00:00:56.250> that's<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.360> something<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.780> will

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
that's that's that's something that will

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.789 
that's that's that's something that will
happen<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.309> I<00:01:01.219> think<00:01:03.470> we<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.559> definitely

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
happen so and I think we are definitely

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.690 
happen so and I think we are definitely
going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> leave<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.640> behind

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
going to have to leave this one behind

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.969 
going to have to leave this one behind
and<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> wonder<00:01:10.080> what<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.409> could<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.710> what<00:01:10.890> we

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and so I wonder what we could do what we

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.539 
and so I wonder what we could do what we
could<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.610> sort<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.950> finish<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.400> guess

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
could do to sort of finish it up I guess

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
could do to sort of finish it up I guess
we<00:01:14.670> could<00:01:14.820> try<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.060> set<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.810> all<00:01:15.930> free

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
we could try and set them all free

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.800 
we could try and set them all free
that'd<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.590> really<00:01:16.740> funny<00:01:17.390> let's<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.600> let's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
