hi I'm Chris Wallace from walnut Hollow
we've<00:00:03.540> been<00:00:03.750> talking<00:00:04.170> about<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.560> creative

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
we've been talking about the creative

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.010 
we've been talking about the creative
versa<00:00:05.190> tool<00:00:05.549> and<00:00:05.940> today<00:00:06.270> we're<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> talk

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
versa tool and today we're going to talk

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.169 
versa tool and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.470> transfer<00:00:08.099> point<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.910> things

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
about the transfer point and the things

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.310 
about the transfer point and the things
you<00:00:09.389> can<00:00:09.570> do<00:00:09.750> with<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:11.179> so<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.840> attached

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
you can do with it so I have attached

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.070 
you can do with it so I have attached
the<00:00:13.769> transfer<00:00:14.429> point<00:00:14.730> on<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.570> end<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the transfer point on to the end of the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.609 
the transfer point on to the end of the
creative<00:00:16.590> versa<00:00:16.770> tool<00:00:17.130> using<00:00:17.609> my<00:00:17.760> pliers<00:00:18.090> and

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
creative versa tool using my pliers and

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.370 
creative versa tool using my pliers and
I<00:00:19.619> don't<00:00:20.460> use<00:00:20.760> this<00:00:21.060> usually<00:00:21.689> for<00:00:22.080> wood

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
I don't use this usually for wood

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.720 
I don't use this usually for wood
burning<00:00:23.180> but<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.689> can<00:00:25.050> if<00:00:25.439> you're<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
burning but you can if you're in need of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.959 
burning but you can if you're in need of
polka<00:00:27.300> dots<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:28.560> sure<00:00:28.859> makes<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.340> great<00:00:30.230> big<00:00:31.230> dot

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
polka dots it sure makes a great big dot

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
polka dots it sure makes a great big dot
so<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:33.690> put<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.079> down<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so you would just put it down on to the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.110 
so you would just put it down on to the
surface<00:00:35.809> let<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> heat<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.460> burning<00:00:38.969> and

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
surface let the heat do the burning and

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.750 
surface let the heat do the burning and
you've<00:00:42.120> got<00:00:42.390> big<00:00:43.290> dots<00:00:44.180> but<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:46.770> most<00:00:47.039> common

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
you've got big dots but the most common

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
you've got big dots but the most common
thing<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.329> use<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:49.020> tool<00:00:49.410> for<00:00:49.440> or<00:00:50.160> use

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
thing that we use this tool for or use

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.200 
thing that we use this tool for or use
the<00:00:50.879> point<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.719> transfer<00:00:52.620> point<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.460> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the point the transfer point for is to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.090 
the point the transfer point for is to
transfer<00:00:54.960> images<00:00:55.489> onto<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.960> surface<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
transfer images onto a surface so you

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.580 
transfer images onto a surface so you
could<00:00:59.340> transfer<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> wood<00:01:00.719> surface<00:01:00.930> or

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
could transfer on to a wood surface or

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.320 
could transfer on to a wood surface or
onto<00:01:02.129> fabric<00:01:04.250> anything<00:01:05.250> that's<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:06.090> going<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
onto fabric anything that's not going to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.969 
onto fabric anything that's not going to
burn<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:08.180> I'll<00:01:09.180> show<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> do<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
burn and I'll show you how to do that I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.609 
burn and I'll show you how to do that I
just<00:01:11.310> cut<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.880> image<00:01:12.390> out<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.990> bottom<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
just cut this image out of the bottom of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.910 
just cut this image out of the bottom of
the<00:01:13.680> paper<00:01:14.299> make<00:01:15.299> sure<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.020> you're<00:01:16.290> using<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the paper make sure that you're using a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
the paper make sure that you're using a
laser<00:01:17.460> copy<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:19.640> what<00:01:20.640> happens<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.840> heat

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
laser copy and what happens is the heat

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.830 
laser copy and what happens is the heat
from<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> tool<00:01:23.390> will<00:01:24.920> transfer<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:29.840> toner

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
from the tool will transfer the toner

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.240 
from the tool will transfer the toner
from<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> laser<00:01:32.040> copy<00:01:32.810> onto<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> surface<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
from the laser copy onto the surface so

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
from the laser copy onto the surface so
I've<00:01:35.579> already<00:01:36.090> I've<00:01:36.360> taped<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.960> on<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
I've already I've taped this on to the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.230 
I've already I've taped this on to the
top<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.310> wood<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.030> I've<00:01:39.540> already<00:01:39.810> started

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
top of my wood and I've already started

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
top of my wood and I've already started
transferring<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.509> image<00:01:43.220> you<00:01:44.220> can<00:01:44.460> transfer

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
transferring the image you can transfer

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.240 
transferring the image you can transfer
this<00:01:45.119> image<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.680> back<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
this image so that you can go back and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.649 
this image so that you can go back and
use<00:01:47.460> marker<00:01:48.420> pins<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:49.259> different<00:01:50.009> things

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
use marker pins or different things

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.980 
use marker pins or different things
pencils<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:52.079> color<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.840> go

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
pencils to color it in or I could go

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.370 
pencils to color it in or I could go
back<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.740> would<00:01:56.280> burn<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> design<00:01:57.390> so

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
back and and would burn on the design so

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.590 
back and and would burn on the design so
once<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.549> tape<00:02:00.090> your<00:02:00.170> image<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.380> place<00:02:01.619> I

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
once you tape your image in place I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.700 
once you tape your image in place I
usually<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:04.020> test<00:02:04.439> my<00:02:04.680> tool<00:02:05.189> onto<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:07.200> surface

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
usually will test my tool onto a surface

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.729 
usually will test my tool onto a surface
just<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.580> make<00:02:08.789> sure<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:09.959> too<00:02:10.410> hot

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
just to make sure that it's not too hot

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.350 
just to make sure that it's not too hot
or<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.970> it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
or that it's

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.240 
or that it's
not<00:02:12.990> two<00:02:14.300> it's<00:02:15.300> hot<00:02:15.870> enough<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.680> order<00:02:16.950> to

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
not two it's hot enough in order to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.600 
not two it's hot enough in order to
transfer<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> start<00:02:19.860> using<00:02:20.430> a

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
transfer and then I start using a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.060 
transfer and then I start using a
circular<00:02:20.910> motion<00:02:21.210> and<00:02:21.960> you<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.710> that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
circular motion and you can see that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.540 
circular motion and you can see that
I've<00:02:23.250> got<00:02:24.090> some<00:02:24.440> burnishing<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.040> back<00:02:26.280> of

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
I've got some burnishing on the back of

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.900 
I've got some burnishing on the back of
my<00:02:26.870> paper<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:31.140> using<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.830> circular<00:02:32.130> motion

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
my paper and I'm using a circular motion

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.220 
my paper and I'm using a circular motion
and<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.330> keep<00:02:33.660> moving<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.490> paper<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:36.330> can

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
and I keep moving on the paper I can

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.280 
and I keep moving on the paper I can
pull<00:02:37.590> up<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.070> see<00:02:38.400> how<00:02:38.760> my<00:02:39.000> image<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.750> going

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
pull up and see how my image is going

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.760 
pull up and see how my image is going
and<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:41.370> see<00:02:41.640> that<00:02:42.030> I<00:02:42.360> still<00:02:43.140> have<00:02:43.410> to<00:02:43.590> go

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
and you can see that I still have to go

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.350 
and you can see that I still have to go
back<00:02:43.800> into<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.820> one<00:02:45.150> blank<00:02:45.540> area<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:47.210> I<00:02:48.210> do

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
back into this one blank area and I do

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.750 
back into this one blank area and I do
that<00:02:49.160> always<00:02:50.160> keeping<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.180> circular<00:02:51.930> motion

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
that always keeping a circular motion

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.380 
that always keeping a circular motion
making<00:02:53.760> sure<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:54.570> it's<00:02:55.580> nice<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.640> smooth

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
making sure that it's nice and smooth

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.460 
making sure that it's nice and smooth
all<00:02:57.660> over<00:02:58.850> sometimes<00:02:59.850> if<00:03:00.420> there's<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.959> lot<00:03:01.290> of

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
all over sometimes if there's a lot of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.020 
all over sometimes if there's a lot of
toner<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.820> paper<00:03:03.150> will<00:03:03.570> stick<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:05.790> won't

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
toner the paper will stick and you won't

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.100 
toner the paper will stick and you won't
be<00:03:06.240> able<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.600> pull<00:03:06.990> it<00:03:07.140> off<00:03:07.410> as<00:03:07.740> easily<00:03:08.870> but<00:03:09.870> if

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
be able to pull it off as easily but if

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.520 
be able to pull it off as easily but if
you<00:03:10.320> go<00:03:10.530> back<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.070> heat<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.610> area<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:12.630> then

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
you go back and heat that area and then

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.150 
you go back and heat that area and then
remove<00:03:13.800> it<00:03:14.340> it'll<00:03:15.150> come<00:03:15.390> off<00:03:15.450> so<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.830> see

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
to make sure that you use a laser copy a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.060 
to make sure that you use a laser copy a
regular<00:04:14.280> inkjet<00:04:15.000> won't<00:04:15.390> work<00:04:15.690> as<00:04:16.019> well<00:04:16.049> as<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
regular inkjet won't work as well as the

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.550 
regular inkjet won't work as well as the
laser<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.820> it's<00:04:18.390> because<00:04:18.840> of<00:04:19.080> the<00:04:19.229> toner

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
laser and it's because of the toner

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.760 
laser and it's because of the toner
that's<00:04:20.010> used<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.820> laser<00:04:21.030> copy

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
that's used in the laser copy

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.950 
that's used in the laser copy
so<00:04:22.770> that's<00:04:23.040> all<00:04:23.250> about<00:04:23.400> transferring<00:04:24.360> on<00:04:24.630> to

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
so that's all about transferring on to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.700 
so that's all about transferring on to
wood<00:04:25.260> or<00:04:25.700> fabric<00:04:26.700> or<00:04:27.240> anything<00:04:27.720> using<00:04:28.560> your
