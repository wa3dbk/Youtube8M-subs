00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
how well you can see that starts to sink

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
how well you can see that starts to sink
automatically<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> setting<00:00:35.430> I've

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
automatically that's the setting I've

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.819 
automatically that's the setting I've
got<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.090> iTunes<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.230> also<00:00:37.380> worth<00:00:37.620> noting

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
got in iTunes and it's also worth noting

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
got in iTunes and it's also worth noting
that<00:00:38.070> you'll<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:39.120> backup<00:00:39.780> doesn't

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
that you'll see a backup doesn't

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
that you'll see a backup doesn't
actually<00:00:40.469> happen<00:00:40.800> here<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.190> go<00:00:41.309> straight<00:00:41.610> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
actually happen here it go straight to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
actually happen here it go straight to
syncing<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> contacts<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.870> calendars<00:00:43.200> and

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
syncing the contacts and calendars and

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.290 
syncing the contacts and calendars and
stuff<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:44.309> because<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:44.910> option<00:00:45.059> up

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
stuff that's because I have an option up

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.250 
stuff that's because I have an option up
here<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.960> Wi-Fi<00:00:46.379> sync<00:00:46.620> menu<00:00:48.260> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
here this is that a Wi-Fi sync menu to

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
here this is that a Wi-Fi sync menu to
disable<00:00:50.010> iTunes<00:00:50.340> backups<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:51.120> makes<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
disable iTunes backups just makes the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.760 
disable iTunes backups just makes the
whole<00:00:51.420> process<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.899> bit<00:00:52.140> faster<00:00:54.260> okay<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.320> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
whole process a bit faster okay so that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.959 
whole process a bit faster okay so that
sync<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.100> pretty<00:00:56.280> quick<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:56.640> I've<00:00:56.820> not

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
sync was pretty quick because I've not

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.990 
sync was pretty quick because I've not
actually<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:58.050> any<00:00:58.289> music<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.280> copy<00:00:59.699> over<00:00:59.969> to

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
actually set any music to copy over to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
actually set any music to copy over to
the<00:01:00.180> phone<00:01:00.390> what<00:01:00.960> I'll<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> I've<00:01:02.280> got<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the phone what I'll do is I've got a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.260 
the phone what I'll do is I've got a
little<00:01:02.760> demo<00:01:02.940> playlist<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> I'm<00:01:06.119> gonna

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
little demo playlist here so I'm gonna

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.899 
little demo playlist here so I'm gonna
add<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.930> couple<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.770> tracks<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.400> let's<00:01:08.760> go

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
add a couple of tracks to that let's go

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.240 
add a couple of tracks to that let's go
Sarah<00:01:09.210> Smith<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.600> there<00:01:12.830> so<00:01:13.830> I'm<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:13.920> adding

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
Sarah Smith on there so I'm just adding

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.450 
Sarah Smith on there so I'm just adding
those<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.670> playlist<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.340> into

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
those to the playlist now so I go into

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.859 
those to the playlist now so I go into
the<00:01:17.640> phone

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.440 

and<00:01:23.289> you<00:01:23.500> can<00:01:23.679> see<00:01:23.979> it's<00:01:25.170> sinking

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.969 

as<00:01:30.020> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.229> see<00:01:30.380> the<00:01:30.590> phone's<00:01:30.740> not<00:01:30.920> plugged

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
as you can see the phone's not plugged

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.030 
as you can see the phone's not plugged
in<00:01:31.310> I<00:01:31.490> was<00:01:31.789> thinking<00:01:32.119> just<00:01:32.270> not

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.980 

so<00:01:39.580> now<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:39.820> copying<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.300> music<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.810> first

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
so now it's copying the music the first

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.450 
so now it's copying the music the first
one<00:01:41.260> usually<00:01:41.560> takes<00:01:41.800> longer<00:01:42.100> than<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.280> others

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
one usually takes longer than the others

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.149 
one usually takes longer than the others
SEC<00:01:45.460> boards<00:01:45.730> going<00:01:45.880> over<00:01:46.090> now<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:48.330> there's<00:01:49.330> a

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.130 

so<00:01:52.700> obviously<00:01:52.970> it's<00:01:53.119> slower<00:01:53.299> than<00:01:53.479> USB<00:01:53.720> but

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
so obviously it's slower than USB but

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.020 
so obviously it's slower than USB but
it's<00:01:54.290> not<00:01:54.439> horrendously<00:01:55.159> slow<00:01:55.520> it's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
it's not horrendously slow it's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.560 
it's not horrendously slow it's
definitely<00:01:56.479> pretty<00:01:56.750> usable<00:02:01.330> just<00:02:02.330> wait<00:02:02.479> for

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
definitely pretty usable just wait for

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.889 
definitely pretty usable just wait for
this<00:02:02.659> to<00:02:02.720> finish<00:02:02.869> now<00:02:05.920> okay<00:02:06.920> all<00:02:07.280> right<00:02:07.460> we'll

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
this to finish now okay all right we'll

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:16.309 
this to finish now okay all right we'll
close<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.080> app

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.610 

and<00:02:17.319> as<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.470> music<00:02:17.800> play<00:02:22.110> it's<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.230> little<00:02:23.500> bit

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
and as a music play it's a little bit

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.199 
and as a music play it's a little bit
more<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.040> an<00:02:24.550> in-depth<00:02:25.000> look<00:02:25.090> at<00:02:25.360> why<00:02:25.569> I<00:02:25.599> think

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
more of an in-depth look at why I think

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.320 
more of an in-depth look at why I think
it<00:02:28.209> goes<00:02:28.300> off<00:02:28.599> iTunes<00:02:28.780> disconnected<00:02:29.970> okay<00:02:30.970> so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
it goes off iTunes disconnected okay so

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.080 
it goes off iTunes disconnected okay so
I<00:02:31.360> hope<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.660> answers<00:02:31.959> some<00:02:31.989> questions

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
I hope that answers some questions

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.360 
I hope that answers some questions
thanks<00:02:34.090> very<00:02:34.239> much
