00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.780
 Hello, I want to give your 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.490
 Attention to a small video review video 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.490
 off road tires 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.379
 michelin wilfried 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.520
 first generation still tire width 2 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.520
 25 by 26 inches 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:33.090
 it means the tire is intended for 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.180
 severe conditions for rocky trails 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:44.160
 katanas screws ups and downs 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 I bought it in place instead of a cross mark 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.670
 model from maksisa 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.840
 so wonderful too sign 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 tire well Maksis have here but 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.219
 It seemed insufficient resin and therefore 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 it was during such mountain pokatushki 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.490
 replaced by this model means width 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.760
 corresponds to the stated 57 millimeters 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:16.920
 spike height in the center of about 5 millimeters 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.369
 has a pretty good pronounced bright 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.619
 pronounced lateral spikes pattern given 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.140
 tire tread pattern is very 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.450
 reminds drawing 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 such a wonderful continental tires 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.930
 explorer you see these oval here 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.930
 such 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.990
 oval design create that is when 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.240
 driving on hard ground with 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.120
 rectilinear work only these 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.000
 central spikes so the tire is very 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.980
 even good rolls for these types of 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.280
 the roof 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:56.680
 on asphalt and on rolled soil 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.070
 generally wonderful on asphalt 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.960
 of course it will not be intended 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.910
 quarter movement means tire 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.690
 directed forward one way behind 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.200
 here you can see another 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.280
 her front is taught background rushing really backwards 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:23.380
 true to respect copic of fate 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:28.120
 saving a tire a tire weighs 650 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.730
 gram light enough pleased here 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.600
 punctures mean it was a little prickly 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.550
 same as all the other tires what else 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.020
 tell clearly means a tire 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.590
 leaves such 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:46.530
 for each tire back this feeling is necessary 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:50.890
 tire for good warm feelings 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.600
 nice ride despite some 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:59.560
 cons can be put ahead she 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.940
 does not greatly affect the forward roll 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.430
 the wheel is not loaded but 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.910
 but on the slopes she does her business very much 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:14.170
 okay that means it inspired 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:20.140
 making this little movie when 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:23.110
 was buying nowhere was a video review review 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.780
 it's cool said but still on sites 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.910
 in photographs one but in life she 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.110
 completely different may be but 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.890
 Basically, this was in the photo 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.870
 she is not such a rubber and it looks like there is 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.000
 many sites of course on which 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.660
 You can read great sites by 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.700
 any tires in Ukraine is particular 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:49.930
 Villa Kiev Kharkiv site but also on 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:52.810
 other St. Petersburg there too, but the video is 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.290
 one photo is another opinion 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.860
 owner, in principle, no one 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.520
 canceled 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:05.730
 Well, if something is missed, ask 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.730
 questions in the comments will answer all
