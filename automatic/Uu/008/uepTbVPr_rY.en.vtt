00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
the best show ever I think I already

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.109 
the best show ever I think I already
said<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:10.979> retracting<00:01:11.790> myself

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
said that I'm like retracting myself

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.710 
said that I'm like retracting myself
it's<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.570> even<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> word<00:01:12.960> um<00:01:14.210> yeah<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:17.240> if<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
it's not even a word um yeah so if this

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.870 
it's not even a word um yeah so if this
video<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.770> making<00:01:19.950> any<00:01:20.280> sense<00:01:20.400> so

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
video is like not making any sense so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.560 
video is like not making any sense so
then<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.680> ignore<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> but<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.580> think

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
then you can just ignore it but I think

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.539
