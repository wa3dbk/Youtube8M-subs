 interfere with advertising media cross in the top 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.790
 right corner all hello 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.110
 with you tire taxis subscribe 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.179
 put likes 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.609
 add to favorites thank you all 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.260
 good view all is all 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.390
 hello with you alexander 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.519
 So today we talk about 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 iron balancing features 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.410
 the disk here is the iron disk basically he 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.070
 helped relatively clean dirty 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.059
 Of course it is not desirable to balance 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:38.430
 weights should be all shot here wearing 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.040
 Rubber principle to turn is also possible 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.020
 check the valve if it starts 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.530
 crack now increase 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.870
 it really needs to be changed, we change it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.530
 we will not be but this is seen preferably already 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 replaced here put on the machine 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:00.739
 put roughly tick marks y 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:05.610
 we won it yellowish turns 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.830
 tag that is you mark under the nipple that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.350
 us further on for that we are as always 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.720
 can you get the installer 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:20.900
 civic cmd-60 3d with computer monitor 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:28.110
 further further fixed the wheel 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.729
 set the ruler can also plane 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.070
 about your 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.320
 the width noticed at the canteen cargo well 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.659
 we will have such a lot 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.939
 options doctors balancing there 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.400
 stuffed or soil well let's say we have here 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.030
 Five options Well, we understand iron 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.670
 the disk will be padded 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.200
 scroll through 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.200
 make sure that we have tires exactly 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.590
 I need this grams of Ukrainians 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.810
 rubber us even now we need 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.400
 punch weights machine itself put 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:10.490
 principle on a certain set here 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:13.640
 joseph push next consider 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:20.600
 next weight here after which 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.050
 hammer beat gently turn on 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.050
 machine 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.750
 and then the wheel mask 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 balanced can also have 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.030
 proceed to remove and put the next 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.480
 wheel 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.740
 but we have here a special principle 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.000
 so we continue well here's a chance 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.610
 let's let's try 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.880
 to balance is wrong first of all 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.750
 we have not removed weights old not with this not 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.380
 from the other side 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.610
 Well collected wheel Well, you can 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.760
 carelessness well, so to do 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.700
 no further our put the line all as 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.630
 already showed traffic jam from Kosovo like 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.350
 it's our fault 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.300
 and here so at an altitude of 1 5 thousand let's find 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.740
 english load miles sums we 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.370
 we start to type the wheel balance 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.370
 weights 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.680
 right 10 novel here we have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.930
 clotted hopefully we give only again 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:34.210
 weight images on 30 gran coupe punch 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.800
 up to 1 degree on the main following our 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.170
 our next pillar race 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.670
 In principle, there is 8 grams of games 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.670
 primitive take punch 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.440
 but it turns out we 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.080
 how come up balanced his wheel 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.080
 balance he will explain incorrectly why 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.060
 for the reason that you are very little worth 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.250
 opposite the weight ie counterweight 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.590
 this holiday that is actually it 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.630
 lock is the wrong height 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.120
 contrary freight weights must 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.100
 be either in rows or one 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.730
 no other way so if you do 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.850
 so blue on the tire well, not really 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.760
 I advise you how it is a weight opposite the weight 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:29.669
 that is, let's say this is how we give hands 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.770
 we have 10 by 5 faces here 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.229
 jumped 15 35 that is georgia 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:39.000
 counterweight could be fixed let's say 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:41.220
 here 10 and somebody remove this principle 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.990
 is the same balancing the same 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:49.080
 the most from this side we get 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:52.350
 weight 30 grams counterweight weight at 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.919
 30 grams inside of course with offset 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.890
 but it is impossible to do this in his 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.580
 oh so we need to remove all these 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.360
 weights 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.160
 all for proper balancing 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.520
 special claws 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.520
 this this 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:22.460
 also withdraw from this side for 30 grams 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:22.460
 for right here and twist the wheel 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:38.919
 promo 10 grams and normally nail on 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.919
 12 top lose weight following and nail 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.590
 we twist 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.810
 the wheel is spinning and what we get 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.259
 drove the balance it says correctly 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.210
 40 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.759
 should not be dohrena weights 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.830
 contradict each other on this all with 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.280
 you were alexander thanks for your attention 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.280
 goodbye 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.410
 Thank you all for your attention with you 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.210
 alexander channel what on mounting rollt
