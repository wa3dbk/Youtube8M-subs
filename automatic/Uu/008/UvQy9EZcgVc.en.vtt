00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.050
 whatsapp people what is I hoping 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.669
 caused the banana me for me okay 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.910
 nickel and today we end up 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:25.809
 for a little tutorial on minecraft 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.160
 so I explain this to you after so I 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:29.079
 am just right here to tell you this is 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 maybe an exclusivity finally I have 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.700
 searched I did not find any videos 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.620
 so would have the chest here so I 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 think with that you have god understand 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.690
 it has something to do with tnt 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.350
 so it's just going to be 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.079
 create a tnt + + where an atomic bomb 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.120
 if you prefer then right away 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.310
 started then for what you need 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.620
 so it's cubes 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.079
 I took obsidian that's it 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.710
 goes better finally it does not explode from the 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:02.140
 tnt a bryce deposit lever and therefore 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.189
 propeller rails and mike hart ac2a 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:09.579
 tnt what are we going to do after the tnt and we 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.590
 will not make that lake too much you 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:13.899
 can do there finished but me so I 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 made a wall of 10 out of 10 with a 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:22.209
 height of 5 that spit and 40000 traffort 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:25.990
 so 1 2 3 4 will have to go 1 2 3 4 

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:30.399
 so that's pretty much like for 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.590
 the moment we go so we held a little 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:36.819
 just for yourself a million will put 5 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.179
 cola so in the middle what is here we go 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:42.630
 put a raÃ¯s have an attraction here 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.850
 how to break 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.249
 I hope he wants well iced little lake 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.279
 jean excuses me that's what makes him go 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:56.909
 be oriented by the theme our psys 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.909
 nonsense here 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.710
 here so we will go up 3 so the guard 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.560
 normally finally you see so that's 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.450
 1 2 3 it's good if we could do f 3 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.920
 so see it on strike I'm at 200 37 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 38 39 to the 240 when I'm in mode 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.400
 flash content the blind order by which the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.180
 csc tell yourself that there are a lot of layers 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:29.880
 for the web so there dared to put 3 is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:35.850
 so too much so it's up to k23 hop side 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:39.010
 So here I am I played my neck badly 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.610
 wallet a TV normally you put 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.100
 a block in front if possible not the tnt 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:55.690
 but me as I have that a block 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:03:00.130
 behind and I have my excuse so here is 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.610
 Maybe I'll pick this 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.730
 could be useful I think we no longer 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.730
 need 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:16.720
 now here we are going to undermine as well as a 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.239
 shit excuse me when these little fels 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.280
 is stronger I am tired but me 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.510
 I had to do everything this video I 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 finally found them I found that in 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.640
 coming back from high school I suffered a music 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.000
 lobby 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.870
 so you'll put yourself from here a 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.329
 rich blog and that's it so you go 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.590
 put hands because tnt and several 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.829
 places so how can we do 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.150
 since it will be on the rail I can you 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.190
 give a little advice if you go 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.040
 press space bar on shift in 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.819
 same absolute time blocked after you 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.459
 have tried to put 14 and stable do 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.590
 that and so there you will lift them 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.430
 charming the employee hop i have more too 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.049
 try to raise the alert 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.510
 so there you go add some in 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:11.400
 reject on the other hand not too much either 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.000
 otherwise it will spit the same things up 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.989
 important 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:25.320
 at the top we put a lever so at this 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:27.240
 block there we put the rails here and then 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.560
 good one can launch the bomb 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.270
 so it's true he's not very 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.370
 compact you can do it more 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.820
 compact where I do not think to render in 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:39.780
 removing that that is known to the contracts 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.830
 fewer resources 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.190
 I'm not but that 's it that's it 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:52.710
 a little more compact or lens there is 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:54.720
 voltage cemac herman powered then 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:00.090
 it is a propelled by the cross so 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:06.930
 this is normally here if I do not say 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:10.440
 no nonsense to stones that's sport 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:13.050
 So here you see, here is the big thing 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.900
 time it does and you can well 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.820
 sure to make it so flying or in a 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:22.680
 server if you want to foot a base that 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.240
 can be nice too up simulator so 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.780
 to compare on the phase includes a 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:33.990
 normal tnt it's like having straight 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:35.520
 his jokes a little it annoys me that they 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.710
 have small fruits excuse me again 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.789
 once it's because as I 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.020
 it would have been a long time since 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:46.740
 is lit up telling them that or anyway 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:51.660
 here it's because I'll have to 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:55.440
 limit added here's workers the hole of the 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.849
 kmt it's finally it's still not bad 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:02.310
 huh and in relation to that please 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.539
 heavy ferrand so you see after 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.780
 you can of course increase it by 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:09.050
 length do for example it's a 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:13.979
 times I tested squarely surrounded the 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.560
 surface traveled houston and do it 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.750
 enough also to make a roof and 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.919
 all but frankly that after if you 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.080
 are on a server I think you 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:24.210
 you have to banish MENT it the 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.409
 to spit the server as if 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.580
 you want sir is a small role 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:30.690
 and you want to make trash and a 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.699
 waiter and ben do that it will do you this 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.260
 will not that be so for this video 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:38.190
 is finished it's over 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.960
