00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.950
 to a new video of game with me 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.109
 toys 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.660
 we will now playmobil together 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.780
 buzzer of candy stand up 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.150
 First and foremost we have to do a lot 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.990
 Distribute sticker and we'll catch you now 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 Just with the roof on 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.380
 the good thing is that these stickers 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.119
 Numbered means that means he can 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.449
 nothing can go wrong 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 unless you stick the sticker 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:37.050
 somehow wrong but I have now 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:46.289
 a little practice in here 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:49.260
 ever the churches then come then 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.550
 this big banner here with the shake 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:01:03.080
 and the ice cream cone then we have here 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.400
 another strawberry and grapes again 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.409
 it's almost ours now 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 Awning because this is still missing 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.400
 whole strip 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.040
 we'll just catch that one now 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.040
 longest 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.930
 and then we come the side parts 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.390
 the stripes are wrong 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.130
 direction 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 Now we can do the roof 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.030
 sit on 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.869
 but there are still more missing 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:45.130
 stickers are still each 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:51.369
 lots left then we build next 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.810
 our table together with ours 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.470
 Customers also know what we all have 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:02.590
 sell and of course also 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:09.300
 a sticker then we still have it 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.300
 an ice or washing machine where such a 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:19.420
 Price drink comes out and there is allowed 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:24.790
 Of course, the sticker is not missing 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.280
 I just swapped the varieties as 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.360
 first comes orange and then 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.310
 strawberry 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.310
 then we have a trash can here 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.220
 the guests also for their waste 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.380
 can dispose of and of course on one 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.200
 matching stickers and an ice chest 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.579
 with the matching sticker of course then 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.670
 our checkout is still missing 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.910
 of course also a sticker club 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:00.430
 and on top of that are stickers 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.340
 that a bit crooked and im 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.400
 All three seem to be loaded with sweets 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.420
 to cost euro 70 we set the cash register 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.380
 now here 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.920
 And now there is still a lot 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.920
 to clue small parts namely 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.209
 these bottles are here all the sweets 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:37.260
 and also these bottles here with these 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:38.849
 all the stickers the rest of the sticker 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.670
 I'll stick to that quickly 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.409
 otherwise too long I just had 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.510
 said that the sweets are 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:49.079
 These are not sweets 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.530
 but different types of ice cream and the 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:56.010
 I'll just do it in ours 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.469
 Game did not offer the ice 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.889
 it melts then we have these parts 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:03.719
 here 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.150
 I'm not so sure what it is 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:11.870
 Maybe it should be so lotti holder 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.099
 or something but can also be flowers 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.449
 Unfortunately, I do not know 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:24.180
 we have four of these once in brown and 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:28.110
 once in such caramel colors and we 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.470
 Here are drinks with a straw 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:33.150
 then we have such stands here 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.720
 then the sweets in there to 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.680
 put 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:44.000
 a few apples and this little one 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:48.470
 subject and of course our figures once 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.470
 a man that could be the father 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:58.310
 a boy that could be the child 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:05:03.810
 Let's go one more girl too 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:08.310
 possibly a child of the father and here 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:11.190
 we still have the saleswoman and the 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.810
 I'm just behind the times now 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.190
 counter 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.960
 I'm finally coming to this 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.099
 What this is, I think so 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.379
 his popcorn 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.150
 I hope you liked my video
