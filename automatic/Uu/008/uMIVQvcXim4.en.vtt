00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 everyone we meet for a 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.520
 new video it was a video we 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.529
 did not ask me that it was 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.570
 how to whiten your teeth you have it 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.929
 asked their hall purchase request on my 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.980
 products from new york and especially we're going 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.949
 actually talk about the product 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 feist but not that so in fact there is 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.590
 several ways to whiten them 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.689
 teeth I looked a little bit on 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.269
 internet except the most 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.070
 natural would be lemon juice be 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.029
 in squat systran the deer is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 a wood of lemon juice 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.769
 it is true that lemon juice make the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.469
 lemon itself has an effect to a 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.309
 launderer would not I know 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.649
 that there are some who put themselves 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.250
 drops in the eyes to lighten 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.570
 their eyes here after months for the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 eyes it's really a method that I 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.629
 would not dare to test a game tells you 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 to see on the internet that you 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.730
 in any case interested in lemon juice 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.110
 white and also the nails and for me 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.050
 this is the really the most 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.030
 natural after the sweetest method 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 for me would still be 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.329
 baking soda 1 1 we put ourselves a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.280
 little baking soda on his 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.379
 toothbrush and I discovered a 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.930
 another method on the internet is water 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460
 oxygenated so we apply with a cotton 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.560
 stem 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.210
 personally I have not tested and I 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.680
 do not really know if I'm going to test the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.619
 I have no oxygenated water at home and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.729
 it makes me a little scared in fact me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.229
 the time product today I'm going 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.720
 you talk about it is the press product so 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.400
 it's a product that comes from the states 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 united you can not find like that in 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.659
 France and it's a product laundered its 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.430
 based on patches that we put on 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.979
 fallow deer so to say do a product is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.470
 different you force me I chose 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 the luxury white rogue so 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.450
 Professional effect is in 14 days 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 you let each day ask a 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.290
 half an hour the product why I had 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.430
 chose the one 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
 because 14 days is not too much 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 binding and half an hour yet 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 unless you go before products that 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.640
 we exposed two hours you have 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.710
 some peoples where they have to be left 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.570
 ask two hours and two hours with this 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.490
 patch on it you can not eat you 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.770
 can not see it's not very nice 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 one thing that I want to say before 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 to buy this product 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.479
 I really advise you to 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.800
 ask the dentists I think all 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.570
 the lenses to recognize pretty much 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.479
 this product or at worst you score a 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.890
 little is there inside but 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.840
 you ask for advice because that 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.370
 sensitize the ladies and I think that this 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.540
 product is not suitable for everyone 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.459
 it's still something very 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.520
 loud and we see there he will also tell you 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.810
 maybe the intensity that has to be taken 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.980
 so I chose this one by 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.590
 relation to the constraint 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.870
 and it's true that as I said in 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.520
 the video at the purchase I made myself a 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.410
 scary because I like you 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.600
 I said that if they read the ladies and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.489
 some girls had pains 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.140
 as much as I was in the us 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.090
 I have no fan at all I wanted to stop 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.770
 the treatment for gifts that I have trouble 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.630
 to my teeth I was afraid to pay the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.980
 dentists in the united states 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.260
 so I stopped treatment the tarpaulin 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.000
 and start over here personally I 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.950
 did not have zero sensitivity to the teeth so 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.150
 here I think it really depends 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.720
 people but it really takes 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.489
 to be preventable is actually gone to see 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.910
 its entirety really know these 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.019
 symbols of the good for his teeth or not 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.489
 so here's the product comes up as 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.989
 this is small patches me it me 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.850
 I have a lot of 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.190
 a good time and honestly I'm not 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.870
 not the rule in fact I 'm not this 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.489
 they asked because of 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.480
 first matches I found that there 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.430
 still had a good difference 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.930
 on my teeth and I think that I am 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.810
 serve only occasionally I have not 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.170
 want to damage the countries of MÃ©doc and in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.250
 more of that if it's already 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.040
 effect I did not beg to actually see 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.290
 some like in a TV ad 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.510
 it's Roman to arms here are the teeth of a 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.130
 more beautiful and I find that here I have 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.900
 not want to attack too much but 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.000
 in 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.489
 currently so I'm going to show you 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.170
 how to ask the one thing also very 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.329
 important is before you ask it 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.549
 product and do not wash them 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.829
 teeth because what we resigned on 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.390
 the times it allows to protect them so 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.700
 it's still pretty important 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.349
 to wash your hands and especially do not 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.299
 not apply it on the gum 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.760
 so I will try to show you 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.680
 how I apply them so I see myself 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.689
 interludes bathroom we will 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.090
 finally apply in fact the producer 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.370
 so is as I told you it's 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.780
 little pouches with patches I do not 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.940
 I'm not washing my teeth it's very very 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.709
 I say quiet significant because it 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.909
 will make you even more aware of 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.600
 teeth brush your teeth before 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:21.229
 prick the product so the product gets 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.720
 present like these it's 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.220
 strips that we apply so we know 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:32.180
 well had the same have advanced very 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:34.900
 important and we actually take off the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.699
 product or just like that 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:44.470
 olam is in and to art in the pipa 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.470
 on people if not very important 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:06.780
 so the thing that's good too is 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:08.250
 to properly press each tooth so that 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.570
 the patch is well paste ben me I 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.889
 can not speak well after I 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:18.389
 find that to find a video it is 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:20.460
 not great it not necessarily standing up against 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.650
 a weird view but we get there 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.520
 used to 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.160
 after as I told you the steps 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.840
 recommended to eat all this finally me 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.070
 I advise you in the sun it 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.139
 could put even more 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.810
 products on you on the food I 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.120
 I thought I do not know but I 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.120
 advise not and the second 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.900
 this 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.879
 there is more glamor m so in fact it's 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.349
 a news item you can do your 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:59.310
 gym meanwhile if you want you 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.280
 do not wish you do what you 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.539
 want and that's it for the sequel as I 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.340
 you said in this product is in 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.009
 sale on ebay but this years maybe 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.139
 also on amazon for a quarantine of 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.240
 dollars so it's up to you to compare the 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.930
 price and to pay attention to which 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.860
 product you take 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.180
 here after me I am very 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.710
 satisfied but as I told you 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.379
 maybe do not overdo it 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.789
 product in addition here is to do we know 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.669
 not necessarily all that is to 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.740
 inside and I think it's not 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.680
 the best thing for my very time 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.330
 if it's very effective, that's not over 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.199
 well forget either becomes 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.849
 brush your teeth 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.319
 me personally I brush them 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.930
 teeth with a classic toothbrush 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.139
 and the signal that the monoi like that I 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.569
 think 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:44.550
 and so here I leave you with 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:46.949
 pictures to my teeth before the data 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.139
 in after I hope this little 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.780
 video will have pleased you I see it very very 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:53.610
 as a bonus today and I wish you 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.349
 a very good day and I tell you to 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.740
 very quickly for a new video chart 

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.740
 everybody 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.460
 so today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.230
 the pollution mark or I do not know 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.090
 not if you know this brand 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:11.430
 me it was products that I had 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.430
 discovered during my little boxes
