00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
stuff and I had a couple branches but I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.060 
stuff and I had a couple branches but I

couldn't find him for the longest time
finally<00:00:47.070> found<00:00:47.250> him<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.670> had<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
finally found him so I had one of them

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.630 
finally found him so I had one of them
in<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.800> basically<00:00:50.010> gave<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.580> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
in there and just basically gave it a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.420 
in there and just basically gave it a
little<00:00:50.730> bit<00:00:50.910> more<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.420> don't<00:00:52.199> know<00:00:52.290> natural<00:00:53.190> up

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
little bit more I don't know natural up

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.389 
little bit more I don't know natural up
or<00:00:53.550> whatever<00:00:54.649> it's<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.950> thought<00:00:56.130> it<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
or whatever it's just I thought it was a

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.060 
or whatever it's just I thought it was a
little<00:00:56.520> bit<00:00:56.670> there<00:00:57.000> before<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:57.860> again<00:00:58.860> like<00:00:59.010> I

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
little bit there before but again like I

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.520 
little bit there before but again like I
said<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.310> ran<00:00:59.460> out<00:00:59.610> of<00:00:59.640> plan<00:00:59.940> some<00:01:00.360> last<00:01:01.320> thing

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
said it ran out of plan some last thing

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.630 
said it ran out of plan some last thing
I<00:01:01.649> wanted<00:01:01.860> to<00:01:01.920> give<00:01:02.070> him<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> few<00:01:02.430> days<00:01:02.579> to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I wanted to give him a few days to

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.939 
I wanted to give him a few days to
settle<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> any<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.020> obviously<00:01:04.710> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
settle in any way because obviously I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
settle in any way because obviously I
didn't<00:01:05.130> want<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.430> poking<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.940> cage

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
didn't want to be poking around the cage

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.940 
didn't want to be poking around the cage

SAT there chilled and just kind of
watched<00:01:26.070> me<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.640> they<00:01:26.729> didn't<00:01:27.030> seem<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
watched me but they didn't seem that

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.420

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
give a crap as long as I didn't touch

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.100

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
plants and branches just stuff that I've

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
plants and branches just stuff that I've
been<00:01:44.310> wanting<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.729> add<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.479> ran<00:01:46.260> out<00:01:46.409> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

been wanting to add but I ran out of
plants<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.010> stuff<00:01:47.780> apparently<00:01:48.780> I've<00:01:48.840> been

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
plants and stuff apparently I've been

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
plants and stuff apparently I've been
using<00:01:49.140> more<00:01:49.380> planes<00:01:49.590> than<00:01:49.680> I<00:01:49.830> thought<00:01:49.979> I<00:01:50.040> was

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
using more planes than I thought I was

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.120 
using more planes than I thought I was
because<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> thought<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.909> had<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.330> more<00:01:52.130> but

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
because I thought I had a lot more but

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.330 
because I thought I had a lot more but
no<00:01:53.400> big<00:01:53.580> deal<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.270> some<00:01:54.450> more<00:01:55.070> got<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.100> big

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
no big deal I got some more got a big

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.880 
no big deal I got some more got a big
branch<00:01:56.670> in<00:01:56.880> there<00:01:57.229> from<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> client<00:01:58.590> I'm<00:01:58.770> not

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
branch in there from the client I'm not

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.020

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
just also as you can see i added the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.729 
just also as you can see i added the
infrared<00:03:04.750> light<00:03:04.930> i<00:03:04.959> said<00:03:05.200> i<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.379> going<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.620> do

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
infrared light i said i was going to do

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
because bouquets are obviously nocturnal

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.539 
because bouquets are obviously nocturnal
