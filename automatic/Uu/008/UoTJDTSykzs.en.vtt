games<00:01:31.020> for<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> midfield<00:01:31.650> isn't<00:01:32.009> too<00:01:32.130> bad<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.520> my

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.609 
games for a midfield isn't too bad in my

forward if you could as I think he'd

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.420 
forward if you could as I think he'd
play<00:01:36.780> best<00:01:37.049> there<00:01:37.290> but<00:01:37.500> definitely<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.220> ahead
