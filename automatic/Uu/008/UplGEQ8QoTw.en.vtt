00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.459
 cross 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.139
 we visited with the tasks especially Spanish business 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.860
 to share with you with technology and engineering apply the 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.119
 food industry especially in this note let's see 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.119
 the merger process of the two parties in 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.640
 anyway the first one by 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.810
 the value of tomato that is going to be used 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.750
 that are small tomatoes and uniforms so they can get into the tin 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.320
 They are transported in Medellin 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.440
 450 kilos 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 and this is not the income do not miss us 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.170
 A car goes ohl are downloaded on a machine 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.500
 overturn hobby 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.660
 with equipment that makes tomato scalding 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 that gives you heat 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.660
 and then went through a tape with everything cold water to cool 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.650
 and that makes the dilation of heat and cold 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.220
 from a little skin 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.550
 then he passed a peeler to mechanics 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.010
 that operator was brought in the year 72 of italy 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.010
 one of the first machines that has overcome mechanical 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 consists of some blades and take it out the idea was on the skin 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.780
 nolasco looks compensated 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.700
 that squeeze the tomato 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 having in it the skin and passing peeled tomato 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.000
 if he continues with an expression tape where they would operate they are injured 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 they take some defect from production 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.970
 once selected last 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.050
 still bottling machines where automatically fed with a high of 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.729
 tape 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760
 the empty cans 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.370
 the tomato is put in hand 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.370
 then went through a bucket winner 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.670
 once complete with fire after another in the time called that option 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.260
 which is the plan more than 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.730
 exposes that he has a Saturday that was given for the eighth time he warmed up he added 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.460
 interior to take 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.460
 if this comes out with a temperature of about 50 degrees 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.069
 then 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.959
 Last auctioneer is an automatic equipment that puts the lid 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.079
 automatically and the heavens 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.389
 then he went through a tape where he dated it 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.739
 to avoid adulterating the date later 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.739
 the others step of the process and in the commercialization 

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:33.489
 in this process, go to the water bath where it is sterilized 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.129
 is a team where there is some time in a continuous chain letter 

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:43.079
 so that Bebeto raises the temperature inside 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.399
 sterilization time ago 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:50.469
 then go to cold water do not want cold so they do not burn 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.919
 the outside 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.229
 after 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:56.989
 lee comes out of the cold water it 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.439
 casal labeler in the case of being Monday afternoon pressed tablante that 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.339
 they look at this moment 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:06.699
 if we did lithography or directly they put inca 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.519
 the cans labeled labeled with 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.170
 and in which the passage of the postal bird the cans ogando 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.319
 where with a 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.679
 I do not want to warm up the picket, we do not seriously mean the punch in another 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.309
 point 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.339
 I do not know how to put it by hand in cajastur 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:32.309
 and go through some then interactive dater to put on the same date 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.239
 that has the law 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:41.129
 The simplified process is the process to be whole perita tomatoes 

00:03:42.679 --> 00:03:47.129
 relatively simple is a continuous line 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.909
 but you need some care 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:52.959
 you can not fix one of queta lavat to finish 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.499
 you have to take care of the process against 

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:58.499
 spots 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:05.199
 j 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.079
 joint 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.079
 finish 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 p 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:26.740
 if you want to attend during the course of dinner 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.430
 so let's try the day 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.720
 pakistan insists name by channel screen 10 pejic sent by mail 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.879
 electronic 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.270
 the point has 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.330
 and at this moment we are later from the viewer community from prague 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.599
 it's a pass 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:45.259
 we'll see
