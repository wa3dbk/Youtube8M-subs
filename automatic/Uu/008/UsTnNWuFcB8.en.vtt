00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
proves is the tech is in perfect balance

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.510 
proves is the tech is in perfect balance
you<00:02:38.050> know<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.230> don't<00:02:38.560> grow<00:02:38.860> these<00:02:39.190> sort<00:02:39.430> of

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
you know you don't grow these sort of

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.810 
you know you don't grow these sort of
things<00:02:39.700> if<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.240> waters<00:02:40.600> not<00:02:41.190> perfect<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.370> just

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
things if the waters not perfect it just

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.640 
things if the waters not perfect it just
won't<00:02:42.940> grow<00:02:43.180> those<00:02:43.540> things<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.320> don't<00:02:44.440> have

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
won't grow those things just don't have

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.590 
won't grow those things just don't have
to<00:02:44.740> entertain<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.850> these<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.420> little

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
to entertain so these are the little

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.660 
to entertain so these are the little
things<00:02:46.720> that<00:02:47.380> you<00:02:47.500> know<00:02:47.650> your<00:02:47.890> water<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.400> right

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
things that you know your water is right

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.610 
things that you know your water is right
and<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.780> good<00:02:49.930> for<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> fish<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
and it's good for the fish the

and it's good for the fish the
temperature<00:02:51.070> is<00:02:51.130> right<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:53.260> actually

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
temperature is right and it's actually

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.270 
temperature is right and it's actually
proof<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.540> you've<00:02:55.750> got<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.100> pretty<00:02:57.100> well

tank<00:04:12.450> for<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.530> last<00:04:13.739> 18<00:04:14.250> months<00:04:14.280> but<00:04:14.819> I<00:04:14.910> must

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
tank for the last 18 months but I must

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.090 
tank for the last 18 months but I must
say<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.480> when<00:04:15.780> we<00:04:15.930> started<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.590> tank<00:04:16.859> and

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
say that when we started the tank and

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.729 
say that when we started the tank and
put<00:04:17.850> the<00:04:17.970> tank<00:04:18.209> together<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.959> took<00:04:19.139> us<00:04:19.320> really

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
put the tank together it took us really

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.190 
put the tank together it took us really
six<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.250> nine<00:04:20.430> months<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.910> get<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> stage

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
six to nine months to get it to a stage

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.230 
six to nine months to get it to a stage
where<00:04:22.500> it<00:04:22.590> was<00:04:22.680> habitable<00:04:23.370> for<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.790> fish<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
where it was habitable for the fish and

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.450 
where it was habitable for the fish and
it<00:04:24.330> was<00:04:24.510> a<00:04:24.750> tank<00:04:25.440> that<00:04:25.560> was<00:04:25.650> balanced<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.370> that

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
it was a tank that was balanced and that

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.129 
it was a tank that was balanced and that
sort<00:04:26.700> of<00:04:26.820> thing<00:04:27.030> we<00:04:27.150> put<00:04:27.330> plenty<00:04:27.570> of<00:04:27.720> corals

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
sort of thing we put plenty of corals

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.620 
sort of thing we put plenty of corals
seen<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.710> here<00:04:28.919> and<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.639> turned<00:04:29.910> black<00:04:30.180> until

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
seen in here and that turned black until

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.629 
seen in here and that turned black until
we<00:04:30.720> got<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.900> Gabby<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.650> or<00:04:31.860> two<00:04:32.100> Gabby's<00:04:32.490> and

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
we got a Gabby in it or two Gabby's and

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.980 
we got a Gabby in it or two Gabby's and
they<00:04:32.729> cleaned<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.650> we<00:04:34.650> had<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:36.419> coral<00:04:36.810> rock

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
they cleaned it we had a the coral rock

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.010 
they cleaned it we had a the coral rock
and<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.500> was<00:04:37.680> put<00:04:37.950> in<00:04:38.070> this<00:04:38.250> there's<00:04:39.060> 300

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
and that was put in this there's 300

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.379 
and that was put in this there's 300
kilos<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:41.010> rock<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.370> there<00:04:41.550> which<00:04:41.760> I<00:04:41.940> know<00:04:42.150> it

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
kilos of rock in there which I know it

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.820 
kilos of rock in there which I know it
doesn't<00:04:42.540> look<00:04:42.810> like<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:43.169> now<00:04:43.320> but<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.680> reason

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
doesn't look like it now but the reason

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.879 
doesn't look like it now but the reason
300<00:04:44.550> kilos<00:04:44.880> of<00:04:45.060> coral<00:04:45.690> rock<00:04:45.840> in<00:04:46.080> there<00:04:46.229> and

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
300 kilos of coral rock in there and

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.670 
300 kilos of coral rock in there and
it's<00:04:47.040> live<00:04:47.250> right<00:04:47.389> this<00:04:48.389> is<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.260> guts<00:04:49.500> of

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
it's live right this is the the guts of

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.409 
it's live right this is the the guts of
the<00:04:49.800> filter<00:04:50.190> which<00:04:50.370> makes<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:50.970> whole<00:04:51.000> tank

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
the filter which makes the whole tank

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.100 
the filter which makes the whole tank
work<00:04:52.380> properly<00:04:52.770> these<00:04:53.190> are<00:04:53.750> algae<00:04:54.750> and<00:04:54.930> here

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
work properly these are algae and here

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.320 
work properly these are algae and here
which<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.590> grow<00:04:55.919> which<00:04:56.160> compete<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.789> the<00:04:56.940> algae

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
which I grow which compete to the algae

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.719 
which I grow which compete to the algae
in<00:04:57.419> the<00:04:57.510> tank<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.680> stops<00:04:59.010> any<00:04:59.160> algae

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
in the tank and that stops any algae

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.850 
in the tank and that stops any algae
coming<00:05:00.090> into<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.660> tank<00:05:00.900> and<00:05:01.050> the<00:05:01.350> effluent<00:05:01.830> of

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
coming into the tank and the effluent of

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.159 
coming into the tank and the effluent of
the<00:05:01.979> fish<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.370> all<00:05:02.520> absorbed<00:05:03.210> in<00:05:03.360> here<00:05:03.539> it's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
the fish is all absorbed in here it's

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.860 
the fish is all absorbed in here it's
got<00:05:04.260> a<00:05:04.320> sand<00:05:04.650> bed<00:05:04.979> to<00:05:05.160> make<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.550> grow<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.450> I've

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
got a sand bed to make it grow and I've

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.110 
got a sand bed to make it grow and I've
got<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.050> light<00:05:07.289> in<00:05:07.320> here<00:05:07.710> too<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:08.610> make<00:05:08.760> it<00:05:08.910> grow

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
got a light in here too to make it grow

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.630 
got a light in here too to make it grow
as<00:05:09.330> well<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:10.100> strangely<00:05:11.100> enough<00:05:11.280> the<00:05:11.460> fish

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
as well and strangely enough the fish

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.980 
as well and strangely enough the fish
eat<00:05:11.850> some<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.330> put<00:05:12.570> some<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:12.930> out

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
eat some of that I put some of that out

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.810 
eat some of that I put some of that out
once<00:05:13.350> a<00:05:13.530> week<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.890> I<00:05:13.950> put<00:05:14.250> it<00:05:14.310> in<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.460> tank<00:05:14.700> in

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
once a week and I put it in the tank in

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.740 
once a week and I put it in the tank in
the<00:05:14.910> future<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.590> love<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.979> I've<00:05:17.729> got<00:05:18.090> this

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
the future and I love it I've got this

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.540 
the future and I love it I've got this

that's<00:05:28.320> all<00:05:28.470> the<00:05:28.590> chemicals<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.400> use<00:05:29.729> at

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
that's all the chemicals that I use at

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.090 
that's all the chemicals that I use at
different<00:05:30.270> times<00:05:30.539> to<00:05:30.750> do<00:05:31.650> different<00:05:32.070> things

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
different times to do different things

which<00:05:37.620> fills<00:05:37.919> that<00:05:38.160> tank<00:05:39.200> it'll<00:05:40.200> find<00:05:40.500> that

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
which fills that tank it'll find that

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.240 
which fills that tank it'll find that
this<00:05:41.640> is<00:05:41.789> the<00:05:41.990> best<00:05:42.990> pipe<00:05:43.410> here<00:05:43.710> is<00:05:43.950> the<00:05:44.070> one

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
this is the best pipe here is the one

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.969 
this is the best pipe here is the one
that<00:05:44.400> runs<00:05:44.700> downstairs<00:05:45.060> and<00:05:45.810> and<00:05:46.110> that's<00:05:46.830> what

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
that runs downstairs and and that's what

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.290 
that runs downstairs and and that's what
we<00:05:47.070> goes<00:05:47.280> down<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.820> keep<00:05:48.030> the<00:05:48.120> water

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
we goes down to keep the water

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.240 
we goes down to keep the water
temperature<00:05:48.450> a<00:05:48.960> constant<00:05:49.530> temperature

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250
