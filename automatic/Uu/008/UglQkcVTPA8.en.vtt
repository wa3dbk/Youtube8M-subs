00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
this again see what the difference is if

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.320 
this again see what the difference is if
there<00:00:32.769> is<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:32.920> difference<00:00:33.400> besides<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:34.120> paint

way up on volume and the drive up some

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.550 
way up on volume and the drive up some
more<00:01:50.760> right<00:01:51.760> at<00:01:51.910> 3<00:01:52.150> o'clock<00:01:52.180> both<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:53.170> them<00:01:53.260> set

sometimes<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.760> vector<00:06:28.180> seemed<00:06:28.479> to<00:06:29.040> get<00:06:30.040> over

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 
sometimes the vector seemed to get over

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.790 
sometimes the vector seemed to get over
the<00:06:30.370> top<00:06:30.580> a<00:06:30.610> little<00:06:30.820> bit<00:06:30.970> better<00:06:31.330> and<00:06:31.630> the<00:06:32.139> hand

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800

painted seems a little bit warmer they
both<00:06:35.050> kind<00:06:35.290> of<00:06:35.350> get<00:06:35.500> that<00:06:35.680> crazy<00:06:35.949> plexi<00:06:36.520> sound

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
both kind of get that crazy plexi sound

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.580 
both kind of get that crazy plexi sound
without<00:06:37.090> having<00:06:37.389> to<00:06:37.510> have<00:06:37.690> crazy<00:06:38.050> plexi
