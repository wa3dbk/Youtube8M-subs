00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
down now but I'm gonna turn the

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.720 
down now but I'm gonna turn the

headlights on and show you guys the
gauges<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:33.809> finished<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:35.660> so

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
gauges that I just finished doing so

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.380 
gauges that I just finished doing so
there<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:36.899> go<00:00:37.850> those<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.149> LEDs<00:00:39.870> behind<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
there you go those are LEDs behind the

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.069 
there you go those are LEDs behind the
gauge<00:00:42.390> cluster<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.960> lights<00:00:43.170> up<00:00:43.379> almost

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
gauge cluster it lights up almost

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.299 
gauge cluster it lights up almost
everything<00:00:46.079> if<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:47.039> over

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
everything if you can see that over

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.459 
everything if you can see that over
there<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.649> oil<00:00:49.649> temperature<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.340> not

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
there for the oil temperature it's not

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:54.040 
there for the oil temperature it's not
not<00:00:52.469> exactly<00:00:52.829> all<00:00:53.039> eliminated<00:00:53.789> but

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
not exactly all eliminated but

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.080 
not exactly all eliminated but
everything<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.230> here<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.440> 100%<00:00:55.860> done<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
everything over here is 100% done it

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.510 
everything over here is 100% done it
looks<00:00:57.239> good<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> second<00:00:59.280> thing<00:00:59.430> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
looks good and then the second thing I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.680 
looks good and then the second thing I
think<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.820> guys<00:01:00.170> may<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.350> may<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.859> our

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
think you guys may or may not like our

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.109 
think you guys may or may not like our
yogi<00:01:03.690> lights<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.470> have<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.220> did

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
yogi lights that I have down here I did

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.340 
yogi lights that I have down here I did
two<00:01:06.390> strips<00:01:07.520> under<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.610> dash<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.930> right<00:01:10.140> here

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
two strips under the dash and right here

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.719 
two strips under the dash and right here
I<00:01:11.540> wired<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> headlight<00:01:13.290> switch<00:01:13.729> let

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I wired it to the headlight switch let

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.990 
I wired it to the headlight switch let
me<00:01:15.710> turn<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.890> headlight<00:01:17.159> switch<00:01:17.250> over<00:01:17.640> you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
me turn the headlight switch over you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.340 
me turn the headlight switch over you
guys<00:01:18.119> see<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.479> little<00:01:18.720> bit<00:01:18.840> better<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
guys see a little bit better and you

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.260 
guys see a little bit better and you
still<00:01:20.159> can't<00:01:20.340> see<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> like<00:01:20.820> novel<00:01:21.180> dish

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
still can't see that like novel dish

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.510 
still can't see that like novel dish
right<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.920> took<00:01:22.920> out<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> whole<00:01:23.310> gauge

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
right here took out the whole gauge

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.210 
right here took out the whole gauge
cluster<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.680> there<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:27.740> wiring<00:01:28.740> harness<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
cluster and there is a wiring harness on

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.950 
cluster and there is a wiring harness on
the<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.670> headlight<00:01:29.820> knob<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.810> was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the back of the headlight knob and I was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.210 
the back of the headlight knob and I was
told<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.259> he's<00:01:31.530> happened<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> brown

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
told that he's happened to the brown

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
told that he's happened to the brown
wire<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.270> can<00:01:33.420> dim<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> LEDs<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.240> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
wire you can dim the LEDs you know like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.569 
wire you can dim the LEDs you know like
like<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> dim<00:01:37.320> them<00:01:37.430> I'm<00:01:38.430> not

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
like this you can dim them I'm not

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.420 
like this you can dim them I'm not
wanted<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.030> able<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> dim<00:01:39.890> these<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:41.159> here

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
wanted to be able to dim these down here

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.190 
wanted to be able to dim these down here
in<00:01:41.729> case<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.659> driving<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.110> they

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in case you know I was driving and they

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.899 
in case you know I was driving and they
were<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.439> break<00:01:43.649> them<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:44.640> least<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
were to break them down at least a

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.830 
were to break them down at least a
little<00:01:45.030> bit<00:01:45.290> but<00:01:47.180> for<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.360> reason<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> guess

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
little bit but for some reason I guess

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.420 
little bit but for some reason I guess
the<00:01:48.960> brown<00:01:49.110> wire<00:01:49.320> wasn't<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.979> one<00:01:50.100> that

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
the brown wire wasn't the one that

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.850 
the brown wire wasn't the one that
worked<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> ended<00:01:52.710> up<00:01:52.799> doing

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
worked so that's what I ended up doing

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.780 
worked so that's what I ended up doing
was<00:01:54.950> basically<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
was basically that was just the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.190 
was basically that was just the
headlight<00:01:57.060> knob<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.390> guess<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.780> parking

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
headlight knob I guess or the parking

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
headlight knob I guess or the parking
lights<00:01:58.409> so<00:01:59.100> remember<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> parking<00:01:59.729> lights

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
lights so remember the parking lights

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.539 
lights so remember the parking lights
come<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.130> turn<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.310> my<00:02:02.460> high

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
come on you know I can turn on my high

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
come on you know I can turn on my high
beams<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.770> LED<00:02:04.770> stay<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.600> turn

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
beams and the LED stay on and I can turn

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.960 
beams and the LED stay on and I can turn
like<00:02:07.680> a<00:02:07.710> turn<00:02:07.950> signal<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.369> something<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.849> all

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
like a turn signal or something it all

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.589 
like a turn signal or something it all
stays<00:02:09.149> off<00:02:09.530> but<00:02:10.530> um

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
stays off but um

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.899 
stays off but um
that's<00:02:12.290> really<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> only<00:02:12.799> updates<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.430> have<00:02:13.610> I

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:13.909 
that's really the only updates I have I

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.819 
that's really the only updates I have I
mean<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.329> you<00:02:14.420> guys<00:02:14.540> have<00:02:14.780> a<00:02:14.810> scene<00:02:15.079> I<00:02:15.110> did<00:02:15.560> do<00:02:15.799> a

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
mean if you guys have a scene I did do a

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.869 
mean if you guys have a scene I did do a
shift<00:02:16.129> knob<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.640> made<00:02:16.909> my<00:02:17.090> own<00:02:17.120> so<00:02:17.689> like<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> seven

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
shift knob I made my own so like a seven

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.569 
shift knob I made my own so like a seven
pool<00:02:19.879> ball<00:02:20.090> but<00:02:20.659> other<00:02:20.840> than<00:02:20.989> that<00:02:21.579> nothing

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
pool ball but other than that nothing

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.599 
pool ball but other than that nothing
but<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:24.099> lights<00:02:25.099> and<00:02:25.370> the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
but this is what the lights and the

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.309 
but this is what the lights and the
gauge<00:02:25.760> cluster<00:02:25.790> looked<00:02:26.390> like<00:02:26.540> before<00:02:26.689> like

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
gauge cluster looked like before like

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.830 
gauge cluster looked like before like
the<00:02:27.980> AC<00:02:28.760> stuff<00:02:29.980> it's<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.129> that<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.720> all

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
the AC stuff it's like that it's all

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.110 
the AC stuff it's like that it's all
green<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.409> like<00:02:33.590> what<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> clock<00:02:34.340> is<00:02:34.609> this

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
green and like what the clock is this

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.660 
green and like what the clock is this
green<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.590> over<00:02:36.769> here<00:02:36.920> now<00:02:37.069> it's<00:02:37.189> blue<00:02:37.430> it's<00:02:37.609> a

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
green but over here now it's blue it's a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.199 
green but over here now it's blue it's a
lot<00:02:37.849> brighter<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:39.459> my<00:02:40.459> opinion<00:02:40.760> looks<00:02:40.909> a<00:02:41.030> lot

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
lot brighter and my opinion looks a lot

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.990 
lot brighter and my opinion looks a lot
better<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.970> I<00:02:44.000> really<00:02:44.239> can't<00:02:44.359> wait<00:02:44.629> said.you

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
better so I really can't wait said.you

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.770 
better so I really can't wait said.you
the<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.840> climate<00:02:48.200> controls<00:02:48.590> over<00:02:48.829> there<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the the climate controls over there and

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.319 
the the climate controls over there and
possibly<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:51.049> clock<00:02:51.349> i<00:02:51.730> i've<00:02:52.730> seen<00:02:53.150> people

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
possibly the clock i i've seen people

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:54.819 
possibly the clock i i've seen people
with<00:02:53.569> blue<00:02:53.750> clocks<00:02:53.989> like<00:02:54.169> that<00:02:54.349> but<00:02:54.560> i'm<00:02:54.620> not

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
with blue clocks like that but i'm not

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.210 
with blue clocks like that but i'm not
sure<00:02:55.099> if<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.489> an<00:02:55.609> LED<00:02:55.970> bulb<00:02:56.439> swap<00:02:57.439> or<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.739> if

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
sure if it's an LED bulb swap or not if

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.339 
sure if it's an LED bulb swap or not if
