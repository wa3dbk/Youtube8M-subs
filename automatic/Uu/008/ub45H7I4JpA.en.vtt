00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.890 
my gas mileage well I don't know yet I
only<00:02:25.080> run<00:02:25.260> two<00:02:25.380> tanks<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.920> gas<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.489> had<00:02:26.730> run<00:02:27.270> two

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
only run two tanks of gas I had run two

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.920 
only run two tanks of gas I had run two
through<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.590> I've<00:02:28.800> run<00:02:29.270> parts<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.420> bubbles<00:02:30.870> to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
through it I've run parts of bubbles to

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.770 
through it I've run parts of bubbles to
two<00:02:31.470> through<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.920> but<00:02:32.730> they've<00:02:33.300> been<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.570> little

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
two through it but they've been a little

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.150 
two through it but they've been a little
unusual<00:02:34.350> in<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.370> tanks<00:02:35.700> I've<00:02:35.850> run<00:02:36.060> through

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
unusual in the tanks I've run through

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.310 
unusual in the tanks I've run through
can<00:02:38.160> explain<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.030> at<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.270> later<00:02:39.570> time<00:02:39.750> not

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
can explain that at a later time not

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.860 
can explain that at a later time not
critical<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.950> this<00:02:41.130> but<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:42.090> gas<00:02:42.300> mileage<00:02:42.570> was

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
critical to this but the gas mileage was

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.570 
critical to this but the gas mileage was
a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.230> lower<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.830> had<00:02:43.980> expected<00:02:44.340> that

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
a little lower but I had expected that

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.150 
a little lower but I had expected that
happen<00:02:45.120> because<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.320> what<00:02:46.560> I've<00:02:46.680> been<00:02:46.830> doing

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
happen because of what I've been doing

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.540 
happen because of what I've been doing
the<00:02:47.250> last<00:02:47.280> few<00:02:47.610> days

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.470 

there's<00:02:51.550> really<00:02:51.730> nothing<00:02:52.150> else<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.450> report

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
there's really nothing else to report

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.160 
there's really nothing else to report
than<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.320> and<00:02:53.650> this<00:02:54.340> juncture<00:02:55.150> but<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> will

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
than that and this juncture but I will

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.020 
than that and this juncture but I will
be<00:02:56.380> tracking<00:02:57.210> mileage<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:59.680> my<00:02:59.890> gas<00:03:00.580> mileage

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
be tracking mileage with my gas mileage

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.510 
be tracking mileage with my gas mileage
closely<00:03:01.810> because<00:03:01.960> I'm<00:03:02.680> real<00:03:02.950> interested<00:03:03.160> to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
closely because I'm real interested to

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.850 
closely because I'm real interested to
see<00:03:03.760> if<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.240> pick<00:03:04.390> up<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.500> know<00:03:05.590> half<00:03:05.830> a
