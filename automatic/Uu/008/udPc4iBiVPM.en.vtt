00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
and that is exactly where I would be

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.410 
and that is exactly where I would be
headed<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.680> also<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.580> this<00:01:11.760> wide-open

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
headed and also to all of this wide-open

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.670 
headed and also to all of this wide-open
tree<00:01:12.930> stuff<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.380> mean<00:01:13.670> if<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.409> where

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
tree stuff I mean if you you know where

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.109 
tree stuff I mean if you you know where
you<00:01:16.770> start<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.189> but<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> good<00:01:17.909> thing<00:01:17.939> about

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
you start out but the good thing about

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.940 
you start out but the good thing about
it<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> they<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.140> good<00:01:19.229> parking<00:01:19.770> down

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
it is they have pretty good parking down

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.340 
it is they have pretty good parking down
here<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:20.640> too<00:01:20.880> hard<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.869> parked

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
here so it's not too hard to get parked

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.300 
here so it's not too hard to get parked
and<00:01:22.700> then<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.720> gondola<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.070> think

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and then get on the gondola and I think

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020 
and then get on the gondola and I think
they<00:01:26.460> call<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.210> Silver<00:01:28.110> Bullet<00:01:29.030> something

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
they call it the Silver Bullet something

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.210 
they call it the Silver Bullet something
or<00:01:30.149> another<00:01:30.470> anyway<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> gondola

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
or another anyway you get on the gondola

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
or another anyway you get on the gondola
here<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> blasts<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.509> right<00:01:33.750> up<00:01:33.899> to<00:01:34.020> here

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
here and it blasts you right up to here

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.310 
here and it blasts you right up to here
and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.649> it<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> drops<00:01:35.670> down<00:01:36.180> this<00:01:36.930> side

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and then it kind of drops down this side

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.550 
and then it kind of drops down this side
over<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:39.509> know<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.689> ski<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.409> to

can't believe it's a very cool

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.880 
can't believe it's a very cool
experience

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
experience

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.130 
experience
you<00:02:11.460> know<00:02:11.580> you've<00:02:11.790> got<00:02:11.940> all<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.330> blues<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
you know you've got all your blues and a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.950 
you know you've got all your blues and a
lot<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.410> really<00:02:13.800> easy<00:02:14.160> terrain<00:02:14.820> out<00:02:15.390> over<00:02:15.810> this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
lot of really easy terrain out over this

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.410 
lot of really easy terrain out over this
way<00:02:16.280> it<00:02:17.280> gets<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.580> little<00:02:17.730> bit<00:02:17.940> confusing

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
way it gets a little bit confusing

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.559 
way it gets a little bit confusing
because<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.959> you<00:02:19.080> drop<00:02:19.440> over<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.160> you

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
because as you drop over then you

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.780 
because as you drop over then you
have<00:02:20.840> these<00:02:21.049> other<00:02:21.290> converging<00:02:22.129> lifts<00:02:22.579> you

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
have these other converging lifts you

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.059 
have these other converging lifts you
know<00:02:22.909> kind<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.299> hitting<00:02:24.019> other<00:02:24.230> aspects<00:02:24.889> of

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
know kind of hitting other aspects of

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.119 
know kind of hitting other aspects of
the<00:02:25.159> mountain<00:02:25.749> and<00:02:26.749> then<00:02:27.109> if<00:02:27.379> you<00:02:27.530> get<00:02:27.709> over

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
the mountain and then if you get over

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.509 
the mountain and then if you get over
here<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:29.359> here<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:30.049> the<00:02:30.260> storm<00:02:30.620> peak<00:02:30.859> Express

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
here over here to the storm peak Express

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.119 
here over here to the storm peak Express
and<00:02:31.999> I<00:02:32.239> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.749> this<00:02:33.139> is<00:02:33.290> called<00:02:33.439> barbecue

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129
