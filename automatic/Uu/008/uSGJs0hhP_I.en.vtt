00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
decide between either one you know if I

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:46.710 
decide between either one you know if I
would<00:01:44.229> pre<00:01:44.470> blend<00:01:44.860> them<00:01:45.040> in<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.090> studio<00:01:46.420> I

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
would pre blend them in the studio I

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.380 
would pre blend them in the studio I
wouldn't<00:01:47.619> be<00:01:47.710> able<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.950> choose<00:01:48.369> just<00:01:48.939> one<00:01:49.060> mic

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
wouldn't be able to choose just one mic

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.510 
wouldn't be able to choose just one mic
or<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.720> other<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.229> what<00:01:50.860> you'll<00:01:50.979> hear<00:01:51.250> here

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
or the other and what you'll hear here

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.039 
or the other and what you'll hear here
is<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.030> difference<00:01:52.420> between<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.900> two

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
is that the difference between the two

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:58.200 
is that the difference between the two
mics<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:55.299> know<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:55.720> drastic<00:01:56.409> that<00:01:57.210> you

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
mics you know is so drastic that you

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.719 
mics you know is so drastic that you
know<00:01:58.299> often<00:01:58.630> times<00:01:58.659> one<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.350> them<00:01:59.470> fits<00:01:59.860> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
know often times one of them fits the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.090 
know often times one of them fits the
mix<00:02:01.240> much<00:02:01.930> better<00:02:02.229> than<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.530> other<00:02:02.710> one

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
mix much better than the other one

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.520 
mix much better than the other one
it<00:02:03.759> doesn't<00:02:04.090> necessarily<00:02:04.299> you<00:02:04.840> know<00:02:04.960> mean

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
it doesn't necessarily you know mean

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.069 
it doesn't necessarily you know mean
it's<00:02:05.680> a<00:02:05.909> better<00:02:06.909> mic<00:02:07.180> worst<00:02:07.509> mic<00:02:07.720> whatever

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.079 
it's a better mic worst mic whatever

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:10.589 
it's a better mic worst mic whatever
it's<00:02:08.259> just<00:02:08.530> where<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.039> fits<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:10.090> here's<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
it's just where it fits so here's the

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's just where it fits so here's the
sound<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.290> fat<00:02:11.470> head<00:02:11.709> -<00:02:11.950> on<00:02:12.300> Matt's<00:02:13.300> what<00:02:13.660> I

to the mix room I want choices to see

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.860 
to the mix room I want choices to see
what<00:05:05.770> fits<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.310> mix<00:05:06.610> and<00:05:07.000> gives<00:05:07.389> me<00:05:07.539> the<00:05:07.660> vibe

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
what fits the mix and gives me the vibe

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.290 
what fits the mix and gives me the vibe
I'm<00:05:08.110> looking<00:05:08.440> for<00:05:08.680> I<00:05:08.889> chose<00:05:09.669> the<00:05:09.849> fat<00:05:10.030> head

the c12 okay both of them sound great

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.710 
the c12 okay both of them sound great
that<00:05:35.650> that's<00:05:35.889> not<00:05:36.160> the<00:05:36.490> issue<00:05:36.820> the<00:05:37.150> issue<00:05:37.180> was

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
that that's not the issue the issue was

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.020 
that that's not the issue the issue was
what<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> was<00:05:38.259> looking<00:05:38.680> for<00:05:38.849> what<00:05:39.849> I<00:05:39.880> was

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
what I was looking for what I was

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.909 
what I was looking for what I was
looking<00:05:40.360> for<00:05:40.599> was<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.080> slightly<00:05:41.560> muted

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
looking for was the slightly muted

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.659 
looking for was the slightly muted
transient<00:05:42.849> of<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.659> ribbon<00:05:44.260> mic<00:05:44.409> it<00:05:45.010> just<00:05:45.340> set

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
transient of the ribbon mic it just set

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.430 
transient of the ribbon mic it just set
in<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.000> mix<00:05:46.210> prior<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.870> any<00:05:47.020> type<00:05:47.260> of

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
in the mix prior to any type of

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.960 
in the mix prior to any type of
compression<00:05:47.860> or<00:05:48.159> anything<00:05:48.340> better<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.650> the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
compression or anything better and the

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.540 
compression or anything better and the
the<00:05:51.970> mid-range<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.720> guess<00:05:53.710> you<00:05:53.830> probably<00:05:54.099> could

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
the mid-range I guess you probably could

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.529 
the mid-range I guess you probably could
hear<00:05:54.729> that<00:05:54.909> and<00:05:55.120> let<00:05:55.210> me<00:05:55.270> give<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.449> to<00:05:55.510> you

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
hear that and let me give it to you

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:02.070 
hear that and let me give it to you
again<00:05:55.659> listen<00:05:56.260> to<00:05:56.289> the<00:05:56.470> mid-range<00:06:01.080> verses

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
again listen to the mid-range verses

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.260 
again listen to the mid-range verses
this

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.120 

you<00:06:08.870> hear<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.260> somewhere<00:06:09.650> between<00:06:09.800> 800

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
you hear that somewhere between 800

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.780 
you hear that somewhere between 800
cycles<00:06:11.000> and<00:06:11.480> a<00:06:11.840> thousand<00:06:12.380> maybe<00:06:12.560> up<00:06:12.800> to<00:06:12.830> you

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
cycles and a thousand maybe up to you

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.580 
cycles and a thousand maybe up to you
know<00:06:14.290> almost<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.880> smoothness<00:06:17.540> of<00:06:17.690> the<00:06:17.780> end

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
know almost to the smoothness of the end

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.100 
know almost to the smoothness of the end
fullness<00:06:19.130> of<00:06:19.340> the<00:06:19.910> fat<00:06:20.090> hit<00:06:20.360> was<00:06:20.720> what<00:06:20.900> I<00:06:20.930> was

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
fullness of the fat hit was what I was

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.020 
fullness of the fat hit was what I was
looking<00:06:21.170> for<00:06:21.500> that<00:06:21.920> was<00:06:22.160> the<00:06:22.340> hole<00:06:22.610> that<00:06:22.940> was

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
looking for that was the hole that was

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.110 
looking for that was the hole that was
available<00:06:23.300> to<00:06:23.630> me<00:06:23.660> in<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:23.990> mix<00:06:24.550> so<00:06:25.550> anyway

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
available to me in the mix so anyway

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.460 
available to me in the mix so anyway
this<00:06:26.330> is<00:06:26.390> kind<00:06:26.600> of<00:06:26.810> what<00:06:26.960> it<00:06:27.080> sounded<00:06:27.380> like

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:27.470 
this is kind of what it sounded like

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.740 
this is kind of what it sounded like
ultimately<00:06:27.950> as<00:06:28.130> you<00:06:28.370> can<00:06:28.580> see<00:06:28.730> bone<00:06:29.000> dry<00:06:29.300> no

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
ultimately as you can see bone dry no

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.550 
ultimately as you can see bone dry no
effects<00:06:30.110> of<00:06:30.650> any<00:06:30.860> type<00:06:31.160> you<00:06:32.120> know<00:06:32.350> reverb<00:06:33.350> or

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
effects of any type you know reverb or

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:41.970 
effects of any type you know reverb or
delay<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:34.370> is

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:41.980 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.280 

that's<00:06:42.610> where<00:06:42.850> I<00:06:42.880> wanted<00:06:43.240> to<00:06:43.300> say<00:06:43.690> I<00:06:43.840> wanted<00:06:44.200> it

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
that's where I wanted to say I wanted it

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.770 
that's where I wanted to say I wanted it
to<00:06:44.380> be<00:06:44.530> heard<00:06:44.910> but<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.030> guitars<00:06:46.420> were<00:06:46.660> the

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:46.780 
to be heard but the guitars were the

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.510 
to be heard but the guitars were the
featured<00:06:47.170> element<00:06:47.680> so<00:06:48.070> I<00:06:48.100> just<00:06:48.280> kind<00:06:48.490> of

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
seeing the way that I use cascade mics

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:05.010 
seeing the way that I use cascade mics

in everyday mainstream music mixing as

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.280 
in everyday mainstream music mixing as
well<00:07:05.320> as<00:07:05.470> how<00:07:05.590> they<00:07:05.740> stand<00:07:06.040> up<00:07:06.250> side-by-side

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 
probably even own so I just can't say

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.600 
probably even own so I just can't say
enough<00:07:14.590> good<00:07:14.770> things<00:07:14.980> about<00:07:15.310> these
