00:00:03.822 --> 00:00:05.295
 Hi, everybody 

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:08.465
 Today we will make a cold summer recipe 

00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:11.299
 a small dish 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:13.432
 Oi-naengguk 

00:00:13.432 --> 00:00:16.531
 Oi is a cucumber. It is a cucumber soup. 

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:19.141
 Today, I don’t cook, I will use the method of mixing. 

00:00:19.141 --> 00:00:21.773
 First you have to use British cucumbers 

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:23.510
 It is best to use cucumber without seeds. 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.537
 But if you can't find British cucumbers 

00:00:26.537 --> 00:00:30.042
 You can use any seedless cucumber. 

00:00:30.042 --> 00:00:32.754
 If the cucumber has seeds, just scrape the seeds with a spoon. 

00:00:32.754 --> 00:00:35.792
 Because the seeds don't look good 

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.595
 So we only use cucumber meat 

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.267
 There are about 12 ounces of cucumber here. 

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:44.894
 I have washed the cucumber that I just took out of the refrigerator. 

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.566
 Now clean and frozen 

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:51.436
 Cucumber frozen soup is made when you want to serve 

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:53.626
 It is very easy to do. Come, let's start doing 

00:00:54.006 --> 00:00:57.863
 I have iced the big bowl beforehand, and now I take it out. 

00:00:58.151 --> 00:00:59.965
 Very frozen 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.485
 Then process the cucumber, go head to tail 

00:01:02.485 --> 00:01:06.605
 Cut, cut 

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:12.126
 Probably so long, here is here, 

00:01:12.126 --> 00:01:13.645
 About three or so 

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:17.607
 (Chopping vegetables) 

00:01:20.435 --> 00:01:23.940
 Like a matchstick to cut into a book 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.695
 So I have to cut the book at the beginning. 

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:42.740
 (lightly chopping vegetables) 

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.084
 Then put it in a large bowl 

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.828
 One garlic 

00:02:06.404 --> 00:02:08.635
 a shallot 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.974
 (Chopping vegetables) 

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:23.253
 Chopped garlic and shallots 

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:25.722
 Put them in the big bowl 

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:31.943
 Then I will use red pepper 

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:33.914
 This is very spicy 

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.042
 So you don't have to use the whole 

00:02:37.042 --> 00:02:38.912
 You can also choose not to 

00:02:38.912 --> 00:02:41.848
 So if you want to do a non-hot version, skip the pepper portion. 

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.139
 I only use a small amount 

00:02:45.352 --> 00:02:49.706
 Just bring out a little spicy taste. 

00:02:54.028 --> 00:02:55.968
 So far, it’s easy 

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.620
 Then seasoning 

00:02:57.797 --> 00:03:00.397
 Add some salt first 

00:03:00.397 --> 00:03:02.415
 Add one teaspoon and a half salt 

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:07.129
 Add another spoonful of soy sauce 

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:09.587
 Two teaspoons of sugar 

00:03:11.714 --> 00:03:14.866
 It has a sweet and salty taste and needs some sourness. 

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:17.459
 Add four teaspoons of white vinegar 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.002
 Four teaspoons equals one tablespoon and one teaspoon 

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:22.974
 Then mix them 

00:03:30.363 --> 00:03:34.920
 Until the sugar and salt are accompanied 

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:38.239
 After that, I will put some sesame seeds on it. 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.205
 These are roasted and baked on their own. 

00:03:41.205 --> 00:03:45.981
 There is also a small cherry 

00:03:45.981 --> 00:03:49.137
 These will be placed on top 

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:50.640
 Cut first 

00:03:51.518 --> 00:03:54.907
 (Chopping vegetables) 

00:03:57.826 --> 00:04:00.366
 Roasted sesame 

00:04:00.366 --> 00:04:02.343
 grinding 

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.257
 It has a very sweet nutty taste. 

00:04:13.176 --> 00:04:15.015
 If you don't have a mortar and pestle 

00:04:15.015 --> 00:04:17.138
 You can use the index finger and the thumb to sesame 

00:04:17.138 --> 00:04:19.877
 Like this 

00:04:19.877 --> 00:04:23.902
 About 1 tablespoon here 

00:04:23.902 --> 00:04:25.608
 Very easy to do 

00:04:26.587 --> 00:04:29.025
 This is the bowl for our serving. 

00:04:29.025 --> 00:04:31.017
 This is ice water 

00:04:39.817 --> 00:04:43.464
 Pour into a glass of ice water 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:51.964
 Lightly mixed 

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:55.732
 Still some ice 

00:04:55.747 --> 00:05:00.405
 About 7 to 8 ice cubes, about a cup serving 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.465
 First break the ice cubes, put them in, add the caramel 

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:21.424
 sesame 

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.317
 I made oi-naengguk, cucumber frozen soup today. 

00:05:30.317 --> 00:05:32.084
 Really really cold 

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:35.091
 I want to serve it when it is very frozen. 

00:05:35.091 --> 00:05:39.490
 In addition, I made a seaweed roll because I want to eat seaweed rolls. 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.359
 So I did it 

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:43.899
 Seaweed rolls are very good with cucumber jelly soup 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.754
 Seaweed rolls 

00:05:51.173 --> 00:05:53.844
 With a big spoon 

00:05:53.844 --> 00:05:57.248
 You can share it 

00:05:57.248 --> 00:05:59.062
 like this 

00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:09.505
 Um~~~~ 

00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:12.978
 (inhalation sound) 

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:19.918
 Ok 

00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:24.744
 Frozen, fresh, sweet, sour, less salty 

00:06:24.744 --> 00:06:29.041
 This with white rice or seaweed rolls is perfect 

00:06:29.041 --> 00:06:33.145
 When I was traveling in Europe, I was crazy about the gazpacho 

00:06:33.145 --> 00:06:36.487
 If you are European, you will understand why I like cold soup 

00:06:36.487 --> 00:06:39.352
 I reminded me of the cucumber frozen soup at that time. 

00:06:39.352 --> 00:06:42.522
 Although the cucumber jelly soup generally does not put small tomatoes 

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:45.589
 But since I came back from Europe 

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:48.129
 I keep thinking about the gazpacho 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.634
 So I added small tomatoes to the cucumber jelly soup. 

00:06:51.634 --> 00:06:53.838
 I am traveling 

00:06:53.838 --> 00:06:57.008
 Understand that different foods come from different cultures 

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.903
 But all have similar practices 

00:06:59.903 --> 00:07:02.077
 So probably you all know the frozen soup. 

00:07:02.077 --> 00:07:05.978
 Today I made oi-naengguk, cucumber frozen soup for everyone. 

00:07:05.978 --> 00:07:07.512
 I hope everyone likes my recipe. 

00:07:07.512 --> 00:07:10.373
 See you next time, bye bye. 

00:07:11.525 --> 00:07:15.239
 (light music)
