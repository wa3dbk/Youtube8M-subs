00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.420
 good morning and find myself I am now 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.670
 thus closes today with a sheet of paper 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.870
 of squared paper like this proceeds 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.510
 from a sheet a4 and we can start 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.600
 well let's start with a square base 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.650
 therefore we will have to explain the square for 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.630
 both heights therefore in half be in 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.630
 horizontal and vertical 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.809
 then we reopen the sheet 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.809
 fold for both diagonals 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.440
 and without opening the last diagonal that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.270
 we have folded and we throw some folds 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:05.170
 to create our square we open 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:13.300
 here we take this fold and we carry it 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:20.260
 then inside this fold Let us take the 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:21.450
 downstream and this side will now match with 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:36.580
 the one below 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:42.970
 same thing this way well now 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:47.710
 take these fins one by one 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.600
 we open here inside 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.380
 at this point we should crush 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.960
 this part of sheet and make sure that 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.000
 this fold that runs through this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.049
 triangle we have here touches 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.049
 this line below 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 I will have to do everything for everyone 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.500
 these fins imagined to dub 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.330
 in speed up 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:33.430
 do it yourself in a while over 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.490
 now well come to this point 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.690
 make sure you have the same number 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.520
 of wings both on one side and on the other 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.400
 as you see here I do n't have them 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:49.900
 they should be four on one side and four 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:52.900
 from the other world between 4 and 12 34 well a 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.580
 at this point we take our model 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.320
 with these triangles in view and i 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.130
 we bring leading down to and a 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.910
 this point we take this side to 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.720
 center and we will do the same also with 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.720
 The other side 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.560
 let's reopen these two folds now 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.380
 let's do something called pet fold 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.390
 rom but we will have to take this task e 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.450
 open it 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.760
 and at this point use the folds that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.590
 we just did as you see i'm 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:51.130
 pushing here to fold the sheet into 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:54.310
 so that a triangle is formed here e 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:58.959
 then pushes it down 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:05.380
 so let 's take the triangle we report 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:08.080
 above and we repeat for all these 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.240
 kind parts to another hospital but 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.110
 today it does not really want the lidl of 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.959
 retouch of speed up 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:19.290
 beware of all these machines 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.790
 they move fast and when it's done you can 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.620
 no rest to bend the cost 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.150
 otherwise they begin to appear already 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.010
 applying 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.050
 now end pause one 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.500
 once we get to this point we should 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:48.560
 take the model that open it 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:52.270
 partially in short this way ea 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.880
 this point we take into consideration 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.350
 one of the high points so this is one 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.510
 low tips 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.990
 as you can see here we have low point 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.420
 bet alternate let's take it in 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:12.130
 two consideration therefore this is 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:19.250
 this at this point we should do so 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:22.490
 we will have to take this high tip e 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:31.540
 push it against one side of the tip 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:34.540
 low as you see it is now instead 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:34.540
 we'll have 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:44.380
 keep this read instead mobile e 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.300
 then bend this tip 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.570
 high down 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.850
 here you will have a fold already done then 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:56.740
 simply click on that 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:06:04.230
 fold push the tip down e 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:04.230
 here it will touch the ground 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.860
 I will have to repeat with all of them 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.500
 fast peckers show me another time and then 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:18.280
 we will leave with the soubrette speed ne 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.770
 has the super- speed nou where I show you 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:27.300
 so let's take this installment of the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.300
 we push against this side and then 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:35.430
 miles down the bet 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.419
 ok by the least maria carmen is the last one 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:48.970
 explained once the result is finished 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:54.460
 it will be this event and so is yours 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:56.050
 Campanula finished by maicon almost closes 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.140
 however, today, as usual, there is 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.360
 we leave with a maxim when you think 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.340
 that no one cares if you try vito 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.090
 not to pay 

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.090
 the car payment
