little more toner than it normally does

little more toner than it normally does
the<00:05:36.790> reason<00:05:37.150> is<00:05:37.390> is<00:05:37.630> so<00:05:37.810> that<00:05:37.960> when<00:05:38.169> I<00:05:38.200> put<00:05:38.500> my

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
the reason is is so that when I put my

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.100 
the reason is is so that when I put my
transfer<00:05:39.280> sheet<00:05:39.640> over<00:05:40.180> my<00:05:40.210> image<00:05:40.630> sheet<00:05:40.900> and

transfer sheet over my image sheet and

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.800 
transfer sheet over my image sheet and
I'm<00:05:41.620> applying<00:05:41.890> my<00:05:42.190> clear<00:05:42.610> emulsion<00:05:43.180> I've<00:05:43.330> got

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
I'm applying my clear emulsion I've got

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.719 
I'm applying my clear emulsion I've got
a<00:05:43.840> nice<00:05:44.200> solid<00:05:44.530> toner<00:05:45.010> layer<00:05:45.340> for<00:05:45.640> that

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
a nice solid toner layer for that
