00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
fixtures on our campus so that we could

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.770 
fixtures on our campus so that we could

using high-efficiency fixtures we

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.370 
using high-efficiency fixtures we

$300<00:02:26.380> per<00:02:26.590> fixture<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.250> would<00:02:27.370> cost<00:02:27.610> about<00:02:27.880> two

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
$300 per fixture it would cost about two

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.790 
$300 per fixture it would cost about two
hundred<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.600> fifty<00:02:28.900> five<00:02:29.020> thousand<00:02:29.560> dollars

to upgrade the lighting these would

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.330 
to upgrade the lighting these would
provide<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.990> savings<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.680> about<00:02:32.800> three<00:02:33.250> hundred
