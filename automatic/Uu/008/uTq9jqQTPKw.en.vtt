00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Well we have ready the entry is already 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.240
 the salad ready and that's good because we 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.400
 open your appetite a salad full of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 flavor of course and a lot of color that 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840
 we are already going to the main course 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.059
 and the main course you go to this steak or 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.830
 steak that sounds like a bit difficult 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.140
 but they're going to see that it's super simple and 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 also super lucidor remember that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.820
 well the cut that we are here 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.539
 using is mignon and fillet mignon 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.750
 is nothing more than the cut that your 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.579
 literal translation is small medallion 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 so good this little medallion is 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.360
 buy at the supermarket already passionate 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.469
 or they can buy the steak of steaks 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.000
 to extort it 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 according to the thickness you want 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 so it is very to taste but it is worth 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'm sorry to suddenly spend a little more 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.410

 medallions of beef with serrano ham and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.580
 asparagus for these versions of beef or 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.520
 filet mignon with serrano ham and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.020
 asparagus will need 6 to 8 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.229
 beef steaks 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.380
 each 150 grams a clove of garlic 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.820

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.649
 soy sauce a quarter cup of sauce 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.170
 english a cup of olive oil 3 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:56.759
 spoonfuls of extra olive oil 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.850
 to fry a cup of red wine a 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:03.750
 cup of beef broth 2 tablespoons of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.720
 flour a teaspoon of fine herbs 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:10.170
 three tablespoons of butter two 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:15.840
 bunches of asparagus cooked al dente or 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.520
 roasted and 400 grams of ham and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.710
 we are ready now we are going to prepare 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.230
 the first thing the marinade for the meat 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.660
 base the marinade that super simple here 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.370
 I have a container, let's start 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.610
 integrate the agito that I have here 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.209
 finely chopped with a touch of 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.520
 pepper of course we are adding a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.010
 little salt little salt only 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.709
 because eye is also marinated the 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.330
 we will use for the sauce and some 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.700
 very important here is that we are 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.070
 using soy sauce that is already 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.870
 pretty salty remember and sauce 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.440
 English that is also quite the 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.480
 Mrs 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.860
 that 's how it can suddenly happen to us of salt and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.230
 is marinated is the one that we are going to use 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 also for the sauce so look out 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.100
 more with that we are adding also a 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.959
 little olive oil that is going to give 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.940
 a lot of flavor and it's also fixing 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.980
 a little our meat those steaks 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.620
 mignon that as I told you the translation 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.010
 literal is small steak or small 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.010
 medallion 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.569
 is what we are going to use the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 beef filet medallions that 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.780
 remember that the beef filet is a 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.819
 very lean meat to which I refer with 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.560
 lean to that it has almost no fat 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.319
 have the sales of grease that 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.700
 other cuts have like that is that good 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.970
 for the steak of the leanest cuts 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.709
 cleaner and younger and that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.720
 they taste so good then there 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.050
 we have the marinade let's now add 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.690
 our little file here if you 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.190
 they can well prepare then leave the 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.230
 marinas of a few minutes and 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.519
 then we're going to cook them 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.989
 issues of time then of course 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.690
 I will forward a little will 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.450
 have to cook these fillets before 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.400
 of time before leaving them there are about 20 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.730
 minutes that are measured and that is 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.250
 soak this salsita well then what 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.360
 what I'm going to do here is put a little 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.240
 of oil 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.950
 to this one 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.260
 let's go now 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.560
 fry our steaks and I want to give them 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.610
 a tip may be that the beef 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.519
 world of the tricks of the beef 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.040
 is that you can be in terms and that 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:18.919
 it differs a lot from each person like that 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.850
 that to give you an idea so that 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.830
 be the red meat they have to leave 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:27.820
 approximately about 4 minutes here in 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.410
 the fire in a fat pan and 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.440
 preheated for 8 to 10 minutes then 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.750
 since we have the pot or rather the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.910
 pan that is something needs preheated 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.290
 from 8 to 10 minutes we will leave the 4 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.110
 minutes the fillets of this thickness for 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:49.050
 that are red if they want it means what 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.960
 Feel the wine half of 5 to 6 minutes 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.780
 and good from 7 to 8 and it's about 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.300
 fillets of a well-cooked meat that are 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.889
 approximately the times 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.440
 so we 're going to put our 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:05.240
 filetitos will let them dry 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:10.569
 I like rojito and we're going to leave it 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.569
 nothing more to 3 minutes on each side 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.500
 to be sealed and here what 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.060
 I want the center to be well 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.100
 I remove so that the meat is juicy 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.010
 but this is also very much to taste in 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.530
 everyone decides how they want their sub 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.870
 term of the meat another of the tips that 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.580
 I want to give them is not to turn the 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.860
 meat until they see you start to go 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.030
 slightly a little bit of juice 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.590
 blood if it 's on top 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.030
 when they see the lend is 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.760
 you need in the top part then 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:39.130
 we can now turn these steaks 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.470
 while we are here also to put in 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.680
 this pan a little bit of oil and 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.880
 let's make our asparagus can 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.260
 to be raw the asparagus 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.400
 here do the or they can also 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.030
 have them lightly bleached 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.030
 bleached 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:59.320
 slightly online or that you stay 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.960
 bleached to account that whiten 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.090
 some vegetables especially with the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.040
 green 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.770
 boiling water boiling water and 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.949
 let's accept a few minutes a minute 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.840
 or two minutes there to the water can be the 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.370
 broccoli can be of course the 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.889
 asparagus what we want is that they remain 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.510
 firm remain al dente al dente 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:21.180
 means slightly resistant to 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.979
 tooth not then we want it to 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.290
 stay slightly al dente I hope that 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:27.060
 remain soft if we already bleach 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:29.040
 then when we do them it's going to be 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.139
 just a little bit we're going to put a 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:33.719
 little salt and pepper 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:36.360
 to our asparagus that are going to 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:39.389
 accompany our steak our steak 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.610
 it's ready we 're going to take them out 

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:43.129
 here 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.050
 so that it will not happen to us 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:47.569
 term and we're going to dry up 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:50.479
 It seems that the more cooking, the more 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:52.520
 dry is the meat although I repeat it is worth 

00:06:50.479 --> 00:06:54.379
 it is worth doing it you like 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.469
 well cooked the meat good then that 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:59.780
 may they be able to taste and taste their 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:03.020
 meat as you like now here 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:06.379
 in this same pan we will put nothing 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.370
 plus a little bit of butter we're going to 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:09.590
 take advantage of the butter that 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.629
 we have to flavor this lack a 

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:14.659
 little bit of butter that melts and 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.729
 let's put our wine to it 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:19.039
 lightly evaporate eye with wine 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:21.979
 remember that if you shine a little bit 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.840
 of this wine in the fire will you learn 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:25.310
 a little bit can be burned you can not 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.409
 give a good scare if it is that eye with that 

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.729
 We have to leave the wine 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.770
 how many minutes nothing more than that 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:32.750
 Evaporate the alcohol to release the pain 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.520
 strong alcohol and that we have a 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.349
 flavor of rich wine so choose let it 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.879
 here the minute and a half we're going 

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:39.710
 you will fly inma to a commercial court and 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:42.260
 we come back here of course until 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:46.390
 sound him celebrating today 

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.390
 if we are a cut we go back
