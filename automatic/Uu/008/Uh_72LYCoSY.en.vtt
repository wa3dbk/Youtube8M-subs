00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.670 
inch strips here and then when you turn
the<00:01:00.610> ruler<00:01:00.850> around<00:01:01.180> you<00:01:01.809> use<00:01:01.989> it<00:01:02.170> to<00:01:02.290> cut<00:01:02.469> your

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
the ruler around you use it to cut your

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.100 
the ruler around you use it to cut your
actual<00:01:03.010> shape<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:05.379> the<00:01:06.630> bat<00:01:07.630> out<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:07.990> way

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.580 
actual shape with the bat out of the way
and<00:01:08.289> bring<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.590> strip<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.280> can<00:01:09.430> see

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.960 

with<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.770> strip<00:01:15.039> rulers<00:01:15.430> there<00:01:15.640> are<00:01:15.759> also

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
with the strip rulers there are also

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.490 
with the strip rulers there are also
these<00:01:16.300> circles<00:01:17.009> cut<00:01:18.009> out<00:01:18.160> areas<00:01:18.580> here<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
these circles cut out areas here and the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.590 
these circles cut out areas here and the
reason<00:01:20.649> for<00:01:20.860> those<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.819> so<00:01:21.970> that<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.240> can<00:01:22.390> cut

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
reason for those and so that you can cut

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.559 
reason for those and so that you can cut
all<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.990> way<00:01:23.110> across<00:01:23.229> a<00:01:23.500> strip<00:01:24.209> without<00:01:25.209> ever

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
all the way across a strip without ever

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:28.440 
all the way across a strip without ever
running<00:01:25.810> into<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.319> ruler<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:28.000> let<00:01:28.209> me<00:01:28.240> show

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
running into the ruler here let me show

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.910 
running into the ruler here let me show
you<00:01:30.119> how<00:01:31.119> we'll<00:01:31.330> do<00:01:31.450> some<00:01:31.660> cutting<00:01:31.869> I<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.649> two

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
you how we'll do some cutting I have two

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.010 
you how we'll do some cutting I have two
strips<00:01:33.310> here<00:01:33.640> stacked<00:01:34.000> up<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:34.450> there<00:01:34.599> are<00:01:34.720> four

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
strips here stacked up so there are four

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.680 
strips here stacked up so there are four
layers<00:01:35.319> and<00:01:35.679> that<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.310> as<00:01:36.700> many<00:01:37.000> layers<00:01:37.270> that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
layers and that is as many layers that

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.040 
layers and that is as many layers that
all<00:01:37.810> as<00:01:38.050> I'll<00:01:38.229> work<00:01:38.470> with<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:40.660> the<00:01:40.720> reason<00:01:41.020> for

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
all as I'll work with and the reason for

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.380 
all as I'll work with and the reason for
that<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.560> want<00:01:41.860> some<00:01:42.340> accuracy<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.119> I<00:01:43.179> want

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
that is I want some accuracy and I want

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.719 
that is I want some accuracy and I want
control<00:01:43.539> when<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.229> come<00:01:44.530> off<00:01:44.800> of<00:01:45.039> that<00:01:45.190> stack<00:01:45.520> of

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
control when I come off of that stack of

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.270 
control when I come off of that stack of
fabric<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.209> any<00:01:46.750> more<00:01:46.990> than<00:01:47.170> four<00:01:47.470> I<00:01:47.770> think<00:01:47.890> I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
fabric and any more than four I think I

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.710 
fabric and any more than four I think I
would<00:01:48.490> probably<00:01:48.670> have<00:01:49.179> more<00:01:49.360> of<00:01:49.420> a<00:01:49.509> tendency

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
would probably have more of a tendency

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.499 
would probably have more of a tendency
to<00:01:49.990> run<00:01:50.140> into<00:01:50.470> the<00:01:50.560> ruler<00:01:50.950> so<00:01:51.330> here<00:01:52.330> we're

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
to run into the ruler so here we're

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.540 
to run into the ruler so here we're
going<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.810> cut<00:01:53.410> our<00:01:53.560> first-dance<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:56.550> cut

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
going to cut our first-dance over cut

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.600 
going to cut our first-dance over cut
our<00:01:57.789> second<00:01:58.679> dance<00:01:59.679> back

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.610 

so<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:03.480> cutting<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> little<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.050> slowly<00:02:04.350> when

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
so I'm cutting a little more slowly when

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:13.510 
so I'm cutting a little more slowly when
I'm<00:02:04.740> coming<00:02:04.920> back<00:02:05.160> towards<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> ruler<00:02:10.340> you

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520
