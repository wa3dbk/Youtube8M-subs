00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
 Hello 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.569
 good to start our work 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.540
 then we need wool of any 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.550
 caliber 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.980
 I'm going to work with this I thought 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.040
 very cute as for a scarf in this 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.380
 At the moment I have a measure the measure that 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.560
 you choose this is going to be the width 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.340
 of our scarf we are going then to 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.320
 catch the wool 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.300
 any wool does not matter the caliber and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.349
 we're going to come then and we're going to 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.809
 place here 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.809
 in this way without squeezing 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.480
 we are not going to do many laps 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's say that at this moment I have 1 2 3 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.530
 4 5 laps 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:54.850
 and I'm going to take it out of there 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:57.899
 I will go then and I will place it here 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.899
 well ordered 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.830
 in the machine we're going to roll this up 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 here to avoid being talked to and 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.600
 we fall 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.369
 we are going to ride it 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.000
 as much as we can so that we stay 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 bushy 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.440
 well having already on the iron of the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.160
 machine 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.160
 the thread 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 I'm going to come, I'm going to look for more or less 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 half with the same carton and the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.430
 half is here where I have it 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.430
 located 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.140
 and what I'm going to do now is that I'm going to 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 pass a straight stitch 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.140
 larguita 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.250
 here 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.010
 very careful then I will pass 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 a stitch 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.820
 straight 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.350
 here in the center 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.010
 and before ending here before the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.310
 come out 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.239
 I am guided by this same measure and I continue 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.239
 bending 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.379
 until then 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.760
 the long 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.830
 what we want 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.680
 for our scarf remember that the 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.630
 Folds that I am doing here are 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.030
 The width 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.030
 the long is being here 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:44.060
 then we will continue to double 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.060
 until we achieve the desired length 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.870
 and we follow then 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.290
 going 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.849
 the straight end 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.849
 in half 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.050
 well here I've been several laps 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.050
 then look how it is being 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.129
 that's how our 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.129
 scarf 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.700
 then I will continue 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.680
 until I achieve the length I want 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.530
 at this point of our fabric the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.000
 scarf is already that long 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.550
 how I chose a wool with balls 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.890
 so I'm staying like a round 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.440
 But here we can see how we 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.840
 is already staying after several 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.440
 turns 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.750
 knowing would be in this case 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.550
 good my friends how can we see 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.940
 then here is our finished 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.330
 scarf we can see how it looks 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.970
 how round that depends on the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.590
 wool they have chosen really is very 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.900
 easy at the time of sewing 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.350
 we finish in the initial part and 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.190
 We finished in the final part to avoid 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.970
 what 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.220
 we let go of my friends once 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.560
 more then I hope my contribution has 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.560
 been useful a hug for all
