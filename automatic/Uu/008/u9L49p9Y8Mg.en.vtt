00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.260
In this lecture, we’ll be looking at the
greenhouse gas water vapor.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.380
It’s actually one of the reasons why our
climate is so sensitive to small changes - water

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.350
vapor amplifies a small amount of warming
and makes it a big warming.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.830
Let’s explore why.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.040
Water vapor and carbon dioxide are both greenhouse
gases, meaning they both absorb the earth’s

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.390
outgoing heat, raising global average temperatures
through a blanketing effect called the greenhouse

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.640
effect.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.480
For example, maybe you’ve experienced water
vapor as a greenhouse gas because on a humid,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.640
summer night, temperatures stay hot because
the water vapor doesn’t allow the heat to

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.850
escape.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.370
There’s a lot of water vapor in the air,
but the amount varies based on location and

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.670
height.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.559
Carbon dioxide concentrations are small, only
making up about 0.04% of the air.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.330
Carbon dioxide is emitted through burning
fossil fuels and deforestation, both caused

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.220
by humans, while water vapor comes from evaporation
of liquid water off of bodies of water, mainly

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.880
the oceans.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.190
The amount of evaporation depends on the global
temperature.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.960
A warmer Earth has a more humid atmosphere.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.460
The warmer it gets, the more evaporation off
the surface of the ocean, putting more water

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.560
vapor into the warmer atmosphere.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.591
Another reason for higher humidity is that
warmer air can “hold” more water vapor

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.700
than cold air.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.880
As the globe warms, evaporation from the oceans
causes water vapor to build up.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.049
But water vapor is a greenhouse gas.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.310
So this excess water vapor causes the atmosphere
to warm even further.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.450
This allows even MORE water to evaporate into
the atmosphere, causing an EVEN FURTHER warming

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.950
due to a stronger greenhouse effect.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.620
This is an amplifying feedback, a self-reinforcing
loop.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.450
In fact this feedback is the most important
of many fascinating feedbacks in our climate

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.619
system.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.229
It takes a small warming, amplifies it and
makes it a big warming.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.590
Water vapor feedback play a big part in making
the Earth’s climate sensitive to small changes.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.310
If the global climate and the global average
temperatures stayed relatively the same, the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.590
water vapor feedback wouldn’t be kicked
into gear.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.460
But because we’re increasing carbon dioxide
from burning fossil fuels and deforestation,

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.859
the earth is getting slightly warmer, kicking
this feedback into playing a large role in

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.130
the climate system.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.000
It’s like having a skateboarder at the top
of a hill, let’s call him Water Vapor.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.040
He’s sitting comfortably at the peak, stably
sitting steady at rest, in equilibrium.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.920
His buddy, let’s call him Carbon Dioxide,
comes along and gives him a little nudge.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.709
Well, this gets him rolling down the hill
faster and faster as he goes down.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.830
Without Carbon Dioxide pushing Water Vapor
just a little bit and getting him started

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.530
down the hill, he would have stayed comfortably
at rest at the top of the hill.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.580
This is how amplifying feedbacks work, they
amplify changes once they are set into motion!

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.090
The same thing happens in the atmosphere.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
Carbon dioxide acts as the trigger for the
water vapor feedback.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.150
Humans don’t control how much water vapor
is in the atmosphere, that’s up to the weather.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.030
We CAN control carbon dioxide concentrations,
though, and by letting our carbon dioxide

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.510
levels get high enough to warm the atmosphere,
we are therefore responsible for triggering

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.230
the water vapor feedback, amplifying the warming
from carbon dioxide.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.580
If carbon dioxide warms the atmosphere 1 degree
Celsius, then water vapor can cause the temperature

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.310
to go up another 1 degree.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.810
But some climate myths take this science out
of context.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.609
Let's look at an example.

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.150
One myth related to water vapor claims, “Forget
carbon dioxide, water vapor is the most important

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.610
greenhouse gas.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.709
It controls the Earth’s temperature.”

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.730
This implies if water vapor is a strong greenhouse
gas and we have it in large concentrations

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.370
in the atmosphere, then adding a small amount
of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide can’t

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.359
make a big difference in global average temperatures.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.229
The fallacy here is jumping to false conclusions.

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.750
It is true that water vapor is a greenhouse
gas, but that doesn’t mean that carbon dioxide

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.750
is not.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.610
It ignores the fact that they play very different
roles in the climate system.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.780
In other words, this myth is trying to use
information about water vapor to distract

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.789
you to imply that an increase in carbon dioxide
isn’t a problem.

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.189
It also oversimplifies the science.

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.740
But now you know that water vapor doesn’t
control the Earth’s temperature, but instead

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.419
is controlled BY earth’s temperature.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.690
Carbon dioxide IS important because it controls
the Earth’s thermostat.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.449
If carbon dioxide levels go up, the temperature
gets warmer.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.020
As a consequence, water vapor levels increase.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.600
Water vapor IS the most dominant greenhouse
gas, but the only way we can keep levels under

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:26.040
control is by keeping temperatures low through
lowering carbon dioxide emissions!
