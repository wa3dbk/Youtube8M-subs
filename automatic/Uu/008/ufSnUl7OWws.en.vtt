flying<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.989> an

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
flying here and there but not an

excessive amount

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.699 
excessive amount
um<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.370> more<00:02:12.700> than<00:02:13.140> higher<00:02:14.140> end<00:02:14.410> shadows

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.600 
so I really like this nail polish
because<00:05:34.780> it<00:05:35.020> just<00:05:35.170> makes<00:05:35.440> my<00:05:36.130> natural<00:05:36.580> nails

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
because it just makes my natural nails

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.760 
because it just makes my natural nails
just<00:05:37.240> look<00:05:37.480> a<00:05:37.690> little<00:05:37.870> more<00:05:37.960> polished<00:05:38.500> and

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
just look a little more polished and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.880 
just look a little more polished and
then<00:05:39.250> the<00:05:39.400> more<00:05:39.610> and<00:05:39.760> more<00:05:40.260> layers<00:05:41.260> i<00:05:41.500> added<00:05:41.770> of

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
then the more and more layers i added of

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.400 
then the more and more layers i added of
course<00:05:42.100> it<00:05:42.280> got<00:05:42.370> more<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.700> more<00:05:42.850> pink<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:44.050> so

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
course it got more and more pink and so

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.260 
course it got more and more pink and so
this<00:05:44.560> is<00:05:44.770> a<00:05:44.800> really<00:05:44.950> pretty<00:05:45.250> color<00:05:45.340> and<00:05:45.970> i

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
this is a really pretty color and i

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.730 
this is a really pretty color and i
think<00:05:46.510> this<00:05:46.600> is<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.840> perfect<00:05:47.080> nail<00:05:47.410> polish

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
think this is the perfect nail polish

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.960 
think this is the perfect nail polish
for<00:05:47.920> like<00:05:48.040> a<00:05:48.070> little<00:05:48.400> girl<00:05:48.640> if<00:05:48.760> you<00:05:48.850> have<00:05:48.940> a
