Galaxy Tab we've already done a review
on<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:11.010> if<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.160> want<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.370> check<00:00:11.519> that<00:00:11.580> out

we've<00:00:14.219> already<00:00:14.429> dropped<00:00:14.790> tested<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.630> iPad<00:00:16.350> 2

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
we've already dropped tested the iPad 2

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.240 
we've already dropped tested the iPad 2
and<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:18.359> iPhone<00:00:18.930> 4s<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.380> they<00:00:19.770> did<00:00:19.920> not<00:00:20.100> fare

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
and the iPhone 4s and they did not fare

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.019 
and the iPhone 4s and they did not fare
well<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.460> all

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
well at all

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.849 
well at all
we<00:00:21.330> do<00:00:21.510> expect<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.230> last<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.590> little<00:00:22.680> bit

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
we do expect this to last a little bit

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.880 
we do expect this to last a little bit
better<00:00:23.010> than<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> iPad<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.910> iPhone<00:00:24.480> did

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
better than the iPad and iPhone did

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
better than the iPad and iPhone did
albeit<00:00:25.890> there<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> lot<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.699> glass<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.359> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
albeit there is a lot of glass in the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.120 
albeit there is a lot of glass in the
structure<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.199> plastic<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:28.859> it's<00:00:29.010> not

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
structure it's plastic so it's not

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.790 
structure it's plastic so it's not
aluminum<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.760> guess<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:31.050> probably<00:00:31.500> going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
aluminum I guess is it's probably going

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020 
aluminum I guess is it's probably going
to<00:00:31.859> break<00:00:32.040> but<00:00:32.160> probably<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.610> another<00:00:32.759> three

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to break but probably not another three

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.660 
to break but probably not another three
foot<00:00:33.210> drop<00:00:33.420> maybe<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.559> 5<00:00:34.710> foot<00:00:34.890> definitely

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
foot drop maybe on the 5 foot definitely

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.790 
foot drop maybe on the 5 foot definitely
on<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.790> face<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.809> guess<00:00:37.469> we'll<00:00:37.649> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
on the face down but I guess we'll just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.250 
on the face down but I guess we'll just
have<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> watch<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.640> check<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.329> out<00:00:39.420> first

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
have to watch and see check it out first

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.150 
have to watch and see check it out first
three<00:00:40.950> foot<00:00:41.190> drop<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.879> concrete<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:43.160> think

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
three foot drop on the concrete I think

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.619 
three foot drop on the concrete I think
it's<00:00:44.250> safe<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.430> say<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.940> plastic<00:00:45.360> did<00:00:45.539> an

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
it's safe to say that the plastic did an

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's safe to say that the plastic did an
exceptional<00:00:46.020> job<00:00:46.289> absorbing<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.250> impact<00:00:47.399> and

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
exceptional job absorbing the impact and

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.490 
exceptional job absorbing the impact and
spreading<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.390> as<00:00:48.510> opposed<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.989> Apple

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
spreading it as opposed to the Apple

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.319 
spreading it as opposed to the Apple
products<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> an<00:00:50.489> aluminum<00:00:50.969> casing

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
products which is an aluminum casing

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.150 
products which is an aluminum casing
with<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> impact<00:00:51.989> spread<00:00:52.320> almost<00:00:52.530> instantly

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
with the impact spread almost instantly

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.889 
with the impact spread almost instantly
to<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.489> glass<00:00:56.180> well<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> looks<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.600> it

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
to the glass well it looks like it

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.049 
to the glass well it looks like it
survived<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> initial<00:00:58.710> all<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.670> really

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
survived the initial all actually really

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.069 
survived the initial all actually really
well<00:01:00.210> there's<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> an

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
well there's a little bit of an

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
well there's a little bit of an
indention<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> plastic<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.210> almost

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
indention on the plastic but it's almost

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.660 
indention on the plastic but it's almost
not<00:01:03.989> noticeable<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:05.010> you're<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.460> paying

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
not noticeable as you're really paying

actually<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> plastic<00:01:13.530> separate<00:01:14.340> from

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
actually see the plastic separate from
