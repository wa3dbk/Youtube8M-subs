00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
like a wind and everything on it and I

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.270 
like a wind and everything on it and I
told<00:01:29.690> about<00:01:29.930> learning<00:01:30.230> planning<00:01:30.620> on<00:01:30.710> making<00:01:30.860> a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
told about learning planning on making a

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.630 
told about learning planning on making a
very<00:01:31.490> spammy<00:01:31.820> don't<00:01:32.660> make<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:32.990> not<00:01:33.530> so<00:01:33.920> just

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
very spammy don't make it not so just

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.900 
very spammy don't make it not so just
decided<00:01:35.240> then<00:01:35.390> combine<00:01:35.810> our<00:01:35.990> efforts<00:01:36.910> genuine

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910

I<00:01:39.790> think<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:41.510> think<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.020> worked<00:01:42.230> well<00:01:42.500> kind<00:01:42.920> of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
I think I think it worked well kind of

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.000 
I think I think it worked well kind of
combining<00:01:43.850> the<00:01:44.150> race<00:01:44.660> marked<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.290> guess<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.800> the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
combining the race marked I guess in the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.460 
combining the race marked I guess in the
traps<00:01:46.460> because<00:01:46.700> they<00:01:47.210> make<00:01:47.690> some<00:01:47.900> traps<00:01:48.200> are

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
traps because they make some traps are

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.500 
traps because they make some traps are
out<00:01:48.740> of<00:01:48.890> place<00:01:49.040> on<00:01:49.370> race<00:01:49.640> fans<00:01:49.910> like<00:01:50.120> don't<00:01:50.360> be

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
out of place on race fans like don't be

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.140 
out of place on race fans like don't be
like<00:01:50.690> a<00:01:50.840> killer<00:01:51.140> trap<00:01:51.590> that's<00:01:51.800> just<00:01:52.190> like<00:01:52.400> why

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
like a killer trap that's just like why

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.469 
like a killer trap that's just like why
that<00:01:53.479> there<00:01:53.750> that<00:01:53.990> doesn't<00:01:54.200> belong<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:54.590> and

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
that there that doesn't belong there and

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.360 
that there that doesn't belong there and
really<00:01:56.479> obscure<00:01:56.930> but<00:01:57.350> this<00:01:57.530> one<00:01:57.740> kind<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.160> each

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
really obscure but this one kind of each

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.030 
really obscure but this one kind of each
this<00:01:59.090> race<00:01:59.360> gives<00:01:59.720> you<00:01:59.900> an<00:02:00.020> opportunity<00:02:00.320> to

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
this race gives you an opportunity to

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.790 
this race gives you an opportunity to
avoid<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:01.910> traps<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:02.869> put<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.350> with<00:02:03.680> this

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
avoid the traps we put on with this

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.250 
avoid the traps we put on with this
difficult<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.670> get<00:02:04.850> around<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.630> another

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
difficult to get around and another

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.160 
difficult to get around and another
thing<00:02:06.880> the<00:02:07.880> traps<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.300> not<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.750> set<00:02:08.990> by

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
thing the traps are not just set by

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.070 
thing the traps are not just set by
timing<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.310> actually<00:02:10.640> own<00:02:11.060> set<00:02:11.840> them

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
timing you can actually own set them

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.500 
timing you can actually own set them
like<00:02:12.560> other<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.459> beginning<00:02:13.820> where<00:02:14.390> you

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510

like other one the beginning where you
going<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> trip<00:02:15.170> right<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:21.489> knee<00:02:22.489> traps

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850
