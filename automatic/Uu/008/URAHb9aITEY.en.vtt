00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
only was I homeless but I felt like I

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.780 
only was I homeless but I felt like I
didn't<00:00:42.199> have<00:00:42.290> anything<00:00:42.830> to<00:00:43.100> live<00:00:43.220> for<00:00:43.280> I

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:43.790

didn't<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.900> any<00:00:45.290> sort<00:00:46.159> of<00:00:46.220> certainties

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
didn't have any sort of certainties

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.750 
didn't have any sort of certainties
about<00:00:47.390> what<00:00:47.540> I<00:00:47.570> would<00:00:47.809> do<00:00:47.989> next<00:00:48.229> and<00:00:48.760> instead

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
about what I would do next and instead

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.340 
about what I would do next and instead
of<00:00:49.850> looking<00:00:50.210> to<00:00:50.330> the<00:00:50.420> future<00:00:50.839> I<00:00:50.870> was<00:00:51.080> just

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
of looking to the future I was just

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.110 
of looking to the future I was just
taking<00:00:52.040> each<00:00:52.129> day<00:00:52.370> as<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:52.640> comes

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
taking each day as it comes

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.340 
taking each day as it comes
so<00:00:54.049> that<00:00:54.379> uncertainty<00:00:55.330> made<00:00:56.330> it<00:00:56.479> hard<00:00:56.720> to<00:00:57.019> sort

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so that uncertainty made it hard to sort

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:05.020 
so that uncertainty made it hard to sort
of<00:00:57.440> have<00:00:57.680> hope<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.280> to<00:00:58.519> to<00:00:59.479> carry<00:00:59.809> on<00:01:03.489> after<00:01:04.489> a

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
of have hope and to to carry on after a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.570 
of have hope and to to carry on after a
while<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.479> sofa<00:01:05.870> surfing<00:01:06.080> it<00:01:06.799> all<00:01:07.010> became<00:01:07.310> too

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580
