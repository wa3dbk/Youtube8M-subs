and along tea I prefer to use loose tea
which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.729> generally<00:01:27.209> of<00:01:27.299> higher<00:01:27.509> quality

which is generally of higher quality

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.779 
which is generally of higher quality
than<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.439> sort<00:01:28.649> of<00:01:28.679> tea<00:01:28.859> that<00:01:29.099> you<00:01:29.279> can<00:01:29.310> buy<00:01:29.639> in

that<00:01:31.979> often<00:01:32.249> the<00:01:32.340> paper<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.849> bleached<00:01:33.179> through

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that often the paper is bleached through

that often the paper is bleached through
all<00:01:33.929> sorts<00:01:34.169> of<00:01:34.229> chemical<00:01:34.619> processes<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.490> then

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
all sorts of chemical processes and then

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.569 
all sorts of chemical processes and then
they<00:01:36.060> use<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.810> kind<00:01:37.169> of<00:01:37.289> glue<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.590> glue<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.429> tea

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
they use a kind of glue to glue the tea

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.709 
they use a kind of glue to glue the tea
back<00:01:38.789> together<00:01:39.029> and<00:01:39.450> those<00:01:40.169> may<00:01:41.069> leave

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
back together and those may leave

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.269 
back together and those may leave
unhealthy<00:01:42.719> residues<00:01:43.109> in<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.409> TV<00:01:43.859> going<00:01:44.069> to<00:01:44.189> be

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:44.279 
unhealthy residues in the TV going to be

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.239 
unhealthy residues in the TV going to be
drinking<00:01:44.459> so<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> prefer<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.299> real<00:01:46.139> thing

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
drinking so I prefer the real thing

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.379 
drinking so I prefer the real thing
which<00:01:47.249> makes<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:47.579> much<00:01:47.669> easier<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.029> see

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
which makes it much easier to see

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:49.849 
which makes it much easier to see
whether<00:01:48.689> you're<00:01:48.869> getting<00:01:49.109> good<00:01:49.229> quality<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:49.859 
whether you're getting good quality I

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.159 
whether you're getting good quality I
used<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> really<00:01:51.119> not<00:01:51.389> like<00:01:51.419> drinking<00:01:51.869> green

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169

show<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.319> how<00:01:58.889> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.399> green<00:01:59.609> tea<00:01:59.669> that

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
show you how you can make green tea that

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.330 
show you how you can make green tea that
tastes<00:02:00.659> mild<00:02:00.989> and<00:02:01.349> not<00:02:01.380> at<00:02:01.679> all<00:02:01.799> bitter

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
tastes mild and not at all bitter

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.269 
tastes mild and not at all bitter
the<00:02:03.209> secret<00:02:03.539> is<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:03.719> using<00:02:04.200> less<00:02:04.679> than<00:02:04.889> boiling

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
the secret is in using less than boiling

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.920 
the secret is in using less than boiling
water<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:06.450> 150<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:07.349> 200

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930

steep<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.990> too<00:02:14.140> long<00:02:14.320> about<00:02:14.620> three<00:02:15.130> to<00:02:15.520> five

steep for too long about three to five
minutes<00:02:15.840> what<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.020> is<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.380> take<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.860> deep<00:02:18.100> pot

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
minutes what I do is I take a deep pot

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.150 
minutes what I do is I take a deep pot
and<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.970> put<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> cotton<00:02:19.450> mesh<00:02:19.780> tea<00:02:20.260> bag<00:02:20.470> in<00:02:20.680> there

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
and I put a cotton mesh tea bag in there

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.970 
and I put a cotton mesh tea bag in there
you<00:02:21.880> can<00:02:22.030> also<00:02:22.180> buy<00:02:22.450> disposable<00:02:23.200> tea<00:02:23.650> bags<00:02:23.860> if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
you can also buy disposable tea bags if

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.860 
you can also buy disposable tea bags if
you<00:02:24.010> prefer<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:24.730> works<00:02:25.000> well<00:02:25.240> rather<00:02:25.630> nicely

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
you prefer this works well rather nicely

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.750 
you prefer this works well rather nicely
and<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.260> wash<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.560> and<00:02:26.890> keep<00:02:27.160> reusing<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
and you can wash it and keep reusing it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.280 
and you can wash it and keep reusing it
then<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.959> place<00:02:29.620> my<00:02:29.920> green<00:02:30.550> tea<00:02:30.850> in<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.930> tea<00:02:32.110> bag

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
then I place my green tea in a tea bag

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.920 
then I place my green tea in a tea bag
and<00:02:32.590> I've<00:02:33.550> pour<00:02:33.880> my<00:02:34.530> warm<00:02:35.530> very<00:02:36.250> warm<00:02:36.520> water

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
and I've pour my warm very warm water

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.190 
and I've pour my warm very warm water
over<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.360> good<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.630> about<00:02:40.750> these<00:02:40.959> tea

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
over and the good thing about these tea

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.780 
over and the good thing about these tea
bags<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.590> that<00:02:41.620> tea<00:02:42.070> really<00:02:42.280> has<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.520> lot<00:02:42.760> of

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
bags is that tea really has a lot of

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.180 
bags is that tea really has a lot of
room<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.090> infuse<00:02:43.660> but<00:02:44.470> then<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.739> can<00:02:44.920> remove

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
room to infuse but then you can remove

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.949 
room to infuse but then you can remove
it<00:02:45.400> so<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.730> tea<00:02:45.880> doesn't<00:02:46.180> get<00:02:46.270> too<00:02:46.450> bit<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
it so the tea doesn't get too bit and it

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.740 
it so the tea doesn't get too bit and it
doesn't<00:02:47.260> over<00:02:47.800> steep<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.910> reuse<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.720> you

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
doesn't over steep you can reuse it you

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.330 
doesn't over steep you can reuse it you
can<00:02:50.080> put<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.260> back<00:02:50.380> in<00:02:50.620> the<00:02:50.739> tea<00:02:50.890> pot<00:02:51.070> when<00:02:51.220> it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
can put it back in the tea pot when it's

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.880 
can put it back in the tea pot when it's
empty<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.820> pour<00:02:52.450> a<00:02:52.480> second<00:02:53.080> lot<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.470> hot<00:02:53.650> water

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
empty and pour a second lot of hot water

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.710 
empty and pour a second lot of hot water
over<00:02:54.989> now<00:02:55.989> wait<00:02:56.320> for<00:02:56.350> three<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.010> four<00:02:57.190> minutes

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
over now wait for three to four minutes

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.570 
over now wait for three to four minutes
once<00:02:58.720> you've<00:02:58.900> finished<00:02:59.190> infusing<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.340> teeth

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
once you've finished infusing the teeth

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.280 
once you've finished infusing the teeth
just<00:03:01.380> drain<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.650> mint<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.640> take<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.090> out<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
just drain the mint and take it out and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.320 
just drain the mint and take it out and
you've<00:03:05.890> got<00:03:06.040> your<00:03:06.130> cup<00:03:06.340> your<00:03:06.880> pot<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.060> green

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
you've got your cup your pot of green

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.000 
you've got your cup your pot of green
tea<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.080> used<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.320> be<00:03:08.410> thought<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.890> you

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
tea now it used to be thought that you

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.410 
tea now it used to be thought that you
have<00:03:09.190> to<00:03:09.310> drink<00:03:09.550> your<00:03:09.670> tea<00:03:09.820> immediately

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
have to drink your tea immediately

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.870 
have to drink your tea immediately
because<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.930> EGC<00:03:11.200> G's<00:03:11.620> tend<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.489> dissipate

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
because the EGC G's tend to dissipate

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.539 
because the EGC G's tend to dissipate
after<00:03:13.150> a<00:03:13.390> short<00:03:13.810> period<00:03:13.989> of<00:03:14.110> time<00:03:14.170> in<00:03:14.799> pure<00:03:15.280> tea

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
after a short period of time in pure tea

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.940 
after a short period of time in pure tea
but<00:03:16.269> researchers<00:03:17.019> have<00:03:17.049> found<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.799> if<00:03:17.890> you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
but researchers have found that if you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.490 
but researchers have found that if you
add<00:03:18.100> lemon<00:03:18.280> juice<00:03:18.610> and<00:03:18.910> sugar<00:03:19.420> or<00:03:19.959> honey<00:03:20.170> to

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
add lemon juice and sugar or honey to

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.680 
add lemon juice and sugar or honey to
the<00:03:20.620> tea<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.430> EGC<00:03:21.670> G's<00:03:21.970> will<00:03:22.120> actually<00:03:22.510> last

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
the tea the EGC G's will actually last

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.449 
the tea the EGC G's will actually last
longer<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:23.170> that's<00:03:23.470> what<00:03:23.709> I<00:03:23.860> like<00:03:24.190> to<00:03:24.340> do

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
longer so that's what I like to do

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.920 
longer so that's what I like to do
partly<00:03:24.850> because<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.180> also<00:03:25.299> makes<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.750> tea

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
partly because it also makes the tea

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.660 
partly because it also makes the tea
taste<00:03:26.500> fresher<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.250> even<00:03:27.549> less<00:03:27.700> bitter<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.510> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
taste fresher and even less bitter so I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.150 
taste fresher and even less bitter so I
put<00:03:30.670> about<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:31.420> tablespoon<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:32.350> occasion<00:03:32.860> in

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
put about a tablespoon of occasion in

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.660 
put about a tablespoon of occasion in

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.850 
because then you might want to
compensate<00:03:56.360> with<00:03:56.810> adding<00:03:57.200> even<00:03:57.409> more<00:03:57.560> honey

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
compensate with adding even more honey

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.729 
compensate with adding even more honey
and<00:03:58.129> obviously<00:03:59.030> we're<00:03:59.690> trying<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.290> keep<00:04:00.470> the

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
and obviously we're trying to keep the

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.280 
and obviously we're trying to keep the
amount<00:04:00.980> of<00:04:01.069> added<00:04:01.250> sugar<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.030> a<00:04:02.060> minimum<00:04:02.569> this

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
amount of added sugar to a minimum this

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.259 
amount of added sugar to a minimum this
by<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.530> way<00:04:03.709> doesn't<00:04:03.950> just<00:04:04.370> keep<00:04:04.549> each<00:04:04.730> ECGs

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
by the way doesn't just keep each ECGs

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.449 
by the way doesn't just keep each ECGs
going<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.959> also<00:04:06.230> increases<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.190> absorption

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
going it also increases the absorption

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.940 
going it also increases the absorption
of<00:04:08.150> them<00:04:08.540> of<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.019> EGC<00:04:09.290> g's<00:04:09.560> into<00:04:09.829> your

of them of the EGC g's into your

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
bloodstream fourfold so it's really

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.020 
bloodstream fourfold so it's really
useful<00:04:12.890> idea<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.340> do<00:04:13.459> this<00:04:13.610> now<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.790> can

useful idea to do this now you can

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.689 
useful idea to do this now you can
either<00:04:14.180> drink<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.690> hot<00:04:14.900> like<00:04:15.230> this<00:04:15.440> or<00:04:15.920> you<00:04:16.430> can

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
either drink it hot like this or you can

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:18.039 
either drink it hot like this or you can
cool<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.329> then<00:04:17.389> chill<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.750> in<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:17.959> fridge

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
