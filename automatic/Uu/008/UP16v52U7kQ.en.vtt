00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.230
 this is no longer in hands 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.480
 the when 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.480
 in particular 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.379
 later we will do that 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.379
 after submitting proposals 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.509
 a year earlier March and no no 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.759
 the brazilian 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.640
 I now feel that we are moving away 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 brussels the eu men 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.160
 fc 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.780
 the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.260
 we don't have to do this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.170
 it it is the first set was the positive approach 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.480
 there is room enough 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
 count a knee 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.090
 later in the week it looked like that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.690
 know on twitter 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.460
 willow lost something 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.390
 that you have refused as the most important, so a very double result 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.270
 although there is mainly that you have the option to move forward 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.570
 dinosaurs 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.730
 last year ago 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.450
 good luck 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.730
 from it all right 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.520
 and that is not easy 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.740
 the Londoners 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.740
 hotels opened 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.350
 nobody has anything on it 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.520
 9 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.830
 Anderlecht started 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.390
 so is the bottom 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.210
 normal people 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.510
 in London 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.130
 since then 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.130
 86 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.719
 you could arrive just in time at home and abroad 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.700
 be the Netherlands 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.700
 we are currently a few months 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.079
 this is looking for a hospital 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.779
 next to the goal 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:36.799
 this fits 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.529
 potchefstroom 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:40.429
 the shortage would come 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.169
 Sint-Niklaas 

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:46.169
 nobody had the family 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:52.279
 but we have 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:57.229
 after the meal 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 after all years 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.749
 it's a class too strong 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:09.969
 if an email wanted to fit 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.499
 alphen in belgium it fits in the plus 

00:03:12.499 --> 00:03:15.499
 6 it concerns a solution 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.169
 it used to be the device 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.349
 if she wanted to marry him 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.510
 6 it 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.510
 you 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.600
 he stated that it made no sense 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.039
 in the documentary ramses 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:44.299
 next month in london wild countries like brazil with dolphins 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.889
 another the kidney that is more than 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.329
 after more than an hour 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.589
 other nominees yes gentlemen ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:03:59.559
 the 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:02.149
 they hang 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.149
 only a year earlier 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.389
 due to the credit crisis 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.779
 still do this 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.150
 Sinterklaas proceeds 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.150
 the last quarter 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.979
 he fitted 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.189
 the order book in europe 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.659
 they pulled 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:33.080
 take a look at it 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.080
 our daughters 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.270
 despite the recession 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.509
 but that seems like a formality 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.610
 we are 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.599
