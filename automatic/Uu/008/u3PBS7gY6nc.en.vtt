00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.070
 The materials we need are the 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.980
 following wool a crochet according to 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.720
 Thickness of wool scissors and needle wool 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.940
 let's start the flower making a 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.730
 eight-point magic ring we passed in 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.489
 around the finger we passed followed by 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.560
 inside the hoop and we fix it with a 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:27.830
 chain and we make eight half points 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.400
 one 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.400
 two 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.700
 4 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.850
 5 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.340
 6 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.100
 7 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.100
 and eight half points and we close 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.490
 the ring and we make a slip stitch 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.720
 with the first point 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.790
 of this round 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.700
 and we start the next round with 3 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.420
 cadenetas 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.570
 and we will make an increase in varetas 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.130
 each of the points so in the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.220
 same space where we have made the three 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.630
 chains we make a crochet and we already have 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.040
 the first increase 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:19.290
 in the next space we do 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.290
 One bar and the increase 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.500
 in the next space a bar 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.990
 and the increase and so on until we finish 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 the turn 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:46.610
 once we have done all the tricks 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.610
 we close with a slipped point 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.940
 we make a chain and cut the thread 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.520
 of these parts we are going to do 5 equal 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.220
 and in one of them we are going to leave the thread 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.830
 long enough to be able to sew once 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.540
 we have the 5 pieces we doubled them 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.540
 little by one of the sides 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:22.280
 and we started to sew together the rooms 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.280
 of the round ones with others 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.890
 once we have sewn all the parts already 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.890
 we have the flower finished 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.770
 all right 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.290
 3
