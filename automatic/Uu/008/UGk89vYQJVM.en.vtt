was<00:00:15.179> using<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.630> MK<00:00:16.109> 14<00:00:16.800> EBR<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> think<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
was using the MK 14 EBR what I think is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.720 
was using the MK 14 EBR what I think is
one<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.380> most<00:00:19.619> underrated<00:00:20.160> weapons

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
one of the most underrated weapons

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.120 
one of the most underrated weapons
within<00:00:21.000> cod<00:00:21.270> ghosts'<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.900> be<00:00:21.990> fair<00:00:22.199> most<00:00:22.949> of

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
within cod ghosts' to be fair most of

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.470 
within cod ghosts' to be fair most of
the<00:00:23.220> marksman<00:00:23.580> rifles<00:00:23.939> are<00:00:24.060> really<00:00:24.300> good<00:00:24.449> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
the marksman rifles are really good a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170 
the marksman rifles are really good a
person<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.199> like<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.220> mr<00:00:26.609> 28

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
person you don't really like the mr 28

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
person you don't really like the mr 28
but<00:00:27.480> apart<00:00:27.720> from<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.680> really<00:00:28.710> like

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
but apart from that one I really like

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130 
but apart from that one I really like
all<00:00:29.699> these<00:00:29.910> marks<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.269> rifles<00:00:30.630> definitely

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
all these marks with rifles definitely

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
all these marks with rifles definitely
give<00:00:31.380> them<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> go<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.579> haven't<00:00:32.880> already

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
give them a go if you haven't already

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.110 
give them a go if you haven't already
because<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.450> hardly<00:00:34.020> ever<00:00:34.190> see<00:00:35.190> anyone<00:00:35.489> use<00:00:35.820> any

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
because I hardly ever see anyone use any

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
because I hardly ever see anyone use any
of<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.540> Marshall<00:00:36.930> rifles<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.469> they're

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
of the Marshall rifles and they're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.740 
of the Marshall rifles and they're
actually<00:00:37.950> really<00:00:38.520> good<00:00:38.640> they're<00:00:39.360> usually<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
actually really good they're usually a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.229 
actually really good they're usually a
two<00:00:40.020> hit<00:00:40.260> kill<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.010> thing<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.640> these

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
two hit kill but the thing is that these

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.540 
two hit kill but the thing is that these
weapons<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:43.050> practically<00:00:43.620> useless<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.340> close

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
weapons are practically useless at close

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
weapons are practically useless at close
range<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.030> mean<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.300> comparison<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.899> sniper

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
range I mean in comparison to sniper

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380 
range I mean in comparison to sniper
rifles<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:47.399> think<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.940> these<00:00:48.120> weapons

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
rifles you think that these weapons

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
rifles you think that these weapons
would<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.809> better<00:00:49.260> at<00:00:49.500> close<00:00:49.710> range<00:00:50.039> than<00:00:50.250> your

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
would be better at close range than your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.670 
would be better at close range than your
average<00:00:50.430> sniper<00:00:50.820> rifle<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.500> fair<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
average sniper rifle but to be fair I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
average sniper rifle but to be fair I
don't<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.340> really<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> case<00:00:53.760> I

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
don't think that's really the case I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.790 
don't think that's really the case I
think<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> these<00:00:55.020> sniper<00:00:55.289> rifles<00:00:55.710> are

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
think that these sniper rifles are

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.139 
think that these sniper rifles are
better<00:00:55.920> up<00:00:56.070> close<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.579> because<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.030> these

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
better up close just because with these

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.779 
better up close just because with these
sniper<00:00:57.480> rifles<00:00:57.989> usually<00:00:58.890> gets<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.340> one-hit

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
sniper rifles usually gets a one-hit

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.090 
sniper rifles usually gets a one-hit
kill<00:01:00.090> one<00:01:00.239> with<00:01:00.359> these<00:01:00.539> weapons<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.649> hardly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
kill one with these weapons you hardly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
kill one with these weapons you hardly
ever<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.699> one-hit<00:01:03.059> kill<00:01:03.329> unless<00:01:03.570> you

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
ever get a one-hit kill unless you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.109 
ever get a one-hit kill unless you
manage<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> get<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.710> head<00:01:05.430> shots<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.060> close

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
manage to get a head shots at close

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
manage to get a head shots at close
range<00:01:06.799> anyway<00:01:07.799> before<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.189> jump<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
range anyway before I jump into the

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.910 
range anyway before I jump into the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
pistol just because you move pretty

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.290 
pistol just because you move pretty
slowly<00:02:34.620> with<00:02:35.400> these<00:02:35.550> weapons<00:02:35.760> although<00:02:36.120> with

slowly with these weapons although with

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
the marshal rivals is not mistaken just

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.460 
the marshal rivals is not mistaken just
like<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> assault<00:02:39.330> rifles<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.050> move<00:02:40.260> at

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
like with the assault rifles you move at

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.280 
like with the assault rifles you move at
around<00:02:40.800> some<00:02:41.190> 90<00:02:41.520> percent<00:02:42.000> of<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:43.020> base

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
around some 90 percent of the base

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.040 
around some 90 percent of the base
speeds<00:02:43.800> but<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:45.180> again<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.569> I<00:02:45.600> said<00:02:45.750> the

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
speeds but then again like I said the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.600 
speeds but then again like I said the
starts<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.680> Marshall<00:02:47.040> drivers<00:02:47.280> aren't<00:02:47.489> too

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
starts the Marshall drivers aren't too

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.600 
starts the Marshall drivers aren't too

to<00:03:32.640> long<00:03:33.030> range<00:03:33.299> just<00:03:33.630> give<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.049> one<00:03:34.170> a<00:03:34.200> go

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
to long range just give that one a go

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.380 
to long range just give that one a go
but<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.310> all<00:03:35.430> fairness<00:03:35.700> like<00:03:35.970> I<00:03:36.000> said<00:03:36.239> at<00:03:36.329> the

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
but in all fairness like I said at the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.880 
but in all fairness like I said at the
start<00:03:36.600> of<00:03:36.720> this<00:03:36.810> video<00:03:36.959> all<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.650> marks

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
start of this video all of the marks

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.740 
start of this video all of the marks
were<00:03:37.980> rifles<00:03:38.280> are<00:03:38.340> really<00:03:38.549> good<00:03:38.670> I<00:03:39.000> mean<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.720> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
were rifles are really good I mean and I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.960 
were rifles are really good I mean and I
don't<00:03:39.780> really<00:03:40.140> like<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.560> mr<00:03:40.860> 28<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.670> because

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
don't really like the mr 28 just because

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.390 
don't really like the mr 28 just because
the<00:03:42.209> recoil<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:42.959> gun<00:03:43.320> seems<00:03:44.100> to<00:03:44.250> be

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
the recoil of that gun seems to be

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.310 
the recoil of that gun seems to be
extremely<00:03:44.670> randomized<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.810> sometimes

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
extremely randomized like sometimes

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.830 
extremely randomized like sometimes
it'll<00:03:46.980> kick<00:03:47.250> upwards<00:03:47.489> sometimes<00:03:48.329> I'll<00:03:48.510> strafe

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
it'll kick upwards sometimes I'll strafe

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.780 
it'll kick upwards sometimes I'll strafe
to<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.049> left<00:03:49.260> sometimes<00:03:49.890> that<00:03:50.220> writes<00:03:50.489> and

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
to the left sometimes that writes and

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.120 
to the left sometimes that writes and
sometimes<00:03:51.780> I'll<00:03:51.989> be<00:03:52.079> pinpoint<00:03:52.650> accurate<00:03:53.100> I

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
sometimes I'll be pinpoint accurate I

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.460 
sometimes I'll be pinpoint accurate I
mean<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.430> recallnet<00:03:53.850> thing<00:03:54.269> it's<00:03:55.049> just<00:03:55.260> far

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
mean the recallnet thing it's just far

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.410 
mean the recallnet thing it's just far
too<00:03:55.500> randomized<00:03:56.250> for<00:03:56.489> me<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.670> like<00:03:56.880> hits<00:03:57.150> and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
too randomized for me to like hits and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.150 
too randomized for me to like hits and
also<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> little<00:03:58.350> something<00:03:58.620> to<00:03:58.739> notes<00:03:58.920> and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
also a little something to notes and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.920 
also a little something to notes and
that<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.340> actually<00:03:59.489> why<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> did<00:04:00.150> not<00:04:00.180> sports<00:04:00.690> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that is actually why I did not sports a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.590 
that is actually why I did not sports a
thermal<00:04:01.380> sights<00:04:01.650> on<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.640> flaw<00:04:02.880> setup<00:04:03.360> and

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
thermal sights on this flaw setup and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.180 
thermal sights on this flaw setup and
that<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.380> if<00:04:04.500> you<00:04:04.530> use<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.980> regular

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
that is that if you use the regular

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.960 
that is that if you use the regular
scope<00:04:05.760> your<00:04:06.480> gun<00:04:06.750> has<00:04:07.079> less<00:04:07.530> recoil<00:04:07.970> that's

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
scope your gun has less recoil that's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.190 
scope your gun has less recoil that's
just<00:04:09.299> a<00:04:09.450> little<00:04:09.600> something<00:04:09.989> that<00:04:10.019> they

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
just a little something that they

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.920 
just a little something that they
implemented<00:04:10.650> into<00:04:11.310> Cove<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:11.820> ghost<00:04:12.000> if<00:04:12.690> you

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
implemented into Cove the ghost if you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.690 
implemented into Cove the ghost if you
use<00:04:13.200> any<00:04:13.410> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> Marshall<00:04:14.070> rifles<00:04:14.489> with

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
use any of the Marshall rifles with

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.640 
use any of the Marshall rifles with
their<00:04:14.910> regular<00:04:15.090> scope<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.320> will<00:04:16.470> have

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
their regular scope then you will have

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.949 
their regular scope then you will have
if<00:04:16.829> I'm<00:04:16.919> not<00:04:17.010> mistaken<00:04:17.310> 10%<00:04:17.940> live<00:04:18.120> recoil<00:04:18.750> as

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
if I'm not mistaken 10% live recoil as

if I'm not mistaken 10% live recoil as
we<00:04:19.650> would<00:04:19.829> let's<00:04:20.039> say<00:04:20.160> use<00:04:20.340> something<00:04:20.850> like

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
we would let's say use something like

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.960 
we would let's say use something like
the<00:04:21.209> red<00:04:21.419> dot<00:04:21.660> sights<00:04:21.989> or<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:23.010> ACOG<00:04:23.310> sides<00:04:23.640> or

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
the red dot sights or the ACOG sides or

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.480 
the red dot sights or the ACOG sides or
the<00:04:24.090> thermal<00:04:24.360> sights<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.560> still<00:04:26.160> prefer

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
the thermal sights but I still prefer

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.680 
the thermal sights but I still prefer
the<00:04:26.789> thermal<00:04:27.360> sight

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
the thermal sight

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
the Marshall rifles and then another

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.210 
the Marshall rifles and then another
thing<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.420> keep<00:04:33.570> in<00:04:33.690> mind<00:04:33.930> whenever<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.980> use

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220

current<00:04:36.930> ghosts<00:04:37.230> your<00:04:38.040> accuracy<00:04:38.640> is<00:04:38.880> key<00:04:39.270> if

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
current ghosts your accuracy is key if

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.960 
current ghosts your accuracy is key if
you<00:04:40.080> are<00:04:40.290> a<00:04:40.320> very<00:04:40.740> inaccurate<00:04:41.160> player<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:41.820> you

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
you are a very inaccurate player if you

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.360 
you are a very inaccurate player if you

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
prefer to the spray-and-pray then this

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.130 
prefer to the spray-and-pray then this
weapon<00:04:44.820> class<00:04:45.000> is<00:04:45.240> probably<00:04:45.570> not<00:04:45.840> one<00:04:46.110> that

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
weapon class is probably not one that

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.930 
weapon class is probably not one that
you<00:04:46.470> should<00:04:46.500> try<00:04:46.980> out<00:04:47.190> it's<00:04:47.550> also<00:04:47.670> probably

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
you should try out it's also probably

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.780 
you should try out it's also probably
not<00:04:48.150> one<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.420> you<00:04:49.200> will<00:04:49.350> do<00:04:49.500> well<00:04:49.770> with<00:04:50.040> but

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
not one that you will do well with but

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.610 
not one that you will do well with but
if<00:04:50.970> you<00:04:51.090> do<00:04:51.270> decide<00:04:51.480> to<00:04:51.720> use<00:04:51.990> any<00:04:52.350> of<00:04:52.500> the

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
if you do decide to use any of the

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.380 
if you do decide to use any of the
microphone<00:04:53.010> rifles<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.670> would<00:04:54.180> always

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.390 
microphone rifles I would always

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.630 
microphone rifles I would always
recommend<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.410> use<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.800> focus<00:04:56.100> perk

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
recommend you to use the focus perk

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.730 
recommend you to use the focus perk
focus<00:04:57.600> what<00:04:57.810> as<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:57.990> don't<00:04:58.260> know<00:04:58.500> is

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
focus what as you don't know is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.820 
focus what as you don't know is
essentially<00:04:59.400> toughness<00:04:59.910> from<00:05:00.150> blackops2

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
essentially toughness from blackops2

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.110 
essentially toughness from blackops2
focus<00:05:01.830> make<00:05:02.040> sure<00:05:02.310> that<00:05:02.520> your<00:05:02.670> character

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
focus make sure that your character

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.390 
focus make sure that your character
flinch<00:05:03.420> is<00:05:03.600> less<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.500> if<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:04.710> get<00:05:04.890> shots<00:05:05.190> and

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
flinch is less and if you get shots and

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.030 
flinch is less and if you get shots and
like<00:05:05.610> I<00:05:05.640> said<00:05:05.970> accuracy<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:06.720> key<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.680> you<00:05:07.740> want

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
like I said accuracy is key so you want

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.830 
like I said accuracy is key so you want
to<00:05:08.100> make<00:05:08.250> sure<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:08.850> stay<00:05:09.120> on<00:05:09.150> target<00:05:09.480> at

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
to make sure that you stay on target at

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.470 
to make sure that you stay on target at
all<00:05:09.990> times<00:05:10.320> and<00:05:10.620> focus<00:05:11.610> will<00:05:11.790> definitely<00:05:12.240> help

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
all times and focus will definitely help

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.420 
all times and focus will definitely help
you<00:05:12.630> out<00:05:12.660> with<00:05:12.870> that<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.380> apart<00:05:14.160> from<00:05:14.280> that

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
you out with that and apart from that

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.550 
you out with that and apart from that
it's<00:05:14.760> really<00:05:15.180> up<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.510> you<00:05:15.690> I<00:05:15.720> mean<00:05:15.930> focus<00:05:16.380> is

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
it's really up to you I mean focus is

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.380 
it's really up to you I mean focus is
the<00:05:16.710> only<00:05:16.950> perk<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.370> I<00:05:17.400> think<00:05:17.790> is<00:05:18.030> quote

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
the only perk that I think is quote

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.870 
the only perk that I think is quote
unquote<00:05:19.070> essential<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.370> I'm<00:05:20.550> also<00:05:20.700> using

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
unquote essential that I'm also using

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.090 
unquote essential that I'm also using
quick-draw<00:05:21.540> just<00:05:22.260> so<00:05:22.380> that<00:05:22.530> I<00:05:22.560> can<00:05:22.680> zoom<00:05:22.890> in<00:05:23.040> a

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
quick-draw just so that I can zoom in a

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.410 
quick-draw just so that I can zoom in a
little<00:05:23.190> bit<00:05:23.370> faster<00:05:23.790> and<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.910> quick<00:05:24.150> draws<00:05:24.390> a

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
little bit faster and a quick draws a

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.050 
little bit faster and a quick draws a
perk<00:05:24.780> that<00:05:25.470> I<00:05:25.590> think<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.100> also<00:05:26.310> very<00:05:26.550> very

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
perk that I think is also very very

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.600 
perk that I think is also very very
helpful<00:05:27.300> but<00:05:28.170> if<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.470> just<00:05:28.650> stick<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.010> long

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
helpful but if you just stick to long

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.400 
helpful but if you just stick to long
range<00:05:29.850> engagements<00:05:29.970> then<00:05:30.690> quick-draw<00:05:31.110> isn't

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
range engagements then quick-draw isn't

range engagements then quick-draw isn't
something<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:32.040> you<00:05:32.580> will<00:05:32.700> essentially<00:05:33.150> need

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
something that you will essentially need

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
even with fully loaded you don't start

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.430 
even with fully loaded you don't start
off<00:05:48.000> with<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.240> whole<00:05:48.540> lot<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.870> ammunition
