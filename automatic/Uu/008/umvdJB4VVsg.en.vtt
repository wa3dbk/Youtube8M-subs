00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.480
 this is a new tutorial on how 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.570
 install from the king minimum to our 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.140
 Minecraft 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.290
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.550
 go to someone who will leave you in the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.360
 description 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360
 the system 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.340
 let's make it smaller come back 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.550
 ok let's copy 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 we close 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.399
 and let's start and access 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 as always it will take us to the page of 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.100
 afl and there we will wait 5 seconds 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.070
 once the five seconds have passed 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.070
 we have click on the yellow button that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.000
 is in the upper lower corner 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 right 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.640
 ok wait for us to redirect the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.200
 mega page I choose this server 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.820
 because this is the fastest up 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.930

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:36.300
