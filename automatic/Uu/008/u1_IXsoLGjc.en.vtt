00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the pneumatic press device 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.180
 allows easier gluing 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.309
 of wooden elements and was as he 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.990
 continue to brave element table designed 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.269
 the advantage of a demanded wood 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.340
 elementes is that the conventional one 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.410
 beam structure thanks to the adhesive 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.699
 Connection now as a surface structure 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.710
 can be viewed 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 surface structures can at the same 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.810
 element height over up to 50 more 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.310
 span and dispose of 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.859
 also improved 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.020
 Vibration stiff alternatively can at 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 same span the element height um 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.340
 which can be reduced to a third 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.340
 allows a greater room height 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.500
 for the production of a hole box 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.890
 elements will be covered with adhesive 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.940
 order a first wood-based panels 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.460
 efficient and accurate 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
 hypothecate 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.909
 next he will be on the element 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 table prefabricated wooden frame 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:06.100
 put on and with 12 screws short 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.750
 fixed after any manufacturing 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 work like isolate or 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 the wooden ramp will rewire then glues 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.190
 and with another layer 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.569
 wood based panels connected 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.530
 last but not least then the price frame 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.750
 placed 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.300
 with the intervening press 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.899
 Wood pressure ideally along the webs 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.899
 to distribute 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.490
 The press frames will be on hand and pulled 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.399
 come at full speed on the high 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.840
 box element fixed and in series 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.840
 compressed air connected 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.530
 the air pressure is via a valve 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.120
 regulated and monitored from it 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.950
 resulting pressing force can 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.710
 following rule will be calculated 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.140
 Pressing force f is equal to the pressure in war 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.900
 times the surface of the respective press 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.320
 afp at a bar is 13 kilos 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.720
 Newton at 2 was at 26 kilo Newton 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.830
 At a maximum of 3 bar this is almost four 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.830
 tons of programs 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.620
 the day of rest was applying adhesive 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.070
 designed and made possible on efficiency 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.450
 an ideal posture and one 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.280
 Optimized stop flight thanks to the impeller 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.520
 Can the adhesive be in a straight line 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.860
 to be applied is the rise 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.720
 impeller guided on both sides and can for 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.280
 different bridge widths easy 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.480
 be replaced with the adhesive 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.790
 not until the next use 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.250
 dries out and thus an effortless 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.860
 The work will be possible 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.510
 impeller cleaned briefly and the whole 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.510
 head stored in special liquid 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.609
 there squeeze in one place as before 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.849
 two working sessions is possible means 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.709
 that was a 50 percent time saving 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.629
 in contrast to the schraub squeeze no 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.959
 screws are used rather remaining 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.010
 additional material costs 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.079
 In addition, this is a screw 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.430
 holes exist in the surface 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.430
 quality 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.120
 a supervised press finally 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.410
 guarantees you the quality you 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.410
 for your products
