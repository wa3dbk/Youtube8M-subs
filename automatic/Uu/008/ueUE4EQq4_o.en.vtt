computer can take that but that's pretty
much<00:01:54.659> how<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.930> do<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.740> see<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:55.979> well

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
much how you do it you can see as well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.010 
much how you do it you can see as well
here<00:01:56.340> history<00:01:56.790> size<00:01:57.000> that's<00:01:57.509> also<00:01:57.899> quite

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
here history size that's also quite

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.230 
here history size that's also quite
handy<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.159> said<00:01:59.310> 220<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
handy you know he said 220 because I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.530 
handy you know he said 220 because I
think<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:01.020> defaults<00:02:01.469> about<00:02:01.710> 10<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.340> 15<00:02:02.509> so<00:02:03.509> I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
think the defaults about 10 or 15 so I

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.720 
think the defaults about 10 or 15 so I
just<00:02:03.899> put<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.290> 20

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
just put up to 20

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.210 
just put up to 20
