setups<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.580> can<00:02:20.730> use<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.630> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
setups that you can use now I have to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.090 
setups that you can use now I have to
test<00:02:21.990> out<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> couple<00:02:22.410> things<00:02:22.650> because<00:02:22.980> I

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
test out a couple things because I

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.290 
test out a couple things because I
really<00:02:23.490> don't<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.970> um<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:26.160> instance<00:02:26.300> like

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
really don't know um for instance like

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.680 
really don't know um for instance like
sleight<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.020> hand<00:02:29.150> okay<00:02:31.310> how<00:02:32.310> fast<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.180> slight

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
sleight of hand okay how fast is slight

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.230 
sleight of hand okay how fast is slight
a<00:02:33.720> hand<00:02:34.940> comparative<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.410> smgs<00:02:37.520> how<00:02:38.520> fast<00:02:38.940> is

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
a hand comparative to smgs how fast is

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.910 
a hand comparative to smgs how fast is
sleight<00:02:39.510> of<00:02:39.540> hand<00:02:39.780> see<00:02:40.230> some<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.500> these<00:02:40.650> things

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
sleight of hand see some of these things

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.360 
sleight of hand see some of these things
are<00:02:41.690> redundant<00:02:42.690> in<00:02:42.840> attachments<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:43.890> in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
are redundant in attachments and in

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.020 
are redundant in attachments and in
weapons<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:46.400> these<00:02:47.400> are<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.670> things<00:02:47.820> I'm

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
weapons so these are the things I'm

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.180 
weapons so these are the things I'm
going<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.210> go<00:02:48.360> over<00:02:48.560> you<00:02:49.560> know<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.980> are<00:02:50.070> going

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
going to go over you know that are going

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.210 
going to go over you know that are going
to<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.340> different<00:02:50.520> between<00:02:50.820> playing<00:02:51.510> online

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220
