you<00:01:09.720> will<00:01:09.869> get<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.200> link<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> wrong<00:01:11.280> file

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
you will get a link for the wrong file

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.789 
you will get a link for the wrong file
go<00:01:12.150> ahead<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> download<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.619> not

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
go ahead and download it and you do not

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.219 
go ahead and download it and you do not
require<00:01:14.159> any<00:01:14.430> G<00:01:14.790> apps<00:01:15.000> for<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.720> particular

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
require any G apps for this particular

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.859 
require any G apps for this particular
installation<00:01:16.500> because<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.580> developer<00:01:18.090> has

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
installation because the developer has

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.719 
installation because the developer has
put<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> G<00:01:19.470> apps<00:01:19.619> package<00:01:20.009> inside<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.580> ROM

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
put the G apps package inside the ROM

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.640 
put the G apps package inside the ROM
file<00:01:21.000> only<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.540> basically<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> comes<00:01:22.320> with<00:01:22.500> G

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
file only so basically it comes with G

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.440 
file only so basically it comes with G
apps<00:01:22.799> built<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.640> require<00:01:24.119> only<00:01:24.330> one

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
apps built in so you require only one

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.899 
apps built in so you require only one
file<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> wrong<00:01:25.590> file<00:01:25.909> download

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.460 
file and that is the wrong file download
it<00:01:27.060> place<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> root<00:01:27.990> directory<00:01:28.140> of

just check your recovery version like

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.319 
just check your recovery version like

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
this is the correct way it should take

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.580

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
like we did the clean way basically you

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.719 
like we did the clean way basically you
should<00:04:34.110> do<00:04:34.320> a<00:04:34.349> clean<00:04:34.710> wipe<00:04:34.889> that<00:04:35.160> way<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.430> do

should do a clean wipe that way you do

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.190 
should do a clean wipe that way you do
not<00:04:35.849> get<00:04:36.060> any<00:04:36.240> additional<00:04:36.479> bugs<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.110> will

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
hamper your experience and you get the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.770 
hamper your experience and you get the
what<00:04:40.830> can<00:04:40.949> I<00:04:41.070> say<00:04:41.190> optimum<00:04:41.699> experience<00:04:42.210> as<00:04:42.330> the

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
what can I say optimum experience as the

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.600 
what can I say optimum experience as the
developer<00:04:43.169> intended<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.250> take<00:04:47.250> another

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
developer intended so it take another

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:56.280 
developer intended so it take another
minute<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:48.210> guess

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.040 

and<00:04:56.380> one<00:04:57.100> more<00:04:57.280> thing<00:04:57.430> guys<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:58.180> rom<00:04:58.510> like<00:04:58.870> I

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
and one more thing guys this rom like I

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.660 
and one more thing guys this rom like I
told<00:04:59.200> in<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.410> beginning<00:04:59.620> comes<00:05:00.160> with<00:05:00.430> the

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
told in the beginning comes with the

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.660 
told in the beginning comes with the
default<00:05:01.150> ancillary<00:05:01.720> density<00:05:02.260> of<00:05:02.440> what<00:05:03.220> I<00:05:03.370> mean

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
default ancillary density of what I mean

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.020 
default ancillary density of what I mean
two-one-one<00:05:04.420> so<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.530> might<00:05:05.890> not<00:05:06.130> find<00:05:06.460> some

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
two-one-one so you might not find some

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.690 
two-one-one so you might not find some
apps<00:05:07.300> in<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.840> Play<00:05:07.960> Store<00:05:08.050> if<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:09.400> is<00:05:09.580> the
