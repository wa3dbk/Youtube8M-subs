building this applies to pretty much any

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939

map<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.570> what<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.379> want<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> do<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:16.800> want

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
map so what you want to do is you want

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.460 
map so what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:17.480> strap<00:00:18.480> them<00:00:18.630> up<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:18.779> want<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.170> desktop

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
so it's just an all folder like that

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.140 
so it's just an all folder like that
they<00:00:22.769> just<00:00:22.920> when<00:00:23.100> they<00:00:23.160> go<00:00:23.279> into<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.640> go<00:00:23.850> map

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
they just when they go into it go map

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
they just when they go into it go map
and<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.109> load<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> map<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.050> way

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
and then load the map this is the way

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.839 
and then load the map this is the way
that<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.859> it<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> didn't<00:00:29.550> know<00:00:29.640> where

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
that you do it if you didn't know where

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
that you do it if you didn't know where
you<00:00:29.939> were<00:00:30.029> looking<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.510> texture<00:00:30.840> files

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
you were looking for the texture files

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
you were looking for the texture files
because<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:32.399> I<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:33.120> did<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.780> didn't

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
because when I first did this I didn't

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.010 
because when I first did this I didn't
know<00:00:34.940> because<00:00:35.940> they<00:00:36.059> sometimes<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.750> changed

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
know because they sometimes he changed

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.139 
know because they sometimes he changed
the<00:00:37.079> name<00:00:37.200> so<00:00:37.440> something<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:38.760> won't<00:00:38.879> always

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the name so something you won't always

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.310 
the name so something you won't always
think<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> want<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.899> put<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.200> in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
think and you want they put them in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.959 
think and you want they put them in
different<00:00:40.590> folders<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.550> where<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> wouldn't

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
different folders to where you wouldn't

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
different folders to where you wouldn't
always<00:00:42.090> think<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.320> can<00:00:43.440> see<00:00:43.620> I've

so now you want to do is you want to
right-click<00:01:44.069> on<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:45.030> edit<00:01:45.450> with

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
right-click on it and then edit with

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.169 
right-click on it and then edit with
notepad<00:01:45.630> plus<00:01:46.049> plus<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.819> tell<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.169 --> 00:01:48.179 
notepad plus plus and that will tell you

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:50.600 
notepad plus plus and that will tell you
where<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.539> texture<00:01:48.840> locations<00:01:49.319> are<00:01:49.679> so<00:01:50.369> for

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
where the texture locations are so for

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.190 
where the texture locations are so for
the<00:01:50.670> roof<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.179> called<00:01:51.420> parlor<00:01:51.810> roof<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
the roof it's called parlor roof and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.859 
the roof it's called parlor roof and
it's<00:01:52.319> in<00:01:52.409> SH<00:01:52.799> models<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:54.599> know<00:01:54.750> where

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
it's in SH models so now we know where

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.960 
it's in SH models so now we know where
that<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.130> all<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.250> need<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> do<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.789> need<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
that is all we need to do is you need to

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.839 
that is all we need to do is you need to
find<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.390> texture<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.750> want<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.789> case

00:01:59.839 --> 00:01:59.849 
find the texture we want so in my case

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.580 
find the texture we want so in my case
I've<00:02:00.270> got<00:02:00.450> them<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.840> my<00:02:00.899> documents<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
I've got them in my documents on the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
I've got them in my documents on the
maps<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.340> I'm<00:02:02.459> running<00:02:02.610> map<00:02:02.880> objects<00:02:03.360> farm

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
maps and I'm running map objects farm

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.039 
maps and I'm running map objects farm
sheds<00:02:04.319> and<00:02:04.640> alternative<00:02:05.640> textures<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.869> what

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
sheds and alternative textures so what

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749 
sheds and alternative textures so what
seven<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.500> choose<00:02:07.709> from<00:02:07.950> three<00:02:08.579> is<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
seven to choose from three is the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
seven to choose from three is the
asbestos<00:02:09.299> so<00:02:09.599> let's<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.140> click<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.410> around

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
asbestos so let's just click on around

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.190 
asbestos so let's just click on around
the<00:02:10.679> one<00:02:12.230> blue

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.110 

we<00:02:16.680> got<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:16.980> color<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.400> suppose<00:02:17.670> that's<00:02:17.790> okay

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
we got that color I suppose that's okay

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.720 
we got that color I suppose that's okay
so<00:02:19.080> what<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.319> wanna<00:02:19.440> do<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.620> right<00:02:19.830> click<00:02:19.860> copy

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so what you wanna do is right click copy

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.760 
so what you wanna do is right click copy
you<00:02:21.360> don't<00:02:21.540> need<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.750> anymore

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.370 

so<00:02:25.370> then<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.580> go<00:02:25.700> into<00:02:26.030> spring<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:26.780> map

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
so then you go into spring the map

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.460 
so then you go into spring the map
folder<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:29.150> just<00:02:29.330> follow<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.780> instructions

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
folder and just follow the instructions

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.690 
folder and just follow the instructions
follow<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> directions<00:02:31.280> there<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.850> SH<00:02:32.660> models

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
follow the directions there so SH models

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670 
follow the directions there so SH models
models<00:02:34.960> textures<00:02:35.960> and<00:02:36.350> Paula<00:02:37.160> roof<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.780> what<00:02:39.620> I

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
models textures and Paula roof so what I

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.309 
models textures and Paula roof so what I
want<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:41.200> delete<00:02:42.200> Paula<00:02:42.650> roof

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.030 

there<00:02:45.920> is<00:02:46.069> delete<00:02:47.319> so<00:02:48.319> just<00:02:48.530> paste<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.920> new

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
there is delete so just paste the new

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.649 
there is delete so just paste the new
one<00:02:49.189> it<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.700> will<00:02:49.849> come<00:02:50.060> off<00:02:50.180> as<00:02:50.269> function<00:02:50.629> of

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
one it it will come off as function of

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.599 
one it it will come off as function of
root<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.870> seven<00:02:51.139> now<00:02:51.980> you<00:02:52.040> want<00:02:52.249> to<00:02:52.310> rename<00:02:52.549> it

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
root of seven now you want to rename it

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:59.250 
root of seven now you want to rename it
to<00:02:53.599> whatever<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:54.079> says<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:54.469> so<00:02:54.620> parlor<00:02:56.920> roof

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
to whatever it says there so parlor roof

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.899 
to whatever it says there so parlor roof
that's<00:03:00.260> it

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:00.909 
that's it

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:02.920 
that's it
you<00:03:01.909> want<00:03:02.030> to<00:03:02.090> come<00:03:02.209> out<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.420> everything<00:03:02.780> just

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
you want to come out of everything just

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.819 
you want to come out of everything just
so<00:03:03.109> it<00:03:03.170> refreshes<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:05.180> all<00:03:05.780> my<00:03:05.959> documents<00:03:06.469> just

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
so it refreshes so all my documents just

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.879 
so it refreshes so all my documents just
close<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.579> let<00:03:08.510> them<00:03:08.629> go<00:03:08.780> away<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.739> then

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
close them let them go away and then

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.190 
close them let them go away and then
load<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.189> the<00:03:10.250> file<00:03:10.459> again<00:03:10.700> map<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.930> then<00:03:12.049> load

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
load up the file again map and then load

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.589 
load up the file again map and then load
up<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:12.469> time<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.579> again<00:03:13.849> and<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.299> should<00:03:14.450> be

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
up the time up again and it should be

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:20.350 
up the time up again and it should be
changed

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.330 

they<00:03:20.870> wait<00:03:21.050> for<00:03:21.080> it<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.320> stop<00:03:21.500> crashing<00:03:21.890> and

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
they wait for it to stop crashing and

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.680 
they wait for it to stop crashing and
there<00:03:23.300> we<00:03:23.360> go<00:03:25.000> as<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.120> can<00:03:26.270> see<00:03:26.390> there's<00:03:26.570> not<00:03:26.630> a

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
there we go as you can see there's not a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.350 
there we go as you can see there's not a
massive<00:03:27.050> difference<00:03:27.170> but<00:03:27.650> you<00:03:27.710> can<00:03:27.980> see<00:03:28.360> it's

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
massive difference but you can see it's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.110 
massive difference but you can see it's
slightly<00:03:29.510> different<00:03:30.050> I<00:03:30.790> probably<00:03:31.790> wasn't<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
slightly different I probably wasn't the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.100 
slightly different I probably wasn't the
best<00:03:32.180> color<00:03:32.510> to<00:03:32.660> give<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.840> guys<00:03:32.990> the

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
best color to give you guys the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.950 
best color to give you guys the
demonstration<00:03:33.710> with<00:03:33.890> but<00:03:34.540> they<00:03:35.540> have<00:03:35.690> changed

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
demonstration with but they have changed

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.460 
demonstration with but they have changed
there<00:03:36.650> are<00:03:36.770> slightly<00:03:37.190> more<00:03:37.430> green<00:03:38.470> blue

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
there are slightly more green blue

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.730 
there are slightly more green blue
asbestos<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.180> that's<00:03:42.110> actually<00:03:42.290> not<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.590> bad

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
asbestos so that's actually not a bad

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110 
asbestos so that's actually not a bad
color<00:03:42.950> how<00:03:43.130> long<00:03:43.280> keep<00:03:43.460> that<00:03:43.960> but<00:03:44.960> yeah<00:03:46.120> yeah

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
color how long keep that but yeah yeah

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.730 
color how long keep that but yeah yeah
that's<00:03:47.360> haider<00:03:47.570> you<00:03:48.200> can<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.650> have

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
that's haider you can you don't have

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:49.840 
that's haider you can you don't have
enough<00:03:48.890> to<00:03:49.010> use<00:03:49.130> those<00:03:49.340> attached<00:03:49.580> if<00:03:49.790> you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
enough to use those attached if you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.220 
enough to use those attached if you
found<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.120> texture<00:03:50.480> on<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> internet<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.020> like

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
found a texture on the internet you like

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.350
