00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
bow it hits the strings when I turn the

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.200 
bow it hits the strings when I turn the
crank<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.920> have<00:00:52.920> two<00:00:53.160> chanter<00:00:53.640> strings<00:00:53.940> all

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
crank I have two chanter strings all

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.210 
crank I have two chanter strings all
these<00:00:54.720> like<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.200> keys<00:00:55.440> all<00:00:55.800> these<00:00:55.980> little

these like little keys all these little

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.250 
these like little keys all these little
hammers<00:00:56.580> act<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.330> fingers<00:00:57.780> against<00:00:58.080> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
hammers act like fingers against the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.410 
hammers act like fingers against the
strings<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.760> all<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:00.090> notes

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
strings to get all the different notes

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.600 
strings to get all the different notes
it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> fully<00:01:01.260> chromatic<00:01:02.070> scale<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> means

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
it's a fully chromatic scale that means

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.609 
it's a fully chromatic scale that means
I<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.880> every<00:01:03.480> note<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.990> the<00:01:04.079> scale<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.559> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
I have every note in the scale like a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.279 
I have every note in the scale like a
piano<00:01:05.240> the<00:01:06.240> rest<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.749> strings<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.279 --> 00:01:07.289 
piano the rest of the strings are the

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:08.810 
piano the rest of the strings are the
drone<00:01:07.499> strings<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.130> those<00:01:08.280> are<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> ones<00:01:08.729> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
drone strings so those are the ones that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.899 
drone strings so those are the ones that
carry<00:01:09.149> on<00:01:09.329> this<00:01:09.979> madness<00:01:10.979> drone<00:01:11.219> and<00:01:11.369> there

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
carry on this madness drone and there

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
carry on this madness drone and there
are<00:01:12.030> two<00:01:12.299> special<00:01:12.749> little<00:01:12.960> bridges<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.499> mine

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
are two special little bridges on mine

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.160 
are two special little bridges on mine
and<00:01:14.039> they<00:01:14.280> are<00:01:14.579> called<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.240> shin<00:01:15.569> or<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.869> dog

and they jump up and down and they make

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:20.090 
and they jump up and down and they make
the<00:01:18.899> rhythm<00:01:19.229> sound<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> makes<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the rhythm sound that makes the

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:30.660 
the rhythm sound that makes the
instruments<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:20.999> unique

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
England I just I felt this lack in my

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.270

life<00:01:45.549> I<00:01:45.729> had<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.939> have<00:01:46.180> this<00:01:46.299> instrument<00:01:47.280> what

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
life I had to have this instrument what

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.520 
life I had to have this instrument what
I<00:01:48.490> really<00:01:48.850> love<00:01:49.030> about<00:01:49.060> this<00:01:49.390> festival<00:01:49.899> is<00:01:50.200> is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
I really love about this festival is is

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.010 
I really love about this festival is is
the<00:01:50.950> emphasis<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.759> traditional<00:01:52.420> music<00:01:52.780> and

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
the emphasis on traditional music and

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.529 
the emphasis on traditional music and
yet<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.649> traditional<00:01:54.189> music<00:01:54.580> doesn't<00:01:55.180> have

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
yet the traditional music doesn't have

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.980 
yet the traditional music doesn't have
to<00:01:55.720> be<00:01:55.899> all<00:01:56.670> stately<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.880> boring<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.630> I<00:01:58.750> think

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
to be all stately and boring and I think

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.450 
to be all stately and boring and I think
there's<00:01:59.140> a<00:01:59.229> lot<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.470> associations<00:01:59.740> sometimes

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
there's a lot of associations sometimes

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.160 
there's a lot of associations sometimes
for<00:02:00.640> people<00:02:00.759> that<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.570> it's<00:02:01.810> it's<00:02:02.080> not

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
