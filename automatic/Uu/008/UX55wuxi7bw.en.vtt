things in this vineyard is that we
pretty<00:01:00.359> much<00:01:00.449> dry<00:01:00.870> farm<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.399> see

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
pretty much dry farm it you can see

pretty much dry farm it you can see
these<00:01:02.730> shoots<00:01:03.030> are<00:01:03.210> still<00:01:03.420> actively<00:01:03.899> growing

little bit of active group shoot tips
that<00:01:48.570> are<00:01:48.600> very<00:01:49.320> are<00:01:49.740> starting<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.370> slow<00:01:50.640> down

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that are very are starting to slow down

that are very are starting to slow down
a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:53.610> fruit<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> sizing<00:01:54.570> pretty

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
a lot and the fruit is sizing pretty

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.370 
a lot and the fruit is sizing pretty
much<00:01:55.620> on<00:01:55.830> schedule<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.730> so<00:01:57.510> to<00:01:57.570> me<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
much on schedule here so to me this is

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.700 
much on schedule here so to me this is
not<00:01:58.620> an<00:01:58.890> overly<00:01:59.840> vigorous<00:02:00.840> vineyard<00:02:01.530> with<00:02:01.680> a

even<00:02:16.450> going<00:02:16.630> to<00:02:16.720> need<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.050> tip<00:02:17.290> these<00:02:17.440> canes<00:02:17.860> we

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
even going to need to tip these canes we

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.340 
even going to need to tip these canes we
can<00:02:18.520> get<00:02:19.030> down<00:02:19.240> these<00:02:19.450> rows<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.200> our

these shoot tips are starting to slow
down<00:02:26.620> naturally<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.020> energy<00:02:29.170> is

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
down naturally because the energy is

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.990 
down naturally because the energy is

maturity of the fruit when we come in to
