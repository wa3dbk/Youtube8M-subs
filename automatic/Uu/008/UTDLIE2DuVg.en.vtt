00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
some stuff that you know conspiracies of

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.210 
some stuff that you know conspiracies of
course<00:05:33.800> as<00:05:34.610> good<00:05:35.120> as<00:05:35.930> any<00:05:36.260> good<00:05:36.620> political

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
course as good as any good political

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.940 
course as good as any good political
thing<00:05:37.970> would<00:05:38.210> have<00:05:38.440> he<00:05:39.440> has<00:05:39.560> sent<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.830> this

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
thing would have he has sent to this

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.560 
thing would have he has sent to this
army<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.310> he<00:05:40.669> doesn't<00:05:40.820> want<00:05:41.000> to<00:05:41.060> die<00:05:41.180> and<00:05:41.540> he

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
army and he doesn't want to die and he

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:43.600 
army and he doesn't want to die and he
actually<00:05:41.750> whips<00:05:42.110> up<00:05:42.260> these<00:05:42.440> troops<00:05:42.919> and<00:05:43.160> then

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
actually whips up these troops and then

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.190 
actually whips up these troops and then
you<00:05:43.700> get<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.910> know<00:05:43.940> them<00:05:44.270> and<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:44.750> think<00:05:44.840> it's<00:05:45.140> a

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
you get to know them and I think it's a

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.580 
you get to know them and I think it's a
lot<00:05:45.470> better<00:05:46.340> than<00:05:46.520> the<00:05:47.300> second<00:05:47.990> story<00:05:48.260> because

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
lot better than the second story because

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.560 
lot better than the second story because
it<00:05:48.740> was<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:49.340> know<00:05:49.460> all<00:05:49.520> about<00:05:49.729> a<00:05:49.760> school<00:05:50.120> and

there's<00:05:50.720> some<00:05:50.870> interesting<00:05:51.350> characters<00:05:51.800> but

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
there's some interesting characters but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.180 
there's some interesting characters but
they're<00:05:52.250> kind<00:05:52.520> of<00:05:52.610> maybe<00:05:53.330> two<00:05:53.600> anime<00:05:54.050> II<00:05:54.320> but

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190 
they're kind of maybe two anime II but

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.950
