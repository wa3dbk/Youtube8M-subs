00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.560
 gambling presents 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.700
 started painting divinity original sin 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.860
 we and not only we are happy 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.619
 recognized as one of the most important games 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.630
 last year is a role-playing game in which 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.849
 almost everything is allowed 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.619
 and there are no restrictions for the sake of 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.840
 balance full freedom of action 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.870
 allows you to pass it as you please 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.850
 to you , as the developers conceived 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.130
 the same can be done both together 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.560
 cooperative arguing with each other right in 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.720
 game dialogs and now this 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.790
 the most curious project is preparing for release 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.700
 also on consoles and moreover in 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.680
 augmented and improved to 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.580
 find out all the details about divinity 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.920
 original sin 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.530
 enhanced edition we tied to the head 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.500
 studio lorian sven wreaths and asked him 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.670
 a series of questions 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.729
 hi everyone in gambling 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.950
 you sent me some questions all 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.530
 they relate to the announced addition 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.490
 publications divinity original sin 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:16.219
 Well I will try to answer the question number 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.619
 one why suddenly the console from 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.560
 sega kunis understandable game pretty baeva 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.109
 the very thing for the gamepad and the original syn 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.960
 this is the perfect game for songs about now 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.390
 she goes to playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.359
 it is interesting that larian is not the only ones 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.509
 studios who decide to do this in sn2 too 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.509
 will come out on consoles coincidence or not 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.729
 in the news on kickstarter today I 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
 said again here's the old ad 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.909
 booklet origin is still in those times 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.710
 when the game was called 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.619
 and isav and child of 2011 and that we are here 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.500
 see two sit side by side and on the couch and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.440
 play in cooperative mode that is 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.470
 such a game was supposed to start 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.119
 with controllers on the same screen with us 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.820
 then there was simply no means to 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.459
 the console version and now the tools are there 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.010
 and we decided to try the experiment 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.650
 succeeded for all one hundred version went to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.250
 production was so born augmented 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.880
 edition 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:22.450
 soon you can try it yourself 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.090
 what about the property connection and and no but so 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.430
 Coincidentally with Brian Fargo we 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.280
 met at gbc just when 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.040
 he announced that his game will come out on 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.290
 consoles and I discussed with the agents 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.980
 will distribute the original syn in 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.890
 retail 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.610
 and news about each other we learned 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.980
 at the same time we both decided that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.049
 porting a good tactical roleplay 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.630
 console games 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:54.160
 nothing is impossible question number two 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.290
 porting original syn on console 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.299
 this is just a bold experiment for you 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.510
 or something more like you think the game 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.640
 dock with consoles like i already 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.519
 said the game is great for 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.690
 consoles because initially 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.420
 conceived for them too 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.850
 we have been looking for the right approach for a long time 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.920
 when nevertheless found and found the solution 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.720
 problems that may arise for 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.540
 games of this type on consoles 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.640
 everything went smoothly picking up the game 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.799
 you will see for yourself in a couple of minutes 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.709
 until almost immediately she just 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.870
 great goes on console brave 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.209
 Experiment perhaps so projects 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.799
 started but we always counted 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.530
 bring it to the console 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.230
 we make our new games on the engine 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.920
 working not only with letters linux act 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.720
 system with but from playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.010
 and 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.610
 opportunities open up big question 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.130
 number 3 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.920
 what is the console version of the origin axis will be 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.960
 different from the computer how will 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.820
 management can be expected to add 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.130
 new control scheme on the pis 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.680
 gamepad support would be very useful 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.820
 Some players, especially on those already 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.680
 imbued with the idea of ​​a computer in the living room 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.120
 actually experiments with control we 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.700
 started with pisi 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.070
 so we already have a fully working 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.680
 controller support for pisi 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.640
 you will be able to play an augmented edition 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:29.490
 divinity original syn on gamepad 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:31.740
 works and looks just fine in 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.720
 augmented edition are you going 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.570
 solve some problems of the original game 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.680
 or the more the better just add 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.180
 new plot and content both to 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.669
 suit on console 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.000
 you have the right lever allowing 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.770
 rotate 360 ​​degrees in 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.169
 the enlarged edition we had everything 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.720
 game levels adapt to this 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:57.240
 opportunity we finalized the game world 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.480
 so that on the console everything works like 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.460
 it should be but also the recording version of it only 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.350
 wins 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.690
 thousands of changes and improvements 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.690
 I do not exaggerate, and many of them 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.990
 based on your feedback and suggestions 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.050
 how to make the game better, I really think 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.260
 that the game has become much better from here and 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.100
 term augmented improved buildings a 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.760
 still we all fully voiced every 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.110
 cue 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:32.150
 and their wife to cook the sphere abound and 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.150
 Now it will be much more interesting to play 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.060
 what else with what problems are you 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.600
 collided with the introduction of the game 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.500
 split screen 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.190
 someone aflare he already had a similar experience 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.230
 you know 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.420
 don't think anyone else is doing 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.270
 role-playing games of this kind with divided 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:54.400
 screen we seem first therefore 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.430
 it was just like the experience 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:06:00.070
 nowhere and of course not everything went right away 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.520
 smooth but we finally managed 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.590
 tasks we show you the result on e3 people 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.140
 will be able to come and play and share 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.870
 impressions with the world you will see 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.120
 that everything works surprisingly well and 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:16.480
 much more intuitive than could 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.860
 think from the release of the original sin mine 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:24.610
 almost a year how are you doing now good 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.650
 the question left me wife wife kidding 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.680
 just kidding 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.640
 things go well padded buildings 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.120
 original syn 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:37.060
 This is our third working draft 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.720
 two of which we will tell later may 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.550
 be this year do not know exactly 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.730
 they look just awesome 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.890
 but we cannot discuss them now 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.800
 we finish work on the augmented 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:53.110
 publication of all the content has already begun 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.830
 fun with cleaning bugs control 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:00.130
 quality translations and so on but in 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:03.400
 In general, Larin, everything is fine, everything is delighted 

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.210
 from new role projects and a warm welcome 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:11.310

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:11.310
 motivates us and gives us strength and 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.000
 Finally, last year you founded two 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.810
 development teams in st. petersburg 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.930
 and quebec 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.240
 how are they doing what's new team in 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:27.340

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.250
 they did a wonderful job 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:35.340
 world class along with the guys from 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.080
 genta they gloriously bother to 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:40.570
 augmented edition saw the light of it 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.850
 great team I am very happy for them 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.100
 team factory working on one of 

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:47.320
 of our secret projects therefore 

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:49.690
 I'll have to wait until I can 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.680
 tell about it just note it 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.680

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:14.850
 Well
