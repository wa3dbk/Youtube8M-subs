00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:28.070
 Syria explanation 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.599
 hello dear youtuber having you buzz and 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.410
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:38.059
 improve voice control present at 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.949
 roof by default I am called syria but 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.780
 you can choose me another name and 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.670
 if you ask yourself the question and there is a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.470
 game not completely replace the real 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.570
 syria since you can not 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.309
 actually argue with me but if 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.690
 just like me you can not manage 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.860
 install it I am a good 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.360
 alternative so hello to all and to 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 all so today when you saw 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.570
 I will show you how to improve 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.949
 the voice control so it does not replace 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.809
 totally the real if rim we can do 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.650
 A lot of things 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.369
 that is by assembling some 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:16.270
 tweets we can succeed happen to these 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:16.270
 so syie syria put it to sleep 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.720
 So here we can only thing is that 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.150
 sometimes when we say syria know hug 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.740
 a little if not globally it works well 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 we can align all kinds of gestures 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.970
 we can not have the weather 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.710
 exactly as for syria we can 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.710
 just access the weather app 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:41.240
 unlock series unlock 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.520
 so we can also get to some 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.270
 results not too bad so for example 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.270
 I can open cydia series cydia 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.010
 so here we can open things on 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 can say text as I said 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.980
 at first we can open url links 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.450
 so websites 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.450
 cyril Ilyasov 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.099
 or so go directly to the internet on 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.829
 my website so there are hours 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.569
 to see press.com so after we can 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.140
 to sign all kinds of things that to 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.670
 you choose 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.420
 so what you propose is that we are going 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.640
 get together right now 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.730
 for the settings part so at all of 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.319
 therefore be able to improve the control 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.150
 voice of your idevice 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.280
 you will have to add 3 tweak 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.379

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.799
 big boss sauce is free on my 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.540
 source 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:37.190
 so the name of the tweets will be in the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.299
 description of the video followed by the link 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.900

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.670
 free 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.290
 so you know when to do 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.760
 speak in cydia xavier to manage in 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.739
 down in source 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.060
 in the middle changed to the top right 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.840
 add top left something added 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.459
 source 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.739
 and you do added the source 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.290
 according to invites you to seek the 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.909
 tweets the three tweaks whose names I 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.269
 repeat will be in the description of the 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.859
 video 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.450
 once it's done download 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.030
 install confirmed etc 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.349
 you go to the settings we're going 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.639
 go to the tricks section, 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.459
 all the way down and you have organs this 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.650
 money in June which you are first of all 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.799
 so choose filtered civic center if the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.470
 sensitivity that you will prefer so 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.910
 be 20.8 street street normand lauzon 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.410
 or then locked loose 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.079
 so in fact it's westward it's 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.199
 when it's going to be hyper a strict by 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.609
 report to understanding the name by 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.870
 which you would have called it one is a 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:28.430
 uncomplicated the way I say it 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.400
 simply there by default it 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.139
 is called syria and if you say it must 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.819
 to say it extremely well so that he 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.049
 can understand it but will use that 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.720
 reverse you can say it a little bit of 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.739
 nonchalantly we'll say for the 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.170
 will even say with your accent and 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.280
 will include 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.020
 better than by verisk then so key 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.310
 words so that's the word to use for 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.099
 activate it you go sing the circuit 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.330
 computer in jazz funk or else the 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.010
 word you will have chosen is the one his 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.209
 custom you mark the word you 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.010
 want and then he will activate 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.050
 I put syria you do what 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.670
 you want the default theme so 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.470
 it's about languages ​​I think 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.690
 american british so do like you 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.150
 want me i leave by default and audio 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.530
 So I suggest you put on has 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.540
 to activate it you have to scream you tick 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.380
 listening service right here so I 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.250
 do not do it right away because 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.169
 as I told you it's sure it's the 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.250
 game can make a mistake sakorzy 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.870
 something that looks like syria is going 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.880
 activate it will hide the tutorial 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.800
 so we will continue in the settings 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.270
 waiting for voice active wrong so 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.100
 here we click on 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.950
 first we go to the activated so in 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.450
 clicking by ticking and mail one can 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.860
 see then there are several types of 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.470
 Unfilled orders of commands 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.210
 I have already created so the end goodbye 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.300
 I hope it's a little surprise 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.620
 you will see in haste as a gift 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.310
 if we click on this to add a 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.500
 new order 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.520
 we can choose how to activate it 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.720
 art what am I going to say for 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.300
 activate the command let's admit I say 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.120
 tutoz is then in action we are hot 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.890
 between spitex open url url forgiveness so 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.289
 open an internet link or 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.850
 activator so it's to choose this 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.740
 we want active and I have 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.370
 selected 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 choose this big text and so in the end 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.210
 so when I tell you soon what is it 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.060
 who will say bah I do not know that is to say 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:18.900
 who says new tutorial so here I have 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:21.840
 created a new tutor then excited 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.160
 wayne conflict which these farms and the 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.110
 voice control as soon as it's finished 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.060
 if you wish if you want it is 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.710
 like that it will remain open to clicks 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.000
 on save rank to the right to save 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.949
 the command which can be a tutorial 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.479
 appeared right here if the click 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.800
 above to remove the command does not 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.900
 Just click on should be commands 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.909
 and click again especially the 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.889
 commands to confirm the action so 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.169
 second stuff for an activator so he 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:43.560
 must select activator apps plus 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.389
 me 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.759
 then we go against figure and we 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.990
 will choose what we want to do so 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.340
 wrongly active those who do not know it's 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.340
 a trick that allows us to assign the 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.610
 gestures to activate that anything 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.990
 so either an application or still 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.909
 send a sms to stuff like 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.449
 that so I choose you what you 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:02.610
 want to do 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:04.470
 you choose what you have to say 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.550
 to activate it and click on save 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.639
 in the top right so it's not more 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.169
 complicated than that for the settings you 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.219
 see it's fast it's simple and 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.539
 effective so just for information in 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.060
 regarding the sentences you 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.729
 want to say that your device ti he 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.810
 must finally he must pay he can say 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.400
 very long sentences like you 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.210
 noticed it at the beginning of my video 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.909
 like makes them talk 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.289
 and so here you can write 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:29.880
 really we can do talk we can 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.650
 really do things simply 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.000
 to write everything shave then against it 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.889
 do not do the commas do not do the 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.240
 points so he 'll say it all in 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.729
 so this is the only one all the information 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.680
 that I have to add you as for me and 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.870
 Well, I'll see you soon and 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.880

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.380
 m and it's a month tell it what you want 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:48.330
 beat you it a little too well does this 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.210
 software reason for more so that your 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.919
 tutorial tears his race 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.540
 I hope anyway if he does not 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.160
 I do not turn off and I do not die 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.600
 him never again on time crosses 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.600
 fingers a good guy but no it 's not going
