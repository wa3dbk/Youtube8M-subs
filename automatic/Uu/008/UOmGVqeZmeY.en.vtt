00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040
 kansas is full of good people 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.970
 but I do not want to be good 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.970
 I want to be the biggest 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.640
 I say 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.079
 is the trust 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.840
 I'm glad that they are 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.130
 Good witch is her essence 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.250
 they do not know much about witches or 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:02.040
 the emerald city you are here 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.190
 and the prophecy is fulfilled that is 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.790
 my sister I'm here to help them 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.620

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.690
 the treasure of place he belonged first 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.890
 you just have to defeat the evil witch 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.780
 The evil cities have been destroyed 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.509
 Children were wise to show the big one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.530
 I know you know 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.530
 long with it 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.140
 This cream just said we die 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.650
 only their magical powers can us 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.650
 save everyone 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:46.490
 please tell me that we can fight 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.110

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.300
 his 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.580
 I am under circumstances no 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:59.170
 but he does not know that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.170
 they are more capable than dr 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.240
 you are the man we expected 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.400
 quite possible 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.299
 kansas is full of good people 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.299
 but I will not be good 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.780
 I want to be the biggest 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.680
 something to need
