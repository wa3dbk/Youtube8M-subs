now<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.460> tents<00:00:20.700> manufactured<00:00:21.330> from<00:00:21.779> ripstop

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
now this tents manufactured from ripstop

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.890 
now this tents manufactured from ripstop
canvas<00:00:22.890> that's<00:00:23.279> SAP<00:00:23.669> proofed<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.509> what<00:00:24.750> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
canvas that's SAP proofed so what that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.600 
canvas that's SAP proofed so what that
means<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.290> they<00:00:25.410> actually<00:00:25.680> saturate<00:00:26.130> the

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
means is they actually saturate the

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.670 
means is they actually saturate the
canvas<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.419> waterproofing<00:00:27.960> agent<00:00:28.079> so

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
canvas in the waterproofing agent so

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.440 
canvas in the waterproofing agent so
that<00:00:28.710> impregnates<00:00:29.430> the<00:00:29.489> fabric<00:00:29.910> which<00:00:30.239> means

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
that impregnates the fabric which means

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.749 
that impregnates the fabric which means
it's<00:00:30.630> gonna<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:31.110> a<00:00:31.349> long<00:00:31.529> time<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.550> need

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
it's gonna last a long time and not need

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.540 
it's gonna last a long time and not need
to<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.970> retreated<00:00:33.450> at<00:00:33.660> but<00:00:33.870> as<00:00:33.989> often<00:00:34.399> it<00:00:35.399> also

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to be retreated at but as often it also

now both the fly and the inner of the
tent<00:00:40.920> are<00:00:41.070> constructed<00:00:41.550> from<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.820> ripstop

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
tent are constructed from the ripstop

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
tent are constructed from the ripstop
canvas<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.750> you've<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:43.050> two<00:00:43.410> layers<00:00:43.739> of
