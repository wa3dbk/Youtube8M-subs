00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 that meat consumption has been controversial since 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.569
 the growing number of vegetarians in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.730
 Germany has been in the last few years 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.040
 seven years doubles to just 4 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.139
 percent of the population in france 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.540
 not least make the rump steaks from 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.510
 charolais rind hard to get out of here 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.189
 abstain only two percent on meat 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.990
 We have just now in the 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.939
 vegan supermarket itself 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.010
 animal free food is not quite 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.380
 without chicken nuggets even when out 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.810
 substitute meat but these are products 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.210
 usually not so tasty and if then 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.880
 it tastes very different than the original 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.219
 in the netherlands , smart food 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.660
 tinkerer now a new art art meat 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.700
 brought to market 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.829
 it should taste so good that even 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.760
 according to the difference to real meat 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.530
 barely recognize 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.930
 Let's do another test right now 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.910
 left chicken skewers a right 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.370
 chicken imitation of vegetables 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.309
 passers-by in holland taste one 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 difference 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.699
 how is that possible 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 very delicious I find the consistency 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.510
 even better than Munich a bit 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.510
 softer but tastes really good 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.070
 the flesh that is none comes from the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.869
 Hague the vegetarian butcher is the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 maybe the most unusual meat shop 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.689
 Europe there is everything chicken beef here 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.360
 pig even fish but rented everything 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.729
 the special all products look like 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.130
 Real meat from tasting deceptive 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.150
 similar and are no longer just let off steam 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.150
 or satan 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.410
 we do not make any meat substitution 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.120
 we make vegetarian meat that is 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.950
 the latest generation of imitated 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.450
 Meat is better by far 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.640
 taste as you are used to it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 that's mainly for the 70's 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.790
 Dutch people eat less meat 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.770
 So want flexitarier the load buzzes 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.710
 more and more vegans and vegetarians 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.870
 get your art meat kick here 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.640
 it expands the world of vegetarian was 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:03.870
 ten years ago you could only or 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 soja here sometimes miss the things 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.240
 from the past as well as soft and wrong beef 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.730
 on rice or a juicy substitute citizen 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.380
 with spicy bacon cubes the meat 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.270
 imitator consist mainly of 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.900
 carrots onions and peas 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.500
 potato starch's consistency pretty much 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 close to the original 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.080
 we only use natural flavor 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.870
 Let's leave natural material 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.849
 ferment proteins from plants and if you 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.310
 the fibers look then you see that 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:49.269
 looks like real bacon 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:51.400
 crispy smoked salty manko are 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.319
 Taut by the Dutch company 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 With the help of eu 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.519
 funding and the German institute 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.890
 for food the meat substitute 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.890
 developed over four years 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.209
 Only regional products are used 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.379
 the big advantage is that you 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.170
 no long distances 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:16.629
 That's why our carbon footprint is extreme 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.400
 low, for example, we use for example 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.260
 Carrots like these are not 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:28.690
 sufficiently flawless for the supermarket 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:31.060
 are and otherwise thrown away too 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.760
 We would have liked to see how the 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.400
 turn carrots into spicy sausage 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.319
 but the factory is taboo because the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.319
 Patent rights are not yet clear 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.760
 we are shortening the food chain for the 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:49.909
 People in the meat industry 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.280
 take out of it by taking vegetables 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.379
 directly we use only the first 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.450
 to feed animals 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.280
 we give the vegetables in a kind of pasta 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:04.640
 machine and it comes immediately 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.829
 art meat sounds good 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.079
 but with many comes the self-deception 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.769
 on the way to fleshless life 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.769
 lack of understanding 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.920
 I do not know why you eat something 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.269
 should that taste like meat if you 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.590
 vegetarians want what will that be 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.000
 if you believe it to the meat 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.599
 Eating bad is then offering the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.430
 no other kind of meat 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:30.710
 the vegetarian butcher and hear that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.470
 the artisan inventor does not like it 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.840
 your invention only a replacement drug for 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.250
 meat junkies manko is certainly a 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.410
 radical withdrawal is impossible 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.400
 eating meat has a 500,000 years 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.750
 old tradition 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.639
 that's why I can hardly imagine 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.250
 that in the next 100 years 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.720
 I would not disappear either 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.550
 but that's not true 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.349
 the problem but that maybe we 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.860
 Do not have enough meat for everyone 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:59.690
 an estimated 9 billion mÃ¼nster want 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.449
 Be stuffed on this planet in 2050 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.050
 15 to 20 billion could do it later 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.050
 still be
