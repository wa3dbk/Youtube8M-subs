00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.169
 welcome to my channel this time we have 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.029
 another episode of the challenge guide of 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:10.010
 sixth generation the best of the sixth 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.170
 generation and good I will present a 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.090
 pokémon that is not this time is not the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.430
 sixth generation but yes that is a 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.160
 pokémon that has given will have a change 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.500
 brutal not for nothing or for these or for 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.600
 skill nothing alone an attack is what 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.539
 has placed him in the top loses of over 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.800
 ife and is about tula Garban is this 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.440
 tarantula that we had already the fifth 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.670
 good generation if it puts over the 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.820
 adventure is a bit a bug type 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.560
 electric that good does not highlight value of 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.300
 pulls in by speed and by good 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.250
 get special attack normalito can 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.329
 hit well but your strong point let's say 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
 what is the speed 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.969
 not entering pokémon very very 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.380
 fast is pretty fast and but neither 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.950
 it is exceedingly falls short of respect 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.660
 others like greg ninja or do not live in 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.040
 end I continued what I was saying 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.770
 about the adventure about his attack 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.930
 characteristic that is the ostia it is 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.340
 of viscous network in English sting web for 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.420
 those of us who are used to English 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.039
 and this team 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.960
 what it does is that a movement is 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.460
 similar to barb trap rocks is a 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.930
 movement of these field 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.659
 it affects the pokemon that go into 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.090
 combat and the effect it produces is 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.469
 that lowers speed a level that is 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.679
 zero by zero with 70 with 67 the opponent who 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.630
 it is quite afterwards to fuck well at 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:26.420
 any pokemon that changes except 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.740
 fliers and pokemon with limitation this 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.369
 which means that for example you take 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.619
 a girl who is very fast is with a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.329
 web stick and it's not worth anything at all 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.030
 Quick shooters who do not have to 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.729
 levitation and they are flying they go fucked 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.990
 if they have this attack ahead because if 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.270
 you do not have quality attacks you become a 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.189
 bit too slow and any pokemon will 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.170
 you can pass in speed this what you want 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.360
 say that it is not necessary to make a 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.429
 very fast team to have super 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.379
 you can hit with a few slow ones like 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.729
 can be for example armani here not 

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:57.319
 it's a little that stands out for its speed 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.810
 and that's why there are people who for the prize 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.849
 elected but with this team in the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.530
 opposing team can give a lot of themselves and 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:05.929
 change the object in biosphere plan or a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.599
 chosen ribbon and destroy it all throw 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.459
 and also good I think it's too much 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.440
 slow but pokemon these that are in the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.209
 limbo that are also not fast 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.210
 but neither are they slow or plan to look for me 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.870
 arcana and not things like that 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:22.270
 and I think it's also good to make a 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.400
 idea all those will serve a lot because 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.810
 let's all say that they are not very 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 fast because they would make cars ask the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.220
 rival and they would allow us to paste enough 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.380
 the characteristic of these we can usually 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.730
 be that they hold up well for example is 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.750
 connected net is an example is a bit 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.630
 slower based on using 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.430
 extreme speed or anger or dance 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.900
 dragon anything but not being slow 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.120
 but they have very good defenses 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.980
 you can take advantage of it well and even 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.700
 do without dragon is released 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.020
 you can use the hooked horus hayes there 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.020
 thousand examples you can think it well 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.590
 there is nothing to say is to throw the stick 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.540
 web and make good the best art for 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.730
 height is definitely a focus band the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.930
 focus back and they took first team 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.180
 to take advantage of this equipment in everything 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.360
 possible with the focus as you make sure 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.830
 almost cojones throw the stick to be see no 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.060
 I know they have surprise and then a task 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.310
 of priority or something like that but 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.830
 by noses normally throw tics and 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.420
 web the rest of attacks good as 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.269
 has to last a short time on track since 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.819
 calman tula does not hit or just throw 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.010
 everything possible before dying I do not 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.930
 just put with light display stick and egg 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.000
 between my things that forgive me 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.470
 accustomed to the English of records to 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.420
 light screen to light a light boat 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.500
 before dying a volt change then if 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.269
 you want to keep it and change 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.519
 quickly you can hit a little bit 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.890
 and finally energy ball that is a bit 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.970
 to cover has not gone either is that in 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.379
 my team I do not have any attack type 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.660
 I planted then I needed it but 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.549
 just if they take you out I know there 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.290
 much of being in a storm I will do nothing 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.970
 Well yes you could not have but of all 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.610
 ways you 're not going to stick in the room 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.019
 attack already of sample selection and bile 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.260
 it could also be to fuck her life 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:00.760
 if it is a strange Pokémon of these 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.760
 skill but good that already is 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.310
 how does the contrast all the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.710
 settlers are avoiders because they 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.270
 go through the ass you get an aero from here 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.940
 I note it with flame and it is that it does not matter 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.620
 because if you harass green kiel because not 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.510
 will matter if you have a little 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.489
 have levitation a no events either 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.560
 in porting but you can cover it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.420
 well if you have a pokémon with a trap 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.760
 rocks since the players make them 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.650
 a lot of pupa rocks traps and then 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.140
 if they force the change they are no more 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.870
 quite slow because you lose lives 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.700
 example as it is countered in the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.710
 network disks to the web stick then where 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.020
 with a quick turn with a fast turn what 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.380
 delete is all included in the network 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.450
 viscous and it goes to hell, that's why it's 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.160
 good to have a quick turn in the team 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.660
 because this little bit is in its 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.310
 accounting is up in the clouds 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.500
 you will not find it in more than one 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.480
 occasion as team leader to 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.720
 principle and a mockery or something for the 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.050
 style 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.800
 the Aragonese but at the beginning it is 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.150
 Miguel with 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.460
 exact magic layer to bounce the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.680
 old style of the all but good 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.660
 that's already selection shows and I've 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.720
 said how you have to take it over 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.520
 a bit the attacks and others because I 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.950
 I forgot of course to upload the 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.630
 speed and normally life or the 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.130
 life depends on 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.750
 It does not really matter either because it's not going 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.190
 to hold and wear the focus band 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.560
 Special dan for the volt change 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.520
 always good, I say goodbye to you 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.520
 all and goodbye
