that<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.320> IE<00:01:06.560> because<00:01:07.270> it<00:01:08.270> supports<00:01:08.689> pinch

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
that with IE because it supports pinch

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.359

see<00:01:10.580> here<00:01:10.880> guess<00:01:11.119> what<00:01:11.299> it's<00:01:11.479> just<00:01:11.689> pretty

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
much like using an iPad or an Android

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.350 
much like using an iPad or an Android
tablet<00:01:14.680> supports<00:01:15.680> that<00:01:15.799> stuff<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.820> just<00:01:17.090> in

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
tablet supports that stuff but just in

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.969 
tablet supports that stuff but just in
case<00:01:17.390> four<00:01:17.810> applications<00:01:18.439> are<00:01:18.560> not<00:01:18.710> made<00:01:18.950> by

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
case four applications are not made by

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.740 
case four applications are not made by
Microsoft<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.880> not<00:01:20.030> touch<00:01:20.240> aware<00:01:20.570> if

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
like pinch zooming built in here so no

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.240 
like pinch zooming built in here so no
problem<00:01:28.159> with<00:01:28.310> that<00:01:32.170> how<00:01:33.170> did<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.470> do<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:33.829> I'm

the<00:04:28.550> problem<00:04:28.850> altogether<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:29.570> now

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the problem altogether so now

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.749 
the problem altogether so now
grabbed<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.290> but<00:04:30.919> it<00:04:31.040> can<00:04:31.190> be<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> little<00:04:31.520> bit<00:04:31.699> of

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
grabbed it but it can be a little bit of

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:35.050 
grabbed it but it can be a little bit of
a<00:04:31.790> pain<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.150> do<00:04:32.300> that<00:04:32.479> kind<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.560> thing<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.880> then

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
a pain to do that kind of thing and then

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.340 
a pain to do that kind of thing and then
you've<00:04:35.210> got<00:04:35.360> a<00:04:35.389> bunch<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.750> handy<00:04:36.080> windows
