00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
the pocket was our first and then the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
the pocket was our first and then the
camera<00:01:48.030> second<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.840> should<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439

camera second and you should be good to
go<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.280> you'll<00:01:50.790> notice<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> my

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
go now you'll notice in a lot of my

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.719 
go now you'll notice in a lot of my
videos<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.500> you'll<00:01:52.710> see<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:53.070> using<00:01:53.280> cue

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
videos that you'll see me using cue

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.999 
videos that you'll see me using cue
flash<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.899> cue<00:01:55.140> flash<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
flash right I like cue flash a lot and

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.010 
flash right I like cue flash a lot and
now<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.610> we're<00:01:56.729> using<00:01:56.969> mirrorless<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
now that we're using mirrorless and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.810 
now that we're using mirrorless and
we're<00:01:58.170> traveling<00:01:58.680> smaller<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.399> lighter

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
we're traveling smaller and lighter

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.539 
we're traveling smaller and lighter
we're<00:02:00.689> doing<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> same<00:02:01.259> with<00:02:01.560> our<00:02:01.799> cue<00:02:02.340> flash

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
we're doing the same with our cue flash

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
we're doing the same with our cue flash
system<00:02:02.790> too<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.360> may<00:02:03.509> have<00:02:03.630> noticed<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.110> on

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
system too you may have noticed that on

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.289 
system too you may have noticed that on
one<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> my<00:02:04.979> last<00:02:05.280> big<00:02:05.549> commercial

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
one of my last big commercial

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.940 
one of my last big commercial
advertising<00:02:06.780> shoots<00:02:07.110> big-budget<00:02:07.469> shoot<00:02:07.770> by

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
advertising shoots big-budget shoot by

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
advertising shoots big-budget shoot by
the<00:02:08.009> way<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.970> chose<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.539> use<00:02:09.569> cue<00:02:10.379> flash<00:02:10.649> well

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
the way we chose to use cue flash well

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.320 
the way we chose to use cue flash well
the<00:02:11.069> reason<00:02:11.340> is<00:02:11.520> mirrorless<00:02:12.390> cameras<00:02:12.810> have

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the reason is mirrorless cameras have

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.390 
the reason is mirrorless cameras have
superior<00:02:13.960> low-light<00:02:14.560> performance<00:02:14.590> when

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
superior low-light performance when

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.330 
superior low-light performance when
compared<00:02:15.880> to<00:02:15.970> our<00:02:16.240> full-sized<00:02:17.230> Nikon<00:02:17.890> cameras

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
compared to our full-sized Nikon cameras

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.120 
compared to our full-sized Nikon cameras
right<00:02:18.550> our<00:02:18.760> DSLR<00:02:19.390> cameras<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.710> means<00:02:20.950> we

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
right our DSLR cameras so that means we

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.280 
right our DSLR cameras so that means we
can<00:02:21.310> get<00:02:21.430> away<00:02:21.550> with<00:02:21.760> less<00:02:22.030> flash<00:02:22.570> power<00:02:22.870> so

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
can get away with less flash power so

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.950 
can get away with less flash power so
I'm<00:02:24.130> gonna<00:02:24.460> use<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:25.120> wide<00:02:25.450> variety<00:02:25.660> of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
I'm gonna use a wide variety of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.840 
I'm gonna use a wide variety of
different<00:02:26.380> quantum<00:02:27.100> brand<00:02:27.340> that's<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.670> cue

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
different quantum brand that's the cue

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.610 
different quantum brand that's the cue
