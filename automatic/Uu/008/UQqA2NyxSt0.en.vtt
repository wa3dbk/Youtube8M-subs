00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
you the most realistic possible drop

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.880 
you the most realistic possible drop
test<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> involves<00:00:27.960> three<00:00:28.349> different

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
test so that involves three different

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
test so that involves three different
drops<00:00:29.250> first<00:00:30.060> we're<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.750> drop<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.960> out

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
drops first we're going to drop it out

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.049 
drops first we're going to drop it out
of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.439> pocket<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.130> pull<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.579> device<00:00:32.820> out

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of the pocket as we pull the device out

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
of the pocket as we pull the device out
which<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> most<00:00:33.870> typical<00:00:34.200> use<00:00:34.590> case

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
which is the most typical use case

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.470 
which is the most typical use case
scenario<00:00:35.250> when<00:00:35.640> people<00:00:35.880> actually<00:00:36.030> drop<00:00:36.360> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
scenario when people actually drop the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.389 
scenario when people actually drop the

from the reverse initial drop test all

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
from the reverse initial drop test all
right<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.460> no<00:01:17.610> shattering<00:01:17.850> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> display<00:01:18.510> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
right so no shattering on the display a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.680 
right so no shattering on the display a
really<00:01:18.900> good<00:01:19.049> sign<00:01:19.260> but<00:01:20.299> looks<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.600> have

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
really good sign but looks like we have

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.120 
really good sign but looks like we have
a<00:01:21.750> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.200> scratching<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> side

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
a little bit of scratching to the side

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
a little bit of scratching to the side
here<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.119> does<00:01:24.299> seem<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.690> fared

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
here but it does seem to have fared

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.530 
here but it does seem to have fared
quite<00:01:24.990> well<00:01:25.460> other<00:01:26.460> than<00:01:26.670> that<00:01:26.759> very<00:01:27.240> minimal

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
quite well other than that very minimal

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.940 
quite well other than that very minimal
damage<00:01:27.690> all<00:01:27.960> things<00:01:28.170> considering<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.830> was

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950

here<00:02:08.190> we<00:02:08.310> are<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.700> drop<00:02:08.820> it<00:02:08.970> from<00:02:09.060> mid

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
here we are going to drop it from mid

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.070 
here we are going to drop it from mid
height<00:02:09.479> from<00:02:09.810> 4<00:02:10.170> feet

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.200 

all<00:02:17.740> right<00:02:17.920> look<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.400> drop<00:02:18.580> on<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> side<00:02:19.000> but

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
all right look to drop on the side but

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.640 
all right look to drop on the side but
let's<00:02:19.390> see<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> moment<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.930> truth<00:02:22.050> okay<00:02:23.050> now

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
let's see the moment of truth okay now

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.250 
let's see the moment of truth okay now
in<00:02:23.800> terms<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.160> actually<00:02:24.490> how<00:02:24.580> unfair<00:02:25.260> all

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
in terms of actually how unfair all

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.830 
in terms of actually how unfair all
right<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:27.270> actually<00:02:28.270> relatively<00:02:28.570> minimal

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
right so actually relatively minimal

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.840 
right so actually relatively minimal
damage<00:02:29.200> as<00:02:29.590> we<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.280> see<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.490> point<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.730> impact

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
damage as we can see the point of impact

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.330 
damage as we can see the point of impact
is<00:02:31.180> here<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.900> looks<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.200> almost<00:02:32.890> fractured<00:02:33.310> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
is here it looks to almost fractured the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.220 
is here it looks to almost fractured the
plastic<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.820> little<00:02:34.000> bit<00:02:34.120> here<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.990> can<00:02:35.110> see

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
plastic a little bit here you can see

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.320 
plastic a little bit here you can see
that<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> metal<00:02:35.770> itself<00:02:35.860> has<00:02:36.310> been<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.520> quite

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
that the metal itself has been a quite

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.380 
that the metal itself has been a quite
dented<00:02:37.840> but<00:02:38.500> no<00:02:39.100> real<00:02:39.370> serious<00:02:39.760> damage<00:02:40.090> out<00:02:40.240> to

six<00:03:39.819> at<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.180> air<00:03:40.870> let's<00:03:41.500> see<00:03:41.650> how<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.799> goes

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.630 

you<00:03:50.350> know<00:03:50.440> I've<00:03:50.890> really<00:03:51.160> got<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> hand<00:03:51.520> it's

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
you know I've really got a hand it's

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.890 
you know I've really got a hand it's
Apple<00:03:52.080> device<00:03:53.080> itself<00:03:53.440> is<00:03:53.620> still<00:03:53.800> functioning

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
Apple device itself is still functioning

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.300 
Apple device itself is still functioning
let's<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.080> where<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.319> moment<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.680> point<00:03:57.220> of

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
let's see where the moment of point of

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.790 
let's see where the moment of point of
impact<00:03:57.400> was

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.750 

all<00:04:01.190> right<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:01.910> fair<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:02.360> yeah

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
all right and fair so yeah

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.850 
all right and fair so yeah
it's<00:04:04.330> a<00:04:04.450> really<00:04:04.569> line<00:04:04.810> cloud<00:04:05.019> device<00:04:05.290> I<00:04:05.530> just

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's a really line cloud device I just

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.960 
it's a really line cloud device I just
to<00:04:05.920> stay<00:04:06.040> a<00:04:06.069> little<00:04:06.250> bit<00:04:06.340> of<00:04:06.489> damage<00:04:06.610> on<00:04:06.879> the

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
to stay a little bit of damage on the

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.759 
to stay a little bit of damage on the
side<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.720> had<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:07.959> first<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.409> second<00:04:08.709> point

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
side we had the first the second point

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.530 
side we had the first the second point
of<00:04:08.920> impact<00:04:09.010> was<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.610> and<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:10.150> first<00:04:10.360> point

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
of impact was here and the first point

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.990 
of impact was here and the first point
of<00:04:10.599> impact<00:04:10.720> was<00:04:11.159> actually<00:04:12.159> excuse<00:04:12.459> me<00:04:12.640> this

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
of impact was actually excuse me this

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.280 
of impact was actually excuse me this
appears<00:04:13.299> to<00:04:13.329> be<00:04:13.420> actually<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.989> point<00:04:14.230> of

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
appears to be actually the point of

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.050 
appears to be actually the point of
impact<00:04:14.409> and<00:04:14.890> whereas<00:04:15.549> you<00:04:15.700> know<00:04:15.730> from<00:04:16.000> the

we're going to drop it from the height

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.180 
we're going to drop it from the height
of<00:04:37.030> my<00:04:37.210> ear<00:04:37.419> to<00:04:37.660> read<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> portrayal<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:39.010> stick

of my ear to read a portrayal a stick
drop<00:04:39.370> test<00:04:39.639> scenario<00:04:40.060> will<00:04:40.690> be<00:04:40.810> five<00:04:40.990> foot<00:04:41.229> six

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
drop test scenario will be five foot six

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.469 
drop test scenario will be five foot six
at<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.680> year<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.850> let's<00:04:43.000> just<00:04:43.090> see<00:04:43.330> how<00:04:43.449> it

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
at the year and let's just see how it

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.810 
at the year and let's just see how it
fares

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.480 

alright<00:04:50.360> so<00:04:50.540> as<00:04:50.660> we<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.840> see<00:04:50.900> ya<00:04:51.800> just<00:04:52.340> from

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
alright so as we can see ya just from

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.950 
alright so as we can see ya just from
the<00:04:52.580> side<00:04:52.760> here<00:04:53.000> it<00:04:53.120> did<00:04:53.330> crack<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> little<00:04:53.750> bit

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
the side here it did crack a little bit

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.650 
the side here it did crack a little bit
more<00:04:54.250> it<00:04:55.250> appears<00:04:55.580> as<00:04:55.730> though<00:04:55.760> yeah<00:04:56.480> the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
more it appears as though yeah the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.600 
more it appears as though yeah the
impact<00:04:56.960> was<00:04:57.080> here<00:04:57.290> on<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.500> side<00:04:57.710> which<00:04:58.430> caused

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
impact was here on the side which caused

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.950 
impact was here on the side which caused
the<00:04:58.640> glass<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.150> fracture<00:04:59.450> a<00:04:59.480> little<00:04:59.690> bit<00:04:59.780> more

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
the glass to fracture a little bit more

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.780 
the glass to fracture a little bit more
but<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.470> just<00:05:00.620> compounded<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.250> fractures<00:05:01.760> to

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
but it just compounded the fractures to

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.060 
but it just compounded the fractures to
the<00:05:01.970> point<00:05:02.240> where<00:05:02.450> they<00:05:02.870> extend<00:05:03.470> all<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.680> way

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
the point where they extend all the way

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.330 
the point where they extend all the way
down<00:05:04.460> the<00:05:04.700> device<00:05:04.970> itself<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.650> rear<00:05:06.860> yeah

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
down the device itself to the rear yeah

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.790 
down the device itself to the rear yeah
obviously<00:05:08.060> not<00:05:08.360> very<00:05:08.390> much<00:05:08.660> damage<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.590> case

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
obviously not very much damage the case

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.230 
obviously not very much damage the case
really<00:05:10.190> no<00:05:10.340> one<00:05:10.460> cares<00:05:10.670> about<00:05:10.730> it's<00:05:11.060> just

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
really no one cares about it's just

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.350 
really no one cares about it's just
cheap<00:05:11.540> plastic<00:05:11.720> really<00:05:12.170> anyway<00:05:12.670> but<00:05:13.670> yeah<00:05:13.790> the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.610 
cheap plastic really anyway but yeah the
screen<00:05:14.570> itself<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.900> still<00:05:15.080> functioning<00:05:15.500> so

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
screen itself is still functioning so

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.870 
screen itself is still functioning so
that's<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:15.860> really<00:05:16.040> good<00:05:16.130> sign<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.460> internals

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
that's a really good sign the internals

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.750 
that's a really good sign the internals
are<00:05:16.910> obviously<00:05:17.300> okay<00:05:17.980> but<00:05:18.980> it<00:05:19.610> just

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
are obviously okay but it just

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.670 
are obviously okay but it just
compounded<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.300> impact<00:05:20.690> and<00:05:20.870> just<00:05:21.380> made<00:05:21.530> all

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
compounded the impact and just made all

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.990 
compounded the impact and just made all
the<00:05:21.770> cracks<00:05:22.010> just<00:05:22.220> go<00:05:22.340> down<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:22.550> little<00:05:22.760> farther

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
the cracks just go down a little farther

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.480 
the cracks just go down a little farther
down<00:05:23.330> the<00:05:23.570> length<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:24.080> the<00:05:24.200> display<00:05:24.560> so

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
down the length of the display so

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.360 
down the length of the display so
Samsung<00:05:26.240> s3<00:05:26.420> unfortunately<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.500> in<00:05:27.680> pretty

the front is extremely durable because

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.839 
the front is extremely durable because

we've dropped it over four times now and

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:26.179 
we've dropped it over four times now and
it<00:06:24.240> isn't<00:06:24.569> cracking<00:06:24.960> at<00:06:25.050> all<00:06:25.199> still<00:06:25.979> fully

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
it isn't cracking at all still fully
