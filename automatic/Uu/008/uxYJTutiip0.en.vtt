00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.799 
well and I think these are called fat
bars<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.610> been<00:00:50.820> changed<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.210> fab<00:00:51.449> parts

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
bars so this been changed to fab parts

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.400 
bars so this been changed to fab parts
and<00:00:52.969> they<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.420> has<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.660> new<00:00:54.840> top<00:00:55.110> end<00:00:55.350> rebuild

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
