it's<00:01:51.540> not<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> traxxas

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it's not going to be like a traxxas

system or whatever but it is going to be

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
system or whatever but it is going to be
a<00:01:58.350> lot<00:01:58.530> cheaper<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.369> can<00:01:59.520> pick<00:01:59.670> one<00:01:59.790> of

very<00:02:40.080> nice<00:02:40.580> am<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:42.270> actually<00:02:42.450> handled<00:02:43.140> has<00:02:43.770> a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
very nice am I actually handled has a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.590 
very nice am I actually handled has a
pretty<00:02:44.100> good<00:02:44.250> track<00:02:44.430> truck<00:02:44.760> I've<00:02:44.940> never<00:02:45.390> take

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
pretty good track truck I've never take

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.300 
pretty good track truck I've never take
it<00:02:45.630> out<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.110> track<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.700> might<00:02:47.700> work<00:02:47.970> um

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
it out on the track but might work um

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.800 
it out on the track but might work um
differentials<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.550> here<00:02:50.760> it's<00:02:51.330> very<00:02:51.540> small

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
differentials right here it's very small

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.300 
differentials right here it's very small
so<00:02:51.870> I<00:02:52.110> don't<00:02:52.320> know<00:02:52.410> if<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.830> gears<00:02:53.070> are<00:02:53.190> gonna

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so I don't know if the gears are gonna

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.500 
so I don't know if the gears are gonna
hold<00:02:53.550> up<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:54.510> far<00:02:54.810> as<00:02:54.840> brushless<00:02:55.140> um<00:02:56.450> no<00:02:57.450> I'm

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
hold up as far as brushless um no I'm

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.180 
hold up as far as brushless um no I'm
not<00:02:57.660> sure<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.410> looks<00:02:58.710> like<00:02:58.770> they<00:02:59.010> put<00:02:59.130> a

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
not sure and it looks like they put a

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.590 
not sure and it looks like they put a
pretty<00:02:59.400> small<00:02:59.610> spur<00:02:59.910> gear<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.180> there<00:03:00.360> because

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
pretty small spur gear in there because

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.690 
pretty small spur gear in there because
they<00:03:00.840> have<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.050> case<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.520> in

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
they have to case it like right up in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.140 
they have to case it like right up in
here<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.600> see<00:03:03.630> that<00:03:04.820> they<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:05.850> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
here if you can see that they have to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.350 
here if you can see that they have to
put<00:03:06.660> this<00:03:06.780> bird<00:03:07.020> here<00:03:07.460> right<00:03:08.460> in<00:03:08.610> here<00:03:08.910> it's

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
put this bird here right in here it's

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.380 
put this bird here right in here it's
like<00:03:09.450> very<00:03:09.990> small<00:03:10.290> area<00:03:10.620> all<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.210> all<00:03:12.210> your

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
like very small area all the all your

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.110 
like very small area all the all your
chip<00:03:12.690> if<00:03:13.560> you<00:03:13.650> want<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.830> change<00:03:13.980> anything<00:03:14.220> with

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
chip if you want to change anything with

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.490 
chip if you want to change anything with
your<00:03:15.240> gear<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.630> match<00:03:15.810> or<00:03:16.080> anything<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
your gear to match or anything like that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500 
your gear to match or anything like that
it's<00:03:16.890> all<00:03:17.010> gonna<00:03:17.130> be<00:03:17.310> inside<00:03:17.610> here<00:03:17.850> I'm<00:03:18.390> not

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
it's all gonna be inside here I'm not

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.300 
it's all gonna be inside here I'm not
taking<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.810> look<00:03:18.930> at<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.170> yet<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.190> comes

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
taking a look at that yet but it comes

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:28.880 
taking a look at that yet but it comes
with<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.490> leopard<00:03:22.580> ha<00:03:23.580> ve<00:03:23.820> motor<00:03:25.010> it's<00:03:26.010> s<00:03:27.890> 2458

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
with a leopard ha ve motor it's s 2458

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.270 
with a leopard ha ve motor it's s 2458
kV<00:03:29.640> that's<00:03:30.360> actually<00:03:31.290> not<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.470> high<00:03:31.740> of<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.920> kV

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
kV that's actually not that high of a kV

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.240 
kV that's actually not that high of a kV
rating<00:03:32.610> higher<00:03:33.030> kV<00:03:33.510> faster<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> though<00:03:34.800> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
rating higher kV faster it is though the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.340 
rating higher kV faster it is though the
less<00:03:35.940> kV<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.480> more<00:03:36.630> torque<00:03:36.870> it's<00:03:37.020> gonna<00:03:37.110> have

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
less kV the more torque it's gonna have

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.870 
less kV the more torque it's gonna have
so<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.620> truck<00:03:37.890> probably<00:03:38.490> is<00:03:38.580> going<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> be

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
so this truck probably is going to be

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.120 
so this truck probably is going to be
when<00:03:39.720> I<00:03:39.750> mean<00:03:39.960> torque<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.320> mean<00:03:40.500> acceleration

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
when I mean torque I mean acceleration

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.199 
when I mean torque I mean acceleration
it's<00:03:41.220> probably<00:03:41.460> gonna<00:03:41.550> be<00:03:41.610> really<00:03:41.760> fast<00:03:41.940> and

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
it's probably gonna be really fast and

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.710 
it's probably gonna be really fast and
get<00:03:42.360> up<00:03:42.480> there<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.750> go<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:44.550> ESC<00:03:45.270> is<00:03:45.480> bigger

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
get up there and go the ESC is bigger

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.390 
get up there and go the ESC is bigger
than<00:03:45.900> some<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.230> other<00:03:46.380> ESC<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.310> I'm

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
than some of the other ESC is so I'm

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.040 
than some of the other ESC is so I'm
sure<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.820> can<00:03:47.940> run<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.150> 3s<00:03:48.510> on<00:03:48.690> this<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.990> no

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
sure you can run a 3s on this and no

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.760 
sure you can run a 3s on this and no
problem<00:03:50.420> let<00:03:51.420> me<00:03:51.480> zoom<00:03:51.630> out<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.900> little<00:03:51.930> bit

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.270 

okay<00:03:56.450> one<00:03:57.450> thing<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.750> saw<00:03:58.500> with<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:58.830> servo

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
okay one thing that I saw with the servo

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.040 
okay one thing that I saw with the servo
system<00:03:59.760> right<00:04:00.090> here<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:02.480> when<00:04:03.480> you<00:04:03.690> turn

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
system right here is that when you turn

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.870 
system right here is that when you turn
your<00:04:04.290> truck<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.830> might<00:04:05.100> go<00:04:05.250> all<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.580> way<00:04:05.670> down

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
your truck it might go all the way down

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.360 
your truck it might go all the way down
in<00:04:06.150> there<00:04:06.390> and<00:04:06.600> then<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.959> can't<00:04:07.260> like<00:04:07.860> if<00:04:07.980> I<00:04:08.130> if

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
in there and then you can't like if I if

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.490 
in there and then you can't like if I if
I<00:04:08.520> turn<00:04:08.940> it<00:04:09.090> all<00:04:09.270> the<00:04:09.300> way<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.870> push<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.290> down

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
I turn it all the way and push this down

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.040 
I turn it all the way and push this down
a<00:04:10.560> little<00:04:10.800> bit<00:04:11.010> then<00:04:11.850> it<00:04:12.240> won't<00:04:12.480> come<00:04:12.690> back<00:04:12.870> up

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
a little bit then it won't come back up

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.120 
a little bit then it won't come back up
you<00:04:13.080> have<00:04:13.260> to<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.410> some<00:04:13.620> pliers<00:04:13.800> but<00:04:13.950> that's

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
you have to have some pliers but that's

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.020 
you have to have some pliers but that's
not<00:04:14.250> gonna<00:04:14.340> happen<00:04:14.520> when<00:04:14.790> you're<00:04:14.880> actually

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
not gonna happen when you're actually

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.340 
not gonna happen when you're actually
steering<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.630> truck<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:15.990> turn<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.260> on

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
steering the truck and you turn it on

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.140 
steering the truck and you turn it on
just<00:04:16.620> if<00:04:17.280> you're<00:04:17.400> messing<00:04:17.670> with<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.910> because

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
just if you're messing with it because

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.300 
just if you're messing with it because
I've<00:04:18.330> never<00:04:18.480> seen<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> steering<00:04:19.109> servo<00:04:19.590> like

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
I've never seen a steering servo like

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.330 
I've never seen a steering servo like
this<00:04:20.549> except<00:04:20.970> in<00:04:21.090> some<00:04:21.239> nitro<00:04:21.540> cars

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.090 

so<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:27.360> front<00:04:27.660> right<00:04:27.900> here<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.410> kind<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
so the front right here it's kind of the

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.430 
so the front right here it's kind of the
same<00:04:29.310> as<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.490> Duratrax<00:04:30.480> evader<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:31.050> steering

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
same as a Duratrax evader the steering

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.530 
same as a Duratrax evader the steering
it's<00:04:31.590> all<00:04:31.800> put<00:04:32.460> into<00:04:32.640> this<00:04:32.910> one<00:04:33.120> pot<00:04:33.330> right

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
it's all put into this one pot right

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.010 
it's all put into this one pot right
here

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
here

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:40.670 
here
it<00:04:34.800> steers<00:04:35.460> pretty<00:04:35.760> well<00:04:38.120> so<00:04:39.120> yeah<00:04:39.390> and<00:04:40.290> then

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
it steers pretty well so yeah and then

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.620 
it steers pretty well so yeah and then
they<00:04:40.920> got<00:04:41.070> your<00:04:41.190> tiny<00:04:41.730> 2.4<00:04:42.450> gigahertz

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
they got your tiny 2.4 gigahertz

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.790 
they got your tiny 2.4 gigahertz
receiver<00:04:43.290> standard<00:04:43.590> tiny<00:04:44.460> little<00:04:44.640> thing<00:04:45.800> and

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
receiver standard tiny little thing and

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.170 
receiver standard tiny little thing and
then<00:04:47.010> let's<00:04:47.220> take<00:04:47.310> a<00:04:47.370> look<00:04:47.550> at<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.700> battery

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
then let's take a look at the battery

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540 
then let's take a look at the battery
nothing<00:04:48.870> special<00:04:49.290> I'll<00:04:49.440> there's<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.370> two

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
nothing special I'll there's just two

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.350 
nothing special I'll there's just two
clips<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> battery<00:04:51.510> tray<00:04:52.670> it<00:04:53.670> can<00:04:53.850> fit<00:04:54.090> to

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
clips on the battery tray it can fit to

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.460 
clips on the battery tray it can fit to
us<00:04:54.480> lipo<00:04:54.810> pretty<00:04:55.050> big

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
us lipo pretty big

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.590 
us lipo pretty big
I'm<00:04:55.980> sure<00:04:56.580> could<00:04:56.730> fit<00:04:56.850> like<00:04:56.970> a<00:04:57.000> six<00:04:57.240> thousand

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
I'm sure could fit like a six thousand

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.570 
I'm sure could fit like a six thousand
milliamp<00:04:57.810> 7000<00:04:58.470> million<00:04:58.710> so<00:04:59.190> I'm<00:04:59.280> pretty<00:04:59.370> big

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
milliamp 7000 million so I'm pretty big

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.720 
milliamp 7000 million so I'm pretty big
like<00:04:59.730> that<00:04:59.910> yeah<00:05:00.600> it's<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:00.960> seven-point<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.730> two

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
like that yeah it's a seven-point to two

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.510 
like that yeah it's a seven-point to two
thousand<00:05:03.030> milliamp<00:05:03.240> battery<00:05:04.520> nothing

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
thousand milliamp battery nothing

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.990 
thousand milliamp battery nothing
special

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
special

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.600

lipo I say get a 7.2 volt cuz I don't

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.550 
lipo I say get a 7.2 volt cuz I don't
want<00:05:12.510> to<00:05:12.630> see<00:05:12.780> you<00:05:12.870> guys<00:05:12.990> tripping<00:05:13.320> out<00:05:13.380> any

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
want to see you guys tripping out any

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.340 
want to see you guys tripping out any
gears<00:05:13.830> in<00:05:13.950> this<00:05:14.630> because<00:05:15.630> I'm<00:05:15.900> not<00:05:15.930> sure<00:05:16.200> if<00:05:16.260> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
gears in this because I'm not sure if it

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.840 
gears in this because I'm not sure if it
will<00:05:16.470> strip<00:05:16.650> out<00:05:16.830> gears<00:05:17.070> but<00:05:17.310> I'd<00:05:17.490> just<00:05:17.520> be

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
will strip out gears but I'd just be

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.760 
will strip out gears but I'd just be
safe<00:05:18.030> with<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.240> 2's<00:05:18.540> because<00:05:18.660> 3s<00:05:19.140> is<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.410> little

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
safe with the 2's because 3s is a little

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.740 
safe with the 2's because 3s is a little
bit<00:05:19.860> too<00:05:19.950> much<00:05:20.040> power<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.520> 2's<00:05:21.390> is<00:05:21.540> just

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
bit too much power and 2's is just

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.140 
bit too much power and 2's is just
enough<00:05:21.960> to<00:05:22.080> have<00:05:22.200> fun<00:05:22.380> with<00:05:22.590> it<00:05:23.000> let's<00:05:24.000> take<00:05:24.060> a

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
enough to have fun with it let's take a

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.070 
enough to have fun with it let's take a
look<00:05:24.300> at<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.420> bottom<00:05:24.600> of<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:24.750> truck<00:05:27.080> alright

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
look at the bottom of the truck alright

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.980 
look at the bottom of the truck alright
so<00:05:28.350> right<00:05:28.470> here<00:05:28.770> we<00:05:28.920> got<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.600> chassis<00:05:30.600> it's

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
so right here we got the chassis it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.300 
so right here we got the chassis it's
got<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.140> little<00:05:31.260> hole<00:05:31.500> cut<00:05:31.680> out<00:05:31.710> for<00:05:32.040> the<00:05:32.100> motor

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
got a little hole cut out for the motor

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.550 
got a little hole cut out for the motor
which<00:05:32.970> lets<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.690> cool<00:05:33.840> down<00:05:33.960> right<00:05:34.200> here<00:05:34.410> and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
which lets it cool down right here and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.040 
which lets it cool down right here and
then<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:35.040> got<00:05:35.190> our<00:05:35.460> cutouts<00:05:36.420> for<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.810> battery

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
then we got our cutouts for the battery
