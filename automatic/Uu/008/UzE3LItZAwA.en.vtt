00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.469 
piece of gunpowder along with a piece of
paper<00:02:01.189> then<00:02:02.189> you'll<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> flight<00:02:03.180> duration

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
paper then you'll get a flight duration

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.050 
paper then you'll get a flight duration
one<00:02:03.960> if<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.770> use<00:02:04.920> two<00:02:05.189> pieces<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.610> gunpowder

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
one if you use two pieces of gunpowder

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.839 
one if you use two pieces of gunpowder
then<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> give<00:02:07.079> flight<00:02:07.290> duration<00:02:07.619> too<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.280> if

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
then you give flight duration too and if

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.100 
then you give flight duration too and if
you<00:02:08.940> use<00:02:09.030> three<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.479> get<00:02:09.599> flight<00:02:09.869> duration

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you use three you get flight duration

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.740 
you use three you get flight duration
three<00:02:10.410> which<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.580> largest<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.599> we're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
three which is the largest so we're

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.580 
three which is the largest so we're
going<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.020> three

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
going to do three

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.350 
going to do three
because<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:14.400> looks<00:02:14.610> better<00:02:14.790> if<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> let<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.180> go

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
because it looks better if you let it go

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.600 
because it looks better if you let it go
longer<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:16.650> put<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:17.010> fireworks<00:02:17.340> start

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
longer so you put your fireworks start

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
experiment with all different dyes you

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.050 
experiment with all different dyes you
can<00:03:03.629> put<00:03:03.840> more<00:03:04.590> than<00:03:04.799> one<00:03:04.860> died<00:03:05.250> in<00:03:05.280> one<00:03:05.760> so

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
can put more than one died in one so

can put more than one died in one so
like<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.510> one<00:03:06.720> will<00:03:06.870> explode<00:03:07.140> into<00:03:07.260> many

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
like this one will explode into many

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.460 
like this one will explode into many
different<00:03:07.530> colors<00:03:07.950> so<00:03:09.079> yeah<00:03:10.079> there's<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.319> whole

bunch of colors around their sisters

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.520 
bunch of colors around their sisters
different<00:03:12.209> dyes<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:13.260> you<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.500> just

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
different dyes so you can just

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.140 
different dyes so you can just
experiment<00:03:13.920> with<00:03:14.190> different<00:03:14.459> colored<00:03:14.940> eyes

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
experiment with different colored eyes

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.809 
experiment with different colored eyes
all<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:16.590> will<00:03:16.829> change<00:03:17.099> certain<00:03:17.370> effects

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
all these will change certain effects

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.900
