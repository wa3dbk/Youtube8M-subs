team was fun to use with a lot of fun
it's<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:31.239> definitely<00:02:32.239> an<00:02:32.480> improvement<00:02:32.659> on<00:02:33.019> the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
it's a definitely an improvement on the

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.020 
it's a definitely an improvement on the
10k<00:02:33.560> side<00:02:33.799> but<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.099> ten<00:02:34.250> case<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.609> could<00:02:34.849> hold

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
10k side but the ten case I could hold

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.460 
10k side but the ten case I could hold
its<00:02:35.239> own<00:02:35.329> definitely<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.959> 10k<00:02:36.319> you're

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
its own definitely for the 10k you're

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.679 
its own definitely for the 10k you're
paying<00:02:36.650> for<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:37.099> maybe<00:02:37.939> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.359> switch

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
paying for it maybe you can switch

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.960 
paying for it maybe you can switch
between<00:02:38.870> them<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:39.349> mix<00:02:40.129> it<00:02:40.250> up<00:02:40.310> say<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.639> when

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
between them all mix it up say you when

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.459 
between them all mix it up say you when
particularly<00:02:41.540> don't<00:02:41.629> like<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.109> differences

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
particularly don't like the differences

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.199 
particularly don't like the differences
but<00:02:42.980> obviously<00:02:43.250> as<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.400> because<00:02:43.670> it<00:02:43.819> works<00:02:44.000> on

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
but obviously as you because it works on

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.520 
but obviously as you because it works on
hyperlink<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:44.780> you<00:02:44.870> could<00:02:45.019> gave<00:02:45.139> like<00:02:45.349> by

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
hyperlink so you could gave like by

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.990 
hyperlink so you could gave like by
