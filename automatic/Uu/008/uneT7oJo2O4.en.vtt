00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
in mine and probably the most important

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.219 
in mine and probably the most important
thing<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.570> compare<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> against

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
thing that we do is compare it against

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
thing that we do is compare it against
other<00:01:13.320> cases<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> found<00:01:14.549> that<00:01:14.700> the

hair<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.180> face<00:01:30.420> oil<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:30.960> after<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.380> day<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> does

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
hair and face oil so after a day it does

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.249 
hair and face oil so after a day it does
feel<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.400> greasy<00:01:33.119> now<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:33.930> top<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.110> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
feel a little greasy now on top of that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.050 
feel a little greasy now on top of that
the<00:01:34.530> case<00:01:34.740> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.400> more<00:01:35.549> difficult

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
the case is a little bit more difficult

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.730 
the case is a little bit more difficult
to<00:01:36.240> install<00:01:36.390> when<00:01:36.869> compared<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.229> other<00:01:37.500> cases

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
to install when compared to other cases

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
to install when compared to other cases
so<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.430> end<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.759> flexed<00:01:39.119> in<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> case<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.630> bit

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so we end up flexed in the case of bit

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.880 
so we end up flexed in the case of bit
more<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.110> we've<00:01:40.229> noticed<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.650> certain

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
more and we've noticed that certain

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.770 
more and we've noticed that certain
parts<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> case<00:01:41.670> seem<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> showing

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
parts of the case seem to be showing

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539 
parts of the case seem to be showing

installs and uninstalls that we've done
with<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.380> case<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.430> protection<00:01:47.939> aspect

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
with this case now the protection aspect

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
with this case now the protection aspect

of the speck CandyShell they make it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
of the speck CandyShell they make it
sound<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.189> incredibly<00:01:50.610> tough

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
sound like this is an incredibly tough

dig deep into their website they don't

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.459 
dig deep into their website they don't
actually<00:02:00.210> tell<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.659> how<00:02:00.689> far<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.110> can<00:02:01.259> drop

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.959 
actually tell you how far you can drop
it<00:02:01.649> they<00:02:01.740> do<00:02:01.799> say<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.280> cases<00:02:02.640> rates<00:02:02.850> in

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
it they do say that the cases rates in

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.850 
it they do say that the cases rates in
mil<00:02:03.149> standard<00:02:03.509> 810g<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.290> from<00:02:04.770> my

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
mil standard 810g and from my

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.980 
mil standard 810g and from my
understanding<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.729> mil<00:02:06.030> spec<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.719> that

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
understanding of that mil spec is that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
understanding of that mil spec is that
you<00:02:07.140> can<00:02:07.259> drop<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.009> thing<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.429> four

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you can drop it this thing from four

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
you can drop it this thing from four
feet<00:02:08.940> no<00:02:09.479> problem<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.929> could<00:02:10.050> probably<00:02:10.200> drop

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
feet no problem you could probably drop

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
feet no problem you could probably drop
from<00:02:10.590> 6<00:02:10.920> feet<00:02:11.209> shouldn't<00:02:12.209> be<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> problem<00:02:12.480> 8

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
from 6 feet shouldn't be a problem 8

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.330
