00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.230
 hello today we find ourselves for 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.610
 a recipe 2.0 so we will make a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.870
 Tunisian recipe we will do the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.490
 macbook recipe I had you 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
 introduced a few years ago 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.700
 well, we will do it again with the means that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.130
 go well go it's gone 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 so to make this magot he will us 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.840
 have to have three are we going to do 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.260
 harden and that we will use hard it will us 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.390
 to have between 10 and 12 would be three 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.289
 binge potatoes saw from 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.840
 the potato of consumption 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 running with a mealy flesh 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 especially not a firm flesh and then 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.739
 about 150 g of chicken leftovers from 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.420
 circle of weight so really very very very 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 simple if you do not have any left over 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.489
 chicken of course you take a white 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.530
 of chicken 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 it will do very well around 100 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.160
 between 100 and 150 tables I peeled the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.800
 potatoes and I cut them in 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.379
 two of them are in the water a small 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.030
 stage point with the conti few of 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.550
 salt with the potatoes otherwise this 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.170
 would not be good and then we will do them 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.120
 so cook the eggs we will do them 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.289
 harden simply and the apples from 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.460
 earth is good we will cook them for 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.780
 they are soft is melting 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.830
 while eggs and apples 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.760
 cuse earth and well I'm going all 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.110
 simply break eggs in a bowl 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.460
 and the bins in May I keep two 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.490
 to can 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.439
 dilute my preparation if I value 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.729
 that it is too thick or if I feel 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.210
 there are not enough well I 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.210
 would add 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.060
 now I cut the curry chicken 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.580
 pieces here I have canes and eggs 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.159
 the potatoes are cooked 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:44.640
 so I'm just going to crush them 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:47.539
 with a hook I add them to the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.539
 preparing a menu 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:04.299
 now we're going roughly 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:07.049
 companies them I'm going to beat the eggs 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.049
 with potatoes 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.959
 I added the problem we had booked 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:33.950
 and now we're going to add ten so 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:36.350
 the hard boiled eggs so I put last 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.440
 to try not to spoil them 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.870
 summarily mixtures 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.270
 I will put the oven to heat 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.720
 thermostat 6 about 180 degrees we're going 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 well salty and peppery to be because I know 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:58.090
 that I will never be sufficiently a 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.090
 small whip round 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.260
 it's okay now I'm going price I 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.390
 will dumped my preparation in a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.390
 racket mold 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.820
 I preheated the oven to 200 Â° 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.860
 I heated the water for Mrs. Obama 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:26.060
 just laughs I want to drop my 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.830
 preparation in this and I'm going to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.410
 put in the oven so I'm going to drop to 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.910
 180 degrees so it to me hot and drill 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.610
 then I'll put it in the oven for 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:37.490
 45 minutes about 45 minutes of cooking 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.780
 Later the mac or cui so I 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.670
 out there it's nickel 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.800
 I'll just leave it in his 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.140
 mold the time that is cooled this so 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.450
 they do not dry out this is our 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.440
 makouda well cooled so bah it takes 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.950
 to know that it is a dish that is eaten 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.450
 cold 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.010
 1 it's not something you're going to 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.209
 eat out of the oven or whatever 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.920
 either you have to put it in the refrigerator 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.320
 once he has touched said he must 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.660
 let cool in his mold so that 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.100
 it does not dry but keeps 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.830
 precisely all the steam and all 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.470
 the humidity with which he accuses so 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.160
 that's what it gives it's really 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.170
 good and it's super appetizing me this 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.700
 that I'm used to doing is 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.800
 take a little tomato sauce and 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.209
 to eat it with i'm not the only one to 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.769
 the house to do like that is great 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.870
 good otherwise you put a little bit of 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.470
 lemon juice on it and it's going to be that 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.169
 happiness 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:27.290

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.300
 really super good a chicken rest 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.250
 few hours some potatoes 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.500
