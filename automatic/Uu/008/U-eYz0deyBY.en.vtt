00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
were using we got to see the fact that

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.240 
were using we got to see the fact that
it<00:01:21.000> seems<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.570> though<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:22.110> maps<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.040> game

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
it seems as though the maps in the game
are<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.850> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.180> interactive<00:01:24.780> I'm

similar<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.920> battlefield<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.850> guess<00:01:27.600> kind<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
similar to battlefield I guess kind of

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
similar to battlefield I guess kind of
similar<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> cod<00:01:28.560> ghosts<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> actual

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
similar to cod ghosts in the actual

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.520 
similar to cod ghosts in the actual
multi-player<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.600> play<00:01:30.750> we<00:01:30.900> saw<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.200> huge

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
multi-player game play we saw a huge

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
multi-player game play we saw a huge
tidal<00:01:31.829> wave<00:01:32.070> coming<00:01:32.759> towards<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> players

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
tidal wave coming towards the players

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
tidal wave coming towards the players
but<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.259> actually<00:01:34.590> cut<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:34.890> before

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
but we it actually cut out before

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.770 
but we it actually cut out before
anything<00:01:35.549> happened<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.509> assume

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
anything happened but I would assume

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.600 
anything happened but I would assume
that<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.079> tidal<00:01:37.320> wave<00:01:37.560> would<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> some<00:01:38.460> type

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
that this tidal wave would do some type

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.359 
that this tidal wave would do some type
of<00:01:38.640> damage<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.409> gameplay<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:40.890> did<00:01:41.100> see

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
of damage and in the gameplay we did see

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.249 
of damage and in the gameplay we did see
the<00:01:41.939> fact<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.570> were<00:01:42.630> using<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:43.229> a

the fact that they were using like a

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
thing that caught my eye the most is the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.600 
thing that caught my eye the most is the
guy<00:01:54.299> only<00:01:54.509> had<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.930> kill<00:01:55.259> streaks<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.740> which<00:01:56.369> to

guy only had to kill streaks on which to
me<00:01:56.759> means<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:58.170> assuming<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.040> only<00:01:59.340> assume

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
me means I'm assuming I can only assume

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
me means I'm assuming I can only assume
that<00:01:59.729> he<00:01:59.939> wasn't<00:02:00.240> using<00:02:00.509> all<00:02:00.750> three

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that he wasn't using all three

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.240 
that he wasn't using all three
killstreaks<00:02:01.380> because<00:02:01.619> call<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.950> duty<00:02:02.159> you've

trailer the guy was only using two and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
trailer the guy was only using two and
the<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.750> that<00:02:09.810> caught<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.319> eye<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.500> most<00:02:10.830> is

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the thing that caught my eye the most is

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.160 
the thing that caught my eye the most is
it<00:02:11.550> appeared

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
it appeared

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.530 
it appeared
to<00:02:13.260> not<00:02:13.740> exactly<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:14.910> killstreak<00:02:15.330> you

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
to not exactly be a killstreak you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.059 
to not exactly be a killstreak you
didn't<00:02:15.780> say<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.200> need<00:02:16.470> six<00:02:16.770> kills

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
didn't say you know you need six kills

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.580 
didn't say you know you need six kills
or<00:02:17.640> whatever<00:02:17.970> what<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.140> appeared<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.530> be

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
or whatever what up it appeared to be

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.160 
or whatever what up it appeared to be
was<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.130> had<00:02:20.489> a<00:02:20.520> bar<00:02:20.880> along<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:21.989> amount

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
was it had a bar along with the amount

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.530 
was it had a bar along with the amount
of<00:02:22.290> points<00:02:22.470> needed<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.280> assume<00:02:23.670> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
of points needed I would assume to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.170 
of points needed I would assume to
obtain<00:02:25.140> these<00:02:25.560> killstreaks<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.459> looked<00:02:26.910> a<00:02:27.030> lot

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
obtain these killstreaks it looked a lot

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.960 
obtain these killstreaks it looked a lot
like<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.540> black<00:02:27.840> ops<00:02:28.080> 2<00:02:28.520> version<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.700> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
like the black ops 2 version of the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.059 
like the black ops 2 version of the
killstreak<00:02:30.390> system<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.870> i'm<00:02:31.290> going<00:02:31.739> to<00:02:31.950> go

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
killstreak system so i'm going to go

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.740 
killstreak system so i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.700> random<00:02:33.030> guess<00:02:33.330> here<00:02:33.630> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
ahead and take a random guess here and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.860 
ahead and take a random guess here and
say<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:35.489> advanced<00:02:35.819> warfare<00:02:36.300> game<00:02:36.630> is

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
say that the advanced warfare game is

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.800 
say that the advanced warfare game is
going<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.290> bring<00:02:37.500> back<00:02:37.739> the<00:02:37.980> black<00:02:38.250> ops<00:02:38.459> 2

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
going to bring back the black ops 2

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.640 
going to bring back the black ops 2
scorestreak<00:02:39.810> system<00:02:40.140> rather<00:02:40.319> than<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
scorestreak system rather than the

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.259 
scorestreak system rather than the
killstreak<00:02:40.980> system<00:02:41.280> now<00:02:41.400> if<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.910> don't<00:02:42.180> know

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
killstreak system now if you don't know

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.120 
killstreak system now if you don't know
about<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.630> score<00:02:42.870> streak<00:02:43.080> system<00:02:43.470> basically

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
about the score streak system basically

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.509 
about the score streak system basically
what<00:02:44.580> goes<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:44.849> with<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:46.350> don't<00:02:46.620> get

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
what goes on with it is you don't get

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.910 
what goes on with it is you don't get
all<00:02:47.760> your<00:02:48.019> streaks<00:02:49.019> based<00:02:49.350> off<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.560> kills

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
all your streaks based off of kills

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.580 
all your streaks based off of kills
alone<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.459> some<00:02:51.000> games<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:52.080> know<00:02:52.170> em<00:02:52.380> dub

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
alone in some games like you know em dub

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
to cod4 world at war black ops 1 you had

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.470 
to cod4 world at war black ops 1 you had
to<00:02:57.239> actually<00:02:57.540> get<00:02:58.310> kills<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.209> needed

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
to actually get kills so if you needed

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.789 
to actually get kills so if you needed
10<00:03:00.660> kills<00:03:00.900> to<00:03:01.140> get<00:03:01.290> your<00:03:01.410> killstreak<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
10 kills to get your killstreak you

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.229 
10 kills to get your killstreak you
would<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.160> get<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> 10<00:03:02.640> kills<00:03:02.880> with<00:03:03.090> your

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
would have to get the 10 kills with your

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.650 
would have to get the 10 kills with your
gun<00:03:03.390> right<00:03:03.660> I'm<00:03:04.010> leaving<00:03:05.010> up<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:06.540> can

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
gun right I'm leaving up and you can

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.300 
gun right I'm leaving up and you can
actually<00:03:06.810> get<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.560> kills<00:03:07.950> with<00:03:08.160> your

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
actually get the kills with your

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.770 
actually get the kills with your
killstreaks<00:03:08.670> as<00:03:08.760> well<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.420> long<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.600> you

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
killstreaks as well so as long as you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
killstreaks as well so as long as you
amounted<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.650> 10<00:03:10.950> kills<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.400> what<00:03:11.580> would

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
amounted to 10 kills that's what would

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.930 
amounted to 10 kills that's what would
happen<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:12.510> with<00:03:12.720> em<00:03:12.840> dub<00:03:13.340> they<00:03:14.340> actually

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
happen now with em dub they actually

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.150 
happen now with em dub they actually
changed<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.170> where<00:03:16.319> if<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.620> got<00:03:16.799> a<00:03:16.830> flag

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
changed it to where if you got a flag

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.590 
changed it to where if you got a flag
you<00:03:17.370> would<00:03:17.489> get<00:03:17.640> one<00:03:17.880> point<00:03:18.120> towards<00:03:18.480> your

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
you would get one point towards your

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.630 
you would get one point towards your
kill<00:03:18.750> streak<00:03:18.959> so<00:03:19.109> a<00:03:19.320> flag<00:03:19.799> counted<00:03:20.190> as<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> kill

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
kill streak so a flag counted as a kill

thought that was excellent that you
basically<00:03:59.819> got<00:04:00.180> points<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.630> everything<00:04:01.109> you

basically got points for everything you
did<00:04:01.410> in<00:04:01.470> black<00:04:01.769> ops<00:04:01.920> 2<00:04:02.040> whether<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.880> was

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
did in black ops 2 whether it was

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.569 
did in black ops 2 whether it was
destroying<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.959> trophy<00:04:04.350> system<00:04:04.709> smashing<00:04:05.519> a

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
destroying a trophy system smashing a

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.000 
destroying a trophy system smashing a
claymore<00:04:06.000> capping<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.569> flag<00:04:06.900> getting<00:04:07.709> kills

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
claymore capping a flag getting kills

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.150

while<00:04:08.819> on<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.150> flag<00:04:09.359> kills<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.290> general

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
while on the flag kills in general

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.490 
while on the flag kills in general
counted<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:12.630> think<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.049> best<00:04:13.290> thing

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
counted and I think that the best thing

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.319 
counted and I think that the best thing
was<00:04:13.920> getting<00:04:14.130> kills<00:04:14.459> on<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> flight<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.000> me<00:04:15.150> that

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
was getting kills on a flight to me that

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.969 
was getting kills on a flight to me that
was<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.480> most<00:04:15.690> fun<00:04:15.810> because<00:04:16.139> I<00:04:16.320> personally<00:04:16.799> it

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
was the most fun because I personally it

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.099 
was the most fun because I personally it
helps<00:04:17.519> people<00:04:17.639> play<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:18.060> objective<00:04:18.479> and<00:04:18.660> it

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
helps people play the objective and it

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.479 
helps people play the objective and it
rewards<00:04:19.530> them<00:04:19.650> greatly<00:04:19.919> for<00:04:20.190> doing<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.459> I

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
rewards them greatly for doing so I

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.890 
rewards them greatly for doing so I
think<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.910> if<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.060> throw<00:04:21.209> myself<00:04:21.390> on<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.690> flag

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
think that if I throw myself on a flag

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.450 
think that if I throw myself on a flag
and<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.140> take<00:04:22.320> out<00:04:22.440> three<00:04:22.710> guys<00:04:22.860> I<00:04:23.039> deserve

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
right there like that I thought that was

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.469 
right there like that I thought that was
a<00:04:46.919> ton<00:04:47.310> of<00:04:47.340> fun<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.790> I<00:04:48.120> thought<00:04:48.300> they're

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
a ton of fun and I thought they're

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.110 
a ton of fun and I thought they're
rewarding<00:04:49.050> players<00:04:49.320> for<00:04:50.250> destroying<00:04:50.850> enemy

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
rewarding players for destroying enemy

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.750 
rewarding players for destroying enemy
equipment<00:04:51.530> shooting<00:04:52.530> down<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:53.310> know<00:04:53.430> spy

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
equipment shooting down you know spy

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.689 
equipment shooting down you know spy
planes<00:04:54.380> destroying<00:04:55.380> flags<00:04:55.740> will<00:04:56.220> you<00:04:56.580> know

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
planes destroying flags will you know

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.250 
planes destroying flags will you know
massacre<00:04:57.389> in<00:04:57.479> the<00:04:57.570> enemy<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:57.960> thought<00:04:58.200> that

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
massacre in the enemy I thought that

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.440 
massacre in the enemy I thought that
that<00:04:58.470> was<00:04:58.680> one<00:04:59.460> of<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.580> best<00:04:59.910> ways<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.180> go

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
that was one of the best ways to go

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.330 
that was one of the best ways to go
about<00:05:00.479> it<00:05:00.690> I<00:05:00.960> love<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.560> fact<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:01.830> you<00:05:02.220> know

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
about it I love the fact that you know

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.879 
about it I love the fact that you know
you<00:05:02.430> could<00:05:02.700> just<00:05:03.000> keep<00:05:03.470> recycling<00:05:04.470> your

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
you could just keep recycling your

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.740 
you could just keep recycling your
killstreaks<00:05:05.400> I<00:05:05.520> thought<00:05:05.700> that<00:05:05.940> was<00:05:06.120> the<00:05:06.360> best

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
killstreaks I thought that was the best

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.450 
killstreaks I thought that was the best
thing<00:05:06.960> in<00:05:07.139> black<00:05:07.290> ops<00:05:07.440> 2<00:05:07.530> black<00:05:07.860> ops<00:05:08.040> 2<00:05:08.190> hat<00:05:08.340> by

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
by far my favorite scorestreak setup and

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.820 
by far my favorite scorestreak setup and
I'm<00:05:12.000> excited<00:05:12.389> man<00:05:12.630> i'm<00:05:12.990> excited<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.530> see<00:05:13.710> it

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
I'm excited man i'm excited to see it

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.040 
I'm excited man i'm excited to see it
returning<00:05:14.280> in<00:05:14.550> advanced<00:05:15.180> warfare<00:05:15.570> hopefully

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
returning in advanced warfare hopefully

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.180 
returning in advanced warfare hopefully
I'm<00:05:16.169> a<00:05:16.260> hundred<00:05:16.410> percent<00:05:16.530> right<00:05:16.770> here<00:05:17.010> but

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
I'm a hundred percent right here but

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.520 
I'm a hundred percent right here but
it'll<00:05:17.370> definitely<00:05:17.550> looks<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.210> be<00:05:18.330> that<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.810> if

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
it'll definitely looks to be that and if

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.930 
it'll definitely looks to be that and if
they<00:05:19.830> do<00:05:19.889> return<00:05:20.190> with<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.490> black<00:05:20.639> ops<00:05:20.789> 2

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
they do return with the black ops 2

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.370 
they do return with the black ops 2
score<00:05:21.180> system<00:05:21.360> I'm<00:05:21.690> thinking<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.139> advanced

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
score system I'm thinking that advanced

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.560 
score system I'm thinking that advanced
warfare<00:05:22.740> might<00:05:22.950> be<00:05:23.070> pretty<00:05:23.310> fun<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:24.120> me<00:05:24.300> man<00:05:24.539> I

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570 
warfare might be pretty fun to me man I

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.659 
warfare might be pretty fun to me man I
if<00:05:25.050> that's<00:05:25.260> warfare<00:05:25.620> looks<00:05:25.800> cool<00:05:26.010> we've<00:05:26.550> been

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
if that's warfare looks cool we've been

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.250 
if that's warfare looks cool we've been
asking<00:05:27.030> for<00:05:27.240> changes<00:05:27.539> in<00:05:27.600> the<00:05:27.810> multiplayer

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
asking for changes in the multiplayer

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.100 
asking for changes in the multiplayer
and<00:05:28.530> it<00:05:29.010> seems<00:05:29.310> like<00:05:29.510> advanced<00:05:30.510> warfare<00:05:30.900> is

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
and it seems like advanced warfare is

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.320 
and it seems like advanced warfare is
trying<00:05:31.590> its<00:05:31.860> taking<00:05:32.190> initiative<00:05:32.729> it's<00:05:32.970> trying

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
trying its taking initiative it's trying

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.969 
trying its taking initiative it's trying
to<00:05:33.630> make<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.020> game<00:05:34.200> different<00:05:34.440> with<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:34.860> the

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
to make the game different with all the

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.640 
to make the game different with all the
crazy<00:05:35.280> exoskeleton<00:05:36.210> suits<00:05:36.479> and<00:05:36.750> everything

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
crazy exoskeleton suits and everything

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.469 
crazy exoskeleton suits and everything
that<00:05:37.740> it's<00:05:37.889> doing<00:05:38.039> and<00:05:38.340> I<00:05:38.940> definitely<00:05:39.180> think

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
that it's doing and I definitely think

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.390 
that it's doing and I definitely think
that<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.750> score<00:05:39.990> system<00:05:40.169> is<00:05:40.560> gonna<00:05:41.280> be

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
that the score system is gonna be

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.120 
that the score system is gonna be
awesome<00:05:41.520> for<00:05:41.970> sure<00:05:42.180> one<00:05:43.080> hundo<00:05:43.500> percent<00:05:43.979> oh

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
awesome for sure one hundo percent oh

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.580 
awesome for sure one hundo percent oh
and<00:05:44.430> yeah<00:05:45.180> so<00:05:45.479> that's<00:05:45.870> pretty<00:05:46.080> much<00:05:46.169> it<00:05:46.289> that's

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
and yeah so that's pretty much it that's

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.900 
and yeah so that's pretty much it that's
really<00:05:46.889> all<00:05:47.070> I<00:05:47.099> want<00:05:47.400> to<00:05:47.460> talk<00:05:47.610> about<00:05:47.729> today
