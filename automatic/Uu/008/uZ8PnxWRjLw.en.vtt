and then you can fill in the remaining
areas<00:02:22.630> with<00:02:22.930> white<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.960> also<00:02:25.960> a<00:02:26.170> yellow

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.780 

this<00:02:44.260> is<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.440> pretty<00:02:44.770> straightforward<00:02:45.190> design

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
this is a pretty straightforward design

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.390 
this is a pretty straightforward design
it's<00:02:46.150> very<00:02:46.240> clean<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.110> crisp<00:02:47.440> there's

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
it's very clean and crisp there's

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.820 
it's very clean and crisp there's
nothing<00:02:48.790> too<00:02:49.030> complicated<00:02:49.510> about<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.080> you

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
nothing too complicated about it you

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.500 
nothing too complicated about it you
just<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.280> wait<00:02:51.520> a<00:02:51.850> little<00:02:52.150> bit<00:02:52.330> before

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
just have to wait a little bit before

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.440 
just have to wait a little bit before
each<00:02:53.080> section<00:02:53.590> dries<00:02:53.860> so<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.310> that's<00:02:55.270> gonna

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
each section dries so that that's gonna

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.510 
each section dries so that that's gonna
probably<00:02:55.660> take<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.230> most<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.740> time<00:02:56.950> but

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
probably take the most of the time but

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:16.380 
probably take the most of the time but
other<00:02:57.670> than<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.450> pretty<00:02:58.750> simple

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.380 

and<00:03:16.930> once<00:03:17.140> you're<00:03:17.410> done<00:03:17.440> filling<00:03:17.860> in<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.390> last

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
and once you're done filling in the last

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.270 
and once you're done filling in the last
section<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.320> have<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.800> let<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.100> cook

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
section you just have to let the cook

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.970 
section you just have to let the cook
the<00:03:21.640> icing<00:03:22.000> dry<00:03:22.270> and<00:03:22.660> then<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.560> can<00:03:23.740> package

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the icing dry and then you can package

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.420 
the icing dry and then you can package
these<00:03:24.430> or<00:03:24.910> give<00:03:25.390> them<00:03:25.570> as<00:03:25.690> favors<00:03:26.140> or<00:03:26.430> whatever
