you<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.280> place<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.670> cannula<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.239> you'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you want to place the cannula and you'll

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.720 
you want to place the cannula and you'll
notice<00:02:27.629> this<00:02:27.840> cannula<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:28.560> side<00:02:28.980> vented<00:02:29.459> quite

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
notice this cannula is side vented quite

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.670 
notice this cannula is side vented quite
a<00:02:29.760> bit<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.870> there's<00:02:31.019> not<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.230> lot<00:02:31.410> of<00:02:31.440> back

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
a bit so there's not a lot of back

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.199 
a bit so there's not a lot of back
pressure<00:02:32.010> that<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.340> can<00:02:32.489> develop<00:02:32.700> with<00:02:33.000> this

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
pressure that you can develop with this

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.410 
pressure that you can develop with this
I<00:02:34.400> normally<00:02:35.400> will<00:02:35.519> take<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.970> measure<00:02:36.180> this

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
I normally will take and measure this

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.880 
I normally will take and measure this
off<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:37.019> an<00:02:37.200> anodized<00:02:37.590> aluminum<00:02:38.160> block<00:02:39.890> the

off in an anodized aluminum block the
canal<00:02:41.340> I'm<00:02:41.489> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.819> do<00:02:41.970> today<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:43.140> only

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
canal I'm going to do today is only

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.320 
canal I'm going to do today is only
about<00:02:45.180> 18<00:02:45.599> millimeters<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.440> block

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
about 18 millimeters in this block

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
about 18 millimeters in this block
shortest<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.450> can<00:02:48.629> go<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.930> 10<00:02:49.140> millimeters<00:02:49.680> so

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
shortest I can go is 10 millimeters so

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.300 
shortest I can go is 10 millimeters so
I'll<00:02:49.980> put<00:02:50.159> that<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> ten<00:02:50.940> millimeter<00:02:51.150> mark

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
I'll put that to the ten millimeter mark

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.250 
I'll put that to the ten millimeter mark
then<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.610> just<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.879> little<00:02:54.120> bit<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.450> this

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
then to that just a little bit and this

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
then to that just a little bit and this
little<00:02:55.470> umbrella<00:02:55.950> cap<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.640> now<00:02:57.209> on<00:02:57.540> top<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:59.450> the

little umbrella cap is now on top of the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.050 
little umbrella cap is now on top of the
ten<00:03:00.659> millimeter<00:03:00.900> mark<00:03:01.490> you<00:03:02.490> can<00:03:02.670> bend<00:03:02.910> these

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
ten millimeter mark you can bend these

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
ten millimeter mark you can bend these
cannulas<00:03:03.660> quite<00:03:03.960> a<00:03:03.990> bit<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:04.800> if<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:04.980> want<00:03:05.190> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
cannulas quite a bit so if you want to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.170 
cannulas quite a bit so if you want to
bend<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> more

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
bend it more

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.509 
bend it more
than<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.650> certainly<00:03:07.950> can<00:03:08.219> and<00:03:08.340> get<00:03:08.430> it

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
than that you certainly can and get it

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.119 
than that you certainly can and get it
closer<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.909> 90<00:03:09.269> degrees<00:03:11.180> then<00:03:12.180> what<00:03:12.390> you'll<00:03:12.540> do

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
closer to 90 degrees then what you'll do

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.039 
closer to 90 degrees then what you'll do
is<00:03:14.129> you<00:03:14.250> will<00:03:14.280> draw<00:03:14.730> up<00:03:15.000> whatever<00:03:15.689> your

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
is you will draw up whatever your

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:22.339 
is you will draw up whatever your
irrigating<00:03:16.560> solution<00:03:17.099> is<00:03:20.840> into<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> syringe

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
irrigating solution is into the syringe

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:30.940 
irrigating solution is into the syringe
the<00:03:24.680> syringe<00:03:25.819> attaches<00:03:26.819> to<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.269> rinse<00:03:27.480> endo

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.429 

and<00:03:31.950> then<00:03:32.939> what<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.209> want<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.540> do<00:03:33.659> is<00:03:33.900> bleed

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
and then what you want to do is bleed

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.349 
and then what you want to do is bleed
out<00:03:34.620> any<00:03:34.980> excess<00:03:37.669> so<00:03:38.669> you<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:38.909> push<00:03:39.150> until

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
out any excess so you just push until

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.520 
out any excess so you just push until
you<00:03:39.599> have<00:03:39.810> liquid<00:03:40.799> flowing<00:03:41.099> out<00:03:41.280> of<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.430> tip

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
you have liquid flowing out of the tip

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.740 
you have liquid flowing out of the tip
then<00:03:43.530> you<00:03:43.739> take<00:03:44.359> whatever<00:03:45.359> quick-disconnect

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
then you take whatever quick-disconnect

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.530 
then you take whatever quick-disconnect
you<00:03:46.230> happen<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.620> use<00:03:47.000> connect<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.389> the

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
you happen to use connect it to the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.259 
you happen to use connect it to the
rinse<00:03:48.720> endo<00:03:52.310> we're<00:03:53.310> going<00:03:53.549> to<00:03:53.639> use<00:03:53.879> a

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
rinse endo we're going to use a

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.740 
rinse endo we're going to use a
previously<00:03:55.019> prepared<00:03:55.650> acrylic<00:03:56.579> block<00:03:56.909> for

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
you introduce it into the block and

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.080 
you introduce it into the block and
you'll<00:04:07.079> notice<00:04:07.260> that<00:04:07.500> once<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.829> step<00:04:08.129> on<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
you'll notice that once you step on the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:18.640 
you'll notice that once you step on the
rheostat<00:04:09.859> air<00:04:10.859> will<00:04:11.250> begin<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.489> pump

arrogance<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.620> you'd<00:05:16.800> like<00:05:16.950> to<00:05:17.130> use<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.430> can

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
arrogance that you'd like to use you can

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.750 
arrogance that you'd like to use you can
use<00:05:17.639> with<00:05:17.910> there<00:05:18.030> in<00:05:18.150> sendou<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:20.430> don't<00:05:20.639> have

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
use with there in sendou you don't have

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:21.830 
use with there in sendou you don't have
to<00:05:20.880> worry<00:05:21.030> about<00:05:21.210> getting<00:05:21.419> this<00:05:21.480> all<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> way

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
to worry about getting this all the way

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.310 
to worry about getting this all the way
down<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.440> tip<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:23.340> force<00:05:23.900> will<00:05:24.900> actually

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
down to the tip the force will actually

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.240 
down to the tip the force will actually
carry<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:26.070> arrogant<00:05:26.520> down<00:05:27.000> to<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.389> apex<00:05:27.780> and

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
carry the arrogant down to the apex and

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.340 
carry the arrogant down to the apex and
then<00:05:29.250> when<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.520> retracts<00:05:29.990> and<00:05:30.990> creates<00:05:31.260> a

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:31.350 
then when it retracts and creates a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:32.659 
then when it retracts and creates a
vacuum<00:05:31.860> it<00:05:31.950> will<00:05:32.040> actually<00:05:32.130> pull<00:05:32.550> the

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
vacuum it will actually pull the

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.940 
vacuum it will actually pull the
material<00:05:33.210> back<00:05:33.419> up<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.380> don't<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.770> to

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
material back up so you don't have to

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.320 
material back up so you don't have to
worry<00:05:35.040> about<00:05:35.070> getting<00:05:35.430> it<00:05:35.490> close<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:35.880> the<00:05:36.000> apex

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
worry about getting it close to the apex

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.690 
worry about getting it close to the apex

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.300 
into the curl of one third or the kernel
half<00:05:39.000> will<00:05:39.570> do<00:05:39.750> nicely<00:05:40.070> then<00:05:41.070> when<00:05:41.220> you're

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
half will do nicely then when you're

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.260 
half will do nicely then when you're
done<00:05:41.810> simply<00:05:42.810> remove<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.380> syringe<00:05:44.270> and

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
done simply remove the syringe and

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:50.840 
done simply remove the syringe and
you'll<00:05:45.419> flush<00:05:45.840> this<00:05:46.140> with<00:05:46.200> clean<00:05:46.650> water<00:05:49.850> take

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
you'll flush this with clean water take

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.800 
you'll flush this with clean water take
it<00:05:50.970> off<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.210> adapter<00:05:52.820> remove<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.270> cannula

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
it off the adapter remove the cannula

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.170 
it off the adapter remove the cannula
which<00:05:54.840> is<00:05:55.050> disposable<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:56.430> then<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.030> can

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
which is disposable and then you can

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.390 
which is disposable and then you can
autoclave<00:05:57.600> this<00:05:57.870> now<00:05:58.710> as<00:05:58.830> I<00:05:58.919> said<00:05:59.100> you<00:05:59.220> can<00:05:59.370> use

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 
autoclave this now as I said you can use

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.490 
autoclave this now as I said you can use
this<00:05:59.580> with<00:05:59.850> multiple<00:06:00.120> irrigants<00:06:00.930> so<00:06:01.290> if<00:06:01.380> you'd

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
this with multiple irrigants so if you'd

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.430 
this with multiple irrigants so if you'd
like<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.710> have<00:06:01.980> more<00:06:02.340> than<00:06:02.400> one<00:06:02.729> syringe<00:06:03.440> all

like to have more than one syringe all
you<00:06:04.860> have<00:06:04.979> to<00:06:05.130> do<00:06:05.250> is<00:06:05.550> draw<00:06:06.060> up<00:06:06.150> your<00:06:06.210> irrigate

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
you have to do is draw up your irrigate

you have to do is draw up your irrigate
connect<00:06:07.320> a<00:06:07.410> new<00:06:07.560> syringe<00:06:08.090> and<00:06:09.090> you<00:06:09.479> can

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
connect a new syringe and you can
