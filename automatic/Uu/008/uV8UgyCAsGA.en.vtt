Taylor 310 now both of these guitars
seemingly<00:00:38.180> are<00:00:38.480> very<00:00:39.230> much<00:00:39.440> the<00:00:39.620> same<00:00:40.300> but

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
seemingly are very much the same but

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:42.850 
seemingly are very much the same but
there<00:00:41.480> are<00:00:41.600> some<00:00:41.810> differences<00:00:42.140> that<00:00:42.320> separate

them<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:43.250> must<00:00:43.460> say<00:00:43.640> after<00:00:43.790> playing<00:00:44.180> them

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
them and I must say after playing them

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.380 
them and I must say after playing them
they<00:00:44.540> do<00:00:44.600> sound<00:00:44.989> very<00:00:45.260> different<00:00:45.710> so<00:00:46.370> what<00:00:47.300> we

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
they do sound very different so what we

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.790 
they do sound very different so what we
have<00:00:47.540> that's<00:00:47.720> similar<00:00:48.080> to<00:00:48.230> both<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.559> these
