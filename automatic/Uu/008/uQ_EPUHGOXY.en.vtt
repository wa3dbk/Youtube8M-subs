00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 these nails have made I have the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.540
 used the following items 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.559
 base camp does that fruity cream blush 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.859
 butterfly queen 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.029
 dark pink and it's good pink 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 tangling reddit is spectrum shimmer 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.029
 I have already done the deception and on this 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.859
 two to schagen occur how this jacket 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.179
 have applied 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.189
 i start cleaning my 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 nails and I do that with the scrub cutter 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.140
 and make this to though it cares 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.760
 make sure your leak stays good, however 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.960
 this I poets as well about my 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.390
 nails and also the front edge 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 you so that you can enjoy yourself there 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.260
 stay and real 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.610
 use a lint-free whatever you need for this 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.590
 because of course you don't want it there 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.360
 all fluff stays on your nails 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.550
 to hang 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 the fresh scrub that dries on you naturally 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.180
 nails and then you can do the basecoat 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.510
 apply 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.360
 apply a thin layer so that you 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.939
 go everywhere but don't leave the product 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 walk in the cuticles 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.650
 apply the basecoat well 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.790
 front of the nail so that the nail 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 is sealed this must then be 10 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.810
 seconds curing in the lamp we continue 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.490
 with the colors 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.250
 put tuttifrutti on my middle finger 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.799
 it is a bright pink color 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 this color is also quite covering and me 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 use that of a layer because below 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:45.270
 then also the 40 color comes to him 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.280
 Syria well in on the edge again 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.590
 my ring finger use shrink this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 is a muscle white color these neighbors can 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.520
 you also use for a french I mix 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.250
 hours and actually I do not like him 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 very nice to be alone on the nails 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.119
 because there is much he could do 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 white for it becomes a bit tippex 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.119
 behind 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.130
 but the glitter there because I 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.369
 go over it on the powders 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.840
 it looks really nice and then 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.500
 white is a very good one again 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.500
 base 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.320
 and these colors must be two minutes 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060
 cure in the lamp 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.070
 then I put this on my middle finger 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.370
 glitter and the pink color 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.350
 this is butterfly queen in this is real 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.600
 very beautiful glittering 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.640
 in itself it is also a beautiful but me 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.340
 bring a thin second 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:41.740
 layer over and I apply another 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:43.480
 second layer of the white color and 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.310
 this goes on again for two minutes 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.650
 lamps 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.440
 I apply an extra layer of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.420
 glitter color then he is just 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.730
 more covering and then you see the 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.470
 glitter even better 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.240
 and this again goes on for two minutes 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.190
 lamp 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.410
 then it's time for the rescue tips 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.530
 these are glitter powders i have a pink one 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.360
 and a little yes white glittering 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.709
 and apply directly over which is white 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.570
 rich the 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.150
 shellac that paste now because it is still 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.950
 an adhesive layer and in it that could 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.390
 then stay well has 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.890
 keep sticking 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.330
 I gently apply it with a brush 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.130
 to 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.630
 I want to make one like on my thumb 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.430
 that I have a bit of an overflow 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.640
 from the rose to the white and then bring 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.340
 I am still a member of this 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.970
 she just has to be on the edge here and so 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.630
 you will put the glitter powder in the wet 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.630
 sticky layer of the gel 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.519
 just do this a little by feeling 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.580
 just what you like 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.709
 then I apply the white or the yes 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.959
 these silver are very many different 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.760
 glitter and I put it on it 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:54.340
 white area 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.500
 and yes you must remember barend 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.000
 but no powder is stuck there yet 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.260
 that the pink part that stick now 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.720
 of course not anymore because there 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.510
 powder is already there you can have one 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.190
 go a little bit over and with the top 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.209
 The kit will be coat anyway 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.459
 keep sticking 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.440
 so make sure you just go along well 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:17.320
 edges goes wherever it sticks 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:20.260
 now apply the glitter and the powder and 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.430
 i want the white not super white i 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.169
 wants a little bit of pink 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.180
 so that's why I go through it a bit 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.680
 pink and then over the white as you 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.590
 sees that the white is also a small one 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.789
 little more pink discoloration I like 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.460
 because otherwise you really have such a typical one 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:37.340
 effect and if you think it's good 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.009
 then the still can get over it 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.740
 the marbles of that pink color that give 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.449
 not finished so you can just put it in you 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.750
 top coat without having to worry 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.940
 are that the fit it's income but the 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.970
 glitter of the editing sister of that 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.070
 powder that always give off I grab 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.220
 who will be the special top coat that I have 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.919
 use for the glitter powders 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.289
 so I have a top coat that simply 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.830
 there is no feel for the normal colors 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:08.210
 it is in it and one that is yes 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.199
 can be used for glitter powders 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.419
 to become 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.860
 now we just have the same top coat because 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.210
 I wouldn't mind if there was one 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.039
 few clots 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.690
 would come that other color but 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.970
 normal use there so just one 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.150
 separate top coat care and this is all about 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.910
 again for two minutes in the UV lamp 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.389
 remove the sticky layer with alcohol and 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.389
 then they are ready
