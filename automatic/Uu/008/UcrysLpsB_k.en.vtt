00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.850
 ah 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.350
 to the people of youtube here is a new 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.210
 video tutorial this time I'm going to 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.040
 teach how to use the procampo program 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.410
 this works to manage the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.730
 3 battlefield servers remember 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.189
 to be able to continue with this tutorial 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.320
 they should see the previous video where they 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.360
 I explain how to create the server of the 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.529
 correct form ok 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.750
 once our server is 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.869
 when we walk we open the program and we give 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:32.200
 add server where it says hot ip 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.360
 We place local host if our server 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.950
 is hosted on our same pc will be 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.650
 hosted a bps or another computer 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:41.730
 we must place the ip of that pc and open 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.430
 the ports in the corresponding place 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.580
 this support then in password we must 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.260
 place the ones that we put to administer 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.480
 a server since it was password 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.180
 administration thinks that we put in 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.070
 the most point file 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.170
 once placed we connect 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.930
 As you can see here, the map that 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.450
 is running the name of the server 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.350
 and then here we select the server 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.350
 from the same wall 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.900
 in this first section of the players 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.150
 we will see the list of 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.310
 players that are within the game 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.140
 then we have the chat that is where 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.480
 We can send messages to all 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.430
 players and all the teams here we 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.440
 lets see which team we want to reach 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.860
 be the American Russian or to all 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.860
 players 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.720
 then we have the events screen that 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.750
 more or less I do not know very well or function I 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.520
 I will not touch anything often we have the 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.220
 management part where we can from 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.020
 realistic bathed the server the list 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.780
 of map rotation list that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.530
 It works in the following way 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.460
 we select a part 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.070
 to this the left side that shows us 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.259
 the type of map the name of the map and the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.390
 name of the file we are not simply 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.000
 we apply in one of them and we give 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.890
 pass this list before giving here 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.330
 we can here add the amount of 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.650
 rounds you want to play the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.930
 users on this map 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.140
 and then we have the part of those of 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.900
 reserved that according to the 1030 of the game 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.129
 It does not work but you can try it 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.770
 adding your nick here and we give 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.840
 add it 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.330
 supposedly it should already be our 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.800
 reserved then we have the section 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.720
 server that is the most important of 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.540
 everyone here we are going to configure the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.040
 basic details of the server here as 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.230
 can see we can add the name of the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.960
 server always remember to apply 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.590
 here what has inscription 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.260
 then a message for the players and the 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.970
 url of the win to me it was very good is 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:56.420
 I was cut off 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:00.110
 but also the measures that always 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.700
 apply then we go to configuration and 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.270
 here we can move other continuations 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.270
 of the human being 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.650
 the limit of players my activities 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.730
 booster that for some reason take us away 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.670
 turn it off and other observables 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.560
 and then we have the gameplay section 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.310
 here we can make several changes about 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.140
 the game with friendly fire the map 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.920
 so that the game is left with more 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.430
 alcohol and here we have some 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.850
 or already pre-designed 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.700
 for 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.220
 for the game as you see it applies 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.770
 which for the loop mode are already 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.770
 created we'll just leave in normal 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.099
 always remember to apply 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.660
 then we have new friend here we can 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.190
 configure the basic productions by 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.470
 fire kidnapping friend and disable 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.140
 cortical punishment disable options 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.750
 advanced and among other things remember 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.400
 always give to apply and finally 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.190
 we have a configuration swimmer that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 is the most important thing of all once 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.730
 we have configured on our server 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.709
 perfectly will generate this 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.019
 code which we are going to give here 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.330
 copy to the clipboard once inside 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.880
 from the folder we're going to face 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.829
 what is called instance within us 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.900
 we go there and we are going to open the file 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.500
 start 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.870
 inside we are going to copy everything that we 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.210
 we brought the trauma prokom as you see now 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.470
 I have it all copied a lot more have 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.960
 been asking with mini be a 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.330
 game with less than four players already 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.340
 that will grow by default comes 4 and the 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.720
 product does not let it change to less than 4 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.690
 we go here line 39 that says roll 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.039
 star 'player const 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.169
 by default the product is not going to have 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:52.880
 in 4 you will put it in 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.880
 always remember to keep the values 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.160
 once they have done that the map 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.570
 it will be ready 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.550
 to work or be the configurations 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.720
 from the center and we can start the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.940
 server without any problem 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.860
 then we have the complement section in 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.720
 the portal that serves to add some 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.760
 plugins to give them more functions of 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.220
 server so far I have the 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.590
 basic plugins 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.570
 finally we have what would be the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.790
 minister the administrators and the 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.430
 console and here we can see what is 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:29.040
 happening on the server all that is 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:31.560
 everything in itself what this one serves the thing 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.120
 with friends this is all I hope you 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.890
