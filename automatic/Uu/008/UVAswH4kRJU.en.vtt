00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
a lot of people who say they don't know

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
what they're doing until it evolves I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:53.910 
what they're doing until it evolves I
must<00:00:37.020> see<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.130> as<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.690> as<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.750> composition

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.400 

it's<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.040> mixture

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
it's a mixture

starting with disuse tarted did you
start<00:01:10.130> this<00:01:10.450> incision<00:01:11.450> from<00:01:12.320> drum<00:01:19.600> because<00:01:20.600> I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
start this incision from drum because I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.350 
start this incision from drum because I
think<00:01:20.960> watercolor<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.640> more<00:01:23.000> of<00:01:23.240> a

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
think watercolor is more of a

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:30.730 
think watercolor is more of a
translation<00:01:24.520> but<00:01:25.520> either

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.420 

it<00:01:31.220> is<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:32.170> very<00:01:33.170> particular<00:01:33.440> language

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
it is a very particular language

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.600 
it is a very particular language
everyone<00:01:35.270> really<00:01:35.570> languages<00:01:36.080> but<00:01:36.680> you<00:01:36.979> really

everyone really languages but you really

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.280 
everyone really languages but you really
do<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:38.119> to<00:01:38.180> turn<00:01:38.570> it<00:01:38.750> into<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.410> language

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
do have to turn it into the language

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.910 
do have to turn it into the language
when<00:01:42.290> I'm<00:01:42.470> working<00:01:42.950> on<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.369> spot<00:01:44.500> such<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.530> big

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
a start to finish in the studio then it

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.160 
a start to finish in the studio then it
came<00:03:25.170> back<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:26.160> reckoned<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.630> come<00:03:27.870> back

with enough starts job provide the
winter<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:33.180> was<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> idea<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.370> we'd<00:03:35.579> go<00:03:35.850> with

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
winter that was the idea so we'd go with

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.470 
winter that was the idea so we'd go with
40<00:03:37.110> panels<00:03:37.560> perhaps<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.400> back<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> car

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:59.320 

yes<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:35.500> it's<00:04:36.500> very<00:04:36.800> useful<00:04:58.000> if<00:04:59.000> you<00:04:59.060> went

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
yes and it's very useful if you went

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:00.430 
yes and it's very useful if you went
back<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.510> teach<00:04:59.810> you<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.139> think<00:05:00.260> there's

I<00:05:05.540> think<00:05:05.750> drawing<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:07.040> absorb<00:05:07.550> far<00:05:08.540> more<00:05:08.870> than

I think drawing you absorb far more than
you<00:05:09.320> know<00:05:09.790> because<00:05:13.120> gives<00:05:14.120> you<00:05:14.270> time<00:05:14.600> to<00:05:14.930> solve

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
you know because gives you time to solve

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.610 
you know because gives you time to solve
