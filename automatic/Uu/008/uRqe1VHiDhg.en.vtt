00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you know they're pretty close to on the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.200 
you know they're pretty close to on the
color<00:01:03.989> wheel<00:01:04.050> if<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.440> look<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> color<00:01:04.980> wheel

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
color wheel if you look at a color wheel

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.150 
color wheel if you look at a color wheel
it's<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.960> got<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> primary<00:01:07.590> colors<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
it's you got the primary colors and

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.580 
it's you got the primary colors and
secondary<00:01:08.850> colors<00:01:09.000> usually<00:01:09.720> primary<00:01:10.440> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
secondary colors usually primary and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
secondary colors usually primary and
secondary<00:01:10.770> colors<00:01:11.370> go<00:01:11.820> well<00:01:12.030> with<00:01:12.180> each<00:01:12.390> other

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
secondary colors go well with each other

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
secondary colors go well with each other
so<00:01:12.870> you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.590> mix<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> match<00:01:14.540> you<00:01:15.540> know

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so you know just mix and match you know

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.870 
so you know just mix and match you know
another<00:01:15.870> rug<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.770> would<00:01:17.100> look<00:01:17.220> good<00:01:17.400> would

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
another rug that would look good would

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
another rug that would look good would
be<00:01:18.060> blue<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.420> cyan<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:19.680> would<00:01:19.800> be<00:01:19.890> also<00:01:20.040> good

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
be blue and cyan that would be also good

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.270 
be blue and cyan that would be also good
so<00:01:21.210> yeah<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.540> experiment<00:01:22.140> with<00:01:22.290> different

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so yeah just experiment with different

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.310 
so yeah just experiment with different
types<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.120> rugs<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.570> stuff<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.050> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
types of rugs and stuff like that and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.050 
types of rugs and stuff like that and
you'll<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:26.040> make<00:01:26.190> your<00:01:26.310> house<00:01:26.460> look<00:01:26.490> good

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
you'll will make your house look good

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.080 
you'll will make your house look good
so<00:01:27.600> yeah<00:01:28.080> example<00:01:28.860> 2<00:01:29.010> is<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.340> realistic<00:01:29.670> rook

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
so yeah example 2 is the realistic rook

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
so yeah example 2 is the realistic rook
now<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.260> see<00:01:31.410> here<00:01:31.620> it's<00:01:31.740> just<00:01:31.890> plain<00:01:32.280> snow

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
torches so you have to put them a little

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.260 
torches so you have to put them a little
bit<00:01:40.590> farther<00:01:40.830> away<00:01:41.040> say<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> put<00:01:42.000> them<00:01:42.150> on

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
bit farther away say if you put them on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.600 
bit farther away say if you put them on
the<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:43.080> know<00:01:43.170> tops<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.770> bookshelf<00:01:44.280> here

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
the you know tops of this bookshelf here

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.540 
the you know tops of this bookshelf here
in<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.120> little<00:01:45.330> corners<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.560> would<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.830> okay<00:01:47.070> but

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
in a little corners it would be okay but

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.480 
in a little corners it would be okay but
if<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.240> had<00:01:48.540> say<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.380> torch<00:01:49.770> right<00:01:49.980> here<00:01:50.310> it

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
if you had say a torch right here it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.360 
if you had say a torch right here it
would<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.300> know<00:01:51.420> melt<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.960> snow<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.590> there

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
would you know melt the snow and there

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
would you know melt the snow and there
goes<00:01:53.670> your<00:01:53.700> rug<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:56.100> realistic<00:01:56.700> rug<00:01:57.150> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
goes your rug so the realistic rug that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.570 
goes your rug so the realistic rug that
I'm<00:01:57.510> going<00:01:57.720> for<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.320> see<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:59.070> you

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
I'm going for as you can see it is you

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
I'm going for as you can see it is you
know<00:01:59.730> a<00:02:00.860> little<00:02:01.860> bit<00:02:02.010> above<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.360> floor<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:05.600> it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
know a little bit above the floor now it

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.089 
know a little bit above the floor now it
gives<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.050> kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.410> little<00:02:07.470> bit<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.740> depth

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
gives it kind of a little bit of depth

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.919 
gives it kind of a little bit of depth
