computer but I think that's isn't this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.290 
computer but I think that's isn't this
is<00:04:20.459> not<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.820> safe<00:04:21.180> idea<00:04:21.450> so<00:04:22.229> in<00:04:22.530> my<00:04:23.430> opinion<00:04:23.580> just

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
is not a safe idea so in my opinion just

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.480 
is not a safe idea so in my opinion just
downloaded<00:04:24.750> from<00:04:24.930> game<00:04:25.169> front<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.740> it<00:04:25.950> should

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
downloaded from game front and it should

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.589 
downloaded from game front and it should
be<00:04:26.520> all<00:04:26.729> fine<00:04:27.000> now<00:04:28.640> this<00:04:29.640> reps<00:04:29.909> version<00:04:30.330> do<00:04:30.450> not

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
be all fine now this reps version do not

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.210 
be all fine now this reps version do not
have<00:04:30.750> that<00:04:30.900> many<00:04:31.110> players<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:31.770> I<00:04:31.800> think<00:04:32.130> in

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
have that many players but I think in

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.950 
have that many players but I think in
the<00:04:32.310> next<00:04:32.370> few<00:04:32.700> weeks<00:04:32.970> there<00:04:33.270> are<00:04:33.330> will<00:04:33.720> come
