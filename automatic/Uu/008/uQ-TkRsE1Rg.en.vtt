new it's an idea that I've had for a
while<00:00:18.419> I<00:00:18.779> think<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.110> could<00:00:19.200> be<00:00:19.230> quite<00:00:19.470> fun

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890

where basically what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
where basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:22.020> into<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.320> App<00:00:22.470> Store<00:00:22.860> and<00:00:23.039> try<00:00:23.250> and

app<00:00:25.829> games<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> play<00:00:26.399> so<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.059> don't<00:00:27.300> have<00:00:27.419> to

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
app games to play so you don't have to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.359 
app games to play so you don't have to
be<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.380> thought<00:00:28.770> it<00:00:28.919> would<00:00:29.040> be<00:00:29.160> only

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
be I thought it would be only

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.569 
be I thought it would be only
appropriate<00:00:30.349> you<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.529> me<00:00:31.680> it<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.219> only<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
appropriate you get me it would only be

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.160 
appropriate you get me it would only be
appropriate<00:00:32.879> if<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.329> actually<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.930> with

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
appropriate if we actually start with

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.750 
appropriate if we actually start with
some<00:00:34.440> kind<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.920> minecraft<00:00:35.460> style

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
some kind of like minecraft style

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.729 
some kind of like minecraft style

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.009 
around if you want to solos da da da da
you<00:02:11.519> spin<00:02:11.790> him<00:02:11.819> around<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.329> can<00:02:12.480> fly<00:02:12.780> them<00:02:12.930> up

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
you spin him around you can fly them up

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:14.960 
you spin him around you can fly them up
in<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.230> air<00:02:13.319> you<00:02:13.500> could<00:02:13.650> drop<00:02:13.860> him<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.189> he

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
in the air you could drop him and he

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.819 
in the air you could drop him and he
falls<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.390> super<00:02:15.840> gracefully<00:02:16.439> which<00:02:16.680> is

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:16.829 
falls like super gracefully which is

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.960 
falls like super gracefully which is
really<00:02:17.250> really<00:02:17.459> bizarre

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
really really bizarre

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.150 
really really bizarre
so<00:02:18.300> other<00:02:18.810> than<00:02:19.110> doing<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> all

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
so other than doing this which is all

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.040 
so other than doing this which is all
that<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> game<00:02:20.610> really<00:02:21.030> offers<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.720> can<00:02:21.900> also

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
that the game really offers you can also

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.970 
that the game really offers you can also
if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.500> tap<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> screen

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
if you tap the screen

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.670 
if you tap the screen
fire<00:02:24.819> stuff<00:02:25.210> at<00:02:25.360> him<00:02:25.510> every<00:02:25.960> time<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.380> hit<00:02:26.530> him

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
fire stuff at him every time you hit him

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.170 
fire stuff at him every time you hit him
with<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.890> projectile<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.670> get<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.880> dollar

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
with the projectile you get a dollar

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.600 
with the projectile you get a dollar
basically<00:02:29.080> so<00:02:29.500> if<00:02:29.800> we<00:02:29.920> keep<00:02:30.069> firing<00:02:30.400> them<00:02:30.520> we

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
basically so if we keep firing them we

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.090 
basically so if we keep firing them we
can<00:02:30.730> do<00:02:30.819> this<00:02:30.940> hang<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.209> watch<00:02:31.740> there<00:02:32.740> we<00:02:32.830> go<00:02:32.980> we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
can do this hang a watch there we go we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.350 
can do this hang a watch there we go we
can<00:02:33.130> find<00:02:33.370> loads<00:02:33.550> loads<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.910> arrows<00:02:34.209> at<00:02:34.330> him

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
can find loads loads of arrows at him

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.360 
can find loads loads of arrows at him
and<00:02:34.630> we<00:02:34.900> can<00:02:35.050> earn<00:02:35.170> dollars<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.830> then<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> top

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
and we can earn dollars and then the top

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.680 
and we can earn dollars and then the top
right-hand<00:02:36.580> corner<00:02:36.760> here<00:02:37.000> you've<00:02:37.390> got<00:02:37.569> like

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
played already here I only downloaded

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.780 
played already here I only downloaded
like<00:03:08.620> an<00:03:08.769> hour<00:03:08.920> ago<00:03:09.070> but<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.340> have<00:03:09.459> been<00:03:09.580> playing

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
like an hour ago but I have been playing

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.920 
like an hour ago but I have been playing
a<00:03:09.910> little<00:03:10.000> bit<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:10.300> pretty<00:03:10.540> good<00:03:10.720> it's

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
called wakka slime and it's essentially

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.640 
called wakka slime and it's essentially
like<00:03:13.209> whack-a-mole<00:03:13.570> but<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> Minecraft

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650

have to unlock these different levels by
gaining<00:03:18.160> slime<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.150> it<00:03:19.360> will<00:03:19.480> stuff<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.840> stage

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
gaining slime so it will stuff and stage
