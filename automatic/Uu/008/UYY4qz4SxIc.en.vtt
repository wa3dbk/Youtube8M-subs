00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.830 
getting that much of a spring there's
probably<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.530> dip<00:02:15.769> before<00:02:15.920> you<00:02:16.670> know<00:02:16.790> a

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
probably a dip before you know a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.190 
probably a dip before you know a
multiplex<00:02:17.840> worth<00:02:17.959> they<00:02:18.110> have<00:02:18.290> cut<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:20.200> remember

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
multiplex worth they have cut I remember

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.140 
multiplex worth they have cut I remember
one<00:02:21.319> game<00:02:21.500> just<00:02:21.769> recently<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.640> think<00:02:22.849> I<00:02:23.000> was<00:02:23.090> in

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
one game just recently I think I was in

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300 
one game just recently I think I was in
autumn<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.690> think<00:02:23.930> there<00:02:24.140> was<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.890> lot<00:02:25.129> of

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
autumn I think there was just a lot of

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.330 
autumn I think there was just a lot of
teams<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.790> booing<00:02:26.540> or<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:27.440> cheering<00:02:28.190> or

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
teams just booing or there cheering or

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910 
teams just booing or there cheering or
not<00:02:29.150> even<00:02:29.329> cheering<00:02:29.569> but<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.870> motor<00:02:30.590> started

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
not even cheering but like motor started

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.640 
not even cheering but like motor started
singing<00:02:31.220> another<00:02:31.610> song<00:02:31.760> whatever<00:02:32.299> I<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.349> you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
singing another song whatever I like you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.130 
singing another song whatever I like you
know<00:02:33.799> it's<00:02:34.060> it's<00:02:35.060> only<00:02:35.209> two<00:02:35.599> minutes<00:02:35.989> or

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
know it's it's only two minutes or

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.300 
know it's it's only two minutes or
thirty<00:02:36.470> seconds<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.269> just<00:02:38.269> before<00:02:38.569> match<00:02:38.780> and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
thirty seconds of just before match and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.860 
thirty seconds of just before match and
I<00:02:40.310> guess<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> opposition<00:02:41.359> team<00:02:41.540> don't

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
I guess the opposition team don't

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.780 
I guess the opposition team don't
opposed<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.280> think<00:02:43.459> it's<00:02:43.579> quite<00:02:43.670> a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
opposed to it and I think it's quite a

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.009 
opposed to it and I think it's quite a
traditional<00:02:44.299> thing<00:02:44.510> that's<00:02:44.690> been<00:02:44.870> happening

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
traditional thing that's been happening

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.589 
traditional thing that's been happening
for<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:45.470> many<00:02:45.650> years<00:02:47.799> past<00:02:48.799> players<00:02:49.040> before

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
for so many years past players before

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.729 
for so many years past players before
someone's<00:02:50.599> haven't<00:02:50.900> done<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.250> there's<00:02:52.250> any

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
someone's haven't done it there's any

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.440 
someone's haven't done it there's any
problems<00:02:54.739> about<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.609> so<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.299> know

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
problems about it in there so you know

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.530 
problems about it in there so you know
they<00:02:57.410> hub<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.430> think<00:02:58.910> it's<00:02:59.060> a<00:02:59.150> good<00:02:59.269> thing<00:02:59.329> you
