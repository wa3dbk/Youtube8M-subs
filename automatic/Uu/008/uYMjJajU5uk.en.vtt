00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
say I have concluded that these are the

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700

best earbuds you can buy I say this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920 
best earbuds you can buy I say this
because<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.490> mids<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> highs<00:01:36.420> are

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
because the mids and the highs are

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.740 
because the mids and the highs are
absolutely<00:01:37.799> amazing<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.270> bass<00:01:39.479> is

pretty good but it's not as good as in
mitts<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.909> highs<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> some<00:01:43.560> headphones<00:01:43.770> will

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
mitts and highs but some headphones will

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.609 
mitts and highs but some headphones will
focus<00:01:44.520> mostly<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.240> bass<00:01:45.420> but<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:46.170> focus

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619
