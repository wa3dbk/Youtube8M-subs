think<00:03:16.980> they're<00:03:17.340> going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> try<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.700> get<00:03:17.850> ready

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
think they're going to try to get ready

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.599 
think they're going to try to get ready
for<00:03:18.180> hyper<00:03:18.630> skills<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.859> third<00:03:20.100> job<00:03:20.340> will<00:03:20.519> be

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
for hyper skills so third job will be

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.180 
for hyper skills so third job will be
reduced<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.150> believe<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.690> level<00:03:21.900> 60<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.620> forth

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
reduced I believe to level 60 and forth

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.690 
reduced I believe to level 60 and forth
job<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.639> either<00:03:23.760> 110<00:03:24.389> or<00:03:24.569> 100<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.859> really<00:03:26.280> huge

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
job to either 110 or 100 is really huge

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.520 
job to either 110 or 100 is really huge
and<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.239> going<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.420> bring<00:03:27.660> down<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.349> level

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
and it's going to bring down the level

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.960 
and it's going to bring down the level
requirements<00:03:29.130> going<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.400> easier<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.880> get

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
requirements going to be easier to get

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.479 
requirements going to be easier to get
to<00:03:30.120> third<00:03:30.329> job<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.900> forth<00:03:31.290> job<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:32.340> was

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
to third job and forth job it was

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.129 
to third job and forth job it was
already<00:03:32.819> pretty<00:03:33.150> easy<00:03:33.480> but<00:03:33.810> now<00:03:33.989> they're

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
already pretty easy but now they're

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.930 
already pretty easy but now they're
going<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.319> make<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.530> easier<00:03:35.010> but<00:03:35.549> like<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.880> said

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
going to make it easier but like I said

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.580 
going to make it easier but like I said
I<00:03:36.180> think<00:03:36.299> they're<00:03:36.720> going<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:37.079> prepared<00:03:37.470> to

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
I think they're going to be prepared to

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.710 
I think they're going to be prepared to
bring<00:03:37.889> out<00:03:38.040> hyper<00:03:38.489> skills<00:03:38.910> now<00:03:39.359> go<00:03:39.540> ahead<00:03:39.569> and

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
ahead and be really powerful now I

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.120 
ahead and be really powerful now I
remember<00:04:03.480> when<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.630> was<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.930> huge<00:04:04.470> issue<00:04:04.680> back

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
remember when that was a huge issue back

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.789 
remember when that was a huge issue back
then<00:04:05.370> when<00:04:05.849> players<00:04:06.180> cannot<00:04:06.720> go<00:04:07.019> luckless<00:04:07.560> or

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
then when players cannot go luckless or

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.099 
then when players cannot go luckless or
strengthless<00:04:08.519> because<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.239> would<00:04:09.389> cost<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.840> lot

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
strengthless because it would cost a lot

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.720 
strengthless because it would cost a lot
of<00:04:10.260> mesos<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.829> had<00:04:10.919> to<00:04:10.980> be<00:04:11.040> really<00:04:11.250> funded

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
of mesos and you had to be really funded

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.309 
of mesos and you had to be really funded
in<00:04:11.880> order<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.569> do<00:04:12.690> that<00:04:12.870> because<00:04:13.079> you'd<00:04:13.260> have

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
in order to do that because you'd have

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.440 
in order to do that because you'd have
to<00:04:13.470> buy<00:04:13.590> real<00:04:13.799> expensive<00:04:14.130> equips<00:04:14.609> to<00:04:15.090> make<00:04:15.269> up

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
to buy real expensive equips to make up

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.449 
to buy real expensive equips to make up
your<00:04:15.599> luckless<00:04:15.900> or<00:04:16.320> your<00:04:16.650> strength<00:04:16.889> lists<00:04:17.340> or

your luckless or your strength lists or

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
really interesting and I'm really

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.979 
really interesting and I'm really
interested<00:04:20.729> to<00:04:21.000> see<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.450> they<00:04:21.570> do<00:04:21.630> with<00:04:21.780> the

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
interested to see what they do with the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.779 
interested to see what they do with the
maple<00:04:22.169> weapons<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:22.890> remember<00:04:23.250> maple

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
maple weapons because I remember maple

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.210 
maple weapons because I remember maple
weapons<00:04:24.060> used<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.330> be<00:04:24.419> really<00:04:24.630> popular

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
weapons used to be really popular

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.650 
weapons used to be really popular
because<00:04:25.430> that<00:04:25.940> would<00:04:26.060> be<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.270> weapon<00:04:26.390> you

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
because that would be the weapon you

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.990 
because that would be the weapon you
would<00:04:26.780> use<00:04:27.020> if<00:04:27.260> your<00:04:27.380> your<00:04:28.100> secondary<00:04:28.700> stat

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
would use if your your secondary stat

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.550 
would use if your your secondary stat
list<00:04:29.270> because<00:04:29.600> they<00:04:29.930> don't<00:04:30.080> require<00:04:30.380> your

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
list because they don't require your

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.250 
list because they don't require your
secondary<00:04:30.950> stat<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:31.820> now<00:04:32.120> it's<00:04:32.360> gonna<00:04:32.510> have

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
secondary stat so now it's gonna have

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.140

if<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.470> saw<00:05:18.770> hyper<00:05:19.070> skills<00:05:19.430> come<00:05:19.610> out<00:05:19.700> with<00:05:19.850> this

if I saw hyper skills come out with this

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.490 
if I saw hyper skills come out with this
update<00:05:20.180> or<00:05:20.540> at<00:05:20.690> least<00:05:20.870> at<00:05:20.990> the<00:05:21.080> end<00:05:21.320> of<00:05:21.410> this

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
update or at least at the end of this

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.830 
update or at least at the end of this
update<00:05:21.919> maybe<00:05:22.430> at<00:05:22.580> the<00:05:22.730> beginning<00:05:23.030> of<00:05:23.300> january

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
update maybe at the beginning of january

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.020 
update maybe at the beginning of january
or<00:05:23.930> so<00:05:24.230> just<00:05:24.710> because<00:05:24.860> they<00:05:25.190> reduce<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:25.760> level

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
or so just because they reduce the level

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.880 
or so just because they reduce the level
requirements<00:05:26.600> already<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.350> i<00:05:27.380> think<00:05:27.530> that

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
requirements already so i think that

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.560 
requirements already so i think that
they<00:05:27.980> might<00:05:28.010> try<00:05:28.460> to<00:05:28.550> get<00:05:28.730> prepared<00:05:28.940> for<00:05:29.450> some

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
they might try to get prepared for some

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.230 
they might try to get prepared for some
hyper<00:05:29.780> skills<00:05:30.140> or<00:05:30.980> maybe<00:05:31.370> in<00:05:31.640> the<00:05:31.760> next<00:05:31.910> patch

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
hyper skills or maybe in the next patch

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.390 
hyper skills or maybe in the next patch
but<00:05:32.510> it's<00:05:32.660> coming<00:05:32.810> out<00:05:33.020> pretty<00:05:33.290> soon<00:05:33.470> so<00:05:34.370> that

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
but it's coming out pretty soon so that

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.220 
but it's coming out pretty soon so that
pretty<00:05:34.700> much<00:05:34.820> does<00:05:35.210> it<00:05:35.270> for<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.810> luminous

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:36.230
