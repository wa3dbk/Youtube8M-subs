in<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:01.170> video<00:00:01.500> I'm<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:01.979> to<00:00:02.040> show<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.310> how

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
in this video I'm going to show you how

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:16.630 
in this video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:02.580> make<00:00:02.820> miniature<00:00:03.300> food<00:00:03.689> from<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.589> out

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.300 

I<00:00:19.660> made<00:00:20.660> templates<00:00:21.230> for<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:21.470> packaging<00:00:22.070> and

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
I made templates for the packaging and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.860 
I made templates for the packaging and
you<00:00:22.370> can<00:00:22.580> find<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:22.940> link<00:00:23.180> to<00:00:23.240> them<00:00:23.480> in<00:00:23.690> the

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:23.870 
you can find the link to them in the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.430 
you can find the link to them in the
description<00:00:23.900> box<00:00:24.530> I<00:00:25.570> started<00:00:26.570> out<00:00:26.690> by<00:00:26.930> copying

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.440 
description box I started out by copying

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.560 
description box I started out by copying
and<00:00:27.650> pasting<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.400> templates<00:00:28.820> into<00:00:29.270> a<00:00:29.300> Word

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
and pasting the templates into a Word

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.340 
and pasting the templates into a Word
document

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:30.350 
document

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.280 
document
you<00:00:30.770> can<00:00:30.950> also<00:00:31.160> use<00:00:31.580> anything<00:00:32.150> like<00:00:32.330> text<00:00:32.930> edit

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
you can also use anything like text edit

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.110 
you can also use anything like text edit
and<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:34.100> just<00:00:34.250> want<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.489> resize<00:00:34.910> the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
and you just want to resize the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.030 
and you just want to resize the
templates<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:35.690> they<00:00:35.809> are<00:00:35.870> small<00:00:36.290> or<00:00:36.650> you<00:00:36.920> can

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
templates so they are small or you can

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.920 
templates so they are small or you can
make<00:00:37.160> them<00:00:37.309> larger<00:00:37.520> just<00:00:38.030> depending<00:00:38.510> on<00:00:38.540> what

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
make them larger just depending on what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.470 
make them larger just depending on what
you're<00:00:39.379> going<00:00:39.470> to<00:00:39.559> use<00:00:39.770> them<00:00:39.920> for

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.170 

I<00:00:44.510> find<00:00:45.350> that<00:00:45.559> it's<00:00:45.739> helpful<00:00:46.040> to<00:00:46.220> print<00:00:46.730> a<00:00:46.940> test

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
I find that it's helpful to print a test

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.000 
I find that it's helpful to print a test
page<00:00:47.329> where<00:00:47.809> you<00:00:47.899> have<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.110> lot<00:00:48.470> of<00:00:48.500> different

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
page where you have a lot of different

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.000 
page where you have a lot of different
sizes<00:00:49.400> of<00:00:49.840> each<00:00:50.840> template<00:00:51.290> on<00:00:51.470> it<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:51.800> you<00:00:51.860> can

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
sizes of each template on it so you can

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.890 
sizes of each template on it so you can
see<00:00:52.280> which<00:00:52.850> is<00:00:53.210> better<00:00:53.600> than<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.989> other<00:00:54.199> and

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
see which is better than the other and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.260 
see which is better than the other and
now<00:00:56.900> I'm<00:00:57.050> just<00:00:57.260> cutting<00:00:57.620> out<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:58.280> gluing<00:00:59.030> all

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
now I'm just cutting out and gluing all

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.140 
now I'm just cutting out and gluing all
the<00:00:59.629> little<00:00:59.870> Berger<00:01:00.680> papers<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.160> fry<00:01:01.699> container

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
the little Berger papers a fry container

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:17.650 
the little Berger papers a fry container
the<00:01:02.449> cups<00:01:02.720> all<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.230> that<00:01:03.379> together

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.960 

for<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.960> milkshakes<00:01:19.440> or<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.190> little<00:01:20.430> cups<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for the milkshakes or the little cups I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.630 
for the milkshakes or the little cups I
just<00:01:21.480> cut<00:01:22.050> out<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.320> template<00:01:22.770> rounded<00:01:23.520> them

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just cut out the template rounded them

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.450 
just cut out the template rounded them
so<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.420> glue<00:01:25.320> together<00:01:25.620> easily<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so that they glue together easily and

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.230 
so that they glue together easily and
then<00:01:27.090> once<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.230> glue<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.620> set<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.130> put<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> some

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
then once the glue is set I put in some

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.660 
then once the glue is set I put in some
translucent<00:01:30.900> clay<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.920> kind<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.160> fill<00:01:32.370> up<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
translucent clay to kind of fill up the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.930 
translucent clay to kind of fill up the
cup<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.150> then<00:01:33.870> I<00:01:34.200> baked<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.160> cup<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.910> the

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
cup and then I baked the cup with the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.990 
cup and then I baked the cup with the
clay<00:01:36.270> inside<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.080> and<00:01:37.290> then<00:01:38.250> after<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> did

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
clay inside of it and then after I did

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.540 
clay inside of it and then after I did
that<00:01:39.030> I<00:01:39.330> made<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.900> straw<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.500> glue<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
that I made a little straw and glue the

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.930 
that I made a little straw and glue the
straw<00:01:41.850> into<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.480> cup

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.520 

you<00:01:47.940> should<00:01:48.150> definitely<00:01:48.480> bake<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.260> straw

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you should definitely bake the straw

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.290 
you should definitely bake the straw
before<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.190> pull<00:01:50.370> it<00:01:50.460> into<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> cup<00:01:51.030> because

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
before you pull it into the cup because

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.410 
before you pull it into the cup because
it's<00:01:52.200> really<00:01:52.530> fragile<00:01:52.800> and<00:01:53.280> baking<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.180> just

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
it's really fragile and baking it just

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.000 
it's really fragile and baking it just
makes<00:01:54.690> it<00:01:54.810> easier<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.350> work<00:01:55.500> with

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.490 

to<00:02:05.010> make<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.340> milkshake<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.120> can<00:02:06.300> use<00:02:06.570> any

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
to make the milkshake you can use any

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.980 
to make the milkshake you can use any
kind<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.830> 3d<00:02:08.190> paint<00:02:08.520> or<00:02:09.240> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.600> use<00:02:09.750> regular

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
kind of 3d paint or you can use regular

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.470 
kind of 3d paint or you can use regular
acrylic<00:02:10.500> paint<00:02:10.920> although<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.640> might<00:02:12.210> not<00:02:12.450> be

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
acrylic paint although that might not be

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:32.390 
acrylic paint although that might not be
as<00:02:12.810> thick<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.600> now<00:02:30.960> I'm<00:02:31.110> just<00:02:31.290> scoring<00:02:32.100> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
as thick so now I'm just scoring the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.880 
as thick so now I'm just scoring the
little<00:02:32.670> edges<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.900> Frye<00:02:34.140> container<00:02:34.620> after

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
little edges of the Frye container after

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.190 
little edges of the Frye container after
I<00:02:35.070> cut<00:02:35.310> it<00:02:35.430> out<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.660> want<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> score

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
I cut it out and you just want to score

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.770 
I cut it out and you just want to score
the<00:02:37.320> edges<00:02:37.590> where<00:02:37.860> you're<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> fold<00:02:38.520> it

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
the edges where you're going to fold it

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.720 
the edges where you're going to fold it
so<00:02:39.780> that's<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> bottom<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.770> then<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.280> flaps

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
so that's the bottom and then the flaps

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.370 
so that's the bottom and then the flaps
where<00:02:42.060> you're<00:02:42.210> going<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.540> add<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.840> glue<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
where you're going to add the glue and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.250 
where you're going to add the glue and
to<00:02:44.100> make<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.400> Frye's<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.240> mixed<00:02:45.780> white

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
to make the Frye's I just mixed white

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.880 
to make the Frye's I just mixed white
tan<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.340> translucent<00:02:48.030> clay<00:02:48.150> together<00:02:51.860> so<00:02:52.860> I

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
tan and translucent clay together so I

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.130 
tan and translucent clay together so I
bake<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> fries<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.480> container

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
bake the fries in a container

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.590 
bake the fries in a container
together<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.950> then<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.940> took<00:02:57.000> them<00:02:57.270> out<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.510> the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
together and then I took them out of the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.510 
together and then I took them out of the
container<00:02:57.960> because<00:02:58.320> they<00:02:58.410> weren't<00:02:58.620> stuck<00:02:59.220> to

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
container because they weren't stuck to

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.100 
container because they weren't stuck to
the<00:02:59.700> actual<00:03:00.000> container<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:00.630> added<00:03:00.930> some

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
the actual container then I added some

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.030 
the actual container then I added some
chalk<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.300> glued<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.990> fries<00:03:04.410> back<00:03:04.770> in<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
chalk and glued the fries back in the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.650 
chalk and glued the fries back in the
container<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.520> this<00:03:05.610> will<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:05.970> help<00:03:06.210> them

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
container and this will just help them

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.560 
container and this will just help them
to<00:03:06.690> stay<00:03:07.080> in<00:03:07.200> place<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:11.489> make<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.880> tray<00:03:12.270> I

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
to stay in place to make the tray I

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.510 
to stay in place to make the tray I
started<00:03:13.260> with<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.620> little<00:03:13.890> tray<00:03:14.130> liner<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
started with the little tray liner that

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.050 
started with the little tray liner that
I<00:03:14.670> cut<00:03:14.970> out<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.360> that<00:03:16.170> template<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.709> also<00:03:17.130> in

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
I cut out and that template is also in

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.380 
I cut out and that template is also in
the<00:03:18.450> description<00:03:18.750> box<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.470> then<00:03:20.310> I<00:03:20.610> use<00:03:21.090> some

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
the description box and then I use some

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.020 
the description box and then I use some
red<00:03:21.630> cardstock<00:03:22.170> paper<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.310> make<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.730> actual

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
red cardstock paper to make the actual

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.870 
red cardstock paper to make the actual
tray<00:03:24.360> around<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.440> size<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.430> tray<00:03:26.640> liner

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
tray around the size of the tray liner

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.170 
tray around the size of the tray liner
and<00:03:27.180> then<00:03:28.050> I<00:03:28.080> scored<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.190> edges<00:03:29.610> and<00:03:29.910> you're

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
and then I scored the edges and you're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.170 
and then I scored the edges and you're
going<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.780> separate<00:03:31.410> edges<00:03:32.250> or<00:03:32.550> folds

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
going to have to separate edges or folds

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.150 
going to have to separate edges or folds
to<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.570> tray<00:03:33.810> one<00:03:34.170> will<00:03:34.380> be<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.620> bottom<00:03:34.800> and

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
to the tray one will be the bottom and

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.880 
to the tray one will be the bottom and
then<00:03:35.280> one<00:03:35.489> will<00:03:35.640> be<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> top<00:03:36.090> edge<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.890> you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
then one will be the top edge and you

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.229 
then one will be the top edge and you
kind<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.160> just<00:03:38.310> have<00:03:38.459> to<00:03:38.580> follow<00:03:38.790> what<00:03:39.120> I'm

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
kind of just have to follow what I'm

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.440 
kind of just have to follow what I'm
doing<00:03:39.540> and<00:03:39.720> look<00:03:40.290> closely<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:41.220> if<00:03:41.459> you<00:03:41.760> watch

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
doing and look closely but if you watch

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.120 
doing and look closely but if you watch
it<00:03:42.690> maybe<00:03:42.870> once<00:03:43.140> or<00:03:43.230> twice<00:03:43.290> she'll<00:03:43.709> understand

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
it maybe once or twice she'll understand

00:03:44.130 --> 00:04:00.360 
it maybe once or twice she'll understand
exactly<00:03:44.310> what<00:03:44.820> I'm<00:03:44.910> doing

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.280 

and<00:04:01.370> now<00:04:02.120> I'm<00:04:02.240> just<00:04:02.300> going<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.600> add<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> clear

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.560 
and now I'm just going to add a clear
glaze<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.010> top<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.670> tray<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.390> looks

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
glaze to the top of the tray so it looks

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.590 
glaze to the top of the tray so it looks
really<00:04:05.900> shiny<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.590> after<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> dried<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:08.060> glued

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.230 
really shiny and after a dried I glued
in<00:04:08.840> little<00:04:09.230> tray<00:04:09.470> liner<00:04:09.710> and<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.940> make<00:04:11.090> the
