00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.230 
hip is great the flavor is great the
vapor<00:02:15.970> production<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.600> light<00:02:16.890> but<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.670> feels

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
vapor production is light but it feels

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:32.150 
vapor production is light but it feels
like<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:21.250> good<00:02:21.640> amount<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:22.030> vapor

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.130 

and<00:02:32.700> again<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.090> looks<00:02:33.270> respectable<00:02:33.420> but

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
and again that looks respectable but

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.950 
and again that looks respectable but
just<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.860> show<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.310> difference<00:02:35.930> you<00:02:36.930> know

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
just to show you the difference you know

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.660 
just to show you the difference you know

this is another vaping system that has

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.240 
this is another vaping system that has
great<00:02:38.940> flavor<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.290> that's<00:02:40.440> a<00:02:40.530> limit<00:02:41.070> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
great flavor to it but that's a limit to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.580 
great flavor to it but that's a limit to
own<00:02:41.430> cool<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.630> a<00:02:42.690> point<00:02:43.050> five<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.500> them

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
own cool this is a point five of them

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:57.300 
own cool this is a point five of them
cool<00:02:43.800> a<00:02:44.090> lot<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:46.550> lot<00:02:47.550> of<00:02:47.700> air<00:02:47.850> flow<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.950> tried<00:02:49.950> it

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.390 

really<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.090> more<00:02:58.239> make<00:02:58.390> around<00:02:58.630> this

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.979 

but<00:03:04.970> does<00:03:05.090> that<00:03:05.120> make<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.510> better<00:03:05.629> flavor

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
but does that make for better flavor

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.339 
but does that make for better flavor
