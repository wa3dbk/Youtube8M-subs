planner spot 70c which had seven
different<00:00:22.189> RGB<00:00:23.480> LEDs<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.380> one<00:00:25.619> works

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
different RGB LEDs now this one works

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.279 
different RGB LEDs now this one works
with<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.400> CEO<00:00:26.640> be<00:00:26.939> led<00:00:27.330> what<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.140> the

with the CEO be led what is the
advantage

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
advantage

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
advantage
well<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.699> has<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> much<00:00:30.330> better<00:00:30.570> color<00:00:30.960> mixing

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
well it has a much better color mixing

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.080 
well it has a much better color mixing
and<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:33.059> also<00:00:33.870> has<00:00:34.469> here<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.190> lens<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.059> front

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
and it also has here a lens in front

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.959 
and it also has here a lens in front
that<00:00:36.899> makes<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.469> very<00:00:38.070> nice<00:00:38.600> 15<00:00:39.600> degree<00:00:39.930> beams

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
that makes you very nice 15 degree beams

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.270 
that makes you very nice 15 degree beams
but<00:00:41.969> very<00:00:42.780> interesting<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:44.070> can

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
but very interesting is that you can

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.060 
but very interesting is that you can
take<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:45.300> lens<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.870> then<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
take off this lens and then you have a

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.510 
take off this lens and then you have a
much<00:00:47.940> wider<00:00:48.210> beam<00:00:48.750> opening<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.440> 100<00:00:50.160> degrees

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
much wider beam opening of 100 degrees

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.510 
much wider beam opening of 100 degrees
so<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.660> use<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.350> for<00:00:52.530> wall<00:00:52.800> washing<00:00:53.160> or

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so you can use it for wall washing or

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.540 
so you can use it for wall washing or
other<00:00:53.969> applications<00:00:55.160> what<00:00:56.160> else<00:00:56.340> is

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
other applications what else is

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.760 
other applications what else is
interesting<00:00:56.730> about<00:00:57.210> this<00:00:57.510> one<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.440> here

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
interesting about this one you have here

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.090 
interesting about this one you have here
the<00:00:59.039> infrared<00:00:59.820> receiver<00:01:00.530> that<00:01:01.530> makes<00:01:01.920> it

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the infrared receiver that makes it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.149 
the infrared receiver that makes it
possible<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:03.049> use<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.769> remote<00:01:05.129> control

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
possible to use it with a remote control

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.109 
possible to use it with a remote control
that<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.390> also<00:01:06.810> included<00:01:07.409> with<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.340> COP
