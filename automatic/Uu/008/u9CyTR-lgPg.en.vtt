00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.199 
like crap and Dawn Fannie's earthquake
is<00:02:14.470> obviously<00:02:14.980> gonna<00:02:15.160> be<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.370> one-hit<00:02:15.700> ko<00:02:15.910> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
is obviously gonna be a one-hit ko and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.750

I go for his n headbutt though because

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.599 
I go for his n headbutt though because
that<00:03:11.650> wasn't<00:03:11.950> really<00:03:12.130> sure<00:03:12.280> what<00:03:12.430> he<00:03:12.519> was

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
that wasn't really sure what he was

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.430 
that wasn't really sure what he was
gonna<00:03:12.730> do<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.030> think<00:03:13.480> he<00:03:13.780> might<00:03:13.930> like<00:03:14.079> switch

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
gonna do I think he might like switch

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.430 
gonna do I think he might like switch
out<00:03:14.590> shooting<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.069> resists<00:03:15.549> grass<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:17.380> you

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
out shooting that resists grass so you

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.979 
out shooting that resists grass so you
Zen<00:03:17.889> headbutt<00:03:18.069> so<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:18.910> was<00:03:19.000> unnecessary<00:03:19.269> risk

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
Zen headbutt so it was unnecessary risk

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.809 
Zen headbutt so it was unnecessary risk
but<00:03:20.349> it<00:03:20.530> didn't<00:03:20.889> really<00:03:20.980> matter<00:03:21.220> in<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.519> end<00:03:21.639> I

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
but it didn't really matter in the end I

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.550 
but it didn't really matter in the end I
guess<00:03:22.829> so<00:03:23.829> I<00:03:23.859> he<00:03:24.489> sends<00:03:24.880> out<00:03:25.030> ster<00:03:25.930> Raptor<00:03:26.349> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
guess so I he sends out ster Raptor and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.409 
guess so I he sends out ster Raptor and
it<00:03:27.220> lowers<00:03:27.430> my<00:03:27.609> attack<00:03:28.060> because<00:03:28.389> of

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
it lowers my attack because of

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.620 
it lowers my attack because of
intimidate<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.489> now<00:03:30.489> I'm<00:03:30.730> like<00:03:30.940> okay<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:31.389> have

intimidate and now I'm like okay I have

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.690 
intimidate and now I'm like okay I have

of damage but this thing is really bulky
which<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.590> why<00:04:33.740> it's<00:04:33.950> overused<00:04:34.460> but<00:04:34.730> we<00:04:35.210> have<00:04:35.300> a

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
which is why it's overused but we have a

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.750 
which is why it's overused but we have a
cool<00:04:35.570> little<00:04:35.630> physical<00:04:36.350> strategy<00:04:36.800> with<00:04:37.010> it<00:04:37.160> it

cool little physical strategy with it it

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.780 
cool little physical strategy with it it
uses<00:04:37.970> agility<00:04:38.570> first<00:04:38.870> turn<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.470> then<00:04:40.130> the

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
uses agility first turn and then the

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.160 
uses agility first turn and then the
opponent<00:04:41.000> will<00:04:41.240> probably<00:04:41.510> try<00:04:41.630> to<00:04:41.660> finish<00:04:42.020> it

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170

licky is just gonna get dominated here

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.309 
licky is just gonna get dominated here

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 
because it just cannot speed that yeah

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.230 
because it just cannot speed that yeah
sad<00:06:13.650> I<00:06:13.680> cannot<00:06:14.009> speed<00:06:14.250> an<00:06:14.370> am<00:06:14.490> for<00:06:14.669> us<00:06:14.789> but<00:06:15.089> you

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
sad I cannot speed an am for us but you

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.540 
sad I cannot speed an am for us but you
know<00:06:15.330> that's<00:06:15.449> the<00:06:15.689> truth<00:06:15.990> you<00:06:16.229> could<00:06:16.919> say<00:06:17.069> he

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
know that's the truth you could say he

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.749 
know that's the truth you could say he
gets<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:17.819> crit<00:06:18.060> there<00:06:18.300> that<00:06:19.110> might<00:06:19.409> have<00:06:19.589> I<00:06:20.069> was

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 
gets a crit there that might have I was

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.339 
gets a crit there that might have I was
thinking<00:06:21.000> that<00:06:21.029> weakly<00:06:21.419> we<00:06:21.539> would<00:06:21.689> hung<00:06:22.139> on

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
thinking that weakly we would hung on

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.200 
thinking that weakly we would hung on
barely<00:06:22.680> but<00:06:22.979> honestly<00:06:23.669> we<00:06:23.879> really<00:06:23.909> haven't

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
barely but honestly we really haven't

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.909 
barely but honestly we really haven't
made<00:06:24.419> a<00:06:24.449> difference<00:06:24.779> overall<00:06:25.139> in<00:06:25.409> the<00:06:25.529> outcome

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
made a difference overall in the outcome

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.579 
made a difference overall in the outcome
of<00:06:25.949> the<00:06:26.099> battle<00:06:26.370> instead<00:06:27.089> of<00:06:27.210> being<00:06:27.449> a<00:06:28.050> total

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
of the battle instead of being a total

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.079 
of the battle instead of being a total
blowout<00:06:28.740> it<00:06:29.099> would<00:06:29.219> have<00:06:29.310> been<00:06:29.430> just<00:06:29.610> a<00:06:29.729> little

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:30.089 
blowout it would have been just a little

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.649 
blowout it would have been just a little
less<00:06:30.270> than<00:06:30.509> a<00:06:30.629> total<00:06:30.930> blowout<00:06:31.080> but<00:06:31.800> it's<00:06:31.979> still

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
less than a total blowout but it's still

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:37.339 
less than a total blowout but it's still
like<00:06:33.659> when<00:06:34.469> slide<00:06:34.919> victory<00:06:35.490> and<00:06:36.349> Ampharos

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:37.349 
like when slide victory and Ampharos

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.019 
like when slide victory and Ampharos
takes<00:06:37.620> and<00:06:37.830> damage<00:06:38.159> there

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:39.029 
takes and damage there

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:40.519 
takes and damage there
it<00:06:39.300> doesn't<00:06:39.599> quite<00:06:39.689> knock<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.139> out<00:06:40.259> though

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
it doesn't quite knock it out though

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:42.439 
it doesn't quite knock it out though
take<00:06:41.159> something<00:06:41.460> like<00:06:41.550> half<00:06:41.789> HP<00:06:42.000> and<00:06:42.389> then

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
take something like half HP and then

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.659 
take something like half HP and then
then<00:06:42.629> pursue<00:06:42.990> the<00:06:43.110> thunder<00:06:43.500> wave<00:06:43.649> and<00:06:44.189> I'm
