evolution<00:00:11.460> lines<00:00:11.670> in<00:00:12.090> general<00:00:12.570> but<00:00:13.200> I'm<00:00:13.349> gonna

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
evolution lines in general but I'm gonna

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.519 
evolution lines in general but I'm gonna
take<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.089> as<00:00:15.269> an<00:00:15.420> example<00:00:15.780> or<00:00:16.260> endless

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
because we all know that Eggman has a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.560 
because we all know that Eggman has a
lot<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.109> digivolution<00:00:19.619> lines<00:00:20.100> he<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.939> a

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
lot of digivolution lines he like and a

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.420 
lot of digivolution lines he like and a
whole<00:00:21.990> lot<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> subspecies<00:00:24.320> you<00:00:25.320> think<00:00:25.680> every

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
whole lot of subspecies you think every

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.970 
whole lot of subspecies you think every
single<00:00:26.789> argument<00:00:27.380> comes<00:00:28.380> from<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> same

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
single argument comes from the same

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.359 
single argument comes from the same
argument<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.900> take<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.859> other

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
argument like if we take and use other

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.299 
argument like if we take and use other
one<00:00:32.640> from<00:00:32.790> season<00:00:33.149> one<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> base<00:00:34.309> basic

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
one from season one like the base basic

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.240 
one from season one like the base basic
argument<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.870> think<00:00:37.140> every<00:00:37.680> like<00:00:37.860> single

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
argument and you think every like single

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
argument and you think every like single
argument<00:00:38.520> has<00:00:39.000> spread<00:00:39.510> out<00:00:39.690> from<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.050> Eggman

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
argument has spread out from that Eggman

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.819 
argument has spread out from that Eggman
become<00:00:41.399> yeah<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:42.870> are<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.410> ice

arm would that change his stage

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.789 
arm would that change his stage
evolution<00:01:42.299> line<00:01:42.450> like<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.170> two<00:01:43.380> totally

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
evolution line like in two totally

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.149 
evolution line like in two totally
different<00:01:43.829> Greymon<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.820> onward<00:01:45.600> from<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
different Greymon and onward from that

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.429 
different Greymon and onward from that
can<00:01:47.159> Digimon<00:01:48.149> change<00:01:48.509> their<00:01:48.780> evolution<00:01:49.229> lines

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
can Digimon change their evolution lines

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
can Digimon change their evolution lines
depending<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.159> what<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.759> look<00:01:51.540> like<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:52.759> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
depending on what they look like and you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.880 
depending on what they look like and you
ask<00:01:53.970> well<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.930> if<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.079> Digimon<00:01:55.439> walks<00:01:55.649> around

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
ask well what if a Digimon walks around

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.069 
ask well what if a Digimon walks around
get<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> leaf<00:01:56.579> stuck<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.119> his<00:01:57.240> foot<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.869> would

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
get a leaf stuck on his foot that would

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
get a leaf stuck on his foot that would
make<00:01:58.259> him<00:01:58.409> change<00:01:58.770> his<00:01:59.070> resolution<00:01:59.549> line<00:01:59.850> no

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
make him change his resolution line no

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.510 
make him change his resolution line no
you're<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> leaf<00:02:02.009> would<00:02:02.280> not

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you're right because that leaf would not

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.219 
you're right because that leaf would not
be<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> part<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.420> Digimon<00:02:03.810> because<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
be a part of that Digimon because that

and yeah that kind of like changed his
data<00:02:14.120> construction<00:02:14.840> I<00:02:14.930> guess<00:02:15.140> what<00:02:15.890> are<00:02:16.069> your

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
data construction I guess what are your

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.520 
data construction I guess what are your
theories<00:02:16.730> about<00:02:16.910> this<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:17.720> simply<00:02:18.349> think

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
theories about this do you simply think

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.260 
theories about this do you simply think
there<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:18.980> different<00:02:19.670> species

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
there are different species

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.930 
there are different species
I<00:02:20.300> know<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.590> are<00:02:21.620> data<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.310> they<00:02:22.430> could<00:02:22.760> have

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
I know they are data so they could have

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.449 
I know they are data so they could have
been<00:02:23.090> created<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.660> way<00:02:23.900> from<00:02:24.500> start<00:02:24.950> but

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
been created that way from start but

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.300 
been created that way from start but
yeah<00:02:26.090> do<00:02:26.450> you<00:02:26.540> think<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.140> think<00:02:27.380> it<00:02:27.530> spread

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
yeah do you think you think it spread

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.370 
yeah do you think you think it spread
out<00:02:28.340> from<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.850> original<00:02:29.239> Eggman<00:02:29.600> into

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
out from the original Eggman into

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.240 
out from the original Eggman into
different<00:02:30.680> kind<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.010> types<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.520> thus<00:02:31.970> items

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
different kind of types and thus items

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.250 
different kind of types and thus items
yeah<00:02:34.250> change<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.150> way<00:02:35.270> they<00:02:35.540> look<00:02:35.810> when<00:02:36.110> a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
yeah change the way they look when a

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.550 
yeah change the way they look when a
digital<00:02:36.730> yeah<00:02:37.730> I'm<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.780> saying<00:02:38.959> take<00:02:39.319> that
