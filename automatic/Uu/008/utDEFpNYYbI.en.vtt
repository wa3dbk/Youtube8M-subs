sir<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:32.960> exciting<00:03:33.230> for<00:03:33.530> us<00:03:33.560> too<00:03:33.830> well<00:03:34.250> it's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:34.460 
sir it was exciting for us too well it's

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.390 
sir it was exciting for us too well it's
obviously<00:03:34.880> tough<00:03:35.660> because<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:36.830> requires<00:03:37.280> a

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
obviously tough because it requires a

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.070 
obviously tough because it requires a
whole<00:03:37.730> different<00:03:38.270> skill<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:38.750> balance

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
whole different skill and balance

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080 
whole different skill and balance
doesn't<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.530> yeah<00:03:39.770> you<00:03:39.860> really<00:03:40.190> have<00:03:40.520> to<00:03:40.760> move

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
doesn't it yeah you really have to move

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.600 
doesn't it yeah you really have to move
very<00:03:41.150> subtly<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:42.170> you<00:03:42.560> do<00:03:42.710> jerky<00:03:43.100> movements<00:03:43.520> it

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
very subtly if you do jerky movements it

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.070 
very subtly if you do jerky movements it
can<00:03:43.700> really<00:03:43.880> upset<00:03:44.270> the<00:03:44.390> pendulum<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.020> the

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
can really upset the pendulum and the

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.860 
can really upset the pendulum and the
wire<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:45.740> it<00:03:46.430> can<00:03:46.610> be<00:03:46.730> beautiful<00:03:47.030> one<00:03:47.480> second

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
wire so it can be beautiful one second

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.480 
wire so it can be beautiful one second
