00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.729
 hallÃ¶chen was here again at the start 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.259
 today a first tutorial on the 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.790
 Visitors have exactly what I do 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.110
 because I do not have a really good idea about it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 found what it is about minecraft 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.850
 and indeed to see the rammers yes 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.830
 So I'll show you how it works 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.320
 looks with minecraft before I die 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.590
 room launcher increased it is here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.150
 ever for the correct version because 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 for the original version one finds 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.589
 Thousands of matic launcher and 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.140
 so on and so forth but for the 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.579
 Cracked version I hardly have things 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.539
 I found myself again broken 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.640
 could that be yes and now you can here 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 at the top right , I would see 989 mbh 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.059
 let's say that with the magic 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 lounge so i could just now 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.690
 here in the browser I go in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.210
 I do, of course, I do 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.359
 I write you the link in the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.160
 description of my media celebration 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 account manager media celebration side and there 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.990
 is the coordinator at the launcher inside 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 of course not written by me 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.420
 I have that of myself from the other 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.800
 video but the only one was me 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.450
 thought yes down video 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:28.320
 then you get on like this 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.720
 the impact the tigers with the axis on 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.100
 the desktop and yes that was 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.080
 probably then you can do that here 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:41.140
 start car by filling 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.140
 the violence results in the username 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.410
 I write with only one in it 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.570
 Attend with other hand actually 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.570
 the microphone and now the little opponent 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 worked to the window on tmd exe and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.010
 invites practically silent 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.930
 Now we go here, too, the parents 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:27.980
 everything changes made already say 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:32.900
 so own by the way running on so 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.790
 in any case, we now have 3640 mb me 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.130
 ever a lot more and how 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.620
 I can see you now almost 5 mb 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.900
 or do I have something 600 mw so must 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.550
 say ram consumed mb used 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.190
 and yes that would be over half 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:55.040
 from my from my old 900 mb ram 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.600
 and now I have six 3000 here 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.580
 it exports just 16 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.750
 percent 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.160
 yes you can really start with that 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.720
 was his big watch if you are 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.700
 here now just one buys closes 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.650
 the window and you can here 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.390
 you can go with that with this one 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.260
 You can start when he buys as 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.260
 starts normally 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:31.130
 we could not see anything 89mm across 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.320
 the debate starts and works 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.970
 everything around I hope I could you 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.100
 can help you a bit if 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.500
 still wondering about this and 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.420
 I have the comments that I try 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.610
 to answer it and no I would 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.610
 say oh yes rocky
