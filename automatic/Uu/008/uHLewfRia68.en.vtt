i'd<00:02:46.920> like<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.250> discuss<00:02:47.430> after<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.330> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
i'd like to discuss after that is the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.190 
i'd like to discuss after that is the
use<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.470> Ring<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.860> wealth<00:02:50.070> arm<00:02:50.400> in<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
use of the Ring of wealth arm in the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.800 
use of the Ring of wealth arm in the
drop<00:02:52.500> rate<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.950> these<00:02:53.220> things<00:02:53.550> now<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.540> don't

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
drop rate of these things now I don't

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.230 
drop rate of these things now I don't
think<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.380> actually<00:02:55.620> even<00:02:56.610> affects<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
think this actually even affects the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.350 
think this actually even affects the
drop<00:02:57.810> rate<00:02:57.960> at<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.490> in<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> positive<00:03:00.030> way

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
drop rate at like like in a positive way

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.350 
drop rate at like like in a positive way
I<00:03:00.830> actually<00:03:01.830> think<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.370> negatively<00:03:02.820> affects

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
I actually think it negatively affects

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.070 
I actually think it negatively affects
the<00:03:03.780> drop<00:03:04.050> rate<00:03:04.080> of<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:05.630> black<00:03:06.630> mass<00:03:06.840> from

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the drop rate of of black mass from

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.340 
the drop rate of of black mass from
kforce<00:03:07.590> because<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.760> got<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.660> mask<00:03:09.960> just

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
kforce because I got this mask just

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.470 
kforce because I got this mask just
recently<00:03:10.770> right<00:03:11.280> when<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.520> took<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.910> off<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.420> took
