00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 brought a very tasty recipe a 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.220
 of the fastest and amazing that I 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.220
 I have done 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.860
 start the melted butter and the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:48.089
 wafers that have been crushed 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.100
 be the basis of our troop of him I like 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.079
 to use this chocolate chip to 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.059
 give a contrast in the recipe 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 and of course it 's not a special flavor either 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.980
 because I know the point of mass I get and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.449
 to March when she does not have the bran sided 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.040

 mix with lemon juice that the yolks 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.720
 I'll turn it from a homogeneous cream 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.979
 It's good to leave a finger below the shape 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.630
 stuffing because as there is egg the gemma goes 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.979
