more<00:01:43.720> speed<00:01:43.990> then<00:01:44.830> grab<00:01:45.310> two<00:01:45.640> more<00:01:45.670> coins<00:01:46.090> and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
more speed then grab two more coins and

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.100 
more speed then grab two more coins and
take<00:01:46.540> another<00:01:46.720> glider<00:01:47.110> pattern<00:01:51.930> head<00:01:52.930> for

take another glider pattern head for
this<00:01:53.229> last<00:01:53.530> bit<00:01:53.710> while<00:01:54.250> grabbing<00:01:54.520> more<00:01:54.880> coins

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300
