00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
doing that security checkpoint that

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.000 
doing that security checkpoint that
everybody<00:02:15.290> goes<00:02:15.500> through<00:02:15.710> and<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:15.920> so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
everybody goes through and it's so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.620 
everybody goes through and it's so

crowded now well now we're going to open

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.840 
crowded now well now we're going to open
it<00:02:17.810> up<00:02:17.960> probably<00:02:18.410> make<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.770> twice<00:02:19.010> as<00:02:19.220> wide<00:02:19.490> and

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it up probably make it twice as wide and

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.730 
it up probably make it twice as wide and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
and not being punched up and that'll be

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.430
