00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.339
 hi today i'm going to show you 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.550
 little movie I filmed there over night 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.420
 the beach that use a lot of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.349
 70's case's capacity is this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.179
 we're going to do what I show the movie 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.590
 first of all it's actually an excerpt from a 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.460
 video that I shot for my other 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.869
 chain my little SLR and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.130
 by we hear about it after it's party 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.050
 says less light necessarily says time 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.189
 laying a little longer then good 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.899
 it remains the sunlight so you 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.689
 should be able to stay in the 100 iso 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.070
 or 200 iso and still check your 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.790
 time to ask then check that the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.860
 picture is clear 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.940
 if that's not the case do not hesitate to 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.579
 to use a tripod it can always 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.379
 help 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.970
 so as you could see the rendering 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.979
 not too bad anyway I am 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.879
 rather satisfied with this 200 of the skis 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.229
 really nice is that it's 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.040
 extremely easy to do because 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.550
 it's all automatic 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.559
 in reality what happens is that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.940
 already compared to the 1100 halls in 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.370
 paris I had before this one he has a 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.410
 removable screen and so what we do 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.339
 is that once you have it yourself 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.229
 good i'm but if you want that's it 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.250
 so there you see that information 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.259
 appear on the screen so I have 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:14.840
 disabled better so these are the 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.979
 information is displayed on the screen and this 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.970
 which is interesting when we follow 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.039
 obviously on the other side of the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.250
 camera and so when we're like that we 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:23.030
 just turn the screen and we see 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.740
 exactly what we're doing 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.970
 So film we see is even 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.229
 when we are ten meters away 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.189
 can know where we are in the case 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.509
 while in fact it's great because 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:32.960
 just press save 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.189
 after me I go in the frame and I 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.810
 positions centimeter by centimeter 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.250
 to be right where I am 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.979
 wish it's a first thing 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.759
 which is really very practical and who 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.409
 advance that I am that I had to 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.149
 do and I position an object to 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.500
 the place where I was going found myself that 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.329
 I was going to do the framing that I'm moving 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.920
 exactly the camera so that the 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.299
 framing be good then I have 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.990
 removed the object I put myself in the place 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.729
 of the object so it was quite laborious 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.649
 another thing that's interesting is 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 what was engaged before that is the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.369
 continuous focus so there actually 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.630
 he will select an object he will do 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.799
 a vacuum at point surjeu page tried 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.799
 to do on the webcam patel 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.470
 ben on line and in the mode where he has 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.349
 tried trying to recognize faces 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.580
 so in fact not necessarily obvious and he 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.170
 maybe I'm too close to a 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.370
 webcam 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.709
 but no matter what is really 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.220
 awesome is who will spot a face 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.080
 in the Seine 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.349
 he is going on continually or 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.940
 keeping that face clean is so what is 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.470
 pass is that I can use my 50 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.830
 mm f / 1 8 which has a depth of field 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.790
 very very weak and where before he 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.620
 I really needed to position myself 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.569
 batteries in the right plane this time it him 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.650
 he's going he'll fit I 'll be all the 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.560
 time to be and my back cloud and 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.450
 mounts my background and well blurred and 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.950
 so suddenly paf it brings out the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.360
 subject who is speaking so 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.099
 it's really really nickel very 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.299
 practical and last thing that is very 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.300
 also practical is that we can dream 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.350
 here the exhibition and all that directly 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.410
 even while we are in the process of 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.860
 filming hit i'm just going to stop that 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.310
 because it's a little annoying 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.310
 of a second 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.630
 I think that's going to calm him down 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.400
 that's my bread sometimes I do not do it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.900
 focus but it's just for the 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.340
 for the demonstration 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.190
 what was I saying 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.210
 he is doing the continuous focus yes ah 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.830
 yes we can change the settings 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.690
 directly even when we're trying 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.940
 to film the video so for example there 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.440
 we have 50/50 of a second as time 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.070
 of exposure so this is the ideal time 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.140
 to make a movie effect I am 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.280
 open at 1.8 you have lease meaning but 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.450
 it's still bright enough if 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.730
 I want to change I will change the time 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.590
 of exhibition and I can turn it as 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.260
 sap live and it will sink the scene 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.100
 and we can do it 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.330
 extremely easily much more 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.590
 simply that our size in the 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.560
 menus of a magic lantern or whatever 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.560
 something like that and it's more 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.709
 it's super instinctive and it can be 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.390
 do it directly during the video if 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.040
 so we're going to find the depth of 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.110
 field if you want and suddenly as it is 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.230
 more closed is also darker and we 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.300
 can also play on the iso so that's it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.580
 that's really great 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.720
 there is something that disappointed me 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.890
 as I tried them on time 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840
 but in fact after all it makes sense 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.260
 is that you know that I tried to 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.620
 filming with the famous one fiftieth of 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.900
 second for like break time for 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.060
 see this famous movie effect that I have not 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.490
 still thoroughly tested but that's it and 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.389
 in fact to do that outdoors with 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.560
 a grand opening 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.340
 you have to put the famous filter end and 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.110
 circulars and so I had installed the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.790
 filters it circulars on 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.560
 the worry is that at that moment the 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.330
 the auto focus auto a 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.430
 facial recognition does not work 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.190
 and for the simple reason that in 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.240
 does it does autofocus with respect to 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.639
 information they receive on the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.250
 sensor and even if the image behind it 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.930
 and well-being because there is he boosted 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:57.169
 the islands are boosting the iso or two 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.210
 things the sensor gets him not enough 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.140
 information and so suddenly they 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.550
 could not put the 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.950
 point continues on on face 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.660
 using this mode there so there I was 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.250
 a little disappointed and suddenly I 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.410
 used for this video there rather than 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.360
 to take the filter is born and from the 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.010
 turn for to adjust the exposure 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.690
 I used the break times 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.700
 because I did not want to change the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.440
 depth of field so I went to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.660
 pause time 2 1 to 2 1000th a 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.590
 fourth and that's good whatever 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.720
 this video there are no movements 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.539
 is no car I would like in 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.620
 movement goes off but that was 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.650
 that I'm trying to find a solution to 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.900
 this problem a little later here I 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.970
 just wanted to share that with you I 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.260
 do not know if it will help you 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.310
 to please it's not really a tutorial 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.590
 but I have too much too this time 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.700
 week I spent a lot of 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.440
 time to make videos for 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.490
 the small SLR completion to be sure 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.520
 to have everything you need during the summer 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.879
 because this summer 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.990
 I'm going pretty busy so sorry 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.400
 advanced but there will probably be 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.830
 some weeks there will be no 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.659
 of episodes on the channel opti videographer 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.940
 I will try to do it but there will be 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.139
 probably scans where he will not have 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.319
 and we will try to pick up a rhythm 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.129
 normal back to school this is it 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:03.400
 everything for today then at very 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:05.909
 soon 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.909
 go ciao
