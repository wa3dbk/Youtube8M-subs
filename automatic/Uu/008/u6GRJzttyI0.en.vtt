00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
and give it a quick base coat not

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.500 
and give it a quick base coat not
covering<00:00:35.100> everything<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:36.120> leave<00:00:36.270> my

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
covering everything and leave my

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.880 
covering everything and leave my
highlight<00:00:37.040> here<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> middle<00:00:38.489> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
highlight here in the middle and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.670 
highlight here in the middle and
picturing<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.070> my<00:00:42.230> light<00:00:43.230> source<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.649> coming

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
picturing that my light source is coming

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.790 
picturing that my light source is coming
from<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.190> direction<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:45.530> thought<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.680> would

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
from this direction I thought that would

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.680 
from this direction I thought that would
give<00:00:47.010> us<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.399> best<00:00:47.780> highlights<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:50.070> work<00:00:50.219> with

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
give us the best highlights to work with

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
give us the best highlights to work with
so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.490 
so
give<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.330> a<00:00:54.420> nice<00:00:54.630> quickie

for<00:00:59.220> my<00:00:59.340> example<00:00:59.820> today<00:00:59.970> I'm<00:01:00.240> using<00:01:01.310> row<00:01:02.310> where

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
for my example today I'm using row where

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.930 
for my example today I'm using row where
may<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:03.090> digital<00:01:03.750> stamp<00:01:04.110> from<00:01:04.980> some<00:01:05.250> ID<00:01:05.400> girl<00:01:05.700> I
