00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
everything but for me was a letdown not

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.830 
everything but for me was a letdown not
because<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.310> maps<00:01:24.520> are<00:01:24.670> bad<00:01:24.910> or<00:01:24.940> because<00:01:25.450> you

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
because the maps are bad or because you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.210 
because the maps are bad or because you
know<00:01:25.930> just<00:01:26.140> because<00:01:26.290> he<00:01:26.470> gained<00:01:26.680> his<00:01:26.710> bad<00:01:27.040> but

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
know just because he gained his bad but

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.160 
know just because he gained his bad but
because<00:01:27.490> there<00:01:27.640> was<00:01:27.760> no<00:01:28.030> variety<00:01:28.600> being<00:01:28.780> added

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
because there was no variety being added

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.320 
because there was no variety being added
to<00:01:29.290> it<00:01:29.470> sure<00:01:29.740> there's<00:01:29.950> new<00:01:30.130> maps<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:30.670> how<00:01:31.180> long

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
away or I don't know if it was just that

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.220
