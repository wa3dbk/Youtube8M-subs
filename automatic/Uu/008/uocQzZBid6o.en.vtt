in<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> way<00:00:53.699> around<00:00:54.350> kind<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.440> imagine<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
in all the way around kind of imagine a

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.250 
in all the way around kind of imagine a
little<00:00:56.430> pancake<00:00:57.800> and<00:00:59.719> your<00:01:00.719> first<00:01:00.989> thought<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
little pancake and your first thought is

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.650 
little pancake and your first thought is
that<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.739> need<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.039> do<00:01:02.219> something<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.539> you

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that you need to do something but you

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.410 
that you need to do something but you
really<00:01:04.019> can't<00:01:04.379> do<00:01:04.589> anything<00:01:04.920> until<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:06.119> dries

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
really can't do anything until it dries

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.480 
really can't do anything until it dries
out<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.290> starts<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.710> brown<00:01:07.890> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
out a little bit and starts to brown and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.260 
out a little bit and starts to brown and
you<00:01:08.610> see<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.780> it's<00:01:10.350> starting<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
you see right here it's it's starting to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.510 
you see right here it's it's starting to
firm<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.500> just<00:01:13.500> let<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:14.990> let<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.189> let<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.250> all

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
firm up just let it go let it let it all

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.490 
firm up just let it go let it let it all
start<00:01:17.820> firming<00:01:18.150> up<00:01:18.270> like<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.380> you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
start firming up like that and then you

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
start firming up like that and then you
can<00:01:19.680> flip<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> over<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.759> tried<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.119> flip<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
can flip it over if you tried to flip it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.160 
can flip it over if you tried to flip it
over<00:01:21.540> now

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
over now

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.370 
over now
it<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.830> turned<00:01:23.070> into<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.430> big<00:01:24.200> piece<00:01:25.200> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it would just turned into a big piece of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.230 
it would just turned into a big piece of
gum<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.570> keep<00:01:27.750> let<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:30.590> it's

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
gum so you just keep let it going it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.980 
gum so you just keep let it going it's
slowly<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.570> from<00:01:34.130> no<00:01:35.130> bubbling<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:36.150> a

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
slowly going from no bubbling to a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.850 
slowly going from no bubbling to a
little<00:01:37.560> brown<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.700> still<00:01:39.650> bubbling<00:01:40.650> up

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
little brown this is still bubbling up

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
little brown this is still bubbling up
there's<00:01:41.130> still<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.369> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.670> moisture<00:01:41.970> there

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
there's still a lot of moisture there

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.819 
there's still a lot of moisture there
and<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:43.470> want<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.740> keep<00:01:43.970> letting<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> go

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
and you want to keep letting that go

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.260 
and you want to keep letting that go
because<00:01:46.829> what<00:01:46.979> you're<00:01:47.130> gonna<00:01:47.220> end<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.579> with<00:01:47.820> if

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
up now in browning that other side let

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.130 
up now in browning that other side let
it<00:02:34.390> go<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> little<00:02:34.900> bit<00:02:35.140> more<00:02:35.170> don't<00:02:36.130> burn<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
it go a little bit more don't burn it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.750 
it go a little bit more don't burn it
but<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.709> definitely<00:02:39.340> something<00:02:39.580> you

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
probably fine see the other side is

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.020
