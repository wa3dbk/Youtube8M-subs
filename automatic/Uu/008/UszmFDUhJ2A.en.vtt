and and the files will be created so

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.640

it's<00:03:10.489> not<00:03:10.640> such<00:03:10.879> a<00:03:10.909> big<00:03:11.090> deal<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:11.629> it's<00:03:11.959> pretty

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
it's not such a big deal but it's pretty

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.319 
it's not such a big deal but it's pretty
important<00:03:13.129> to<00:03:13.189> know<00:03:13.400> about<00:03:13.519> that<00:03:13.849> because<00:03:14.030> if

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:14.329 
important to know about that because if

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:16.119 
important to know about that because if
you<00:03:14.360> don't<00:03:14.599> learn<00:03:14.780> another<00:03:15.079> Fermat's<00:03:15.650> in<00:03:15.920> my

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
you don't learn another Fermat's in my

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.819 
you don't learn another Fermat's in my
case<00:03:16.430> for<00:03:16.700> example<00:03:17.209> another<00:03:18.049> games<00:03:18.439> won't

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
case for example another games won't

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.740 
case for example another games won't
work<00:03:19.299> you'll<00:03:20.299> have<00:03:20.360> like<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.810> black<00:03:21.170> screen<00:03:21.950> and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
work you'll have like a black screen and

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.369 
work you'll have like a black screen and
the<00:03:23.750> emulator<00:03:24.170> will<00:03:24.349> crash<00:03:24.650> so<00:03:25.280> this<00:03:25.849> is<00:03:26.090> the

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:26.379 
the emulator will crash so this is the

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.190 
the emulator will crash so this is the
best<00:03:27.379> format<00:03:27.799> I've<00:03:27.950> found<00:03:28.280> like<00:03:28.610> 90%<00:03:29.510> of<00:03:30.140> the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
best format I've found like 90% of the

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.680 
best format I've found like 90% of the
games<00:03:30.440> will<00:03:30.680> work<00:03:30.950> so<00:03:31.459> it's<00:03:31.610> almost<00:03:32.030> perfect

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
games will work so it's almost perfect

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.140 
games will work so it's almost perfect
so<00:03:33.379> it's<00:03:33.560> it's<00:03:33.739> like<00:03:33.920> it's<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.370> great<00:03:34.609> way<00:03:35.120> to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
so it's it's like it's a great way to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.960 
so it's it's like it's a great way to
make<00:03:35.510> it<00:03:35.599> work<00:03:35.629> so<00:03:36.159> once<00:03:37.159> you<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.400> your<00:03:37.459> image

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
make it work so once you have your image

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.720 
make it work so once you have your image
compare<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.540> this<00:03:39.079> format<00:03:39.920> as<00:03:40.250> you<00:03:40.459> see<00:03:40.670> in

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
compare it this format as you see in

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.240 
compare it this format as you see in
here<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.239> lot<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.569> all<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> games<00:03:42.829> are<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.040> the
