well<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.960> few<00:00:25.110> pence<00:00:25.320> was<00:00:25.500> on<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.680> field<00:00:25.829> too

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:26.040 
well a few pence was on the field too

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.319 
well a few pence was on the field too
long<00:00:26.250> there<00:00:26.460> between<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.880> second<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.240> third

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
long there between the second and third

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.749 
long there between the second and third
quarter<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:28.140> think<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.500> only<00:00:28.590> got<00:00:28.829> two<00:00:29.490> first

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
quarter I think we only got two first

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.940 
quarter I think we only got two first
downs<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.930> it's<00:00:31.110> not<00:00:31.200> just<00:00:31.259> a<00:00:31.470> function<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.860> the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
downs so it's not just a function of the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.540 
downs so it's not just a function of the
defensive<00:00:32.520> function<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.940> both<00:00:33.030> sides<00:00:33.270> and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
defensive function of both sides and

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.660 
defensive function of both sides and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.400 
get pressure with it with a four-man
rush<00:02:53.300> then<00:02:54.300> you're<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:54.990> be<00:02:55.110> tough<00:02:55.290> to

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
rush then you're going to be tough to

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.590 
rush then you're going to be tough to
beat<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.770> right<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:56.280> they're<00:02:57.210> controlling

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
1310 there if we can go in there even if

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
even if we don't go into it's going to

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.970 
even if we don't go into it's going to
feel<00:04:06.239> going<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.810> it's<00:04:06.900> you<00:04:07.230> know<00:04:07.290> surgery<00:04:07.860> and

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
feel going and it's you know surgery and

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.610 
feel going and it's you know surgery and
six<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:09.360> know<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:09.540> had<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> touchdown<00:04:10.380> call

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
six so you know we had a touchdown call

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.940 
six so you know we had a touchdown call
back<00:04:10.830> we<00:04:11.610> drop<00:04:11.850> the<00:04:12.239> one<00:04:12.930> or<00:04:13.050> two<00:04:13.080> touchdowns<00:04:13.680> I

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
back we drop the one or two touchdowns I

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.909 
back we drop the one or two touchdowns I
think<00:04:14.670> we<00:04:14.730> dropped<00:04:14.970> two<00:04:15.380> we<00:04:16.380> had<00:04:16.500> one<00:04:16.680> called

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
think we dropped two we had one called

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.729 
think we dropped two we had one called
back<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.459> then<00:04:17.790> you<00:04:18.780> know<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.380> pin<00:04:19.560> him<00:04:19.680> down

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
back and then you know we pin him down

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.670 
back and then you know we pin him down
there<00:04:20.630> deep<00:04:21.630> before<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.109> half<00:04:22.260> would<00:04:22.470> get<00:04:22.590> the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
there deep before the half would get the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.280 
there deep before the half would get the
ball<00:04:22.860> on<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.400> 35<00:04:23.850> but<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.180> over<00:04:24.990> three<00:04:25.260> and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
ball on the 35 but in over three and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.050 
ball on the 35 but in over three and
three<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.740> out<00:04:25.890> basically<00:04:26.220> a<00:04:26.340> Miss<00:04:26.610> appeal<00:04:26.880> go

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
three and out basically a Miss appeal go

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.130 
three and out basically a Miss appeal go
so<00:04:27.830> again<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:29.040> too<00:04:29.340> much<00:04:29.520> to<00:04:29.669> overcome<00:04:30.140> all

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
so again to too much to overcome all

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.590 
so again to too much to overcome all
three<00:04:31.440> phases<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:32.250> know<00:04:32.850> and<00:04:33.060> we<00:04:33.300> got<00:04:33.450> to<00:04:33.510> go

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
three phases you know and we got to go

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.480 
three phases you know and we got to go
back<00:04:33.720> two<00:04:33.870> more<00:04:34.020> starting<00:04:34.530> with<00:04:34.590> me<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:36.020> just
