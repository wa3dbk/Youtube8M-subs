edges<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.470> they<00:01:43.710> seal<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:45.180> you're

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
edges so that they seal and then you're

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.600 
edges so that they seal and then you're
going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.450> give<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> old<00:01:45.990> crimp<00:01:46.799> crimping

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
going to give it the old crimp crimping

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.090 
going to give it the old crimp crimping
nothing<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.630> krumping<00:01:49.020> now<00:01:49.560> crimping

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
nothing to do with krumping now crimping

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.090 
nothing to do with krumping now crimping
is<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:51.030> easily<00:01:51.299> done<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.680> hold<00:01:52.860> two

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is very easily done you just hold two

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.950 
is very easily done you just hold two
fingers<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.670> an<00:01:53.790> inch<00:01:53.939> apart<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.659> press

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
fingers about an inch apart you press

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
fingers about an inch apart you press
and<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.590> press<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.979> other<00:01:56.100> finger<00:01:56.399> in

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
and you press your other finger in

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.950 
and you press your other finger in
between<00:01:56.610> them<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> makes<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> little

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
between them and it just makes a little

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.959 
between them and it just makes a little
like<00:01:58.200> scalloped<00:01:58.740> edge<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.520> optional

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
like scalloped edge that's just optional

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.580 
like scalloped edge that's just optional
it<00:02:00.210> looks<00:02:00.390> pretty<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.439> do

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
it looks pretty but you don't have to do

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.749 
it looks pretty but you don't have to do
that<00:02:01.619> either<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.310> long<00:02:02.430> as<00:02:02.460> they're<00:02:02.670> all

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that either just so long as they're all

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.270 
that either just so long as they're all
sealed<00:02:02.969> then<00:02:03.750> here's<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.350> secret<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.159> this

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
sealed then here's the secret to this

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.570 
sealed then here's the secret to this
technique<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.240> works<00:02:06.509> so<00:02:07.439> nicely<00:02:07.580> spoon

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
technique and it works so nicely spoon

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.339 
technique and it works so nicely spoon
over<00:02:08.849> your<00:02:09.030> caramel<00:02:09.479> sauce<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:10.140> going<00:02:10.289> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
over your caramel sauce it's going to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.960 
over your caramel sauce it's going to
drizzle<00:02:10.530> down<00:02:10.770> between<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> lattice<00:02:11.760> it's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
drizzle down between the lattice it's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.730 
drizzle down between the lattice it's
going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> coat<00:02:12.360> all<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.660> apples<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.410> also

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
going to coat all the apples but also

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.290 
going to coat all the apples but also
you<00:02:13.770> want<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.950> make<00:02:14.040> sure<00:02:14.070> all<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.700> dough<00:02:15.000> on

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
you want to make sure all your dough on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.060 
you want to make sure all your dough on
the<00:02:15.450> lattice<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.990> covered<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.920> we're

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
the lattice is covered because we're

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.800 
the lattice is covered because we're
going<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> put<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.790> very<00:02:17.820> hot<00:02:18.480> oven<00:02:19.430> 425

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
going to put that in a very hot oven 425

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.620 
going to put that in a very hot oven 425
for<00:02:21.860> 15<00:02:22.860> minutes<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> start

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
for 15 minutes and that's going to start

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.210 
for 15 minutes and that's going to start
the<00:02:24.750> caramelization<00:02:25.140> on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> crust<00:02:25.980> because

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the caramelization on the crust because

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.460 
the caramelization on the crust because
it's<00:02:26.490> coated<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.060> sugar<00:02:27.300> syrup<00:02:27.630> all

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's coated with that sugar syrup all

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.080 
it's coated with that sugar syrup all
right<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.770> caramel<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.430> then<00:02:29.460> you're<00:02:30.000> going

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
right that caramel and then you're going

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.530 
right that caramel and then you're going
to<00:02:30.150> turn<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.450> down<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.750> 350<00:02:31.310> for<00:02:32.310> another<00:02:32.550> 35<00:02:33.270> or

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to turn it down to 350 for another 35 or

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
to turn it down to 350 for another 35 or
40<00:02:33.840> minutes<00:02:34.110> until<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.470> pie<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.680> done<00:02:34.950> and

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
40 minutes until the pie is done and

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.820 
40 minutes until the pie is done and
what<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:36.000> is<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.570> purest<00:02:37.050> most

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.480 
what you get is the purest most
delicious<00:02:38.550> apple<00:02:39.540> pie<00:02:39.750> ever<00:02:40.220> let<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.340> cool

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
delicious apple pie ever let it cool

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.150 
delicious apple pie ever let it cool
down<00:02:41.550> completely<00:02:42.050> before<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.650> try<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.890> slice

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
down completely before you try to slice

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.700 
down completely before you try to slice
this<00:02:44.340> okay<00:02:44.970> now<00:02:45.450> here's<00:02:45.720> one<00:02:46.020> thing<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
this okay now here's one thing the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.320 
this okay now here's one thing the
filling<00:02:46.980> doesn't<00:02:47.070> have<00:02:47.310> any<00:02:47.520> corn<00:02:47.910> starch<00:02:48.180> or

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
filling doesn't have any corn starch or

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.690 
filling doesn't have any corn starch or
flour<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.530> it's<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.040> apples

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
flour in it so it's really just apples

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.700 
flour in it so it's really just apples
in<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.030> nice<00:02:51.300> caramel<00:02:51.810> syrup<00:02:52.080> so<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.590> very

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
in this nice caramel syrup so it's very

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.970 
in this nice caramel syrup so it's very
kind<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.160> pure<00:02:53.520> clean<00:02:54.000> apple<00:02:54.990> pie<00:02:55.170> if<00:02:55.500> you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
kind of a pure clean apple pie if you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.220 
kind of a pure clean apple pie if you
want<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.430> more<00:02:56.640> traditional<00:02:57.210> thicker<00:02:57.540> more

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
want it more traditional thicker more

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.260 
want it more traditional thicker more
held<00:02:58.530> together<00:02:58.770> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.820> add<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> couple

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
held together you can add a couple

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.390 
held together you can add a couple
tablespoons<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:01.140> flour<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:01.890> apples<00:03:02.280> you

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
tablespoons of flour to the apples you

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.040 
tablespoons of flour to the apples you
can<00:03:02.520> toss<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.270> before<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.900> put

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
can toss them in that before you put

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.140 
can toss them in that before you put
them<00:03:04.110> in<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.320> shell<00:03:04.530> up<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.820> to<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
them in the shell up to you up to you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.150 
them in the shell up to you up to you
I'd<00:03:06.750> like<00:03:06.990> this<00:03:07.140> method<00:03:07.530> you<00:03:07.890> can<00:03:07.980> add<00:03:08.130> a

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
I'd like this method you can add a

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.380 
I'd like this method you can add a
little<00:03:08.310> more<00:03:08.430> Apple<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:08.820> if<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:08.970> want<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.270> I

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
little more Apple so if you want like I

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.100 
little more Apple so if you want like I
said<00:03:09.630> and<00:03:09.990> there<00:03:10.710> you<00:03:10.800> go<00:03:10.920> a<00:03:11.160> delicious<00:03:12.110> very

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
said and there you go a delicious very

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.790 
said and there you go a delicious very
pure<00:03:13.760> apple<00:03:14.760> flavor<00:03:15.360> by<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> way<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> crust

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
pure apple flavor by the way the crust

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.560 
pure apple flavor by the way the crust
worked<00:03:17.040> nicely<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.790> thought<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.150> was<00:03:18.240> very<00:03:18.300> good

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
worked nicely I thought it was very good

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.540 
worked nicely I thought it was very good
quality<00:03:18.990> so<00:03:19.590> in<00:03:19.710> a<00:03:19.740> pinch<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.250> think<00:03:20.430> that's

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
quality so in a pinch I think that's

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.530 
quality so in a pinch I think that's
probably<00:03:20.670> gonna<00:03:20.880> work<00:03:21.000> a<00:03:21.060> lot<00:03:21.180> better<00:03:21.330> than

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
