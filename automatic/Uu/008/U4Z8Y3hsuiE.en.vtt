00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
like this are hard to get not because we

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
like this are hard to get not because we
can't<00:00:32.099> win<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.489> games<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.059> because<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
can't win the games but because of the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.569 
can't win the games but because of the
fact<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.989> when<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.590> leg<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.190> games

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
fact that when you get leg out of games

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.970

it<00:00:35.910> counts<00:00:36.300> as<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> loss<00:00:36.719> which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.530> sad

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it counts as a loss which is also sad

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.610 
it counts as a loss which is also sad
and<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.730> have<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.969> 500<00:00:39.930> wins<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.350> still
