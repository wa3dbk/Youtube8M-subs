00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.389
 excellent day is the weather report 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.760
 from the national meteorological service 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.460
 the weather conditions for today 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.560
 January 15 are the following we have 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.430
 the entrance of important moisture towards 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.529
 the north of the national territory 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.970
 generated by moisture propagation 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.860
 from the Pacific Ocean what 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.599
 is being reinforced with a current in 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.520
 jet in height plus a zone 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.739
 of instability that is about 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.910
 the states of Chihuahua and Coahuila is 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.469
 in the course of the day it generates a 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.719
 potential for light rain to 

00:00:31.469 --> 00:00:35.790
 punctually moderate about said 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.200
 entities on the other side we already have to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.180
 front system number 21 with

 novation spread is important 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.810

 central portion of our Gulf of 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.940
 mexico and generates the negotiated propagation 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.500
 important in the littoral states of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 said gulf in addition to a northern event 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.760
