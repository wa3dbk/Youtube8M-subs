restore<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.169> recover<00:05:31.439> features<00:05:31.999> so<00:05:32.999> I<00:05:33.029> guess

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
restore and recover features so I guess

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.809 
restore and recover features so I guess
that<00:05:33.449> means<00:05:33.710> you<00:05:34.710> can<00:05:34.860> only<00:05:35.009> do<00:05:35.189> 10<00:05:35.400> tracks<00:05:35.639> at

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:35.819 
that means you can only do 10 tracks at

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.850 
that means you can only do 10 tracks at
a<00:05:35.879> time<00:05:36.120> which<00:05:36.900> I'm<00:05:37.199> okay<00:05:37.529> with<00:05:38.509> so<00:05:39.589> I'll<00:05:40.589> be

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
a time which I'm okay with so I'll be

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.249 
a time which I'm okay with so I'll be
