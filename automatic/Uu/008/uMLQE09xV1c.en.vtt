00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
milk is we get a little bit more protein

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.610 
milk is we get a little bit more protein
in<00:02:28.950> here<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:30.030> just<00:02:30.330> feel<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.930> better<00:02:31.200> than

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
in here and I just feel it's better than

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.229 
in here and I just feel it's better than
normal<00:02:32.160> milk<00:02:32.400> first<00:02:32.670> of<00:02:32.790> all<00:02:32.880> we<00:02:32.940> don't<00:02:33.030> get

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
normal milk first of all we don't get

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.180 
normal milk first of all we don't get
the<00:02:33.330> lactase<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.319> we<00:02:34.440> do<00:02:34.590> with<00:02:34.739> those<00:02:34.890> milk

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
the lactase that we do with those milk

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.680 
the lactase that we do with those milk
sugars<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.670> our<00:02:35.760> bodies<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.180> actually<00:02:36.480> digest

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
sugars so our bodies can actually digest

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.110 
sugars so our bodies can actually digest
and<00:02:37.080> absorb<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.560> nutrients<00:02:37.950> better<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.430> I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and absorb the nutrients better and I

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.120 
and absorb the nutrients better and I
just<00:02:39.420> think<00:02:39.600> almond<00:02:39.930> milk<00:02:40.110> tastes<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.769> little

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
just think almond milk tastes a little

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.460 
just think almond milk tastes a little
bit<00:02:41.250> better<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:42.150> we<00:02:42.360> get<00:02:42.510> some<00:02:42.690> added<00:02:43.019> fats<00:02:43.290> in

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
bit better so we get some added fats in

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.740 
bit better so we get some added fats in
there<00:02:43.620> too<00:02:43.940> next<00:02:44.940> up<00:02:45.090> we're<00:02:45.420> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.569> mix

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
there too next up we're going to mix

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.170 
there too next up we're going to mix
some<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:45.989> that<00:02:46.140> fructose<00:02:46.709> fruit<00:02:47.220> sugar<00:02:47.519> with

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
some of that fructose fruit sugar with

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.020 
some of that fructose fruit sugar with
some<00:02:48.390> honey<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.840> add<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:49.799> tablespoon<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:50.580> this

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
some honey and add a tablespoon of this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
some honey and add a tablespoon of this
natural<00:02:52.400> high<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.850> goes<00:02:54.380> really<00:02:55.380> gonna

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
natural high in that goes really gonna

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.580 
natural high in that goes really gonna
help<00:02:55.709> enhance<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.430> flavor<00:02:56.700> and<00:02:57.410> bring<00:02:58.410> our

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
help enhance the flavor and bring our

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.770 
help enhance the flavor and bring our
calories<00:02:59.100> up<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.579> match<00:02:59.700> our<00:02:59.940> protein<00:03:00.299> and

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
calories up to match our protein and

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.680 
calories up to match our protein and
carb<00:03:01.140> intake<00:03:01.670> we're<00:03:02.670> nearly<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.239> few

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
carb intake we're nearly there a few

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.270 
carb intake we're nearly there a few
more<00:03:03.780> items<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.320> go<00:03:04.470> in<00:03:05.959> healthy<00:03:06.959> dose<00:03:07.140> of

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
more items to go in healthy dose of

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.699 
more items to go in healthy dose of
cinnamon<00:03:09.109> again<00:03:10.109> it's<00:03:10.350> going<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.560> add<00:03:10.680> a

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
cinnamon again it's going to add a

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.289 
cinnamon again it's going to add a
little<00:03:10.980> bit<00:03:11.070> more<00:03:11.280> flavor<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.730> there<00:03:11.940> plus

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
little bit more flavor in there plus

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.910 
little bit more flavor in there plus
it's<00:03:12.570> also<00:03:12.750> got<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.230> slight<00:03:13.470> thermogenic

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
it's also got a slight thermogenic

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.220 
it's also got a slight thermogenic
effect<00:03:14.160> helping<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.239> increase<00:03:15.750> our<00:03:15.930> body's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
effect helping to increase our body's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.210 
effect helping to increase our body's
ability<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.160> burn<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.700> calories<00:03:17.910> at<00:03:18.299> rest

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
ability to burn more calories at rest

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.479 
ability to burn more calories at rest
and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:20.609> one<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.570> our<00:03:21.630> supplements<00:03:22.200> here

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
and then one of our supplements here

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.080 
and then one of our supplements here
three<00:03:23.489> grams<00:03:23.730> of<00:03:24.060> glutamine<00:03:25.730> this<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.880> mainly

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
three grams of glutamine this is mainly

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.860 
three grams of glutamine this is mainly
if<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.570> post-workout<00:03:29.480> addition<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.600> go<00:03:30.750> in

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
if it's a post-workout addition to go in

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.660 
if it's a post-workout addition to go in
there<00:03:31.019> this<00:03:31.260> will<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.530> our<00:03:31.920> kind<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.489> muscle

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
there this will be our kind of muscle

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.270 
there this will be our kind of muscle
protector<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:33.959> to<00:03:34.049> help<00:03:34.230> refuel<00:03:34.769> our<00:03:34.890> muscles

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
protector but to help refuel our muscles

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.539 
protector but to help refuel our muscles
with<00:03:35.459> those<00:03:35.640> lost<00:03:35.970> essential<00:03:36.570> amino<00:03:36.840> acids

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
with those lost essential amino acids

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.960 
with those lost essential amino acids
almost<00:03:38.549> done

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
almost done

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.479 
almost done
final<00:03:39.510> thing<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.810> want<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.049> add<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.459> might<00:03:41.459> not

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
final thing I want to add in might not

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.400 
final thing I want to add in might not
think<00:03:41.820> about<00:03:42.120> putting<00:03:42.299> in<00:03:42.570> a<00:03:42.810> protein<00:03:43.230> shake

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
think about putting in a protein shake

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.199 
think about putting in a protein shake
but<00:03:43.859> like<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.160> said<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.519> is<00:03:44.640> more<00:03:44.790> of<00:03:44.880> an<00:03:45.000> ice

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
but like I said this is more of an ice

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.319 
but like I said this is more of an ice
cream<00:03:45.450> next<00:03:46.130> couple<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.220> handfuls<00:03:47.400> of<00:03:47.820> raisins

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
cream next couple of handfuls of raisins

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.559 
cream next couple of handfuls of raisins
so<00:03:49.109> again<00:03:49.290> three<00:03:49.620> different<00:03:49.890> sources<00:03:50.190> of

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
so again three different sources of

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.180 
so again three different sources of
carbohydrates<00:03:51.569> in<00:03:51.690> there<00:03:51.840> ranging<00:03:52.290> in<00:03:52.530> kind

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
carbohydrates in there ranging in kind

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.699 
carbohydrates in there ranging in kind
of<00:03:53.220> glycemic<00:03:53.819> index<00:03:54.209> level<00:03:54.540> plus<00:03:55.260> it<00:03:55.410> adds<00:03:55.440> a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of glycemic index level plus it adds a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.380 
of glycemic index level plus it adds a
little<00:03:55.829> bit<00:03:55.920> more<00:03:56.130> consistency<00:03:56.670> so<00:03:57.000> once<00:03:57.239> we

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
little bit more consistency so once we

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.539 
little bit more consistency so once we
get<00:03:57.510> it<00:03:57.630> out<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.200> freezer<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.799> we<00:03:59.160> eat<00:03:59.370> it

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
get it out of the freezer and we eat it

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.979 
get it out of the freezer and we eat it
we<00:03:59.819> got<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.090> little<00:04:00.329> bit<00:04:00.419> more<00:04:00.540> texture<00:04:00.900> in

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
we got a little bit more texture in

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.289 
we got a little bit more texture in
there<00:04:01.229> that<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.440> can<00:04:01.470> bite<00:04:01.709> into<00:04:01.919> and<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:03.060> whole

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
there that we can bite into and a whole

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.070 
there that we can bite into and a whole
host<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.690> flavors

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.699 

just<00:04:07.080> get<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.290> on

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.020 

and<00:04:14.709> that's<00:04:14.890> why<00:04:15.069> we<00:04:15.190> need<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.489> powerful

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
and that's why we need a powerful

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.789 
and that's why we need a powerful
blender<00:04:16.570> so<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:16.750> can<00:04:16.900> really<00:04:17.109> mix<00:04:17.380> all<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
blender so we can really mix all of the

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.460 
blender so we can really mix all of the
ice<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.329> everything<00:04:19.480> looking<00:04:19.930> smooth

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
ice and get everything looking smooth

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.340 
ice and get everything looking smooth
you'll<00:04:20.650> see<00:04:20.859> when<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.040> pour<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.340> into<00:04:21.489> our<00:04:21.609> tray

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
you'll see when I pour it into our tray

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.540 
you'll see when I pour it into our tray
that<00:04:23.350> reminds<00:04:23.650> me<00:04:23.800> if<00:04:23.889> you<00:04:23.949> have<00:04:24.130> any<00:04:24.340> of<00:04:24.460> those

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
that reminds me if you have any of those

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.210 
that reminds me if you have any of those
icicle<00:04:25.210> trays<00:04:25.449> this<00:04:25.840> makes<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.290> great<00:04:26.470> protein

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
icicle trays this makes a great protein

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.960 
icicle trays this makes a great protein
popsicle<00:04:30.479> see<00:04:31.479> just<00:04:31.750> how<00:04:31.870> thick<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.410> creamy

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
popsicle see just how thick and creamy

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:40.499 
popsicle see just how thick and creamy
and<00:04:33.970> make<00:04:34.150> sure<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.419> now

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.760 

lovely<00:04:41.509> right<00:04:41.780> I'm<00:04:42.020> gonna<00:04:42.169> get<00:04:42.319> the<00:04:42.379> lid<00:04:42.590> on

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
lovely right I'm gonna get the lid on

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.850 
lovely right I'm gonna get the lid on
that<00:04:42.949> this<00:04:43.729> goes<00:04:44.030> in<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.300> freezer<00:04:44.479> for<00:04:44.719> one<00:04:45.259> to

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
that this goes in the freezer for one to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.330 
that this goes in the freezer for one to
two<00:04:46.129> hours<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:48.139> like<00:04:48.409> I<00:04:48.590> said<00:04:48.800> this<00:04:48.919> is<00:04:49.129> about

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
two hours and like I said this is about

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.830 
two hours and like I said this is about
three<00:04:49.639> servings<00:04:50.090> altogether<00:04:50.569> with<00:04:50.810> the

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
three servings altogether with the

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.300 
three servings altogether with the
amount<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.139> protein<00:04:51.319> and<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.979> different

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
amount of protein and the different

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.070 
amount of protein and the different
fruits<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:52.819> carbohydrates<00:04:53.509> we<00:04:53.689> added<00:04:53.960> in

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
fruits and carbohydrates we added in

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.589 
fruits and carbohydrates we added in
which<00:04:54.680> works<00:04:54.919> out<00:04:55.099> to<00:04:55.159> be<00:04:55.279> about<00:04:55.460> 35<00:04:56.060> grams<00:04:56.330> of

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
which works out to be about 35 grams of

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.350 
which works out to be about 35 grams of
complete<00:04:57.020> amino<00:04:57.680> acids<00:04:58.069> so<00:04:58.550> full<00:04:59.060> range<00:04:59.240> of

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
complete amino acids so full range of

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.390 
complete amino acids so full range of
protein<00:04:59.689> in<00:04:59.810> there<00:05:00.069> carbohydrates<00:05:01.069> what<00:05:01.279> we

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
protein in there carbohydrates what we

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.950 
protein in there carbohydrates what we
have<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.729> range<00:05:02.029> of<00:05:02.180> different<00:05:02.240> mixtures<00:05:02.810> in

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
have a range of different mixtures in

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.959 
have a range of different mixtures in
there<00:05:03.139> it's<00:05:03.499> coming<00:05:03.770> in<00:05:03.860> about<00:05:04.099> 30<00:05:04.370> grams<00:05:04.639> and

00:05:04.959 --> 00:05:04.969 
there it's coming in about 30 grams and

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.480 
there it's coming in about 30 grams and
fats<00:05:05.270> we're<00:05:05.810> looking<00:05:06.050> at<00:05:06.229> about<00:05:06.319> 4<00:05:06.830> to<00:05:07.039> 5<00:05:07.069> grams

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
fats we're looking at about 4 to 5 grams

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.019 
fats we're looking at about 4 to 5 grams
so<00:05:08.680> much<00:05:09.680> better<00:05:09.919> than<00:05:10.099> the<00:05:10.370> normal<00:05:10.520> ice<00:05:10.789> cream

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:11.029 
so much better than the normal ice cream

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:13.119 
so much better than the normal ice cream
and<00:05:11.240> a<00:05:11.659> much<00:05:11.900> higher<00:05:12.080> protein<00:05:12.349> content<00:05:12.680> so

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:13.129 
and a much higher protein content so

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:15.219 
and a much higher protein content so
we'll<00:05:13.699> put<00:05:13.909> this<00:05:14.210> in<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:14.539> freezer<00:05:14.750> and<00:05:15.020> get<00:05:15.139> it

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
we'll put this in the freezer and get it

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:22.110 
we'll put this in the freezer and get it
out<00:05:15.349> and<00:05:15.560> check<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:15.979> about<00:05:16.219> an<00:05:16.310> hour's<00:05:16.490> time

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.879 

I've<00:05:23.120> only<00:05:23.240> had<00:05:23.419> it<00:05:23.569> in<00:05:23.629> the<00:05:23.689> freezer<00:05:24.080> for<00:05:24.110> just

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
I've only had it in the freezer for just

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.700 
I've only had it in the freezer for just
under<00:05:25.129> an<00:05:25.219> hour<00:05:25.340> so<00:05:25.849> it's<00:05:26.060> probably<00:05:26.330> yep<00:05:27.199> still

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
under an hour so it's probably yep still

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.200 
under an hour so it's probably yep still
a<00:05:27.770> little<00:05:28.099> bit<00:05:28.250> more<00:05:28.400> like<00:05:28.580> a<00:05:28.729> creme<00:05:29.090> brulee

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
a little bit more like a creme brulee

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.790 
a little bit more like a creme brulee
than<00:05:29.960> ice<00:05:30.289> cream

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
than ice cream

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.700 
than ice cream
but<00:05:31.370> you<00:05:31.699> get<00:05:31.849> the<00:05:31.969> idea<00:05:32.000> and<00:05:32.539> you<00:05:33.379> Sprint's

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
but you get the idea and you Sprint's

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.499 
but you get the idea and you Sprint's
them<00:05:33.830> up<00:05:33.919> here<00:05:34.159> around<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.580> outside<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:38.419> know

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
them up here around the outside you know

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.170 
them up here around the outside you know
if<00:05:38.659> this<00:05:38.779> makes<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.229> great<00:05:39.620> dessert<00:05:40.249> or<00:05:40.849> just

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
if this makes a great dessert or just

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.209 
if this makes a great dessert or just
something<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.629> little<00:05:41.839> different<00:05:42.169> than<00:05:42.349> your

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
something a little different than your

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.490 
something a little different than your
average<00:05:43.279> protein<00:05:43.819> shake<00:05:44.199> anything<00:05:45.199> it's

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
average protein shake anything it's

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.689 
average protein shake anything it's
something<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:45.979> you<00:05:46.069> can<00:05:46.189> actually<00:05:46.490> eat

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
something that you can actually eat

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.360 
something that you can actually eat
which<00:05:46.969> for<00:05:47.210> me<00:05:47.330> I<00:05:47.539> always<00:05:48.229> prefer<00:05:48.560> eating<00:05:48.979> over

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
which for me I always prefer eating over

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.969 
which for me I always prefer eating over
drinking<00:05:49.669> something<00:05:50.650> so<00:05:51.650> we<00:05:51.740> can<00:05:51.830> probably

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
drinking something so we can probably

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.779 
drinking something so we can probably
get<00:05:52.219> three<00:05:52.520> servings<00:05:52.969> out<00:05:53.120> of<00:05:53.210> this<00:05:54.580> we<00:05:55.580> said

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:55.789 
get three servings out of this we said

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.139 
get three servings out of this we said
that<00:05:55.819> was<00:05:56.000> about<00:05:56.210> 35<00:05:56.719> grams<00:05:56.960> of<00:05:57.289> protein<00:05:58.009> 30<00:05:58.729> 35

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
that was about 35 grams of protein 30 35

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:02.100 
that was about 35 grams of protein 30 35
grams<00:05:59.419> of<00:05:59.659> carbs<00:06:00.020> and<00:06:00.199> less<00:06:00.979> than<00:06:01.129> 5<00:06:01.370> grams<00:06:01.639> of

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110

grams of carbs and less than 5 grams of
fat

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.280 

great<00:06:07.670> combination<00:06:08.030> of<00:06:08.360> flavors<00:06:08.600> in<00:06:09.110> there

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
great combination of flavors in there

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:11.170 
great combination of flavors in there
and<00:06:09.470> with<00:06:09.590> an<00:06:09.770> extra<00:06:10.100> hour<00:06:10.280> in<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.910> freezer

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.260 
and with an extra hour in the freezer
that<00:06:11.720> would<00:06:11.870> have<00:06:11.960> set<00:06:12.170> firm<00:06:12.410> like<00:06:12.740> ice<00:06:12.980> cream

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
that would have set firm like ice cream

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.490 
that would have set firm like ice cream
anyway<00:06:14.270> that<00:06:14.450> pretty<00:06:14.660> much<00:06:14.780> wraps<00:06:15.020> up<00:06:15.290> our
