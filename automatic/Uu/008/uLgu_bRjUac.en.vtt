power<00:00:39.570> shifts<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> NFC<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:40.800> he<00:00:40.950> moves<00:00:41.190> were

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
power shifts in the NFC if he moves were

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.690 
power shifts in the NFC if he moves were
made<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.760> huge<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> biggest<00:00:43.800> move<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.309> think

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
made a huge the biggest move I think

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420 
made a huge the biggest move I think
that<00:00:45.000> happened<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.600> when<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.320> Eagles<00:00:46.770> cut

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that happened was when the Eagles cut

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.569 
that happened was when the Eagles cut
Westbrook's<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.170> thought<00:00:49.680> he<00:00:49.920> was<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
Westbrook's because I thought he was the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
Westbrook's because I thought he was the
heart<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.239> team<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.629> thought<00:00:51.809> he<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
heart of that team I thought he was the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.250 
heart of that team I thought he was the
reason<00:00:52.680> why<00:00:53.039> they<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.940> know<00:00:53.969> we're<00:00:54.600> not<00:00:54.870> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
reason why they you know we're not that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
reason why they you know we're not that
good<00:00:55.320> last<00:00:56.039> year<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:57.030> were<00:00:57.090> good

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
good last year you know they were good

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.849 
good last year you know they were good
but<00:00:57.690> they<00:00:57.809> were<00:00:57.930> missing<00:00:58.379> something<00:00:58.710> I<00:00:58.800> think

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
but they were missing something I think

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.990 
but they were missing something I think
it<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.809> stability<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> uh<00:01:02.000> Westbrook's

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
it was the stability that uh Westbrook's

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
it was the stability that uh Westbrook's
provided<00:01:03.930> for<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> team<00:01:04.439> he<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> killer

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
provided for that team he was a killer

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.490 
provided for that team he was a killer
he<00:01:05.610> killed<00:01:05.909> us<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.270> many<00:01:06.450> occasions<00:01:07.140> he<00:01:07.229> killed

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
he killed us on many occasions he killed

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.910 
he killed us on many occasions he killed
the<00:01:07.619> Giants<00:01:08.100> he<00:01:08.549> was<00:01:08.729> he<00:01:09.180> was<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.780> god<00:01:10.200> now

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the Giants he was he was the god now

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.160 
the Giants he was he was the god now
that<00:01:11.130> he's<00:01:11.280> gone<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:12.299> know<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.869> look

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
that he's gone you know they don't look

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.170 
that he's gone you know they don't look
as<00:01:13.409> strong<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.369> know<00:01:14.490> expecially<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.060> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
as strong you know expecially with that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
as strong you know expecially with that
defense<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.810> being<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.229> was<00:01:16.470> they<00:01:17.159> seem

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
defense not being what it was they seem

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.310 
defense not being what it was they seem
to<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.119> dropped<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.080> mind

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to have dropped a little bit in my mind

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700 
to have dropped a little bit in my mind
I<00:01:19.530> hope<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.460> reality<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.710> Giants

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I hope that is reality to the Giants

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740 
I hope that is reality to the Giants
they<00:01:22.860> improved<00:01:23.220> themselves<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:24.299> with

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
they improved themselves you know with

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.340 
they improved themselves you know with
in<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.890> secondary<00:01:26.340> which<00:01:26.640> was<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.840> needed

in the secondary which was they needed

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.590 
in the secondary which was they needed
to<00:01:28.710> improve<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.759> were<00:01:29.820> decimated

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to improve because they were decimated

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.020 
to improve because they were decimated
by<00:01:30.810> injuries<00:01:31.140> last<00:01:31.439> year<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:31.890> last<00:01:32.759> year<00:01:33.000> I

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
tight in which is always good if you're

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.020

Taylor's<00:02:58.170> well<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:58.920> still<00:02:59.160> very

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
Taylor's well I think it's still very

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.570 
Taylor's well I think it's still very
very<00:02:59.700> very<00:03:00.210> good<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.780> effective<00:03:01.110> then<00:03:01.980> I

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
very very good and effective then I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.160 
very very good and effective then I
think<00:03:02.970> they'd<00:03:03.150> be<00:03:03.210> getting<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.630> course<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:04.080> his

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
think they'd be getting of course to his

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.750 
think they'd be getting of course to his
preference<00:03:04.650> going<00:03:04.920> back<00:03:05.100> there<00:03:05.280> into<00:03:05.550> what

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
preference going back there into what

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.390 
preference going back there into what
the<00:03:05.940> words<00:03:06.150> of<00:03:06.380> what's<00:03:07.380> ur<00:03:07.530> life<00:03:07.800> coming<00:03:08.250> back

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
the words of what's ur life coming back

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.310 
the words of what's ur life coming back
so<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> defense<00:03:09.120> should<00:03:09.300> be<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.540> lot<00:03:10.080> better

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
so the defense should be a lot better

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.840 
so the defense should be a lot better
than<00:03:10.620> last<00:03:10.650> year<00:03:11.010> because<00:03:11.100> you<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.520> you'll

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
than last year because you get to you'll

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.390 
than last year because you get to you'll
have<00:03:12.000> two<00:03:12.240> superstars<00:03:12.630> on<00:03:13.080> there<00:03:13.320> that<00:03:13.500> wasn't

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
have two superstars on there that wasn't

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.160 
have two superstars on there that wasn't
on<00:03:14.490> that<00:03:14.520> defense<00:03:15.090> last<00:03:15.330> year<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:15.840> it's<00:03:16.020> going

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
on that defense last year so it's going

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.680 
on that defense last year so it's going
to<00:03:16.230> be<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.350> lot<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:17.580> then<00:03:17.760> marks<00:03:18.150> coming<00:03:18.360> in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
to be a lot of and then marks coming in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.800 
to be a lot of and then marks coming in
I<00:03:19.850> think<00:03:20.850> it's<00:03:21.120> going<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.330> take<00:03:21.510> them<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.780> while

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
I think it's going to take them a while

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.140 
I think it's going to take them a while
to<00:03:21.990> master<00:03:22.709> marks<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.130> often<00:03:23.520> so<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> don't<00:03:24.060> know

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
to master marks is often so I don't know

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.390 
to master marks is often so I don't know
what<00:03:24.330> worry<00:03:24.570> about<00:03:24.840> them<00:03:25.050> to<00:03:25.200> Nick<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.040> next

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.190 
what worry about them to Nick this next

Chicago<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:28.950> looks<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> could<00:03:29.580> be

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
Chicago that looks like it could be

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.180 
Chicago that looks like it could be
could<00:03:30.390> be<00:03:30.450> farmable<00:03:30.959> so<00:03:31.470> teams<00:03:31.800> that<00:03:32.040> look

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
could be farmable so teams that look

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.520

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
with us the only thing that I think we

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.600 
with us the only thing that I think we
can<00:04:11.550> do<00:04:11.730> is<00:04:11.970> uh<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.620> think<00:04:13.620> it's<00:04:13.980> time<00:04:14.190> for<00:04:14.459> let

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
can do is uh I think it's time for let

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.970 
can do is uh I think it's time for let
the<00:04:14.730> Marion<00:04:15.060> Marion<00:04:15.570> Barber<00:04:15.900> go<00:04:16.169> and<00:04:16.500> work

the Marion Marion Barber go and work
somewhere<00:04:17.370> else<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.030> he<00:04:18.180> got<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.600> he'll

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
somewhere else I think he got the he'll

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.530 
somewhere else I think he got the he'll
he'll<00:04:19.200> still<00:04:19.530> do<00:04:20.280> something<00:04:20.820> good<00:04:21.060> for<00:04:21.120> some

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
he'll still do something good for some

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.530 
he'll still do something good for some
other<00:04:21.690> team<00:04:21.989> but<00:04:22.320> I<00:04:22.350> think<00:04:22.680> here<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.419> think<00:04:24.419> it's

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
other team but I think here I think it's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.170 
other team but I think here I think it's
time<00:04:24.750> for<00:04:24.780> us<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.220> part<00:04:26.220> ways

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
time for us to part ways

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.659 
time for us to part ways
like<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.229> said<00:04:28.350> I've<00:04:28.530> always<00:04:28.830> loved<00:04:29.370> Mary

like I said I've always loved Mary
Barbara<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.180> just<00:04:30.419> think<00:04:30.600> that<00:04:30.900> we<00:04:31.590> can<00:04:31.889> replace

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
Barbara I just think that we can replace

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.200 
Barbara I just think that we can replace
his<00:04:32.880> production<00:04:33.630> with<00:04:33.840> day<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.289> with<00:04:35.280> with

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
his production with day on with with

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.240 
his production with day on with with
even<00:04:37.070> choice<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.490> know<00:04:38.610> I'm<00:04:38.759> saying<00:04:39.000> so<00:04:39.240> I

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
even choice you know I'm saying so I

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.860 
even choice you know I'm saying so I
that's<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.460> only<00:04:41.699> move<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.090> think<00:04:42.360> we<00:04:42.509> can<00:04:42.660> make

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
that's the only move I think we can make

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.980 
that's the only move I think we can make
but<00:04:43.650> anything<00:04:44.370> other<00:04:44.580> than<00:04:44.789> that<00:04:45.000> I'm<00:04:45.389> good

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
but anything other than that I'm good

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.969 
but anything other than that I'm good
deal<00:04:46.620> with<00:04:46.740> everything<00:04:47.100> um<00:04:48.770> I've<00:04:49.770> been

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
deal with everything um I've been

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.270 
deal with everything um I've been
walking<00:04:50.250> around<00:04:50.520> because<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.419> Bradford<00:04:52.280> it's

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
walking around because of Bradford it's

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.730 
walking around because of Bradford it's
just<00:04:53.639> a<00:04:53.729> dumb<00:04:53.970> decision<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:55.020> just<00:04:55.320> don't<00:04:55.470> think

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
just a dumb decision I just don't think

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.320 
just a dumb decision I just don't think
they<00:04:56.070> should<00:04:56.100> go<00:04:56.460> over<00:04:56.580> Brad<00:04:56.789> I<00:04:56.970> think<00:04:57.000> that

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
they should go over Brad I think that

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.060 
they should go over Brad I think that
you<00:04:57.449> should<00:04:57.479> go<00:04:57.780> for<00:04:57.990> sue<00:04:58.169> because<00:04:58.680> they<00:04:58.919> got

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
you should go for sue because they got

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.770 
you should go for sue because they got
those<00:04:59.190> other<00:04:59.430> defense<00:04:59.820> being<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.479> you<00:05:00.750> know

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
those other defense being in you know

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.080 
those other defense being in you know
that<00:05:01.080> they<00:05:01.229> draft<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:01.830> so<00:05:01.979> if<00:05:02.280> you<00:05:02.370> get<00:05:02.699> sued

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
that they draft and so if you get sued

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.150 
that they draft and so if you get sued
you<00:05:03.570> make<00:05:03.840> those<00:05:04.020> defense<00:05:04.470> ends<00:05:04.860> better

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
you make those defense ends better

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.159 
you make those defense ends better
because<00:05:05.580> they're<00:05:05.699> going<00:05:05.849> to<00:05:05.910> be<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.509> wasting

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
because they're going to be just wasting

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.900 
because they're going to be just wasting
too<00:05:07.349> much<00:05:07.380> time<00:05:07.530> trying<00:05:08.099> to<00:05:08.220> stop<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.699> I've

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
too much time trying to stop so I've

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.270 
too much time trying to stop so I've
never<00:05:09.090> seen<00:05:09.360> anybody<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.930> dominant<00:05:10.740> so<00:05:11.250> I

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
never seen anybody that dominant so I

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360 
never seen anybody that dominant so I
think<00:05:11.789> if<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.270> Rams<00:05:12.509> don't<00:05:13.110> get<00:05:13.410> sue<00:05:13.710> or<00:05:14.009> tray

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
think if the Rams don't get sue or tray

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.969 
think if the Rams don't get sue or tray
down<00:05:14.639> they're<00:05:15.060> just<00:05:15.300> silly<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:16.440> I'm<00:05:16.740> very

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
down they're just silly so I'm very

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.560 
down they're just silly so I'm very
interested<00:05:17.460> in<00:05:17.759> watch<00:05:17.880> what<00:05:18.090> they<00:05:18.240> do<00:05:18.300> and
