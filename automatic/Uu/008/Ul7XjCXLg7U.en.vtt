00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.270 
socket you got one made it and you got a
corded<00:01:41.140> so<00:01:41.259> all<00:01:41.380> you<00:01:41.470> need<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:41.649> a<00:01:41.740> branch<00:01:42.040> of

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
corded so all you need is a branch of

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.060 
corded so all you need is a branch of
fire<00:01:42.520> board<00:01:42.790> we<00:01:43.479> designed<00:01:43.840> this<00:01:44.070> little

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
fire board we designed this little

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.590 
fire board we designed this little
section<00:01:45.250> here<00:01:45.430> because<00:01:45.729> look<00:01:46.119> at<00:01:46.180> while<00:01:46.450> the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
section here because look at while the

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.270 
section here because look at while the
weight<00:01:46.780> is<00:01:46.930> on<00:01:47.080> this<00:01:47.229> thing<00:01:47.440> I've<00:01:47.860> got<00:01:48.009> three

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
weight is on this thing I've got three

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.649 
weight is on this thing I've got three
fingers<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.880> there<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:49.299> holding<00:01:49.540> this

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
fingers on there just holding this

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.690 
fingers on there just holding this
little<00:01:49.990> grip<00:01:50.170> here<00:01:50.350> so<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:50.770> choke<00:01:50.979> up<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
little grip here so you can choke up and

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.880 
little grip here so you can choke up and
do<00:01:51.880> more<00:01:52.090> intense<00:01:52.720> work<00:01:53.020> with<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.649> also

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
do more intense work with it it also

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.830 
do more intense work with it it also

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
it they won't slide past you you got

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.609 
it they won't slide past you you got
your<00:01:57.850> nice<00:01:58.030> draw<00:01:58.330> something<00:01:59.140> the<00:01:59.200> saw<00:01:59.409> edge

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
your nice draw something the saw edge

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.060 
your nice draw something the saw edge
here<00:02:00.750> look<00:02:01.750> at<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:01.990> just<00:02:02.470> since<00:02:02.679> right<00:02:02.890> down

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
here look at that just since right down

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.070 
here look at that just since right down
there<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.399> gets<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.670> right<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.750> baton

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
there and gets it right you have a baton

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.419 
there and gets it right you have a baton
each<00:02:05.229> edge<00:02:05.380> here<00:02:05.590> from<00:02:05.740> batani

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
each edge here from batani

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:09.090 
each edge here from batani
if<00:02:06.640> you've<00:02:06.909> got<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.090> scrape<00:02:07.450> full<00:02:08.440> grip<00:02:08.769> with

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
if you've got a scrape full grip with

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.979 
if you've got a scrape full grip with
another<00:02:09.399> hand<00:02:09.700> to<00:02:09.880> scrape<00:02:10.330> on<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.780> thing

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
another hand to scrape on this thing

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.230 
another hand to scrape on this thing
even<00:02:11.290> using<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> draw<00:02:11.980> blade<00:02:12.220> edge

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
even using the draw blade edge

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.760 
even using the draw blade edge
you<00:02:13.330> can<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.780> all<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.020> Spears<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.590> can

for let's say you got bananas or some

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270 
for let's say you got bananas or some
high<00:02:19.630> in<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> tree<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.200> can't<00:02:20.440> reach<00:02:20.620> it<00:02:20.830> gets

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
high in the tree you can't reach it gets

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.640 
high in the tree you can't reach it gets
your<00:02:21.490> pole<00:02:21.760> lash<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:22.690> to<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.500> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
your pole lash it to this with that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.010 
your pole lash it to this with that
piece<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:23.860> parachute<00:02:24.730> cord<00:02:24.760> lash<00:02:25.600> it<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.900> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
piece of parachute cord lash it to the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.900 
piece of parachute cord lash it to the
pole<00:02:26.230> now<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.740> can<00:02:27.010> reach<00:02:27.130> quite<00:02:27.430> higher<00:02:27.670> it's

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
pole now you can reach quite higher it's

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.820 
pole now you can reach quite higher it's
a<00:02:27.970> heavier<00:02:28.330> like<00:02:28.660> a<00:02:28.690> Halliburton<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:29.680> can
