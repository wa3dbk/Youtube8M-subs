fish these bouncers it's important to
keep<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.450> 45-degree<00:02:29.230> angle<00:02:29.620> so<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:29.980> know

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
keep that 45-degree angle so you know

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.650 
keep that 45-degree angle so you know
how<00:02:30.310> far<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.880> bottom<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.180> your<00:02:31.270> bouncer

going to do is going to let it down let
Hitler<00:03:48.820> bottom<00:03:49.209> one<00:03:49.390> time<00:03:49.660> you'll<00:03:49.900> feel<00:03:50.110> a

Hitler bottom one time you'll feel a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.440 
Hitler bottom one time you'll feel a
pretty<00:03:50.410> distinct<00:03:50.739> thud<00:03:51.100> when<00:03:52.000> he<00:03:52.060> gets<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
pretty distinct thud when he gets to the

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.020 
pretty distinct thud when he gets to the
bottom

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.580 

there<00:03:55.690> doesn't<00:03:55.900> hit<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.080> bottom<00:03:56.440> right<00:03:56.560> there

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
there doesn't hit the bottom right there

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.920 
there doesn't hit the bottom right there
so<00:03:57.130> I<00:03:57.160> asked<00:03:57.490> our<00:03:57.700> forty<00:03:58.090> feet<00:03:58.330> we<00:03:58.569> went<00:03:58.750> 30

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
so I asked our forty feet we went 30

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.930 
so I asked our forty feet we went 30
feet<00:03:59.140> down<00:03:59.319> if<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.100> stop<00:04:00.400> there<00:04:00.640> and<00:04:00.760> putting

the rod holder right here water

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.960 
the rod holder right here water
pressures<00:04:02.950> gonna<00:04:03.069> lift<00:04:03.250> that<00:04:03.400> bouncer<00:04:03.819> about

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
pressures gonna lift that bouncer about

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:05.520 
pressures gonna lift that bouncer about
a<00:04:04.000> foot<00:04:04.240> and<00:04:04.300> a<00:04:04.360> half<00:04:04.480> almost<00:04:04.840> two<00:04:05.200> feet<00:04:05.380> off

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
a foot and a half almost two feet off

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.140 
a foot and a half almost two feet off
the<00:04:05.590> bottom<00:04:05.709> but<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.459> want<00:04:06.640> to<00:04:06.700> be<00:04:06.760> close<00:04:06.970> for

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
the bottom but I want to be close for

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.400 
the bottom but I want to be close for
the<00:04:07.270> fish<00:04:07.390> were<00:04:07.510> seen<00:04:07.690> on<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> graph<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.230> right

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
the fish were seen on the graph of right

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.140 
the fish were seen on the graph of right
tight<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.860> bottom<00:04:09.040> I'm<00:04:09.670> going<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.850> hold<00:04:10.030> it

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
tight to the bottom I'm going to hold it

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.550 
tight to the bottom I'm going to hold it
about<00:04:10.240> 10<00:04:10.569> seconds<00:04:10.990> so<00:04:11.050> that<00:04:11.080> water<00:04:11.350> pressure

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
about 10 seconds so that water pressure

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.559 
about 10 seconds so that water pressure
lifts<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.220> I'll<00:04:12.760> let<00:04:12.970> some<00:04:13.150> more<00:04:13.330> line<00:04:13.540> out

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
lifts it I'll let some more line out

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.210 
lifts it I'll let some more line out
still<00:04:14.080> keep<00:04:14.230> my<00:04:14.380> thumb<00:04:14.530> on<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.739> spool<00:04:15.010> just

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
still keep my thumb on the spool just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.090 
still keep my thumb on the spool just
keep<00:04:15.370> it<00:04:15.489> tight<00:04:15.700> pressure<00:04:16.680> there's<00:04:17.680> by<00:04:17.889> on<00:04:18.010> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
keep it tight pressure there's by on the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.530 
keep it tight pressure there's by on the
second<00:04:18.459> time<00:04:18.609> that<00:04:18.820> will<00:04:18.940> bring<00:04:19.090> it<00:04:19.209> up<00:04:19.299> about

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
second time that will bring it up about

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.539 
second time that will bring it up about
12<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.019> 15<00:04:20.320> inches<00:04:20.380> off<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.709> bottom<00:04:20.950> that's

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
12 to 15 inches off the bottom that's

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.770 
12 to 15 inches off the bottom that's
where<00:04:21.730> we're<00:04:21.820> gonna<00:04:21.880> leave<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.360> we're<00:04:22.660> gonna

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
where we're gonna leave it we're gonna

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
where we're gonna leave it we're gonna
do<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:24.540> engage<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.750> reel<00:04:25.900> right<00:04:26.110> about<00:04:26.320> 45

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
do that engage the reel right about 45

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.870 
do that engage the reel right about 45
feet<00:04:27.040> and<00:04:27.190> now<00:04:27.250> we're<00:04:27.370> just<00:04:27.400> gonna<00:04:27.580> put<00:04:27.760> on<00:04:27.820> the

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
feet and now we're just gonna put on the

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850 
feet and now we're just gonna put on the
rod<00:04:28.060> holder<00:04:28.450> for<00:04:29.020> this<00:04:29.140> type<00:04:29.350> of<00:04:29.380> fish<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:29.740> like

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
rod holder for this type of fish I like

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.070 
rod holder for this type of fish I like
cradle<00:04:30.280> round<00:04:30.490> holders<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:31.600> rod<00:04:31.810> will<00:04:31.990> a

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
cradle round holders so the rod will a

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.280 
cradle round holders so the rod will a
parallel<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.040> water<00:04:33.940> line<00:04:34.210> just<00:04:34.510> like

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
parallel to the water line just like

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.990 
parallel to the water line just like
that<00:04:35.410> when<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.800> see<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.040> rod<00:04:36.220> tip<00:04:36.430> load<00:04:36.640> up<00:04:36.820> I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
that when I see the rod tip load up I

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:50.960 
that when I see the rod tip load up I
got<00:04:37.240> a<00:04:37.270> fish<00:04:37.510> that's<00:04:37.900> simple

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.490 

I<00:04:51.530> see<00:04:52.530> by<00:04:52.680> using<00:04:52.740> live<00:04:53.220> powder<00:04:53.670> I<00:04:53.880> was<00:04:54.750> 47<00:04:55.380> feet

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
I see by using live powder I was 47 feet

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.350 
I see by using live powder I was 47 feet
bag<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.920> can<00:04:56.010> put<00:04:56.160> this<00:04:56.250> one<00:04:56.430> right<00:04:56.460> back<00:04:56.760> 47

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
bag I can put this one right back 47

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.030 
bag I can put this one right back 47
feet<00:04:57.510> cold<00:04:58.110> so<00:04:58.230> everyone<00:04:58.470> needs<00:04:58.590> to<00:04:58.740> eat<00:04:58.860> just
