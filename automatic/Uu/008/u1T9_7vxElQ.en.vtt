much I think you have some other stuff

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.900 
much I think you have some other stuff
somewhere<00:00:28.830> else<00:00:29.179> here's<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.359> mine

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
somewhere else here's my mine

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.490 

and<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> just<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.690> car<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> saw<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
and this is just a car that I saw on

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.600 
and this is just a car that I saw on
what's<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> code<00:00:37.829> or<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.690> Corrales<00:00:39.690> channel

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
what's the code or on Corrales channel

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
what's the code or on Corrales channel
definitely<00:00:41.610> check<00:00:41.790> them<00:00:41.910> out<00:00:42.110> just<00:00:43.110> being

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
definitely check them out just being

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.119 
definitely check them out just being
here<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.379> which<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:46.980> looks

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
here like this which I think it looks

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.090 
here like this which I think it looks
kind<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.430> cool<00:00:47.610> but<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.329> doesn't<00:00:48.570> really<00:00:48.660> fit

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
kind of cool but it doesn't really fit

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.660 
kind of cool but it doesn't really fit
to<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> rest<00:00:50.460> because<00:00:50.940> well<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.960> isn't<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
to the rest because well this isn't so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.619 
to the rest because well this isn't so
um<00:00:53.930> modern<00:00:54.930> looking<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:56.489> whatever<00:00:56.910> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
um modern looking what up whatever so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.799 
um modern looking what up whatever so
here's<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> tree<00:00:58.289> farm<00:00:59.210> it's<00:01:00.210> very<00:01:00.420> simple

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
here's the tree farm it's very simple

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.920 
here's the tree farm it's very simple
you<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:00.960> plant<00:01:01.379> trees<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.780> get<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
you just plant trees up there get the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
you just plant trees up there get the
wood<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> saplings<00:01:05.489> fall<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.939> through

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
wood and the saplings fall down through

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.859 
wood and the saplings fall down through
water<00:01:06.450> streams<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.460> fall<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.490> out<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
water streams and fall down out here and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.920 
water streams and fall down out here and
I<00:01:10.619> don't<00:01:10.830> have<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> minecart

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
I don't have a minecart

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.399 
I don't have a minecart
over<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.360> automated<00:01:15.360> wheat<00:01:15.600> farm

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.859 

it's<00:01:19.409> not<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> biggest<00:01:20.070> I've<00:01:20.220> ever<00:01:20.430> made<00:01:20.869> but

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869
