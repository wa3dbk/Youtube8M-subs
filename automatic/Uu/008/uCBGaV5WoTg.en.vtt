do we're going to put a level here we

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.859 
do we're going to put a level here we
already<00:01:44.710> know<00:01:45.009> that<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.970> frame<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.450> level

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
already know that the the frame is level

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.210 
already know that the the frame is level
because<00:01:47.020> it's<00:01:47.200> in<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.350> same<00:01:47.619> position<00:01:48.130> as

because it's in the same position as
last<00:01:48.490> frame<00:01:48.820> when<00:01:49.060> we<00:01:49.210> leveled<00:01:50.080> it<00:01:50.200> we're

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
last frame when we leveled it we're

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.800 
last frame when we leveled it we're
going<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.920> put<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.399> level<00:01:52.210> here<00:01:54.330> I'm<00:01:55.330> going<00:01:55.750> to

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
measure this distance so i can make this

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.180 
measure this distance so i can make this
bracket<00:02:05.560> on<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.799> iron<00:02:06.069> worker

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.980 

normally<00:02:12.190> I<00:02:12.460> would<00:02:12.970> never<00:02:13.240> use<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:14.020> Fender<00:02:14.950> as

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
normally I would never use a Fender as

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.800 
normally I would never use a Fender as
something<00:02:16.990> normally<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.280> would<00:02:18.760> never<00:02:19.030> use<00:02:19.390> a

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
something normally I would never use a

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.390 
something normally I would never use a
Fender<00:02:20.740> as<00:02:22.020> something<00:02:23.020> as<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.860> basis<00:02:24.370> for

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
Fender as something as a basis for

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.210 
Fender as something as a basis for
something<00:02:24.880> structural<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:27.130> I

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
something structural like this but I

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.980 
something structural like this but I
feel<00:02:27.400> comfortable<00:02:27.820> doing<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.540> two

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
feel comfortable doing it for two

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.980 
feel comfortable doing it for two
reasons<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.680> we've<00:02:30.040> got<00:02:30.070> frame<00:02:30.840> we've<00:02:31.840> got<00:02:31.960> a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
reasons one we've got frame we've got a

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.800 
reasons one we've got frame we've got a
frame<00:02:32.320> attachment<00:02:33.240> that's<00:02:34.240> going<00:02:34.420> to<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.570> top

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
frame attachment that's going to be top

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.380 
frame attachment that's going to be top
and<00:02:35.020> bottom<00:02:35.460> which<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.580> don't<00:02:36.730> get<00:02:36.880> any<00:02:37.030> you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
and bottom which you don't get any you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.090 
and bottom which you don't get any you
don't<00:02:37.570> get<00:02:37.690> any<00:02:37.870> better<00:02:38.020> more<00:02:38.590> stronger<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
don't get any better more stronger on a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.130 
don't get any better more stronger on a
bike<00:02:39.310> to<00:02:39.459> the<00:02:39.490> frame<00:02:39.850> the<00:02:40.300> frames<00:02:40.540> not<00:02:40.810> strong

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
bike to the frame the frames not strong

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.230 
bike to the frame the frames not strong
enough<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.500> got<00:02:41.650> way<00:02:41.890> way<00:02:42.370> bigger<00:02:42.610> problems

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
enough you got way way bigger problems

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.850 
enough you got way way bigger problems
than<00:02:43.450> just<00:02:44.080> how<00:02:44.200> you're<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.560> mount<00:02:44.740> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
than just how you're going to mount a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.880 
than just how you're going to mount a
chain<00:02:45.100> tensioner<00:02:45.640> okay<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:47.440> other<00:02:47.560> thing<00:02:47.860> is

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
chain tensioner okay the other thing is

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.190 
chain tensioner okay the other thing is
this<00:02:48.640> spacer<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.510> that<00:02:49.900> we're<00:02:50.020> going<00:02:50.140> to

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
this spacer here that we're going to

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
this spacer here that we're going to
make<00:02:50.350> and<00:02:50.620> put<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.100> really<00:02:51.430> going<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
make and put on is really going to

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.699 
make and put on is really going to
mainly<00:02:52.060> act<00:02:52.270> as<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> stiffener<00:02:53.140> in<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> middle

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
mainly act as a stiffener in the middle

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.979 
mainly act as a stiffener in the middle
of<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.950> bracket<00:02:54.520> it's<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.570> real

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
of this bracket it's and the real

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.330 
of this bracket it's and the real
strength<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.470> going<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.709> come<00:02:56.890> out<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.100> the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
strength is going to come out on the

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.370 
strength is going to come out on the
ends<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.880> will<00:02:58.060> mainly<00:02:58.360> just<00:02:58.780> be<00:02:59.110> a

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
ends this will mainly just be a

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.190 
ends this will mainly just be a
stiffener<00:03:00.220> in<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:01.030> middle<00:03:01.360> since<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.020> is

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
stiffener in the middle since this is

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.229 
stiffener in the middle since this is
sort<00:03:02.410> of<00:03:02.440> a<00:03:02.560> long<00:03:02.800> thin<00:03:03.190> bright<00:03:03.459> again<00:03:03.900> okay<00:03:06.239> so

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
sort of a long thin bright again okay so

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.699 
sort of a long thin bright again okay so
we'll<00:03:08.110> fire<00:03:08.350> up<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.680> trustee<00:03:09.100> digital<00:03:09.550> level

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.380 

you<00:03:14.709> can<00:03:14.890> see<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.400> thanks<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.730> our<00:03:15.910> good<00:03:16.060> tab

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
you can see that thanks to our good tab

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.660 
you can see that thanks to our good tab
work<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:17.019> it's<00:03:17.200> just<00:03:17.980> takes<00:03:18.220> barely

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
work that it's just takes barely

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.830 
work that it's just takes barely
anything<00:03:18.910> and<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:20.260> is<00:03:21.160> already<00:03:21.730> pretty<00:03:22.570> much

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
anything and it is already pretty much

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.090 
anything and it is already pretty much
hanging<00:03:23.110> right<00:03:23.440> there<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.739> dead<00:03:24.070> at<00:03:24.850> dead<00:03:25.180> 0

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
hanging right there a dead at dead 0

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.270 
hanging right there a dead at dead 0
which<00:03:27.100> is<00:03:27.250> real<00:03:27.430> nice

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.360 

okay<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.420> all<00:03:31.450> I've<00:03:31.780> got<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:31.959> do<00:03:32.170> now<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.830> guess

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
okay so all I've got to do now I guess

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.920 
okay so all I've got to do now I guess
this<00:03:33.520> is<00:03:33.700> another<00:03:33.940> reason<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.510> just<00:03:34.569> thought

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
this is another reason I just thought

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.990 
this is another reason I just thought
you<00:03:35.140> know<00:03:35.260> this<00:03:35.560> methodology<00:03:36.250> of<00:03:36.700> attaching

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
you know this methodology of attaching

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.030 
you know this methodology of attaching
it<00:03:37.300> at<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:37.510> point<00:03:37.750> is<00:03:37.990> really<00:03:38.200> nice<00:03:38.350> all<00:03:38.920> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
it at one point is really nice all I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.680 
it at one point is really nice all I
going<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.280> do<00:03:39.400> now<00:03:39.430> even<00:03:39.940> with<00:03:39.970> one<00:03:40.209> hand<00:03:40.450> free

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
going to do now even with one hand free

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.840 
going to do now even with one hand free
is<00:03:41.470> just<00:03:41.740> take<00:03:41.890> a<00:03:41.920> measurement<00:03:42.370> from<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.670> edge

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
is just take a measurement from the edge

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.910 
is just take a measurement from the edge
of<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.060> fender<00:03:43.569> to<00:03:44.170> the<00:03:44.290> inside<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:44.740> that

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
of that fender to the inside of that

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.670 
of that fender to the inside of that
bracket<00:03:45.730> which<00:03:46.330> is<00:03:46.510> two<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:46.870> six<00:03:47.110> teens<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.650> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
bracket which is two and six teens now I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.030 
bracket which is two and six teens now I
know<00:03:47.830> exactly<00:03:48.959> what<00:03:49.959> link<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.410> tell<00:03:50.620> big<00:03:50.800> t<00:03:50.980> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
know exactly what link to tell big t to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.910 
know exactly what link to tell big t to
fire<00:03:51.340> up<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.550> lathe<00:03:51.730> make<00:03:52.120> me<00:03:52.239> that<00:03:52.680> stand<00:03:53.680> off

sixteenth big t okay down here all I

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.960 
sixteenth big t okay down here all I
need<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.209> do<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.600> kind<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.870> I<00:04:02.020> brawl<00:04:02.850> figure<00:04:03.850> out

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
need to do is kind of I brawl figure out

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.590 
need to do is kind of I brawl figure out
how<00:04:04.360> I<00:04:04.390> want<00:04:04.780> this<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:04.989> look<00:04:05.290> from<00:04:05.560> the<00:04:05.680> side<00:04:06.600> so

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
how I want this to look from the side so

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.300 
how I want this to look from the side so
i<00:04:07.630> know<00:04:07.750> where<00:04:08.080> i<00:04:08.110> want<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.800> attach<00:04:09.070> at

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
i know where i want this to attach at

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.479 
i know where i want this to attach at
the<00:04:09.400> bottom<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.590> i<00:04:11.590> think<00:04:11.800> right<00:04:11.950> about<00:04:12.220> their

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
the bottom and i think right about their

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.580 
looks kind of good so i'm going to do is
get<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.370> let's<00:04:15.610> get<00:04:15.910> a<00:04:15.970> dimension<00:04:16.630> from<00:04:17.350> this

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
get it let's get a dimension from this

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.000 
get it let's get a dimension from this
bottom<00:04:18.010> frame<00:04:18.310> rail<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.090> center<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:20.010> this

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
bottom frame rail to the center of this

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.540 
bottom frame rail to the center of this
bolt<00:04:21.370> right<00:04:21.579> here<00:04:21.690> okay<00:04:22.979> which<00:04:23.979> I<00:04:24.280> don't<00:04:24.460> know

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
bolt right here okay which I don't know

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.030 
bolt right here okay which I don't know
if<00:04:24.640> the<00:04:24.729> camera<00:04:24.910> can<00:04:25.090> pick<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.540> up<00:04:25.830> just<00:04:26.830> almost

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
if the camera can pick it up just almost

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.900 
if the camera can pick it up just almost
dead<00:04:27.460> exactly<00:04:28.120> inch<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.990> three<00:04:29.169> quarters<00:04:29.910> so

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
dead exactly inch and three quarters so

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.120 
dead exactly inch and three quarters so
we'll<00:04:31.030> make<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.240> flat<00:04:31.630> bracket<00:04:32.229> going<00:04:32.919> from

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
we'll make a flat bracket going from

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.240 
we'll make a flat bracket going from
here<00:04:34.140> inch<00:04:35.140> and<00:04:35.380> three<00:04:35.500> quarters<00:04:35.860> up<00:04:36.070> it'll

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
here inch and three quarters up it'll

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.120 
here inch and three quarters up it'll
have<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.460> whole<00:04:36.760> five<00:04:37.390> sixteenth<00:04:37.870> hole<00:04:38.100> for<00:04:39.100> the

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
have a whole five sixteenth hole for the

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.110 
have a whole five sixteenth hole for the
pivot<00:04:39.580> bolt<00:04:39.729> and<00:04:40.050> we'll<00:04:41.050> probably<00:04:41.350> around<00:04:42.120> ok

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
pivot bolt and we'll probably around ok

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360 
pivot bolt and we'll probably around ok
so<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:43.419> pulled<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.900> piece<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.370> quarter-inch
