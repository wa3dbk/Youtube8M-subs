basically should I feel bad for existing
is<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.730> I'm<00:00:47.820> asking<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.450> suspicion<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.960> that

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is what I'm asking my suspicion is that

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.180 
is what I'm asking my suspicion is that
most<00:00:49.289> people<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.620> spend<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:49.890> of<00:00:50.070> time

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
most people don't spend a lot of time

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
most people don't spend a lot of time
worrying<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.530> I've

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
worrying about this but I do and I've

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.889 
worrying about this but I do and I've
come<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> conclusion<00:00:53.360> after<00:00:54.360> years<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
come to the conclusion after years of

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.479 
come to the conclusion after years of
thinking<00:00:55.079> about<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> were<00:00:55.890> worth<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.309> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
thinking about this that were worth it I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
thinking about this that were worth it I
might<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.699> biased<00:00:56.940> towards<00:00:57.329> humans<00:00:57.690> being<00:00:58.289> one

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
might be biased towards humans being one

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.990 
might be biased towards humans being one
of<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.010> all<00:00:59.070> but<00:00:59.309> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> same<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.879> that
