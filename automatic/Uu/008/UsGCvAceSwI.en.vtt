00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.080
 in this next image different from the 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.320
 of one in the leg and a throat of 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.320
 foot 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.230
 structures are superficial 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:29.400
 we have the nervous packages in this 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.589
 case as a nervous example as in the 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.660
 who is 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:37.899
 these elements remembering that in the 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.879
 lower limb in structures 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.769
 muscular smooth muscle structure 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.350
 within the main or within 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.409
 the first ones that we have are the tendon 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.149
 calcaneus that third change has in its 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.339
 set or also called the price 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.100
 South has two muscles that are 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.039
 medial sill and the lateral head of 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.530
 the twins as well as the muscle 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.030
 soleus and between both a very content 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.399
 of the complication we owe in 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.540
 this video which we point out the tendon 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.860
 Canary 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:13.020
 structures in this case have been 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 inserted the least partial of the muscle 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.450
 planted in any proximal insertion 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.440
 knowing that we will have a 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.840
 disposition some links with an art 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.990
 more to the period of a plan under which 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.090
 it is bounded on the outside by a muscle 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.700
 called the long flexor of the first 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.440
 finger of the lux that is has an egg are 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.080
 the second intermediate dentition is the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 posterior tibial muscle and muscle 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.910
 which is in a medial region 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.229
 is the flexor digitorum longus 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.700
 look how it reaches this immense 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.800
 crisscross between the tendons of 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.460
 distraction and in the plantar region 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.080
 we point out the flexor muscle temple 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.550
 long day 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.550
 this is how we will see that there are compositions 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.500
 a provision in which a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:16.330
 anterior trunk 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.160
 so when this happens, I have the trunk 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.680
 warm fibula and in turn also 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.300
 you will have two arteries and an apex the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 artery I want to explain the strong signal 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.280
 and others in the fibula artery and that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.230
 will have a provision at the level of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.120
 foot or ankle throat 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.190
 understand by noticing the artery I would say 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.500
 posterior inside and outside to the 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.130
 Lateral malleolar activity minimal note 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.130
 but average 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.550
 Y 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.020
 A) Yes
