00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
and I'm all this browser works pretty

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.039 
and I'm all this browser works pretty
well<00:00:02.550> for<00:00:03.449> very<00:00:04.140> basic<00:00:04.740> sites<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.250> just<00:00:05.430> have

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
well for very basic sites that just have

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.379 
well for very basic sites that just have
text<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.200> some<00:00:07.470> pictures<00:00:07.710> if<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.940> downloaded

this<00:00:09.540> browser<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> hope<00:00:10.410> that<00:00:10.440> you'd<00:00:10.800> be

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
this browser with the hope that you'd be

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.999 
this browser with the hope that you'd be

able to watch streaming videos such as

able to watch streaming videos such as
those<00:00:14.700> found<00:00:14.940> on<00:00:15.120> YouTube<00:00:15.529> you're<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.980> going

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
those found on YouTube you're not going

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.269 
those found on YouTube you're not going
to<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> very<00:00:17.990> easy<00:00:18.990> time<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.070> fact

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
to have a very easy time of that in fact

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
to have a very easy time of that in fact
they'll<00:00:20.460> find<00:00:20.670> that<00:00:20.789> impossible<00:00:21.199> for<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
they'll find that impossible for the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.120 
they'll find that impossible for the
reason<00:00:23.130> being<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:24.080> dsi<00:00:25.080> browser<00:00:25.380> does

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
reason being that the dsi browser does

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.770 
reason being that the dsi browser does
not<00:00:26.160> support<00:00:28.849> either<00:00:29.849> java<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:31.130> flash<00:00:32.780> there's

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
not support either java or flash there's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.180 
not support either java or flash there's
no<00:00:33.899> support<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.520> either<00:00:35.520> plugin<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.980> that<00:00:37.980> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
no support for either plugin and that is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.819 
no support for either plugin and that is
my<00:00:38.489> biggest<00:00:38.960> problem<00:00:40.219> with<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.340> browser<00:00:42.829> but

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
my biggest problem with this browser but

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.819 
my biggest problem with this browser but
this<00:00:43.950> browser<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:45.660> very<00:00:45.930> much<00:00:46.110> identical<00:00:46.559> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
this browser is very much identical to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.279 
this browser is very much identical to
the<00:00:46.920> original<00:00:46.950> vs<00:00:47.550> browser<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.059> was

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
the original vs browser that was

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.540 
the original vs browser that was
released<00:00:49.289> almost<00:00:49.530> three<00:00:49.770> years<00:00:49.890> ago<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
released almost three years ago that

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
released almost three years ago that
browser<00:00:50.879> did<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.420> any<00:00:51.570> flash<00:00:51.899> or<00:00:52.230> java

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.580 
browser did not have any flash or java
support<00:00:53.340> either<00:00:54.949> now<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.129> now<00:00:56.430> while<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.590> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
support either now is now while the the

see the thumbnail images of some of the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.719 
see the thumbnail images of some of the
videos<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.220> try<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> view<00:01:11.580> one

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729

videos when you actually try to view one
of<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> videos<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:14.130> won't<00:01:14.369> work

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.540 

it<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.200> give<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.770> it'll<00:01:29.310> just

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
it will just give you and it'll just

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.800 
it will just give you and it'll just
give<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.760> an<00:01:29.850> error<00:01:30.000> message<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.510> says<00:01:30.690> you

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
don't have any flash or java support
installed<00:01:35.060> so<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.690> much<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.409> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
installed so that's pretty much it for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.719 
installed so that's pretty much it for
the<00:01:38.070> d/s<00:01:38.790> browser<00:01:39.090> its<00:01:40.100> overall<00:01:41.100> I'd<00:01:41.340> say<00:01:41.369> it's

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
the d/s browser its overall I'd say it's

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.790 
the d/s browser its overall I'd say it's
the<00:01:41.909> least<00:01:42.090> impressive<00:01:42.450> feature<00:01:42.900> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.320> dsi

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the least impressive feature of the dsi

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.969 
the least impressive feature of the dsi
in<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.640> fact<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> because<00:01:45.720> it<00:01:46.050> doesn't<00:01:46.860> have

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
in the fact that because it doesn't have

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.719 
in the fact that because it doesn't have
any<00:01:47.160> faster<00:01:47.520> Java<00:01:47.729> support<00:01:49.280> its<00:01:50.280> uses<00:01:50.640> are

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
any faster Java support its uses are

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.100 
any faster Java support its uses are
very<00:01:50.909> limited<00:01:51.150> especially<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:51.900> day<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
very limited especially in this day and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.590 
very limited especially in this day and
age<00:01:52.320> when<00:01:53.190> so<00:01:53.369> many<00:01:53.490> websites<00:01:53.820> take<00:01:54.150> advantage

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
age when so many websites take advantage

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.880 
age when so many websites take advantage
of<00:01:54.780> those<00:01:54.960> two<00:01:55.200> plugins<00:01:57.259> now<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.440> is<00:01:58.470> entirely

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
of those two plugins now it is entirely

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.680 
of those two plugins now it is entirely
possible<00:01:59.040> that<00:01:59.460> Nintendo<00:01:59.970> could<00:02:00.180> update<00:02:00.390> this

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
possible that Nintendo could update this

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.560 
possible that Nintendo could update this
browser<00:02:01.610> in<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> future<00:02:03.060> which<00:02:03.420> they

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
browser in the future which they

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.600 
browser in the future which they
couldn't<00:02:03.869> with<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.110> old<00:02:04.259> browser<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.160> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
couldn't with the old browser but it is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.460 
couldn't with the old browser but it is
technically<00:02:06.119> possible<00:02:06.210> for<00:02:06.930> them<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.140> update

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
technically possible for them to update

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.999 
technically possible for them to update
this<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.239> happens<00:02:09.269> i

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
this but if and when that happens i

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.259 
this but if and when that happens i
don't<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.160> but<00:02:11.550> hopefully<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:12.090> will

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
don't know but hopefully they will

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.520 
don't know but hopefully they will
update<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.720> someday<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:15.140> lastly<00:02:16.140> guys<00:02:16.350> i'm

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530
