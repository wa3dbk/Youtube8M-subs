message and a comments I think about how
to<00:00:19.340> put<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.550> video<00:00:20.760> into<00:00:21.510> cinema<00:00:22.020> 4d<00:00:22.260> or<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to put a video into cinema 4d or if I

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.160 
to put a video into cinema 4d or if I
just<00:00:23.279> put<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.670> After<00:00:24.000> Effects<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:25.050> know

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
just put it in After Effects you know

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.250 
just put it in After Effects you know
where<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:26.060> importing<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> camera<00:00:27.570> or<00:00:27.750> 3d

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
where the importing the camera or 3d

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.849 
where the importing the camera or 3d
camera<00:00:28.740> but<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> suggested<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.599> in<00:00:30.750> after<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
camera but I suggested it in after in a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.160 
camera but I suggested it in after in a
semaphore<00:00:32.579> T<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.660> actually<00:00:33.899> pretty

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
semaphore T so it's actually pretty

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.729 
semaphore T so it's actually pretty
simple

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
simple

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.430 
simple
I'm<00:00:35.430> just<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> show<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.390> quick<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.410> I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
I'm just going to show you quick how I

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.780 
I'm just going to show you quick how I
did<00:00:38.180> so<00:00:39.180> we're<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:40.790> actually

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
did so we're going to make this actually

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.270 
did so we're going to make this actually
then<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:42.360> really<00:00:43.290> hate<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.500> problem<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.040> made

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
then I really hate that problem I made

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.720 
then I really hate that problem I made
didn't<00:00:45.149> get<00:00:45.270> any<00:00:45.450> proud<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.899> but<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.250> let's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
didn't get any proud of it but so let's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.229 
didn't get any proud of it but so let's
just<00:00:48.030> make<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> box<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.170> begin<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.120> we

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
just make a box to begin with so here we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.049 
just make a box to begin with so here we
got<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.629> box<00:00:52.399> awesome<00:00:53.449> then<00:00:54.500> we're<00:00:55.500> going<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
got a box awesome then we're going to

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.779 
got a box awesome then we're going to
import<00:00:57.059> our<00:00:57.390> video<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> material<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> just

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
import our video in a material so just

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.039 
import our video in a material so just
click<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.329> texture<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:06.990> just

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
click the texture so then we can just

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.310 
click the texture so then we can just
choose<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:08.100> example<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:09.150> don't<00:01:09.540> know<00:01:09.630> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
choose for example I don't know like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.850 
choose for example I don't know like
fusion<00:01:11.299> that's<00:01:12.299> cool<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:15.320> the<00:01:16.320> width<00:01:16.619> and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
fusion that's cool and the width and

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.109 
fusion that's cool and the width and
length<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.640> video<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.979> yeah<00:01:19.979> yes<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.909> is

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
length of this video is yeah yes here is

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
length of this video is yeah yes here is
frame<00:01:21.420> width<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:22.100> 1280<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.280> for<00:01:23.700> him<00:01:23.790> height

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
frame width is 1280 and for him height

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.539 
frame width is 1280 and for him height
is<00:01:24.420> 720<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.580> take<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.880> cube<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
is 720 so then we just take the cube and

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.690 
is 720 so then we just take the cube and
that's<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.759> first<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.810> nice

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
that's just first of all just nice

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.350 
that's just first of all just nice
minimizes<00:01:32.700> Lou<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.750> we'll<00:01:33.900> take<00:01:34.049> 1280<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
minimizes Lou and we'll take 1280 and

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:45.380 
minimizes Lou and we'll take 1280 and
720<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:39.320> when<00:01:41.540> we<00:01:42.540> add<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:43.079> material<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
720 so when we add this material in to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.690 
720 so when we add this material in to
the<00:01:45.509> cube<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:49.850> will<00:01:50.850> actually<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.450> it's

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
the cube it will actually look like it's

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.850 
the cube it will actually look like it's
yeah<00:01:54.409> in<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> video<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:57.170> but<00:01:58.170> as<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> can<00:01:58.649> see

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
yeah in the video so but as you can see

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.569 
yeah in the video so but as you can see
here<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.060> back<00:02:00.860> so<00:02:01.860> here<00:02:02.399> take

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
here it's also in the back so here take

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.080 
here it's also in the back so here take
on<00:02:02.729> front<00:02:03.060> but<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> didn't<00:02:03.750> work<00:02:03.780> for<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
on front but that didn't work for me I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.960 
on front but that didn't work for me I
was<00:02:06.090> still<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.310> what<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> actually<00:02:08.580> did

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
was still there so what I actually did

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
was still there so what I actually did
was<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:11.060> took<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
was just I took this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.250 
was just I took this
I<00:02:13.020> like<00:02:13.650> make<00:02:13.890> it<00:02:13.920> really<00:02:14.460> really<00:02:14.790> small

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I like make it really really small

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.960 
I like make it really really small
digest<00:02:16.260> duplicated<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.100> then<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> deleted<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
digest duplicated it then I deleted the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.280 
digest duplicated it then I deleted the
the<00:02:20.970> material<00:02:21.360> on<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:25.170> know

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
the material on this one and I you know

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
the material on this one and I you know
made<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> little<00:02:25.740> box<00:02:25.980> just<00:02:26.730> put<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.000> right

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
made a little box just put it right

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.970 
made a little box just put it right
behind<00:02:27.750> it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.440 

may<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.040> easier<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.370> Jesse<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.150> I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
may be easier for Jesse like this I

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:46.240 
may be easier for Jesse like this I
guess<00:02:38.990> yes<00:02:40.910> there<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.030> go<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.140> now<00:02:44.480> we<00:02:45.480> got<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
guess yes there we go so now we got it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.560 
guess yes there we go so now we got it
simple<00:02:47.250> that's<00:02:48.000> nothing

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
simple that's nothing

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.070 
simple that's nothing
so<00:02:49.410> that's<00:02:49.740> actually<00:02:50.340> how<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.490> do<00:02:50.820> it<00:02:51.210> well<00:02:51.840> no

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
so that's actually how you do it well no

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.770
