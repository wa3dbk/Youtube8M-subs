reddish<00:02:36.950> pouty<00:02:37.430> lips<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.090> I<00:02:38.150> tried<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.660> cut<00:02:38.870> a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
reddish pouty lips so I tried to cut a

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.070 
reddish pouty lips so I tried to cut a
tomato<00:02:39.290> into<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.400> little<00:02:40.700> pout<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.300> put<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.900> on

tomato into a little pout and put it on

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.300 
tomato into a little pout and put it on
there<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.709> didn't<00:02:42.920> look<00:02:43.010> quite<00:02:43.220> right
