00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
chipmunk sea air and then sucked out the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.220 
chipmunk sea air and then sucked out the
blood<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.120> guts<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> chipmunk<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
blood and guts out of the chipmunk it

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.540
