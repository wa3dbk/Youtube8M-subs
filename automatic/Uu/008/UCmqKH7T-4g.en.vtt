00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.210
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 another bucket plugin tutorial 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.390
 today we are doing wonderfully gmc jobs in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.710
 just add it as usual in ours 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.470
 plugins folder 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.570
 without having to unpack it before now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 Let's start the server with it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.060
 here in the plugins folder a folder of 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.099
 put mmc jobs 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.719
 Let's see if you already 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
 Something about a goal job 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.680
 and yes it was now we can give them 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.540
 stop server again 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.399
 We wanted to take a quick look now 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 what can you do in the conflicting time 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.379
 adjust 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.809
 Now there is such a file here 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.480
 open jobs we open now 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.969
 Just open the config point 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.940
 jml with notepad plus one really 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.920
 Good ad program like I think 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 so we want to the top and here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.219
 you can see the different jobs legally 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 translated means, so to speak, graves or he 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.189
 must stop earth level or similar 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.890
 dismantle 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.189
 Here you can see something and be soul 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 gremmel dirt and karst and sand that are 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.610
 the different tasks, so to speak 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.860
 this is your job I fulfill fulfilled 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.840
 Just call now in graves one 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.390
 can simply do it here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 I think that's how you can do it 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.479
 By the way, before you set how much of the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.909
 blue pro block deserves this is here 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.670
 set and up here you can see the 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.619
 time interval I'll take 10 in here 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.799
 which shows how much money you have 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.470
 deserves to be displayed 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.890
 that you earned something like many jobs 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 and have a maximum of it 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.409
 and that's what they were 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.579
 most important here for example Baumeister 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.579
 I'll just go now 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.560
 Baumeister must stop at ten 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.299
 he sets different blocks 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.729
 for that money put the applet if that 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.110
 blocks must be removed or blocks must buy 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.050
 I also believe he gets blocks 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:14.030
 this is the soldier soldier 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.360
 he gets money if he kills monster 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.360
 or other players or just wolves something 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.130
 this is what is the thinker 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.640
 you can not translate that badly 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.890
 So if he is in power he has to get money 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.190
 Let's just leave it that way 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.660
 lumberjack here of course gets 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.490
 money in the trees environment lumberjack and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.520
 The pharma will be like that and soon 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
 the payment so how much money you 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.200
 get is actually pretty often 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.790
 quite well set the rest 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.360
 I translate now which ones are there too 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.790
 the fischer the baker mister and master 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.160
 schmid so there are different us 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.980
 Now speak the config file and 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.920
 can actually be back now 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.390
 start if any further 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.980
 you want to configure yourself 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.610
 just through the contact file 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.320
 read 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.170
 There you can change the dog like that 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.360
 Jobs are called if you want to become one 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 get translated and now 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.870
 Let's see if that worked out 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.459
 go into the server and here 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.709
 we see it was unfortunately now 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.920
 a bit because I'm still completely different here 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.970
 Processes run and help often 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.640
 unbelievable / shops will notice 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.989
 which version, so to speak, the job has 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.670
 and jobs sometimes you have jobs and 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.640
 sometimes just jobs that we write the 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:46.400
 a bit confusing job then you see 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:49.040
 Here is the help for the jobs here 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.040
 example job job name can tell you more about 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.150
 learning a job double is seen 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.400
 all the jobs you can learn 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:05.170
 so we just do it now 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.290
 jobs pointed here here is jobs so 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:13.319
 be on the job 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.389
 Now let's take the master brewer 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:23.800
 repairs the lumberjack had 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:27.010
 we still translate well job john 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.169
 lumberjack you have joined lumberjack 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.460
 Now that is under job you have to search one 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:38.100
 Just look at a tree now 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:42.250
 short on and his account balance with / 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:43.900
 So we have a lot of money and money 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.590
 now we sit in our times briefly 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.539
 Good and build here just once 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.370
 bit of wood I want now 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.440
 just see if that worked 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.960
 has is has something with 9 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.880
 anything are tree species dollar 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.750
 small farmers and see if we 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.699
 then have more 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.520
 after ten minutes get to the topic 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.470
 the message if you deserve money 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.090
 has or whether one gets it deducted money 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.940
 but is actually rather rare 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.490
 So we put ourselves back in game 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.490
 fashion for security and writing 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.210
 manni and you can see we have one 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.870
 quite a bit more money got before 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.550
 had believed to have pulled 792 now 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.320
 we get more money and this 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.080
 You also want information like that 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:35.080
 ten minutes get shampoo though 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:43.120
 even further to the help pages to and 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:46.360
 Although holding jobs 2, we now see how to do it 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.770
 The double is calling on high social 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.060
 Here you can watch fire 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.360
 could adjust 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:59.530
 how many jobs you can have so we 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:01.330
 make jobs once again holds four 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.949
 I skipped like that so bad 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:06.610
 In any case, you can get this one 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:08.650
 look at help pages and then 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.939
 you know more about plugin jobs more 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.469
 I do not want to show now first 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:13.750
 you can do a little more yourself 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.939
 find out and I find this plugin 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.159
 is really handy since you are effective 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.110
 there is no task to follow 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:23.050
 and money, so to speak 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:26.400
 so it was then from me to the 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.400
 next video bye
