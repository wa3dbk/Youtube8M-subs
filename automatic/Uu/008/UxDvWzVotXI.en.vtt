00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.540 
I think my favorite move
is<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.020> back-handspring<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.220> three<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
is the back-handspring when the three of

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.160 
is the back-handspring when the three of
us<00:01:20.610> are<00:01:20.790> facing<00:01:21.000> each<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.660> all<00:01:21.690> flip

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
us are facing each other and we all flip

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.260 
us are facing each other and we all flip
out<00:01:22.380> words<00:01:22.590> it's<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.760> exciting<00:01:23.970> part

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
out words it's a really exciting part

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.110 
out words it's a really exciting part
for<00:01:24.360> us<00:01:24.510> today

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.730 

the<00:01:34.120> hardest<00:01:34.690> part<00:01:34.930> in<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.200> dance<00:01:35.410> would<00:01:35.710> be

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
the hardest part in the dance would be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.400 
the hardest part in the dance would be
at<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.220> end<00:01:36.430> when<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.540> three<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.930> us<00:01:38.050> come

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
at the end when the three of us come

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.610 
at the end when the three of us come
forward<00:01:38.770> doing

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
forward doing

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.350 
forward doing
and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:40.010> right<00:01:40.220> away<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.490> goes<00:01:40.640> into<00:01:40.790> Daniels

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
and then right away it goes into Daniels

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.420 
and then right away it goes into Daniels
solo<00:01:41.630> moment<00:01:42.050> so<00:01:42.260> going<00:01:42.560> from<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:42.800> jump<00:01:43.100> into

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
solo moment so going from that jump into

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.940 
solo moment so going from that jump into
a<00:01:43.640> solo<00:01:44.030> turn<00:01:44.300> is<00:01:44.540> a<00:01:44.750> lot<00:01:44.960> to<00:01:45.230> figure<00:01:45.590> out<00:01:45.740> for

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
a solo turn is a lot to figure out for

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.220 
a solo turn is a lot to figure out for
my<00:01:46.040> body
