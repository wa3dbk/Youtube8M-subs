00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.259 
awaited episode - so in this episode
we're<00:00:17.869> going<00:00:18.109> to<00:00:18.350> look<00:00:18.589> at<00:00:18.880> inflicting<00:00:19.880> damage

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
we're going to look at inflicting damage

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.380 
we're going to look at inflicting damage
upon<00:00:20.839> a<00:00:20.900> tank<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:21.609> receiving<00:00:22.609> damage<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.179> how

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
upon a tank and receiving damage and how

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.259 
upon a tank and receiving damage and how
you<00:00:23.449> can<00:00:23.779> reduce<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.499> damage<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.880> to<00:00:25.939> start

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
you can reduce the damage so to start

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.210 
you can reduce the damage so to start
off<00:00:26.509> we're<00:00:26.900> going<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.289> cover<00:00:27.529> what<00:00:28.009> is

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
off we're going to cover what is

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.130 
off we're going to cover what is
probably<00:00:28.640> quite<00:00:29.329> well<00:00:29.630> known<00:00:29.839> among<00:00:30.109> the

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
probably quite well known among the

probably quite well known among the
community<00:00:30.739> it's<00:00:31.279> a<00:00:31.460> bit<00:00:31.730> of<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.060> tip<00:00:32.419> for

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
community it's a bit of a tip for

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.110 
community it's a bit of a tip for
newbies<00:00:32.960> but<00:00:33.230> basically<00:00:33.699> when<00:00:34.699> you<00:00:34.850> are<00:00:34.969> in

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
newbies but basically when you are in

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.200 
newbies but basically when you are in
the<00:00:35.270> tank<00:00:35.559> taking<00:00:36.559> damage<00:00:36.949> from<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.489> front<00:00:37.879> as

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
the tank taking damage from the front as

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.090 
the tank taking damage from the front as
you<00:00:38.300> can<00:00:38.420> see<00:00:38.690> on<00:00:38.780> this<00:00:38.870> empty<00:00:39.109> serve<00:00:39.469> I'm<00:00:39.739> here

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
you can see on this empty serve I'm here

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.650 
you can see on this empty serve I'm here
with<00:00:40.280> a<00:00:40.370> friend<00:00:40.399> who's<00:00:40.789> helping<00:00:41.329> me

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
with a friend who's helping me

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.900 
with a friend who's helping me
demonstrate<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.320> point<00:00:42.590> but<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.430> front<00:00:43.730> of

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
demonstrate this point but the front of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.439 
demonstrate this point but the front of
the<00:00:44.030> tank

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
the tank

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.950 
the tank
always<00:00:44.750> takes<00:00:45.140> less<00:00:45.620> damage<00:00:46.280> then<00:00:47.179> the<00:00:47.600> sides

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
always takes less damage then the sides

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.500 
always takes less damage then the sides
of<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.440> tank<00:00:48.649> take<00:00:49.039> the<00:00:49.219> second<00:00:49.789> least<00:00:50.000> damage

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
of the tank take the second least damage

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.889 
of the tank take the second least damage
followed<00:00:51.410> by<00:00:51.800> the<00:00:52.219> rear<00:00:52.579> of<00:00:52.879> the<00:00:53.120> tank<00:00:53.300> so<00:00:53.780> I'm

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
followed by the rear of the tank so I'm

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.079 
followed by the rear of the tank so I'm
just<00:00:54.140> demonstrating<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:55.339> point<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.940> you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
just demonstrating this point to you

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.419 
just demonstrating this point to you
with<00:00:56.329> the<00:00:56.449> RPG<00:00:56.989> with<00:00:57.170> my<00:00:57.350> friend<00:00:57.710> who's<00:00:57.949> kindly

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
with the RPG with my friend who's kindly

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.020 
with the RPG with my friend who's kindly
helping<00:00:58.910> me<00:00:59.089> but<00:00:59.809> the<00:00:59.899> point<00:01:00.140> really<00:01:00.379> is<00:01:00.620> that

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
helping me but the point really is that

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.459 
helping me but the point really is that
obviously<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.359> front<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.839> the<00:01:02.960> tank<00:01:03.199> is<00:01:03.410> the

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
obviously the front of the tank is the

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.300 
obviously the front of the tank is the
strongest<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:04.910> if<00:01:05.239> you're<00:01:06.140> engaging<00:01:06.590> an<00:01:06.950> enemy

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
strongest so if you're engaging an enemy

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.010 
strongest so if you're engaging an enemy
if<00:01:07.520> you<00:01:07.759> have<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.060> chance<00:01:08.329> you<00:01:08.630> want<00:01:08.810> to

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
if you have the chance you want to

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.010 
if you have the chance you want to
engage<00:01:09.200> them<00:01:09.740> from<00:01:10.310> behind<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:11.869> a

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
engage them from behind so that's a

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.560 
engage them from behind so that's a
sound<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.409> bit<00:01:12.439> rude<00:01:12.860> but<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:13.549> want<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:14.030> engage

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
sound a bit rude but you want to engage

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.960 
sound a bit rude but you want to engage
them<00:01:14.990> and<00:01:15.320> fire<00:01:15.799> your<00:01:16.009> shell<00:01:16.310> into<00:01:16.610> them<00:01:16.729> from

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
them and fire your shell into them from

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.020 
them and fire your shell into them from
behind<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:17.720> from<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.110> sides<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:19.399> front<00:01:19.430> of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
behind or from the sides the front of

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.179 
behind or from the sides the front of
the<00:01:20.240> tank<00:01:20.540> is<00:01:20.810> obviously<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.560> strongest<00:01:22.040> the

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
the tank is obviously the strongest the

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.179 
the tank is obviously the strongest the
most<00:01:22.280> fortified<00:01:22.970> part<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:24.380> now<00:01:24.530> that<00:01:24.590> we<00:01:24.890> know

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
most fortified part so now that we know

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.090 
most fortified part so now that we know
well<00:01:25.909> areas<00:01:26.540> of<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.869> tank<00:01:27.079> are<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.500> weakest

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
well areas of the tank are the weakest

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.520 
well areas of the tank are the weakest
you<00:01:28.430> can<00:01:29.030> obviously<00:01:29.390> make<00:01:29.600> sure<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.380> that

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
you can obviously make sure that that

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.310 
you can obviously make sure that that
plays<00:01:30.799> a<00:01:30.829> part<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.369> the<00:01:31.460> way<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.670> tank<00:01:32.479> in

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
plays a part in the way you tank in

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.859 
plays a part in the way you tank in
ensuring<00:01:34.250> that<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.520> don't<00:01:34.850> expose<00:01:35.329> weak

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
ensuring that you don't expose weak

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.730 
ensuring that you don't expose weak
points<00:01:36.350> of<00:01:36.530> view<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.979> enemy<00:01:37.820> tanks<00:01:38.210> or<00:01:38.420> RPGs

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
points of view to enemy tanks or RPGs

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.609 
points of view to enemy tanks or RPGs
other<00:01:39.950> engineers<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.119> enemy<00:01:41.570> team<00:01:41.899> but

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
other engineers on the enemy team but

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.310 
other engineers on the enemy team but
it's<00:01:42.770> also<00:01:42.979> important<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:43.909> note<00:01:44.240> that<00:01:44.689> the

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
it's also important to note that the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.490 
it's also important to note that the
direction<00:01:46.280> in<00:01:46.460> which<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.850> shot<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.450> fired<00:01:47.500> also

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
plays a part in the amount of damage it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.399 
plays a part in the amount of damage it
inflicts<00:01:51.649> if<00:01:51.920> a<00:01:52.759> shot<00:01:53.060> is<00:01:53.210> fired<00:01:53.240> into<00:01:53.930> a<00:01:54.110> tank

inflicts less damage now that you know
about<00:02:08.360> these<00:02:08.539> angles<00:02:09.050> of<00:02:09.200> damage<00:02:09.560> how<00:02:09.860> can<00:02:10.130> you

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
about these angles of damage how can you

they're<00:02:57.020> not<00:02:57.050> just<00:02:57.590> relevant<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.370> tank<00:02:58.640> shots

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470

a repair tool so let's say your tanks

a repair tool so let's say your tanks
gone<00:03:10.040> down<00:03:10.370> and<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:11.720> know<00:03:11.840> you're<00:03:12.050> exposed<00:03:12.560> to

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
the enemy tank if you take your repair

the enemy tank if you take your repair

tool and you repair tool the enemy tank
to<00:03:18.680> damage<00:03:19.070> it<00:03:19.340> if<00:03:20.000> you're<00:03:20.270> at<00:03:20.390> a

to damage it if you're at a

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.480 
to damage it if you're at a
perpendicular<00:03:20.780> angle<00:03:21.500> just<00:03:22.010> like<00:03:22.130> Lou's

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:22.490 
perpendicular angle just like Lou's

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.720 
perpendicular angle just like Lou's
explaining<00:03:23.090> with<00:03:23.209> the<00:03:23.330> RPG<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:24.470> do<00:03:24.650> much<00:03:25.130> more

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
explaining with the RPG you do much more

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.660 
explaining with the RPG you do much more
damage<00:03:26.240> than<00:03:26.510> if<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.900> are<00:03:27.140> at<00:03:27.470> a<00:03:27.530> more<00:03:28.220> acute

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
damage than if you are at a more acute

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.970 
damage than if you are at a more acute
angle<00:03:29.240> when<00:03:29.570> inflicting<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.350> damage<00:03:30.709> on<00:03:30.890> a

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
angle when inflicting that damage on a

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.520 
angle when inflicting that damage on a
tank<00:03:31.340> as<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:32.000> say<00:03:32.150> this<00:03:32.300> is<00:03:32.360> a<00:03:32.510> bit<00:03:32.750> of<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.930> pro<00:03:33.200> tip

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
tank as I say this is a bit of a pro tip

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.040 
tank as I say this is a bit of a pro tip
because<00:03:34.010> not<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> lot<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.670> people<00:03:35.120> outside<00:03:35.570> the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
because not a lot of people outside the

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.960 
because not a lot of people outside the
competitive<00:03:36.650> gaming<00:03:36.950> circle<00:03:37.520> know<00:03:37.700> about

competitive gaming circle know about

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.390 
competitive gaming circle know about
this<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.810> hopefully<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:39.650> something<00:03:40.220> that

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
this so hopefully that's something that

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.550 
this so hopefully that's something that
you<00:03:40.490> didn't<00:03:40.820> know<00:03:40.880> and<00:03:41.209> on<00:03:41.420> on<00:03:41.630> sending<00:03:42.410> your
