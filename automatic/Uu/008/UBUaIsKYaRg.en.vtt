least amount of materials needed to do

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.290 
least amount of materials needed to do
this<00:00:18.949> so<00:00:19.949> before<00:00:20.550> short<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> first<00:00:21.029> thing

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
this so before short the first thing

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
this so before short the first thing
used<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> do<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.900> get<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.830> scroll<00:00:23.340> that

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
used to do is get the scroll that

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.420 
used to do is get the scroll that
increased<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.269> lets<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:24.600> skill<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.430> 700
