well I started making these toothpick

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.820 
well I started making these toothpick
holders<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:14.309> see<00:00:14.519> they're<00:00:14.880> nice<00:00:15.030> tall<00:00:15.830> simple

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
holders you see they're nice tall simple

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.090 
holders you see they're nice tall simple
things<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.880> it's<00:00:18.449> got<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> large<00:00:19.590> bore<00:00:19.949> in

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
things and it's got the large bore in

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.670 
things and it's got the large bore in
there<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> toothpicks<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.420> I<00:00:21.570> make<00:00:22.050> caps

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
there for the toothpicks and I make caps

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.910 
there for the toothpicks and I make caps
that<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:24.260> regular<00:00:25.260> corks

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
that take regular corks

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.390 
that take regular corks
it's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:27.060> nice<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.510> package<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:29.099> issue<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it's a nice little package the issue I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.240 
it's a nice little package the issue I
ran<00:00:29.640> into<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> turn<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:31.199> as<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
ran into is I like to turn these as you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.830 
ran into is I like to turn these as you
see<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.669> might<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> off<00:00:33.660> the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
see this might just get it off the

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.200 
see this might just get it off the
faceplate<00:00:34.440> off<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> waste<00:00:35.550> block<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:36.000> should

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
faceplate off the waste block I should

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
faceplate off the waste block I should
say<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.570> was<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.930> faceplate<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
say that was that in the faceplate and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
say that was that in the faceplate and
now<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> want<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> turn<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.120> foot<00:00:40.219> but<00:00:41.899> how<00:00:42.899> to

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
now I want to turn the foot but how to

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.190 
now I want to turn the foot but how to
hold<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.530> becomes<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> issue<00:00:44.899> so<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:46.140> I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
hold this becomes the issue so what I

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.160 
hold this becomes the issue so what I
ended<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.590> doing<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.789> made<00:00:48.170> what

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
ended up doing is I made what

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
ended up doing is I made what
effectively<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:51.500> expansion<00:00:52.500> chuck<00:00:52.910> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
effectively is a expansion chuck it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
effectively is a expansion chuck it
starts<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> piece<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.780> aluminum<00:00:55.020> like

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
starts with a piece of aluminum like

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.920 
starts with a piece of aluminum like
this<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.579> hunk<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.149> inch<00:00:57.329> bar<00:00:57.570> stack

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
this just a hunk of one inch bar stack

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.700 
this just a hunk of one inch bar stack
and<00:00:58.800> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.399> six<00:00:59.670> inches<00:00:59.789> long<00:01:00.590> then<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and this is about six inches long then I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.929 
and this is about six inches long then I
cut<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.340> V<00:01:02.609> into<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
cut this V into it as you can see and a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
cut this V into it as you can see and a
line<00:01:06.720> on<00:01:07.170> my<00:01:07.890> bandsaw<00:01:08.659> away<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.080> V<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
line on my bandsaw away from that V I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.679 
line on my bandsaw away from that V I
took<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.670> V<00:01:11.850> piece<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:14.310> cut<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> ends<00:01:15.570> off

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
took the V piece and I cut the ends off

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.350 
took the V piece and I cut the ends off
I<00:01:16.080> guess<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.070> should<00:01:17.250> say<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.670> though<00:01:18.000> before

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I guess I should say first though before

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.929 
I guess I should say first though before
I<00:01:18.390> cut<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.930> B<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.380> drilled<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.430> hole<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> way

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
I cut the B I drilled a hole all the way

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:21.469 
I cut the B I drilled a hole all the way
through

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
through

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.530 
through
that's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.290> clearance<00:01:22.650> hole<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> quarter<00:01:24.210> 20

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that's a clearance hole for a quarter 20

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.819 
that's a clearance hole for a quarter 20
red<00:01:25.340> so<00:01:26.340> now<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:28.140> piece<00:01:28.409> cut

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
red so now that I have this piece cut

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.109 
red so now that I have this piece cut
and<00:01:29.270> that<00:01:30.270> will<00:01:30.390> fit<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.750> there<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.790> now<00:01:32.790> have

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
and that will fit in there I now have

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.789 
and that will fit in there I now have
the<00:01:33.270> quarter<00:01:33.570> twenty<00:01:33.900> rod<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:37.259> wing<00:01:37.619> nut

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the quarter twenty rod and a wing nut

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.240 
the quarter twenty rod and a wing nut
the<00:01:38.520> wing<00:01:38.729> nut<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.210> had<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.750> shave<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.650> wings

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the wing nut I had to shave the wings

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.039 
the wing nut I had to shave the wings
look<00:01:41.460> down<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:41.850> bit<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.570> didn't

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
look down a little bit so that didn't

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
look down a little bit so that didn't
extend<00:01:43.380> beyond<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.979> diameter<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.640> piece

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
extend beyond the diameter of this piece

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
extend beyond the diameter of this piece
and<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.259> way<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> works<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:48.619> put<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.799> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
and the way it works is I put this on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.639 
and the way it works is I put this on
like<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.710> run<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> center<00:01:53.759> and

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
like so run this up to the center and

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
like so run this up to the center and
secure<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.340> nut<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.299> water<00:01:59.630> now<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
secure with the nut and a water now I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.910 
secure with the nut and a water now I
make<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.890> holes<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.700> toothpick<00:02:03.210> holder

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
make the holes in my toothpick holder

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.649 
make the holes in my toothpick holder
actually<00:02:04.920> two<00:02:05.130> diameters<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.180> primary

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
actually two diameters of the primary

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.790 
actually two diameters of the primary
one<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:06.960> one-inch<00:02:07.530> diameter<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.810> up<00:02:09.810> near<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
one is one-inch diameter and up near the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.700 
one is one-inch diameter and up near the
top<00:02:11.039> part<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.640> hole<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.180> drill<00:02:13.020> one

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
top part of the hole I drill one

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.790 
top part of the hole I drill one
sixteenth<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:15.240> that's<00:02:15.810> because<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.440> quarks

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
sixteenth and that's because the quarks

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.980 
sixteenth and that's because the quarks
just<00:02:17.040> sent<00:02:17.250> better<00:02:17.460> than<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.700> parameter<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
just sent better than that parameter so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.170 
just sent better than that parameter so
it's<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.230> two-stage<00:02:19.650> whole<00:02:20.040> than<00:02:20.730> what<00:02:21.060> I've

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
it's a two-stage whole than what I've

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.480 
it's a two-stage whole than what I've
got<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.900> two-stage<00:02:22.350> diameter<00:02:22.920> this

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
got here is the two-stage diameter this

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.700 
got here is the two-stage diameter this
is<00:02:23.550> one<00:02:23.880> inch<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.930> fit<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.380> one<00:02:25.530> inch

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
is one inch and to fit in the one inch

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.460 
is one inch and to fit in the one inch
hole<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.950> had<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> Machine<00:02:26.760> a<00:02:26.790> little<00:02:26.940> bit<00:02:27.270> off

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
hole I had the Machine a little bit off

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.930 
hole I had the Machine a little bit off
so<00:02:28.470> that's<00:02:28.710> diameters<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.310> little<00:02:29.550> bit<00:02:29.670> smaller

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
so that's diameters a little bit smaller

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.700 
so that's diameters a little bit smaller
than<00:02:30.120> one-inch<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:30.960> slides<00:02:31.260> right<00:02:31.410> in

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
than one-inch it just slides right in

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.580 
than one-inch it just slides right in
and<00:02:31.920> then<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:33.030> bump<00:02:33.360> up<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.750> outside<00:02:33.900> instead

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
and then to bump up the outside instead

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.350 
and then to bump up the outside instead
of<00:02:34.830> cutting<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.340> ring<00:02:35.550> groove<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.060> putting<00:02:36.270> an

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
of cutting a ring groove and putting an

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.700 
of cutting a ring groove and putting an
overhang<00:02:36.690> which<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.020> could<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.230> done<00:02:37.500> I

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
overhang which I could have done I

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.820 
overhang which I could have done I
simply<00:02:38.430> wrapped<00:02:38.640> some<00:02:39.650> electrical<00:02:40.650> tape

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
simply wrapped some electrical tape

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.520 
simply wrapped some electrical tape
around<00:02:40.860> there<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.510> what<00:02:42.690> will<00:02:42.840> happen<00:02:43.290> now

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
around there and so what will happen now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.460 
around there and so what will happen now
is<00:02:44.340> that<00:02:44.400> will<00:02:44.730> fit<00:02:44.940> right<00:02:44.970> in<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.780> this

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
is that will fit right in there and this

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.640 
is that will fit right in there and this
is<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.710> nice<00:02:47.010> GM<00:02:47.400> fit<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.330> diameter<00:02:48.650> now

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
is a nice GM fit for this diameter now

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.920 
is a nice GM fit for this diameter now
when<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.860> tighten<00:02:50.280> this<00:02:50.460> nut<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:51.480> will<00:02:51.660> spread

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
when I tighten this nut it will spread

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
when I tighten this nut it will spread
that<00:02:52.110> chunk<00:02:52.440> out<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> little<00:02:52.770> bit<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.280> it'll

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
that chunk out a little bit and it'll

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.420 
that chunk out a little bit and it'll
hold<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.300> in<00:02:54.420> there<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.990> I'll<00:02:55.740> show<00:02:55.950> you<00:02:55.980> on

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
hold it in there and I'll show you on

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.230 
hold it in there and I'll show you on
the<00:02:56.550> lathe<00:02:56.730> next<00:02:57.270> how<00:02:57.450> this<00:02:57.660> will<00:02:57.840> work<00:03:02.240> now

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
the lathe next how this will work now

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.000 
the lathe next how this will work now
we're<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.690> lathe<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.230> see<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> have<00:03:04.770> my

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
we're on the lathe if you see I have my

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.050 
we're on the lathe if you see I have my
Chuck<00:03:05.640> with<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.950> spindle<00:03:07.950> jaws<00:03:08.340> on<00:03:08.610> it<00:03:08.820> these

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
Chuck with the spindle jaws on it these

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.010 
Chuck with the spindle jaws on it these
are<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.570> know<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:09.840> they're<00:03:09.990> really

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
are I don't know what they're really

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.650 
are I don't know what they're really
called<00:03:10.350> but<00:03:10.650> they're<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.980> small<00:03:11.490> ones<00:03:11.760> often

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
called but they're the small ones often

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.080 
called but they're the small ones often
used<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.440> hold<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.010> inside<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.520> holes<00:03:14.730> but

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
used to hold on the inside of holes but

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.090 
used to hold on the inside of holes but
they're<00:03:15.360> not<00:03:15.570> small<00:03:15.990> enough<00:03:16.290> to<00:03:16.680> hold<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
they're not small enough to hold the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.680 
they're not small enough to hold the
inside<00:03:17.430> of<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.640> one<00:03:17.850> edge<00:03:18.030> holds<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:18.510> that's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
inside of this one edge holds so that's

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900 
inside of this one edge holds so that's
why<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:18.900> came<00:03:18.990> up<00:03:19.170> with<00:03:19.410> this<00:03:19.610> on<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.790> other

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
why I came up with this on the other

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.210 
why I came up with this on the other
hand<00:03:21.240> they<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.540> hold<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.470> diameter<00:03:22.770> very

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
hand they will hold this diameter very

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.500 
hand they will hold this diameter very
nice<00:03:24.320> from<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.350> check<00:03:26.340> that<00:03:26.520> I<00:03:26.610> made<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.300> we'll

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
nice from the check that I made so we'll

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:38.000 
nice from the check that I made so we'll
put<00:03:27.720> this<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.050> here

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.720 

and<00:03:39.010> now

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.660 

you<00:03:45.569> see<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.110> will<00:03:46.290> spend<00:03:47.099> this<00:03:47.340> very

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
you see that I will spend this very

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.050 
you see that I will spend this very
nicely<00:03:47.909> and<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.659> will<00:03:49.349> be<00:03:49.739> able<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.099> turn<00:03:51.000> that

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
nicely and I will be able to turn that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.520 
nicely and I will be able to turn that
foot<00:03:53.239> anybody<00:03:54.239> down<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.480> little<00:03:54.629> bit<00:03:54.900> excuse<00:03:55.349> my

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
foot anybody down a little bit excuse my

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.009 
foot anybody down a little bit excuse my
jumping<00:03:55.980> this<00:03:56.129> here<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:57.659> see<00:03:57.690> now<00:03:57.989> I

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
jumping this here but you can see now I

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.910 
jumping this here but you can see now I
can<00:03:58.200> just<00:03:58.560> turn<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.400> foot<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.720> tell<00:04:01.620> nice

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
can just turn that foot and tell nice

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.630 
can just turn that foot and tell nice
and<00:04:02.160> rigidly<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.890> ready<00:04:04.890> go<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.069> thought<00:04:05.400> you'd

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
and rigidly so ready go I thought you'd

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.820 
and rigidly so ready go I thought you'd
enjoy<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:06.030> now<00:04:06.450> of<00:04:06.569> course<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.959> could<00:04:07.140> scale

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
enjoy that now of course you could scale

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.259 
enjoy that now of course you could scale
this<00:04:08.069> for<00:04:08.310> whatever<00:04:08.459> you'd<00:04:08.819> happen<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.150> be

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
this for whatever you'd happen to be

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.059 
this for whatever you'd happen to be
making<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.400> use<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.579> appropriate<00:04:12.349> alot<00:04:13.379> you

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
making and use the appropriate alot you

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.640 
making and use the appropriate alot you
could<00:04:14.220> probably<00:04:14.400> use<00:04:14.760> wooden<00:04:15.209> dowels<00:04:15.650> but

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
could probably use wooden dowels but

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.830 
could probably use wooden dowels but
obviously<00:04:17.070> there<00:04:17.340> won't<00:04:17.489> be<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.669> stiff<00:04:18.030> also<00:04:18.419> if

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
obviously there won't be a stiff also if

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.199 
obviously there won't be a stiff also if
you<00:04:18.930> use<00:04:18.989> wooden<00:04:19.380> dowels<00:04:19.760> that<00:04:20.760> would<00:04:20.910> be<00:04:21.000> good

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
you use wooden dowels that would be good

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.629 
you use wooden dowels that would be good
for<00:04:21.449> one<00:04:21.690> or<00:04:21.810> two<00:04:21.989> usage<00:04:22.500> but<00:04:22.740> as<00:04:22.889> you<00:04:23.100> clamp<00:04:23.430> it

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 
for one or two usage but as you clamp it

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:25.430 
for one or two usage but as you clamp it
repeatedly<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.330> device<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:24.990> probably<00:04:25.110> put

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
repeatedly and device you probably put

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.930 
repeatedly and device you probably put
divots<00:04:25.860> in<00:04:25.979> there<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.310> it'll<00:04:26.430> start<00:04:26.669> going

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
divots in there and it'll start going

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.379 
divots in there and it'll start going
out<00:04:27.060> around<00:04:27.389> on<00:04:27.600> you<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:29.280> something<00:04:29.550> else<00:04:29.669> to

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
out around on you just something else to

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.280 
out around on you just something else to
give<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.660> a<00:04:30.690> solution<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.440> turning<00:04:31.949> issues
