kind<00:04:41.539> of<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.690> new<00:04:41.810> feature<00:04:42.130> what<00:04:43.130> we<00:04:43.280> have<00:04:43.430> down

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
kind of a new feature what we have down

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.170 
kind of a new feature what we have down
here<00:04:43.910> is<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:45.940> some<00:04:46.940> sort<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:49.990> signal<00:04:50.990> repeater

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
here is a some sort of signal repeater

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.850 
here is a some sort of signal repeater
type<00:04:53.180> thing<00:04:53.449> what<00:04:53.930> happens<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:55.690> if<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:57.080> input

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
type thing what happens is if you input

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:05.469 
type thing what happens is if you input
a<00:04:58.400> signal<00:05:00.669> into<00:05:01.669> this<00:05:01.820> guy<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:04.520> runs<00:05:05.270> down

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:05.479 
a signal into this guy it runs down

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:08.200 
a signal into this guy it runs down
there<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.050> comes<00:05:06.530> on<00:05:06.740> back<00:05:06.979> and<00:05:07.280> then<00:05:07.610> send

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
there and comes on back and then send

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:14.140 
there and comes on back and then send
you<00:05:08.419> one<00:05:08.630> pulse<00:05:09.020> back<00:05:12.310> they'll<00:05:13.310> come<00:05:13.610> back<00:05:13.789> and

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
you one pulse back they'll come back and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.800 
you one pulse back they'll come back and
it'll<00:05:14.449> pulse<00:05:14.780> once<00:05:15.430> and<00:05:16.430> what<00:05:17.210> I'm<00:05:17.330> using<00:05:17.539> that

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
it'll pulse once and what I'm using that

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.750 
it'll pulse once and what I'm using that
for<00:05:18.199> is<00:05:18.530> to<00:05:19.690> send<00:05:20.690> a<00:05:20.870> final<00:05:21.380> reset<00:05:22.010> after<00:05:22.250> you

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
for is to send a final reset after you

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.860 
for is to send a final reset after you
leave<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.530> station<00:05:25.060> that'll<00:05:26.060> reset<00:05:26.570> all<00:05:26.840> the

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
leave the station that'll reset all the

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.520 
leave the station that'll reset all the
tracks<00:05:27.650> back<00:05:28.490> to<00:05:28.759> the<00:05:28.909> default<00:05:29.530> configuration

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
tracks back to the default configuration

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.460 
tracks back to the default configuration
and<00:05:30.740> the<00:05:31.310> reason<00:05:31.520> that's<00:05:31.639> important<00:05:32.240> on<00:05:32.570> this

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
and the reason that's important on this

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.040 
and the reason that's important on this
particular<00:05:33.740> station<00:05:34.400> is<00:05:34.729> because<00:05:35.060> since<00:05:35.870> I'm

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
particular station is because since I'm

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:41.050 
particular station is because since I'm
not<00:05:36.289> using<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:39.110> tracks<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.880> send<00:05:40.880> the

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.060 
not using the tracks to send the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:43.779 
not using the tracks to send the
arrivals<00:05:41.659> on<00:05:41.930> the<00:05:42.020> separate<00:05:42.860> separate<00:05:43.430> track

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
arrivals on the separate separate track

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:46.240 
arrivals on the separate separate track
we're<00:05:44.240> using<00:05:44.389> the<00:05:44.650> same<00:05:45.650> track<00:05:46.009> as<00:05:46.039> the

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
we're using the same track as the

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.710 
we're using the same track as the
departures<00:05:46.820> we<00:05:46.970> got<00:05:47.120> to<00:05:47.210> make<00:05:47.330> sure<00:05:47.360> that

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
departures we got to make sure that

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.950 
departures we got to make sure that
these<00:05:47.840> pieces<00:05:48.169> are<00:05:48.380> in<00:05:48.650> the<00:05:48.830> proper<00:05:49.699> position

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
these pieces are in the proper position

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.330 
these pieces are in the proper position
so<00:05:50.960> that<00:05:50.990> when<00:05:51.259> you<00:05:51.380> enter<00:05:51.740> the<00:05:51.919> station

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
so that when you enter the station

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.999 
so that when you enter the station
you'll<00:05:52.940> always<00:05:53.300> get<00:05:53.750> routed<00:05:54.050> to<00:05:54.979> the

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:55.009 
you'll always get routed to the

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:59.800 
you'll always get routed to the
selection<00:05:55.699> area<00:05:56.030> if<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.729> selected<00:05:58.810> track

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
selection area if you selected track

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:06.670 
selection area if you selected track
number<00:06:00.849> let's<00:06:01.849> try<00:06:02.060> three<00:06:05.110> like<00:06:06.110> three<00:06:06.139> there

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 
number let's try three like three there

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.649 
number let's try three like three there
if<00:06:06.800> he<00:06:06.889> came<00:06:07.099> in<00:06:07.250> left<00:06:07.820> on<00:06:07.969> three<00:06:08.240> but<00:06:08.479> came

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 
if he came in left on three but came

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:10.870 
if he came in left on three but came
back<00:06:08.690> in<00:06:09.020> on<00:06:09.139> for<00:06:09.500> you<00:06:10.099> just
