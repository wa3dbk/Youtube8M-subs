00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
of the coon print it could be pretty

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.430 
of the coon print it could be pretty
good<00:02:27.400> size<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.209> lets<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.630> wired<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:29.080> up<00:02:29.200> real

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
good size and it lets I wired it up real

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.199 
good size and it lets I wired it up real
well<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.830> going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.069> be<00:02:30.130> pretty<00:02:30.280> flimsy<00:02:30.700> and

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
well it's going to be pretty flimsy and

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.660 
well it's going to be pretty flimsy and
he<00:02:32.019> was<00:02:32.170> afraid<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> actually<00:02:32.769> drowning<00:02:35.670> the

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
he was afraid of actually drowning the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.280 
he was afraid of actually drowning the
Coon<00:02:36.910> because<00:02:37.330> you<00:02:37.420> could<00:02:37.569> get<00:02:37.750> in<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:38.110> get

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
Coon because you could get in there get

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.350 
Coon because you could get in there get
caught<00:02:38.560> you're<00:02:38.800> trapped<00:02:39.130> can't<00:02:39.459> get<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
caught you're trapped can't get out the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.229 
caught you're trapped can't get out the
wire<00:02:40.569> being<00:02:40.870> soft<00:02:41.260> or<00:02:41.709> more<00:02:42.370> pliable<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.090> this

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
wire being soft or more pliable in this

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.559 
wire being soft or more pliable in this
rather<00:02:43.480> rigid<00:02:43.810> wire<00:02:44.760> could<00:02:45.760> cause<00:02:46.000> harm<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
rather rigid wire could cause harm to

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.440 
rather rigid wire could cause harm to
the<00:02:46.900> Coon<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:47.980> opted<00:02:48.340> against<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> chicken

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
the Coon so I opted against the chicken

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.100 
the Coon so I opted against the chicken
wire<00:02:49.860> even<00:02:50.860> though<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:52.090> could<00:02:52.599> be<00:02:52.840> possible

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
wire even though it could be possible

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.309 
wire even though it could be possible
that<00:02:54.069> if<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.209> fellow<00:02:55.450> walks<00:02:55.780> out<00:02:55.989> here<00:02:56.140> on

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
that if the fellow walks out here on

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.930 
that if the fellow walks out here on
it's<00:02:56.830> sturdy<00:02:57.160> enough<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.430> hold<00:02:57.549> him

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
it's sturdy enough to hold him

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.789 
it's sturdy enough to hold him
especially<00:02:58.269> as<00:02:58.630> i<00:02:58.750> put<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.019> crossmember<00:02:59.349> on

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
especially as i put this crossmember on

these watermelons that came out of an
organic<00:03:44.569> garden<00:03:45.200> and<00:03:45.469> of<00:03:46.400> course<00:03:46.639> they've

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
organic garden and of course they've

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.520 
organic garden and of course they've
taken<00:03:47.060> it<00:03:47.269> hard<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.780> course<00:03:47.810> it's<00:03:48.169> a<00:03:48.290> rough

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
taken it hard of course it's a rough

to<00:03:50.359> try<00:03:50.510> to<00:03:50.650> convert<00:03:51.650> so<00:03:51.950> my<00:03:52.579> idea<00:03:52.969> is<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.739> allow

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
to try to convert so my idea is to allow

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.449 
to try to convert so my idea is to allow
these<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.519> remain<00:03:56.239> for<00:03:56.569> a<00:03:56.629> while<00:03:57.010> use<00:03:58.010> up<00:03:58.219> their

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
these to remain for a while use up their

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.879 
these to remain for a while use up their
energy<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.329> create<00:03:59.569> or<00:03:59.959> set<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.379> root<00:04:00.590> face

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
energy to create or set the root face

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:04.869 
energy to create or set the root face
required<00:04:01.989> or<00:04:02.989> the<00:04:03.109> shocked<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:03.889> then<00:04:04.639> as

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
required or the shocked and then as

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.839 
required or the shocked and then as
these<00:04:05.269> begin<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.079> dry<00:04:06.439> and<00:04:06.859> actually<00:04:07.519> stop

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
these begin to dry and actually stop

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.509 
these begin to dry and actually stop
doing<00:04:08.209> their<00:04:08.419> job<00:04:08.750> which<00:04:09.680> would<00:04:09.919> be<00:04:10.069> to<00:04:10.310> help

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
doing their job which would be to help

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.309 
doing their job which would be to help
the<00:04:10.639> plant<00:04:10.879> become<00:04:11.269> more<00:04:11.540> accustomed<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:12.230> the

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
the plant become more accustomed to the

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.789 
the plant become more accustomed to the
new<00:04:12.469> environment<00:04:13.129> oh<00:04:13.219> there's<00:04:13.430> my<00:04:13.549> finger

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
new environment oh there's my finger

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.710 
new environment oh there's my finger
I'll<00:04:15.799> trim<00:04:16.250> these<00:04:16.400> back<00:04:16.789> and<00:04:17.150> let<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.449> new

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
I'll trim these back and let this new

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.060 
I'll trim these back and let this new
stuff<00:04:18.019> go<00:04:19.810> there<00:04:20.810> was<00:04:20.959> actually<00:04:21.349> three<00:04:21.680> plants

stuff go there was actually three plants
and<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:22.610> looked<00:04:22.789> like<00:04:22.849> one<00:04:23.180> plant<00:04:23.539> but<00:04:23.750> when<00:04:23.900> I

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
and it looked like one plant but when I

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.980 
and it looked like one plant but when I
got<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.259> and<00:04:24.410> started<00:04:24.440> soaking<00:04:24.949> the<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:26.060> be

organic<00:04:27.650> dirt<00:04:28.009> off<00:04:28.250> of<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.639> I<00:04:29.500> discovered<00:04:30.500> it

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
organic dirt off of it I discovered it

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.320 
organic dirt off of it I discovered it
was<00:04:30.710> actually<00:04:31.310> three<00:04:31.580> plants<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:31.940> there's<00:04:32.120> one

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
was actually three plants so there's one

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.210 
was actually three plants so there's one
here<00:04:32.750> and<00:04:32.990> they<00:04:33.289> may<00:04:33.500> not<00:04:33.680> take<00:04:33.979> this

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
here and they may not take this

scalpel here one standing and so these
