 you see on the frozen video number of 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.280
 1 to 6 wanted to place in the center and then you 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.890
 go take the left end and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.850

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.350
 6 exactly as on the video 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.869
 here you already have the boches of a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.670
 flower now you will iron the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.090
 wires inside the drops for 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.479

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.830
 you take one of the ends you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.259
 put the pair on the round and make you 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.810

 you just have to stick the flower on 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.259

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.850
