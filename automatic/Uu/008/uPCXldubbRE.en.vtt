ginger growing so what I'm going to do
is<00:00:16.139> put<00:00:16.379> it<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.740> bit<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> valley<00:00:17.760> this<00:00:18.390> time

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
is put it in a bit of a valley this time

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.090 
is put it in a bit of a valley this time
and<00:00:19.520> I've<00:00:20.520> got<00:00:20.730> my<00:00:20.880> rhizomes<00:00:21.920> with<00:00:22.920> these

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
and I've got my rhizomes with these

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.929 
and I've got my rhizomes with these
nodules<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.880> them<00:00:24.529> spaced<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.699> just

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
nodules on them spaced about of just

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.220 
nodules on them spaced about of just
zigzag<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:28.289> 12<00:00:29.390> rhizomes<00:00:30.390> here<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
zigzag them about 12 rhizomes here and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.090 
zigzag them about 12 rhizomes here and
I've<00:00:31.710> got<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.009> about<00:00:32.279> 300<00:00:33.090> or<00:00:33.239> 1<00:00:33.690> foot

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
I've got them about 300 or 1 foot

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.869 
I've got them about 300 or 1 foot
spacing<00:00:35.100> between<00:00:35.730> each<00:00:36.120> plant<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> what<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> got

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
spacing between each plant so what I got

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
spacing between each plant so what I got
is<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> lime<00:00:40.559> better<00:00:40.920> dolomite

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
is a little bit of lime better dolomite

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
is a little bit of lime better dolomite
line<00:00:41.960> give<00:00:42.960> them<00:00:43.079> all<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> bit<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.680> Decimus

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
line give them all a bit of a Decimus

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.869 
line give them all a bit of a Decimus
dolomite<00:00:44.850> line<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:49.250> I've<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.460> some<00:00:50.640> blood

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
dolomite line and I've got some blood

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.170 
dolomite line and I've got some blood
and<00:00:51.030> bone<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.039> just<00:00:53.789> gotta<00:00:53.940> give<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and bone here and just gotta give it

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.420 
and bone here and just gotta give it
taller<00:00:54.629> size<00:00:54.989> dressing<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.649> blood<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.039> bone

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.689 

good<00:01:01.270> a<00:01:01.300> good<00:01:01.719> generous<00:01:02.140> amount<00:01:02.550> don't<00:01:03.550> want

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
good a good generous amount don't want

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.359 
good a good generous amount don't want
to<00:01:03.820> too<00:01:03.969> close<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.720> actual<00:01:05.530> rhizome

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
to too close to the actual rhizome

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:15.300 
to too close to the actual rhizome
itself<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:13.090> improvement<00:01:13.780> here<00:01:14.049> is<00:01:14.350> that

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
itself so the improvement here is that

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
itself so the improvement here is that
last<00:01:15.520> year<00:01:15.790> I<00:01:15.940> didn't<00:01:16.330> have<00:01:16.390> enough<00:01:16.780> hardwood

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
last year I didn't have enough hardwood

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.310 
last year I didn't have enough hardwood
sawdust<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:20.020> put<00:01:20.350> a<00:01:20.380> good<00:01:20.680> covering<00:01:21.430> on<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:22.320> on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
sawdust to put a good covering on the on

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280 
sawdust to put a good covering on the on
the<00:01:23.500> ginger<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.940> so<00:01:25.540> that's<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.899> reason<00:01:26.259> for

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
the ginger so so that's the reason for

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.430 
the ginger so so that's the reason for
having<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.800> bit<00:01:26.950> of<00:01:26.979> an<00:01:27.159> IV<00:01:27.909> because<00:01:28.810> you<00:01:29.200> want

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
having a bit of an IV because you want

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.430 
having a bit of an IV because you want
about<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.740> four-inch<00:01:30.399> covering<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.440> hardwood

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
about a four-inch covering of hardwood

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.940 
about a four-inch covering of hardwood
sawdust<00:01:33.039> on<00:01:33.310> the<00:01:34.289> ginger<00:01:35.289> so<00:01:35.500> I'm<00:01:35.560> just<00:01:35.770> going

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950

on<00:03:03.700> top<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:05.489> so<00:03:06.489> we've<00:03:06.639> got<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.819> lot<00:03:07.030> and

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
on top of that so we've got a lot and

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.619 
on top of that so we've got a lot and
look<00:03:07.750> thicker<00:03:08.069> amount<00:03:09.069> of<00:03:09.519> sawdust<00:03:10.000> on<00:03:10.299> the

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
look thicker amount of sawdust on the

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.619 
look thicker amount of sawdust on the
ginger<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:12.340> year<00:03:12.670> than<00:03:13.000> what<00:03:13.120> we<00:03:13.269> had<00:03:13.420> last

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:13.629 
ginger this year than what we had last

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.369 
ginger this year than what we had last
year<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.879> we've<00:03:15.879> got<00:03:16.060> an<00:03:16.239> average<00:03:16.659> of<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.109> keel

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
year and we've got an average of a keel

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:22.129 
year and we've got an average of a keel
over<00:03:17.560> plant<00:03:18.870> last<00:03:19.870> year<00:03:20.200> or<00:03:20.439> this<00:03:20.829> this<00:03:21.159> year

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
over plant last year or this this year

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.979 
over plant last year or this this year
so<00:03:23.139> I'm<00:03:23.230> hoping<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.680> get<00:03:23.859> as<00:03:24.329> much<00:03:25.329> as<00:03:25.599> that<00:03:25.810> or

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
so I'm hoping to get as much as that or

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.619 
so I'm hoping to get as much as that or
even<00:03:26.139> more<00:03:26.439> this<00:03:26.709> next<00:03:27.250> year<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:28.389> in

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
even more this next year but in

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.720 
even more this next year but in
