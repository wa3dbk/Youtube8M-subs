hey guys Mike here today I want to take
a<00:00:03.389> look<00:00:03.570> at<00:00:03.720> cases<00:00:03.990> for<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.470> iPhone<00:00:04.920> 4s

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:05.450 
a look at cases for the iPhone 4s

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.550 
a look at cases for the iPhone 4s
essentially<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.509> iPhone<00:00:06.750> 4s<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.319> same

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
essentially the iPhone 4s is the same

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.470 
essentially the iPhone 4s is the same
shape<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.160> generally<00:00:08.610> pretty<00:00:08.970> much<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.269> same

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
shape and generally pretty much the same

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.570 
shape and generally pretty much the same
as<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.019> iPhone<00:00:10.200> formed<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.070> one<00:00:11.219> difference

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
as the iPhone formed the one difference

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.850 
as the iPhone formed the one difference
here<00:00:11.639> on<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.000> side<00:00:12.300> these<00:00:12.990> buttons<00:00:13.349> line<00:00:13.620> up<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
here on the side these buttons line up a

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.350 
here on the side these buttons line up a
little<00:00:13.889> bit<00:00:14.250> differently<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.849> resembles

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
little bit differently this resembles

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.870 
little bit differently this resembles
the<00:00:15.509> Verizon<00:00:16.080> iPhone<00:00:16.260> for<00:00:16.740> both<00:00:17.010> these<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.490> 18

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the Verizon iPhone for both these are 18

iPhone 4 on the right and bottom line
here<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.430> case<00:00:23.699> that<00:00:24.150> works

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
here is if you got a case that works

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
here is if you got a case that works
with<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> Verizon<00:00:25.470> iPhone<00:00:25.619> 4<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.310> should<00:00:26.460> be

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
with the Verizon iPhone 4 you should be

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.910 
with the Verizon iPhone 4 you should be
good<00:00:26.730> on<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:26.970> iPhone<00:00:27.390> 4s<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.740> some

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
good on the iPhone 4s right so some

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
good on the iPhone 4s right so some
cases<00:00:29.039> will<00:00:29.279> be<00:00:29.369> working<00:00:29.670> just<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.090> 18<00:00:30.480> t

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
cases will be working just for 18 t

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.999 
cases will be working just for 18 t
those<00:00:30.960> are<00:00:31.080> particularly<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> older<00:00:31.830> ones

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
those are particularly the older ones

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.860 
those are particularly the older ones
some<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> newer<00:00:32.550> ones<00:00:32.850> will<00:00:33.390> work<00:00:33.600> for

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
some of the newer ones will work for

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.389 
some of the newer ones will work for
have<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.410> two<00:00:34.559> versions<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.100> for<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
have you know two versions one for the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.310 
have you know two versions one for the
Verizon<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.120> one<00:00:36.510> that'll<00:00:36.780> work<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.079> both

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
Verizon and one that'll work for both

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
Verizon and one that'll work for both
the<00:00:37.559> ATT<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.250> Verizon<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.210> looks<00:00:39.390> like<00:00:39.450> if

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
the ATT and Verizon so it looks like if

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
the ATT and Verizon so it looks like if
you<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> case<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> works<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you have a case that works with the

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
you have a case that works with the
Verizon<00:00:41.850> iPhone<00:00:41.940> 4<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.960> should<00:00:42.989> be<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
Verizon iPhone 4 you should be good to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.020 
Verizon iPhone 4 you should be good to
go<00:00:43.559> there's<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> lot<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.129> cases<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.820> on

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
go there's a lot of cases out there on

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.090 
go there's a lot of cases out there on
the<00:00:45.180> store<00:00:45.390> shelf<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.870> just<00:00:46.079> look<00:00:46.260> for<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the store shelf so just look for that so

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.139 
the store shelf so just look for that so
the<00:00:47.160> main<00:00:47.309> thing<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> show<00:00:48.059> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the main thing I just want to show you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.400 
the main thing I just want to show you
is<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> difference<00:00:48.809> between<00:00:48.870> these<00:00:49.320> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is the difference between these you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.510 
is the difference between these you
could<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.739> antenna<00:00:50.039> is<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.430> bit

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
could see the antenna is a little bit

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.549 
could see the antenna is a little bit
different<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.329> iPhone<00:00:51.690> 4<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.170> has<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
different the iPhone 4 here has this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.000 
different the iPhone 4 here has this
bridge<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.579> top<00:00:53.879> where<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.079> iPhone<00:00:55.500> 4<00:00:55.829> here

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
bridge up on top where the iPhone 4 here

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.970 
bridge up on top where the iPhone 4 here
on<00:00:56.100> 18<00:00:56.520> t<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.180> over<00:00:57.329> there<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> then<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
on 18 t has it over there and then the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
on 18 t has it over there and then the
buttons<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:01:00.059> different

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
buttons are a little bit different

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.229 
buttons are a little bit different
basically<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> 4s<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.640> bit<00:01:02.820> lower

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
basically the 4s is a little bit lower

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.160 
basically the 4s is a little bit lower
and<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.600> where<00:01:03.840> you're<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.110> run

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and that's where you're going to run

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
and that's where you're going to run
some<00:01:04.470> problems<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:04.949> some<00:01:04.979> cases<00:01:05.489> alright<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
some problems with some cases alright so

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
some problems with some cases alright so
let's<00:01:05.970> check<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.450> couple<00:01:06.750> cases<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.320> on

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
let's check out a couple cases here on

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.490 
let's check out a couple cases here on
the<00:01:07.680> 4s<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:09.030> from<00:01:09.290> Signet<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the 4s this one here is from Signet and

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.399 
the 4s this one here is from Signet and
this<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.549> basically<00:01:12.510> works<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.170> fine

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
this is basically works just fine

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.929 
this is basically works just fine
because<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.070> designed<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.549> work<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.880> both

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
because it's designed to work with both

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.899 
because it's designed to work with both
the<00:01:15.299> iPhone<00:01:15.509> 4<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.350> ATT<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.369> Verizon<00:01:17.759> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
the iPhone 4 on ATT and Verizon and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.310 
the iPhone 4 on ATT and Verizon and
we're<00:01:18.000> good<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.299> go<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.540> buttons<00:01:18.840> line<00:01:19.110> up

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
we're good to go the buttons line up

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
we're good to go the buttons line up
pretty<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.520> off<00:01:20.640> center

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
pretty well it's a little bit off center

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.940 
pretty well it's a little bit off center
but<00:01:20.970> close<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> work<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.619> up<00:01:22.770> on

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but close enough to work and then up on

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
but close enough to work and then up on
top<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.790> silence<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.479> works<00:01:24.780> just

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
top and the silence which works just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.690 
top and the silence which works just
fine<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.470> everything's<00:01:25.799> nice<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.040> accessible

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
fine so everything's nice and accessible

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
know they're they're close enough that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.530 
know they're they're close enough that
you<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> nice<00:01:44.280> still<00:01:44.610> solid<00:01:45.119> click<00:01:45.329> on

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
them right here you can see the silence

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.249 
them right here you can see the silence
which<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> partially<00:01:48.390> covered<00:01:48.899> now

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
which is partially covered now

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
which is partially covered now
technically<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.159> work<00:01:50.399> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.790> your

iPhone 4s it's just not gonna have the
perfect<00:01:59.340> accessibility<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.810> other<00:02:00.930> than

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
that everything seems to work just fine

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.700 
that everything seems to work just fine
all<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.119> other<00:02:03.360> buttons<00:02:03.719> work<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.560> top

microphone still works fine and the
headset<00:02:07.020> jack<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.409> up<00:02:07.560> pretty<00:02:07.740> much<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.129> same

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
headset jack is up pretty much the same

headset jack is up pretty much the same
so<00:02:08.970> just<00:02:09.239> note<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.629> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.229> an<00:02:10.440> old

probably this silent switch

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.690 
probably this silent switch
