00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.670
 Hello coming of the new year yet 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.650
 make a small gift namely 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.960
 talk about technology which 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.050
 called remote desktop 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.270
 The essence of technology in the next you can 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 manage your desktop 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.510
 using ios or android 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.710
 device for this you need 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.250
 Internet connection 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.800
 it can be like wi-fi such 3g in 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.660
 general now show how it all 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.660
 set up to go 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.050
 go to the developer site link I 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.300
 gave in the description under the video 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.460
 choose the appropriate operating room 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.089
 system and download the program on 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.059
 computer 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.159
 then video web quarrels and download 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 app called team vibo 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.960
 link to download also leave in 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.449
 description actually 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
 programs of remote access a lot 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.360
 but I chose this because I consider it the most 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 productive since in similar 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.909
 programs or problems with the transfer 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.069
 colors 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.530
 or the sound does not play 

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:18.009
 device so let's install 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.619
 here we choose to install the program then 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.200
 choose a personal non-profit click 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.179
 accept and complete 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.909
 after completing installation on computer 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.549
 you need to configure the program 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:34.179
 first in the right window we register 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.000
 enter the name of the e-mail password and click 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.549
 further since i have a profile i 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.399
 just log in next I want 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.289
 show how to add a personal password then 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.390
 there is a password that you will 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.789
 use when connecting your 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.399
 device computer click on 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.550
 pencil and enter in the name 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.429
 computer and password all with setup 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.709
 server we finished now move on 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.800
 directly to the device on which 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.890
 and check the program to start 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.289
 we need to lead you 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.610
 which was listed on the server then 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.970
 enter personal password 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.890
 we created it earlier and so here 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.830
 there was a desktop of my computer 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.909
 I will now open the browser and try 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.590
 go to youtube but seems to be switching 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:25.620
 let's try to run some 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.260
 roller 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.990
 for example, this one I want to note that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.490
 the sound is transmitted to the speaker and you can 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.220
 fully watch movies 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.080
 the truth is small delays but in 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.209
 Basically it is not disastrous. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.360
 well, and probably the most important question 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.670
 which will interest many I can 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.010
 I play games that are installed 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.620
 on my computer now i will try 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.410
 show how it will look for 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:59.500
 an example behind the source and go to 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.870
 some server as you see besides 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.480
 that terribly lags and will run 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.600
 very hard because the keyboard 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.220
 closes the whole screen of course you can take 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.769
 GDP and sit in the pit 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.980
 but most likely while you run there 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.620
 the round is over i think guys 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 of a team it would be worth thinking about 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.080
 optimization of this problem because 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.420
 run so in n in the pit is not an option oh yeah 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.330
 did not pay much attention to the keyboard 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.970
 besides the skype and cancel buttons 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.329
 there are also shift arrows and 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 let's go and so on here's another handy 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:39.579
 piece when you click on the key pops up 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.519
 window where you can start the dispatcher 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:46.239
 tasks restart the computer and so 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:49.420
 further my review came to an end see you in 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.880
 new 2014 I want to wish you 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.880
 apple gifts for the new year so far
