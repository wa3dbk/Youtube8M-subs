tips on how to play top lane from my

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.920 
tips on how to play top lane from my
perspective<00:00:17.060> alright<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:18.539> tip<00:00:18.750> you

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
perspective alright so the first tip you

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.599 
perspective alright so the first tip you
want<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.859> want<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.070> push<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> tower

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
want to do is you want to push the tower

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.670 
want to do is you want to push the tower
after<00:00:21.090> getting<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.449> kill<00:00:21.689> now<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.350> reason<00:00:22.650> you

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
after getting it kill now the reason you

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080 
after getting it kill now the reason you
do<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.609> want<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.789> deny<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
do this is because you want to deny the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.509 
do this is because you want to deny the
enemy<00:00:24.480> CS<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.500> turret<00:00:25.740> takes<00:00:25.980> all<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> CS

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
enemy CS and the turret takes all the CS

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.189 
enemy CS and the turret takes all the CS
so<00:00:26.760> they<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.060> denied<00:00:27.359> experience<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
so they are denied experience and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.349 
so they are denied experience and
potential<00:00:29.070> gold<00:00:29.310> now<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> enemy<00:00:30.210> has

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
potential gold now the enemy has

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
potential gold now the enemy has
teleport<00:00:30.840> if<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.199> teleport<00:00:31.470> 5<00:00:31.740> CS<00:00:32.160> which

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
teleport if you will teleport 5 CS which

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.340 
teleport if you will teleport 5 CS which
makes<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> inefficient<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.170> it

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
makes it kind of inefficient but it

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.139 
makes it kind of inefficient but it
still<00:00:34.590> works<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.610> enemies<00:00:35.940> wave

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
still works because the enemies wave

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.150 
still works because the enemies wave
will<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.450> pushing<00:00:36.660> onto<00:00:36.960> yours<00:00:37.320> giving<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.010> an

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
will be pushing onto yours giving you an

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.770 
will be pushing onto yours giving you an
advantage<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.790> I'll<00:00:38.879> explain<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> next<00:00:39.480> tip

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
advantage and I'll explain the next tip

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.900 
advantage and I'll explain the next tip
why<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.379> important<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.430> before<00:00:41.760> we

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
why that is important but before we

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.400 
why that is important but before we
leave<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.239> tip<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.510> want<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.750> guys<00:00:42.899> take<00:00:43.170> note

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
leave this tip I want you guys take note

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.979 
leave this tip I want you guys take note
that<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.100> kill<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> somewhat<00:00:45.030> equivalent<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.719> an

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
that a kill is somewhat equivalent to an

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.810 
that a kill is somewhat equivalent to an
enemy<00:00:46.260> backing<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.039> if<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.250> ever<00:00:47.340> think<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
enemy backing so if you ever think that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.760 
enemy backing so if you ever think that
me<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.149> backing<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:49.020> should<00:00:49.200> still<00:00:49.410> push<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
me is backing you should still push the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.529 
me is backing you should still push the
wave<00:00:49.920> into<00:00:50.100> his<00:00:50.309> dollar<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.760> he<00:00:50.789> does<00:00:51.059> lose<00:00:51.239> all

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
wave into his dollar so he does lose all

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
wave into his dollar so he does lose all
the<00:00:51.660> creeps<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.559> denied<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.160> gold<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the creeps and is denied that gold and

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
the creeps and is denied that gold and
experience<00:00:54.300> points<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.379> next<00:00:55.620> tip<00:00:55.739> I'll

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
experience points in the next tip I'll

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.560 
experience points in the next tip I'll
be<00:00:56.010> explaining<00:00:56.399> why<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:57.030> want<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.329> let<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
be explaining why you want to let the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.779 
be explaining why you want to let the
creeps<00:00:57.899> push<00:00:58.109> into<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.640> let

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
creeps push into you so you want to let

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
creeps push into you so you want to let
the<00:00:59.910> lane<00:01:00.149> push<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.629> freeze<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.289> bio<00:01:01.710> tower

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
the lane push and freeze it a bio tower

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
the lane push and freeze it a bio tower
and<00:01:02.370> there's<00:01:02.730> many<00:01:03.059> advantages<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.690> doing

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and there's many advantages of doing

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.020 
and there's many advantages of doing
this<00:01:04.320> which<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.739> will<00:01:04.769> explain<00:01:04.979> first<00:01:05.760> off

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this which I will explain first off

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.700 
this which I will explain first off
since<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> wave<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> pushing<00:01:07.500> into<00:01:07.680> your

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
since the wave is pushing into your

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.899 
since the wave is pushing into your
tower<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.159> are<00:01:08.189> making<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.670> enemy

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
tower you are making the enemy

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
tower you are making the enemy
overextend<00:01:09.689> more<00:01:09.930> thus<00:01:10.470> leaving<00:01:10.799> them<00:01:11.040> more

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
overextend more thus leaving them more

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
overextend more thus leaving them more
open<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.640> ganks<00:01:12.000> second<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> all<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:13.140> do

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
open to ganks second of all if you do

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
open to ganks second of all if you do
win<00:01:13.530> trades<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.820> zone<00:01:15.000> them

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
win trades with them you can zone them

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.270 
win trades with them you can zone them
from<00:01:15.299> creeps<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.350> wave<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.680> pushing<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
from creeps as the wave is pushing and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
from creeps as the wave is pushing and
since<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.850> constantly<00:01:18.330> pushing<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.170> can

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
since it's constantly pushing you can

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
since it's constantly pushing you can
deny<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> lot<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> creeps<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.549> force

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
deny them a lot of creeps or force

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
deny them a lot of creeps or force
trades<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.600> he<00:01:21.720> does<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> CS

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
trades in them if he does go for a CS

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.039 
trades in them if he does go for a CS
naturally<00:01:23.670> going<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.030> trades<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.450> his<00:01:24.509> minion

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
naturally going for trades in his minion

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
naturally going for trades in his minion
wave<00:01:25.259> will<00:01:25.650> push<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.130> lane<00:01:26.250> back<00:01:26.520> into<00:01:26.939> him

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
wave will push the lane back into him

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
wave will push the lane back into him
but<00:01:27.420> obviously<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> natural<00:01:28.369> standard<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.640> if

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
but obviously the natural standard is if

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.340 
but obviously the natural standard is if
you<00:01:30.000> win<00:01:30.150> trades<00:01:30.390> keep<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.079> for<00:01:31.229> those

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
you win trades keep going for those

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.710 
you win trades keep going for those
trades<00:01:31.619> third<00:01:32.310> off<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.670> also<00:01:32.939> safer<00:01:33.509> from

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
trades third off you are also safer from

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
trades third off you are also safer from
ganks<00:01:34.079> since<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> wave<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.860> pushing<00:01:35.220> into

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
ganks since the wave is pushing into

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.550 
ganks since the wave is pushing into
your<00:01:35.490> tower<00:01:35.810> but<00:01:36.810> just<00:01:37.020> don't<00:01:37.200> let<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> wave

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
your tower but just don't let the wave

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.350 
your tower but just don't let the wave
hit<00:01:37.770> your<00:01:37.920> towers<00:01:38.250> since<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.880> tower<00:01:39.119> can

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
hit your towers since that tower can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
hit your towers since that tower can
push<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:39.810> all<00:01:40.409> right<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.710> third<00:01:40.890> tip<00:01:41.100> is<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
push back all right so third tip is a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.280 
push back all right so third tip is a
really<00:01:41.610> basic<00:01:41.759> tip<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.329> want<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.899> ward<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really basic tip I want you to ward the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.950 
really basic tip I want you to ward the
river<00:01:43.470> at<00:01:43.740> 240<00:01:44.340> ish<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.119> ward<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
river at 240 ish this ward is here to

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960 
river at 240 ish this ward is here to
protect<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.470> from<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.979> jungle<00:01:47.340> ganking<00:01:47.850> your

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
protect you from the jungle ganking your

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.630 
protect you from the jungle ganking your
lane<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> around<00:01:49.110> 250<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> usually<00:01:50.250> when<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
lane and around 250 is usually when the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
lane and around 250 is usually when the
enemy<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:50.909> done<00:01:51.329> his<00:01:51.479> second<00:01:51.810> buff<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.320> then

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
enemy is done his second buff and then

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.590 
enemy is done his second buff and then
he's<00:01:53.100> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> try<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.700> look<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.360> gank

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
he's going to try and look for a gank

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.539 
he's going to try and look for a gank
somewhere<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.290> by<00:01:55.590> doing<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.979> ward<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
somewhere so by doing this ward and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
somewhere so by doing this ward and
putting<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> river<00:01:57.570> you're<00:01:58.020> protecting

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
putting in the river you're protecting

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.139 
putting in the river you're protecting
yourself<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.189> double<00:01:59.399> buff<00:01:59.700> jungler

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
yourself from that double buff jungler

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.760 
yourself from that double buff jungler
and<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.719> should<00:02:00.960> always<00:02:01.140> assume<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
and so you should always assume that the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.380 
and so you should always assume that the
jungler<00:02:02.219> does<00:02:02.549> want<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.880> gank<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.180> Lane

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
jungler does want to gank your Lane

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.510 
jungler does want to gank your Lane
around<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.960> three<00:02:04.170> minutes<00:02:04.409> since<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.399> are

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
around like three minutes since you are

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.429 
around like three minutes since you are
playing<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.939> overextended<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
playing so overextended but if you

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.100 
playing so overextended but if you
aren't<00:02:07.590> playing<00:02:07.799> overextended<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.700> getting

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
aren't playing overextended and getting

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.140 
aren't playing overextended and getting
then<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.220> can<00:02:10.340> either<00:02:10.460> save<00:02:10.759> your<00:02:10.910> award

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
then then you can either save your award

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.400 
then then you can either save your award
or<00:02:11.300> if<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.540> feel<00:02:11.720> like<00:02:11.870> you're<00:02:11.990> getting<00:02:12.080> dive

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
or if you feel like you're getting dive

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.200 
or if you feel like you're getting dive
you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.800> bore<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.040> over<00:02:13.280> the<00:02:13.370> wall<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:14.000> see<00:02:14.180> if

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
you can bore it over the wall to see if

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.400 
you can bore it over the wall to see if
you<00:02:14.330> are<00:02:14.450> actually<00:02:14.630> getting<00:02:14.840> dived<00:02:15.170> by<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
you are actually getting dived by the

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.650 
you are actually getting dived by the
enemy<00:02:15.680> jungler<00:02:15.980> next<00:02:16.820> if<00:02:16.940> you<00:02:17.120> never<00:02:17.390> want<00:02:17.630> to

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
enemy jungler next if you never want to

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.750 
enemy jungler next if you never want to
let<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> enemy<00:02:18.080> last<00:02:18.410> hit<00:02:18.650> this<00:02:19.160> only<00:02:19.460> applies

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
let the enemy last hit this only applies

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.280 
let the enemy last hit this only applies
if<00:02:20.060> you<00:02:20.210> have<00:02:20.330> an<00:02:20.480> advantage<00:02:20.780> over<00:02:21.020> your<00:02:21.170> enemy

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
if you have an advantage over your enemy

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.920 
if you have an advantage over your enemy
like<00:02:21.860> same<00:02:22.280> item<00:02:22.730> or<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.060> just<00:02:23.270> generally<00:02:23.600> win

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
like same item or you just generally win

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:24.820 
like same item or you just generally win
trades<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.710> better

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
trades because you have the better

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.500 
trades because you have the better
matchup<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.640> what<00:02:25.910> you<00:02:26.030> want<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.270> do<00:02:26.390> is

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
matchup so what you want to do is

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.510 
matchup so what you want to do is
basically<00:02:26.690> if<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.590> enemy<00:02:27.800> ever<00:02:27.980> tries<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.400> go

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
basically if the enemy ever tries to go

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.760 
basically if the enemy ever tries to go
for<00:02:28.700> CS<00:02:29.030> then<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.480> go<00:02:29.660> for<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> trade<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.410> by

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
for CS then you go for a trade and by

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.320 
for CS then you go for a trade and by
doing<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.160> then<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.550> to<00:02:31.730> sacrifice<00:02:31.910> its

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
doing this then we have to sacrifice its

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.300 
doing this then we have to sacrifice its
hit<00:02:32.450> point<00:02:32.690> for<00:02:33.020> one<00:02:33.260> CS<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.860> if<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.160> keep

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
hit point for one CS and if you keep

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.830 
hit point for one CS and if you keep
this<00:02:34.460> up<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.760> enemy's<00:02:35.030> forced<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.420> use<00:02:35.540> bones

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
this up the enemy's forced to use bones

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.350 
this up the enemy's forced to use bones
to<00:02:36.050> last<00:02:36.290> hit<00:02:36.590> or<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.340> forced<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.700> lose<00:02:37.850> some<00:02:38.060> CS

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
to last hit or is forced to lose some CS

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.120 
to last hit or is forced to lose some CS
in<00:02:38.600> exchange<00:02:39.020> for<00:02:39.110> keeping<00:02:39.380> her<00:02:39.620> health<00:02:39.890> high

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
in exchange for keeping her health high

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.440 
in exchange for keeping her health high
obviously<00:02:40.760> there<00:02:40.910> are<00:02:41.000> certain<00:02:41.120> situations

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
obviously there are certain situations

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360 
obviously there are certain situations
we<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.200> can't<00:02:42.440> do<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:42.830> against<00:02:43.190> certain

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
we just can't do this against certain

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.730 
we just can't do this against certain
champions<00:02:43.940> but<00:02:44.510> generally<00:02:45.140> if<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.590> have<00:02:45.709> a

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
champions but generally if you do have a

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.710 
champions but generally if you do have a
lead<00:02:46.040> over<00:02:46.160> an<00:02:46.340> enemy<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.209> want<00:02:47.330> to<00:02:47.450> keep<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
lead over an enemy you want to keep the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.640 
lead over an enemy you want to keep the
pressure<00:02:47.870> onto<00:02:48.200> him

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
pressure onto him

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.560 
pressure onto him
so<00:02:48.920> if<00:02:49.010> your<00:02:49.130> enemy<00:02:49.370> laner<00:02:49.580> roams<00:02:49.940> for<00:02:50.360> stand

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
so if your enemy laner roams for stand

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.690 
so if your enemy laner roams for stand
back<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.230> easily<00:02:51.530> done<00:02:51.860> by<00:02:51.920> clearing<00:02:52.520> one

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
back this is easily done by clearing one

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.729 
back this is easily done by clearing one
wave<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.300> if<00:02:53.480> your<00:02:53.720> wave<00:02:53.900> does<00:02:54.170> pushing<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.650> his

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
wave so if your wave does pushing to his

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.160 
wave so if your wave does pushing to his
tower<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.220> basically<00:02:56.120> he's<00:02:56.360> forced<00:02:56.750> back<00:02:56.959> to

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
tower and basically he's forced back to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380 
tower and basically he's forced back to
go<00:02:57.650> back<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:58.010> his<00:02:58.160> land<00:02:58.340> or<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.850> loses<00:02:59.120> a<00:02:59.150> lot<00:02:59.330> of

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
go back to his land or it loses a lot of

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.090 
go back to his land or it loses a lot of
CS<00:02:59.720> and<00:03:00.020> if<00:03:00.140> he<00:03:00.230> doesn't<00:03:00.500> come<00:03:00.530> back<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.950> lane

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
CS and if he doesn't come back to lane

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.070 
CS and if he doesn't come back to lane
then<00:03:01.370> he<00:03:01.610> loses<00:03:01.820> a<00:03:02.000> tower<00:03:02.270> once<00:03:02.810> someone<00:03:03.050> comes

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
then he loses a tower once someone comes

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.440 
then he loses a tower once someone comes
in<00:03:03.500> tries<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.860> cover<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.220> tower<00:03:04.400> now<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:05.330> is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
in tries to cover the tower now this is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.330 
in tries to cover the tower now this is
also<00:03:05.660> associated<00:03:06.080> with<00:03:06.470> pushing<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:07.130> lane

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
also associated with pushing the lane

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.699 
also associated with pushing the lane
before<00:03:07.550> doing<00:03:07.880> something<00:03:08.239> else<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:09.050> let's<00:03:09.500> say

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
before doing something else so let's say

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.320 
before doing something else so let's say
you're<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.010> better<00:03:10.250> team<00:03:10.520> fighter<00:03:10.790> someone

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
you're a better team fighter someone

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.420 
you're a better team fighter someone
like<00:03:11.540> Lulu<00:03:11.810> then<00:03:12.560> obviously<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.160> want<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.340> be

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
like Lulu then obviously you want to be

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.280 
like Lulu then obviously you want to be
team<00:03:13.730> fighting<00:03:13.940> more<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:14.780> you<00:03:14.810> would<00:03:15.080> push

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
team fighting more and so you would push

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.380 
team fighting more and so you would push
your<00:03:15.470> lane<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.890> then<00:03:16.040> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.370> roam<00:03:16.580> now<00:03:17.180> what

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
your lane and then you can roam now what

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.699 
your lane and then you can roam now what
I<00:03:17.420> generally<00:03:17.540> want<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.019> do<00:03:18.230> is<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.680> always

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
I generally want to do is I always

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.740 
I generally want to do is I always
usually<00:03:19.190> want<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.640> split<00:03:19.910> when<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.209> do<00:03:20.360> have<00:03:20.630> my

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
usually want to split when I do have my

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.600 
usually want to split when I do have my
teleport<00:03:21.290> up<00:03:21.410> this<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:21.830> because<00:03:22.130> I<00:03:22.160> want<00:03:22.489> to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
teleport up this is because I want to

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.280 
teleport up this is because I want to
have<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.910> lane<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.269> keep<00:03:23.420> pushing<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.989> having

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
have the lane to keep pushing and having

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.229 
have the lane to keep pushing and having
some<00:03:24.410> pressure<00:03:24.650> onto<00:03:25.010> my<00:03:25.280> enemies<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:25.940> then

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
some pressure onto my enemies and then

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:28.030 
some pressure onto my enemies and then
say<00:03:26.540> if<00:03:26.660> we<00:03:26.810> ever<00:03:26.900> do<00:03:27.140> teamfight<00:03:27.590> somewhere

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
say if we ever do teamfight somewhere

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.130 
say if we ever do teamfight somewhere
then<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:29.000> can<00:03:29.120> get<00:03:29.269> an<00:03:29.360> objective<00:03:29.480> off<00:03:29.900> that

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
then we can get an objective off that

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.199 
then we can get an objective off that
like<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> tower<00:03:30.650> or<00:03:30.890> if<00:03:31.519> the<00:03:31.610> enemy<00:03:31.850> does<00:03:32.030> win

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
like a tower or if the enemy does win

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.000 
like a tower or if the enemy does win
the<00:03:32.299> teamfight<00:03:32.510> then<00:03:33.080> they<00:03:33.530> can't<00:03:33.739> really<00:03:33.860> get

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
the teamfight then they can't really get

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.590 
the teamfight then they can't really get
any<00:03:34.220> objectives<00:03:34.730> since<00:03:35.000> our<00:03:35.209> lanes<00:03:35.420> are

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
any objectives since our lanes are

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.390 
any objectives since our lanes are
pushing<00:03:35.840> into<00:03:36.080> them<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.590> just<00:03:37.190> in<00:03:37.280> general

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
pushing into them and just in general

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.100 
pushing into them and just in general
you<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:37.880> just<00:03:38.090> teleport<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.540> teamfights<00:03:38.959> if

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
you can just teleport to teamfights if

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.410 
you can just teleport to teamfights if
your<00:03:39.260> team<00:03:39.470> ever<00:03:39.650> does<00:03:39.860> fight<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:40.580> it's<00:03:41.120> kind

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
your team ever does fight so it's kind

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.340 
your team ever does fight so it's kind
of<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.600> a<00:03:41.660> 5v5

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
of like a 5v5

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.949 
of like a 5v5
but<00:03:42.709> it's<00:03:42.920> more<00:03:43.040> like<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.250> 4.5<00:03:43.970> versus<00:03:44.450> 5<00:03:44.720> V<00:03:44.930> 5

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
but it's more like a 4.5 versus 5 V 5

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.229 
but it's more like a 4.5 versus 5 V 5
since<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:45.769> rival<00:03:46.220> 8<00:03:46.310> that's<00:03:46.910> the<00:03:47.060> only

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
since you do rival 8 that's the only

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.180 
since you do rival 8 that's the only
disadvantage<00:03:47.510> but<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.320> advantages<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:49.010> get

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
disadvantage but the advantages you get

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.070 
disadvantage but the advantages you get
from<00:03:49.370> pushing<00:03:49.549> the<00:03:49.700> lane<00:03:49.910> is<00:03:50.120> really<00:03:50.690> really

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
from pushing the lane is really really

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.289 
from pushing the lane is really really
worth<00:03:51.380> it<00:03:51.650> next<00:03:52.250> up<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.549> split<00:03:52.880> push<00:03:53.030> if<00:03:53.239> you

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
worth it next up is split push if you

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.670 
worth it next up is split push if you
can<00:03:53.540> one<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.840> want<00:03:54.019> everyone<00:03:54.380> now<00:03:54.650> to

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
can one of you want everyone now to

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.770 
can one of you want everyone now to
previous<00:03:55.160> concept<00:03:55.519> always<00:03:55.790> split<00:03:56.000> with<00:03:56.299> TP

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
previous concept always split with TP

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.170 
previous concept always split with TP
overrides<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.769> tip<00:03:58.040> but<00:03:58.549> in<00:03:58.700> general

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
overrides this tip but in general

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.430 
overrides this tip but in general
basically<00:03:59.480> if<00:03:59.840> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.080> want<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.260> doing

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
basically if you can want to doing

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.760 
basically if you can want to doing
everyone<00:04:00.799> on<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.430> enemy

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
everyone on the enemy

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.250 
everyone on the enemy
team<00:04:01.950> then<00:04:02.430> what's<00:04:02.610> going<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.820> happen<00:04:03.360> is<00:04:03.630> well

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
team then what's going to happen is well

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.630 
team then what's going to happen is well
they're<00:04:04.590> gonna<00:04:04.680> have<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.920> send<00:04:05.130> someone<00:04:05.310> for

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
they're gonna have to send someone for

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.310 
they're gonna have to send someone for
you<00:04:05.850> and<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.600> guy's<00:04:06.750> gonna<00:04:06.900> have<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.110> rough

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
you and that guy's gonna have a rough

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.830 
you and that guy's gonna have a rough
time<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.920> so<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.880> can<00:04:09.030> bruise<00:04:09.300> them<00:04:09.450> up<00:04:09.600> and

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
time and so you can bruise them up and

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.140 
time and so you can bruise them up and
then<00:04:10.020> get<00:04:10.260> his<00:04:10.350> tower<00:04:10.560> after<00:04:10.830> or<00:04:11.160> they<00:04:11.640> do<00:04:11.700> send

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
then get his tower after or they do send

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.720 
then get his tower after or they do send
to<00:04:12.330> people<00:04:12.600> after<00:04:12.960> you<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.380> causing<00:04:13.980> a<00:04:14.070> 3v4

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
to people after you and causing a 3v4

somewhere else on the map and so it's a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
really hard scenario for the enemy to

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.310 
really hard scenario for the enemy to
deal<00:04:17.880> with<00:04:18.120> next<00:04:18.720> step<00:04:18.870> along<00:04:19.110> with

deal with next step along with
split-pushing<00:04:19.770> is<00:04:20.040> do<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:20.430> continue<00:04:20.910> to

into a 1v1 situation I will just hang
back<00:04:39.090> until<00:04:39.570> they<00:04:40.140> reveal<00:04:40.440> themselves<00:04:40.650> on<00:04:40.950> the

you<00:04:55.680> always<00:04:56.010> want<00:04:56.190> to<00:04:56.220> have<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.430> ward<00:04:56.700> when

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
we're slow question we really don't

different<00:05:09.990> from<00:05:10.200> still<00:05:10.470> pushing<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.010> this

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
different from still pushing and this

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.950 
different from still pushing and this
time<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.970> actually<00:05:12.060> group<00:05:12.480> with<00:05:12.630> your<00:05:12.780> team

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
time you actually group with your team

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.620 
time you actually group with your team
so<00:05:13.290> team<00:05:13.950> fight<00:05:14.160> if<00:05:14.370> you're<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.700> most<00:05:14.880> fed<00:05:15.180> so

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
so team fight if you're the most fed so

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.510 
so team fight if you're the most fed so
if<00:05:15.780> you<00:05:15.900> have<00:05:16.080> all<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.440> kills<00:05:16.650> all<00:05:16.950> the<00:05:17.190> CS

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
if you have all the kills all the CS

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.550 
if you have all the kills all the CS
whatever<00:05:17.970> then<00:05:18.510> five<00:05:18.840> all<00:05:19.080> means<00:05:19.350> you

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
whatever then five all means you

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.660 
whatever then five all means you
probably<00:05:19.620> have<00:05:19.920> the<00:05:20.010> most<00:05:20.040> teamfight

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
probably have the most teamfight

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.760 
probably have the most teamfight
potential<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.720> let's<00:05:21.870> say<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.140> team's<00:05:22.440> gold

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
potential and let's say the team's gold

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.130 
potential and let's say the team's gold
are<00:05:23.070> even<00:05:23.580> but<00:05:24.090> if<00:05:24.270> you<00:05:24.390> have<00:05:24.540> all<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.870> kills

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
are even but if you have all the kills

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.080 
are even but if you have all the kills
and<00:05:25.440> your<00:05:25.530> team<00:05:25.710> fight<00:05:25.890> 244<00:05:26.580> they'll<00:05:26.880> probably

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
and your team fight 244 they'll probably

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.030 
and your team fight 244 they'll probably
get<00:05:27.360> aced<00:05:27.690> since<00:05:28.320> you<00:05:28.470> weren't<00:05:28.650> there<00:05:28.860> with

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
get aced since you weren't there with

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.760 
get aced since you weren't there with
them<00:05:29.250> usually<00:05:29.730> I<00:05:29.970> probably<00:05:30.450> do<00:05:30.720> this<00:05:30.930> in<00:05:31.140> like

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
them usually I probably do this in like

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.860 
them usually I probably do this in like
lower<00:05:32.070> lows<00:05:32.580> since<00:05:33.120> people<00:05:33.390> don't<00:05:33.780> really

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
lower lows since people don't really

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.590 
lower lows since people don't really
know<00:05:34.050> disengage<00:05:34.740> usually<00:05:35.730> someone<00:05:36.270> will<00:05:36.480> get

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
know disengage usually someone will get

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.750 
know disengage usually someone will get
caught<00:05:36.930> out<00:05:37.170> or<00:05:37.380> something<00:05:37.800> under<00:05:38.100> Tower<00:05:38.340> and

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
caught out or something under Tower and

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.820 
caught out or something under Tower and
so<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.510> do<00:05:39.570> feel<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.350> better<00:05:40.500> strategy

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
so I do feel like it's a better strategy

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.130 
so I do feel like it's a better strategy
then<00:05:41.340> it's<00:05:41.490> by<00:05:41.580> pushing<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:42.270> my<00:05:42.540> opinion<00:05:42.990> in

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
then it's by pushing in my opinion in

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.320 
then it's by pushing in my opinion in
some<00:05:43.620> situations<00:05:44.220> but<00:05:44.460> probably<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.150> easy

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
some situations but probably the easy

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.330 
some situations but probably the easy
situation<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.990> analyze<00:05:46.380> is<00:05:46.650> if<00:05:46.890> you're<00:05:47.190> the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
situation to analyze is if you're the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.430 
situation to analyze is if you're the
most<00:05:47.460> fed<00:05:47.700> on<00:05:47.850> your<00:05:47.970> team<00:05:48.210> and<00:05:48.480> the<00:05:48.720> teams<00:05:49.140> are

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
most fed on your team and the teams are

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.560 
most fed on your team and the teams are
even<00:05:49.890> and<00:05:50.100> so<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.760> only<00:05:50.910> way<00:05:51.000> you<00:05:51.120> will<00:05:51.419> win<00:05:51.540> a

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
even and so the only way you will win a

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.800 
even and so the only way you will win a
5<00:05:51.780> to<00:05:51.900> 5<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.470> if<00:05:52.770> you're<00:05:52.950> there<00:05:53.160> now<00:05:54.120> you're

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
5 to 5 is if you're there now you're

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.300 
5 to 5 is if you're there now you're
what<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:54.990> want<00:05:55.140> to<00:05:55.200> do<00:05:55.290> is<00:05:55.500> tell<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:55.860> gank<00:05:56.160> to

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
what you want to do is tell a gank to

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.860 
what you want to do is tell a gank to
overextend<00:05:56.760> this<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.330> how<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.480> make<00:05:57.690> big

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
overextend this is how you make big

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.570 
overextend this is how you make big
