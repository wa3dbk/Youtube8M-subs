00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.369
 The studio is pretty new as you are 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.689
 because come together because there is 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.770
 some experienced people yes that's right for 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.730
 I have on the mafia series 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.380
 collaborated 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.869
 but one day I have to do it 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.939
 decided to do something new something 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.380
 which I always wanted to do so 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.090
 I have quit my job and one 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.320
 a few friends have been calling for a long time 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.180
 work in the industry 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 we managed a team 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.879
 set up people 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.309
 the former play the mafia 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.390
 operation flashpoint but or crysis 3 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.010
 have worked 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.420
 we have a pretty strong one with that 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.129
 team of people already in the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.960
 have worked together in the past 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.190
 This makes us two new team though 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.190
 have known each other for years 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.620
 It becomes a realistic first person 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.920
 roleplay in the middle ages are so 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.630
 without fantasy elements the biggest feature 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.979
 probably the infighting in the 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.570
 ego-perspective 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.390
 they will be physically correct 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.880
 but very easy to control that 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.299
 for example, in a egoshooter only with 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.299
 more possibilities 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.380
 We would like something for adults 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.700
 make mature people 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.140
 comparable to the game of thrones 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.729
 or the vikings tv series game of 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.840
 but thrones also has fantasy elements 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 we obviously plan your world 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.670
 Realistic things were created without magic 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.539
 that's why I mentioned vikings too 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.430
 but if you have the first two 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.770
 and read books on the game of 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.229
 there are almost no thrones 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.390
 magic though you somehow im 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.009
 background expected it is rather about 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.820
 the characters and the relationships 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.530
 between them 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.289
 paired with some unexpected ones 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.120
 I also like to learn something like that 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.320
 Achieving independence is also 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.660
 not easy especially if 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.660
 one plans more than 1 2 of the previous year 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.080
 yes that's not we were lucky one 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.490
 to get strong private investor 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.710
 originally it was our goal and 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.540
 publisher approach but the last 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.050
 year was not a very good time 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.820
 for this 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.620
 since many had that fear in front of it 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.960
 the nextgen consoles are not very good 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:46.110
 would sell and great titles the 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:48.150
 be lost come out for so 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.770
 we thought it would be better that 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.540
 to bring out the game itself 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.610
 but our investor said that the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.110
 publishers would love the game so 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.820
 we finally went to kickstarter 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.820
 the game is very expensive 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.480
 we had no hope at all 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.030
 to be able to raise funds alone 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.570
 so we made a deal with ours 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.360
 investor 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.459
 if we could do it 500,000 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:18.630
 he would get the rest of the dollar 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:20.880
 so finance if there is one 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.440
 demand for this game and give 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.320
 if the community should like that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.580
 I hope that she does that then it will 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.959
 play also made and financed it 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.340
 But it will not just be a release 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:39.150
 enter ye the game in stages 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.650
 bring out if it is traditional 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.330
 be published in style 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.790
 it would be a huge one 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.850
 roleplaying a bigger example 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.080
 skyrim but there ws how many people the 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.120
 publish yourself 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.739
 will gradually be brought out 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.750
 split the game into three sections 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.850
 the first section already has one 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.230
 size of 9 square kilometers and more 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.340
 than 30 hours playing time 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.959
 So it is not a small game by any means 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.600
 but it is divided into three chapters 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.700
 become 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.740
 each chapter will be a new part of 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.570
 Add world 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:12.820
 Eventually, the world will be around 15 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.750
 square kilometer be big and each 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.430
 chapter becomes its own 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.480
 strand of action and its own 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.430
 possess a climax 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.900
 We also want the chapters as possible 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.690
 publish quickly in a row 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.640
 we take a distance of about 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.130
 eight months between the release 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.170
 with the fans and the community 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.240
 but we also work closely together 

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:33.160
 That's what we bakery for our bakers 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.290
 soon a part of the game accessible 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.670
 we are gradually making new ones 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.670
 Feeding features 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.740
 you will have the opportunity the world 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.570
 to explore and the basic mechanics 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.700
 are already doing it gradually 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:56.010
 then other things like the dialogues 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.010
 Crafting fight and riding are added 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.440
 when we are done with it the 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.760
 release a beta as early access 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.630
 and on the reactions of the players 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.000
 react 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.460
 we want to know what you like and what you like 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.120
 they do not like and with him 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.120
 work on it 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.610
 back to the game itself it's a 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.380
 roleplaying and action adventure in 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.450
 How is the story behind it? 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.810
 look how will you start one becomes 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.810
 play 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.740
 i mentioned action adventure because of it 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.780
 it is a predefined story 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.120
 will give specified characters as in 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.560
 third or mass effect you have 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.120
 someone we play a name, a 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.130
 face and even its own 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.990
 history has history though 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.790
 relatively nonlinear 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.300
 You can do tasks in different ways 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.300
 and wisely 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.650
 you do not just have to fight 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.389
 focus 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.490
 you can live out of problem 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.900
 you can bribe people or im 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.909
 Background intrigue spinning 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.469
 you can play as a thief but we have 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:03.300
 no predefined classes 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:05.580
 we have a really big roll 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.919
 Game mechanics in the background fallout new 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.479
 vegas system eg very similar if you 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.020
 a little more often makes you better 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.240
 therein 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.280
 there is no attitude what to do and 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.650
 we can have a lot of them 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.389
 states textures persons skills 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.439
 So very similar to classic 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.240
 role playing 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.580
 On the other hand, we also have one 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.860
 strong history and our goal is it 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.419
 to focus on quality and 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.419
 not too much on quantity 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:39.270
 if other games have eg 200 dungeons 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.300
 we will only have a few 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.159
 but these will be hand made everyone 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.569
 will have something unique in it 

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:46.529
 it is done with graphics themselves 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.949
 do not repeat 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:53.150
 sometimes less is more 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.150
 at least our approach 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.340
 in kingdom come the mistake so 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.699
 something like survival mechanics you have to 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.830
 food you have to sleep yes that is there 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:07.550
 but we want the whole thing to be too strong 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.990
 implement into the game like daisy 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.379
 Endurance, however, plays an important role 

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.139
 role 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.969
 you have to eat and sleep you will 

00:07:13.139 --> 00:07:17.039
 but do not have to do it often 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:19.080
 but it has its advantages in the game 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:21.719
 to be rested as it is a small one 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.219
 boost granted these are mechanical 

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:24.240
 very ingenious and feel very much 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.419
 of course 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:30.199
 everything should make sense as well 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:30.199
 as in the right life 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:40.180
 we want to give you the feeling 

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:42.390
 a real medieval knight too 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.390
 his 

00:08:06.889 --> 00:08:08.949
 on
