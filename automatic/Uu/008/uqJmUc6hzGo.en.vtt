00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the white Nexus 5

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.520 
the white Nexus 5
I<00:00:10.349> removed<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> slick<00:00:11.429> rap<00:00:12.320> sticker<00:00:13.320> on<00:00:13.440> the

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I removed the slick rap sticker on the

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.499 
I removed the slick rap sticker on the
back<00:00:13.710> so<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:13.980> can<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:15.000> was

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
back so you can see that this I was

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.810 
back so you can see that this I was
using<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> white<00:00:16.199> one<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.130> right<00:00:17.400> looks

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
using the white one and right looks

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.810 
using the white one and right looks
pretty<00:00:17.940> cool<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:19.289> I<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.980> white<00:00:20.189> color<00:00:20.220> that's

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
pretty cool so I like white color that's

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.450 
pretty cool so I like white color that's
why<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> had<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.270> iPhone<00:00:21.390> 6<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.380> white<00:00:22.680> color<00:00:22.949> so

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.040 

so<00:00:26.460> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.699> wondering<00:00:26.910> about<00:00:27.240> my<00:00:27.599> knife

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
so if you are wondering about my knife

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.859 
so if you are wondering about my knife
test<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.619> did<00:00:28.650> earlier<00:00:29.210> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.420> iPhone<00:00:30.660> 6

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
test that I did earlier on the iPhone 6

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.299 
test that I did earlier on the iPhone 6
yes<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.650> do<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.980> here<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.430> scratch<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> mostly

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
yes I do have here a scratch so mostly

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.910 
yes I do have here a scratch so mostly
the<00:00:35.460> screen<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.910> working<00:00:36.690> fine<00:00:37.290> there<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.710> no

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the screen is working fine there is no

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940 
the screen is working fine there is no
visible<00:00:38.670> scratch<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> screen<00:00:39.510> but<00:00:40.440> we<00:00:40.800> do

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
visible scratch on the screen but we do

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.060 
visible scratch on the screen but we do
have<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.790> scratch<00:00:42.390> here<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.829> see

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
have here is scratch here so you can see

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.660 
have here is scratch here so you can see
that<00:00:44.340> my<00:00:45.180> knife<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.020> extremely<00:00:46.980> sharp<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that my knife here is extremely sharp so

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.010 
that my knife here is extremely sharp so
that's<00:00:48.600> why<00:00:48.809> we<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.140> scratch<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.020> so

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that's why we have scratch here so so

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's why we have scratch here so so
let's<00:00:52.230> try<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.309> bend<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.449> devices<00:00:55.350> here

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
let's try to bend these devices here

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.240 
let's try to bend these devices here
apply<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.430> normal<00:00:56.969> hand<00:00:57.660> pressure<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
apply some normal hand pressure so and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.560 
apply some normal hand pressure so and
also<00:00:59.579> we'll<00:00:59.699> be<00:00:59.730> using<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:02.270> headlock<00:01:03.270> pressure

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
also we'll be using a headlock pressure

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.679 
also we'll be using a headlock pressure
to<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.320> reference<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:06.150> know<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.479> apply

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
to for reference and you know to apply

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.330 
to for reference and you know to apply
more<00:01:07.049> pressure<00:01:07.290> than<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.920> hands

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
more pressure than just hands

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.649 
more pressure than just hands
use<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.119> hand<00:01:09.180> helmet<00:01:09.930> in<00:01:10.470> more<00:01:10.710> great<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
use this hand helmet in more great so

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.960 
use this hand helmet in more great so
first<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.020> will<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.369> hand<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.939> let's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
first I will do with just hand so let's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.810 
first I will do with just hand so let's
try<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> Nexus<00:01:16.439> 5<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.700> have

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
try out with the Nexus 5 so you have

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.429 
try out with the Nexus 5 so you have
watched<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.330> video<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.930> unbox<00:01:19.320> therapy

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
watched the video of the unbox therapy

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.490 
watched the video of the unbox therapy
he<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.549> bent<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.240> iPhone<00:01:21.689> six-plus<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
he just bent the iPhone six-plus like a

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.630 
he just bent the iPhone six-plus like a
butter<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:24.360> but<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.619> will<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:25.979> if<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.250> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
butter so a but we will see if we can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.700 
butter so a but we will see if we can
bend<00:01:26.970> these<00:01:27.420> both<00:01:27.750> devices<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.350> by<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> know

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
bend these both devices just by you know

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.399 
bend these both devices just by you know
a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.700> pressure<00:01:30.030> on<00:01:30.570> different<00:01:31.049> areas

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
a little bit pressure on different areas

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.060 
a little bit pressure on different areas
so<00:01:32.750> let's<00:01:33.750> try<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.320> we<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
so let's try to do this we will do it

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.780 
so let's try to do this we will do it
three<00:01:35.400> times

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
three times

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.340 
three times
so<00:01:36.360> first<00:01:36.900> let's<00:01:37.200> try<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.860> back

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.710 

okay<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:47.570> can<00:01:47.690> see<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.050> Nexus<00:01:48.380> 5<00:01:48.590> is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
okay so you can see the Nexus 5 is

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.210 
okay so you can see the Nexus 5 is
pretty<00:01:50.720> much<00:01:50.840> straight<00:01:51.080> it's<00:01:51.590> actually<00:01:52.190> a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
pretty much straight it's actually a

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.730 
pretty much straight it's actually a
little<00:01:52.640> bit<00:01:53.650> bended<00:01:55.240> but<00:01:56.240> as<00:01:56.600> young<00:01:57.530> this<00:01:57.680> is

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
little bit bended but as young this is

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.710 
little bit bended but as young this is
the<00:01:57.950> design<00:01:58.720> maybe<00:01:59.979> maybe<00:02:00.979> I'm<00:02:01.159> wrong<00:02:01.400> but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
the design maybe maybe I'm wrong but

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.780 
the design maybe maybe I'm wrong but
feels<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.780> little<00:02:02.840> bit<00:02:03.020> bended<00:02:03.460> but<00:02:04.460> anyways

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
feels a little bit bended but anyways

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.370 
feels a little bit bended but anyways
let's<00:02:05.090> try<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> apply<00:02:05.780> pressure<00:02:06.020> from<00:02:06.320> the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
let's try to apply pressure from the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:19.550 
let's try to apply pressure from the
opposite<00:02:06.680> side

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.310 

looks<00:02:20.160> like<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.580> bended<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.360> I<00:02:21.600> think<00:02:22.170> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
looks like it's bended but I think this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.550 
looks like it's bended but I think this
the<00:02:22.640> design<00:02:23.640> doesn't<00:02:24.150> dial<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> phone<00:02:24.900> so

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
the design doesn't dial the phone so

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.980 
the design doesn't dial the phone so
let's<00:02:25.710> try<00:02:26.100> to<00:02:26.370> spread<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.420> off

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.490 

straight<00:02:36.990> pre-screened<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:39.000> me<00:02:39.150> no<00:02:40.050> problem

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
straight pre-screened to me no problem

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.700 
straight pre-screened to me no problem
so<00:02:41.180> let's<00:02:42.180> try<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> do<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.810> with<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.320> iPhone<00:02:43.680> 6

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
so let's try to do it with the iPhone 6

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.820 
so let's try to do it with the iPhone 6
here<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:47.540> so<00:02:48.540> let's<00:02:48.870> try<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.200> apply<00:02:49.530> pressure

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
here and so let's try to apply pressure

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:01.990 
here and so let's try to apply pressure
from<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:50.370> slide<00:02:50.580> first<00:02:52.070> so<00:02:53.070> 1<00:02:53.730> 2<00:02:54.000> 3<00:02:54.030> go

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750 

extreme<00:03:03.000> pressure<00:03:04.250> let's<00:03:05.250> try<00:03:05.490> to<00:03:05.550> apply

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
extreme pressure let's try to apply

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030 
extreme pressure let's try to apply
pressure<00:03:06.000> again<00:03:06.540> but<00:03:07.350> from<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.710> opposite

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
pressure again but from the opposite

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:20.590 
pressure again but from the opposite
side<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:09.830> so<00:03:10.830> let's<00:03:11.730> do<00:03:11.970> this

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.740 

no<00:03:21.290> bending<00:03:21.740> whatsoever<00:03:22.610> please<00:03:23.510> please

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
no bending whatsoever please please

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.020 
no bending whatsoever please please
smooth<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.200> me<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:26.530> let's<00:03:27.530> see

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
smooth to me and let's see

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.280 
smooth to me and let's see
no<00:03:29.030> bending<00:03:29.480> wheresoever<00:03:30.190> so<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> finally

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
no bending wheresoever so so finally

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.610 
no bending wheresoever so so finally
let's<00:03:33.860> try<00:03:34.040> to<00:03:34.100> use<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.490> hammer<00:03:35.300> so<00:03:35.780> could<00:03:36.470> be

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
let's try to use this hammer so could be

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.260 
let's try to use this hammer so could be
concluding<00:03:37.310> this<00:03:37.430> test<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.450> let's<00:03:40.270> first

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
concluding this test so let's first

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.000 
concluding this test so let's first
start<00:03:41.480> off<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:42.170> 5<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.920> so<00:03:44.170> no<00:03:45.170> I<00:03:45.470> use<00:03:45.860> the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
start off it's 5 here so no I use the

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.380 
start off it's 5 here so no I use the
hammer<00:03:46.250> because<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.700> can<00:03:46.850> apply<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.120> pressure

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
hammer because I can apply a pressure

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.280 
hammer because I can apply a pressure
from<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.930> top<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:49.130> down<00:03:49.340> here<00:03:49.790> so<00:03:50.300> let's

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
from the top and the down here so let's

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:06.640 
from the top and the down here so let's
do<00:03:51.530> this<00:03:51.850> game<00:04:01.240> ok<00:04:02.240> Nexus<00:04:03.080> 5<00:04:03.350> is<00:04:05.560> pretty<00:04:06.560> much

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
do this game ok Nexus 5 is pretty much

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.990 
do this game ok Nexus 5 is pretty much
ok<00:04:07.540> I'm<00:04:08.540> not<00:04:08.840> sure<00:04:09.230> I'm<00:04:10.100> not<00:04:10.190> really<00:04:10.430> sure<00:04:10.790> but

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
ok I'm not sure I'm not really sure but

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.300 
ok I'm not sure I'm not really sure but
it<00:04:11.180> feels<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:11.840> you<00:04:12.110> just<00:04:12.140> bend<00:04:12.770> it<00:04:12.950> from<00:04:13.160> the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it feels like you just bend it from the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.500 
it feels like you just bend it from the
top

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.650 

feels<00:04:17.510> like<00:04:17.720> but<00:04:18.220> but<00:04:19.220> maybe<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:20.180> designed

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
feels like but but maybe it's designed

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.310 
feels like but but maybe it's designed
but<00:04:20.900> I'm<00:04:21.410> not<00:04:21.590> sure<00:04:21.799> but<00:04:22.120> of<00:04:23.120> course<00:04:23.420> if<00:04:24.110> I

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
but I'm not sure but of course if I

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.230 
but I'm not sure but of course if I
apply<00:04:24.590> a<00:04:24.830> lot<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.250> pressure<00:04:25.580> on<00:04:25.790> this<00:04:26.030> device

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
apply a lot of pressure on this device

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.570 
apply a lot of pressure on this device
like<00:04:26.930> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.620> a<00:04:27.800> lot<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.190> lot<00:04:28.340> of<00:04:28.400> pressure

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
like you know a lot a lot of pressure

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.800 
like you know a lot a lot of pressure
I'm<00:04:28.790> pretty<00:04:29.000> sure<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.330> even<00:04:29.570> break<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:31.810> just

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
I'm pretty sure that even break and just

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.690 
I'm pretty sure that even break and just
I<00:04:32.930> have<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.110> feeling<00:04:33.140> that<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:33.740> will<00:04:33.800> break<00:04:34.070> so

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
I have a feeling that it will break so

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.880 
I have a feeling that it will break so
that<00:04:35.390> of<00:04:35.480> course<00:04:35.510> applied<00:04:36.080> a<00:04:36.110> lot<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:36.620> pressure

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
that of course applied a lot of pressure

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.930 
that of course applied a lot of pressure
with<00:04:37.490> my<00:04:37.670> thumbs<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.420> know<00:04:39.040> but<00:04:40.040> now

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
with my thumbs and you know but now

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.390 
with my thumbs and you know but now
let's<00:04:41.210> try<00:04:41.450> out<00:04:41.660> with<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.320> iPhone<00:04:42.530> 6<00:04:42.740> here

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
let's try out with the iPhone 6 here

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.940 
let's try out with the iPhone 6 here
I<00:04:43.430> don't<00:04:44.210> have<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.450> 6<00:04:44.690> plus<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.170> will<00:04:45.650> get<00:04:45.830> it

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
I don't have the 6 plus I will get it

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.860 
I don't have the 6 plus I will get it
pretty<00:04:46.160> soon<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.670> then<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.150> will<00:04:47.330> do<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.540> bend

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
pretty soon and then I will do the bend

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.890 
pretty soon and then I will do the bend
test<00:04:48.110> myself<00:04:48.890> and<00:04:49.700> let's<00:04:49.940> see<00:04:50.090> if<00:04:50.120> we<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:50.870> know

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
test myself and let's see if we you know

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.990 
test myself and let's see if we you know
can<00:04:51.200> bend<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.650> other<00:04:51.680> 6<00:04:52.100> plus<00:04:52.400> or<00:04:52.580> laughs<00:04:52.790> so

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
can bend the other 6 plus or laughs so

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.480 
can bend the other 6 plus or laughs so
let's<00:04:53.180> try<00:04:53.420> to<00:04:53.450> do<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:53.900> quickly<00:04:54.140> here<00:04:54.680> before

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
let's try to do this quickly here before

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:05.430 
let's try to do this quickly here before
my<00:04:55.610> camera<00:04:55.970> turns<00:04:56.210> off<00:04:56.480> so<00:04:57.140> 1<00:04:57.860> 2<00:04:58.100> 3<00:04:58.280> go

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.760 

finger<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:07.160> you<00:05:07.550> can<00:05:08.030> see<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.770> straight

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
finger but you can see it's straight

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.100 
finger but you can see it's straight
it's<00:05:10.190> pretty<00:05:10.430> much<00:05:10.550> straight<00:05:10.790> no<00:05:11.600> problems

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
it's pretty much straight no problems

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.550 
it's pretty much straight no problems
but<00:05:12.620> of<00:05:13.100> course<00:05:13.400> I<00:05:13.580> have<00:05:13.670> to<00:05:13.700> do<00:05:13.880> another<00:05:14.560> Bend

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
but of course I have to do another Bend

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.530 
but of course I have to do another Bend
test<00:05:15.860> all<00:05:16.460> you're<00:05:16.640> doing<00:05:16.790> to<00:05:16.850> be<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.090> galaxy's

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
test all you're doing to be the galaxy's

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.120 
test all you're doing to be the galaxy's

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
now I would do with another device

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.190 
now I would do with another device
another<00:05:21.470> mysterious<00:05:22.370> device<00:05:22.780> that<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.990> will
