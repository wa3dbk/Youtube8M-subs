00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
worry about them being too loopy because

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.730 
worry about them being too loopy because
I'll<00:01:47.969> explain<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.539> in<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.749> minute<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.590> go

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
okay and once you have all your loops

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.540 
okay and once you have all your loops
separated<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.800> we're<00:02:10.920> gonna<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.459> we're

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
separated what we're gonna do so we're

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490 
separated what we're gonna do so we're
gonna<00:02:11.640> find<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.209> middle<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.900> we've<00:02:13.050> got<00:02:13.200> two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
gonna find the middle so we've got two

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.040 
gonna find the middle so we've got two
and<00:02:13.920> two<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.640> right<00:02:14.819> here's<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> middle<00:02:15.480> we're

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and two so right here's the middle we're

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.309 
and two so right here's the middle we're
just<00:02:16.200> gonna<00:02:16.290> press<00:02:16.650> all<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.130> loops<00:02:17.370> down<00:02:17.670> flat

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
just gonna press all the loops down flat

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.430 
just gonna press all the loops down flat
so<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.620> the<00:02:19.800> center<00:02:20.310> open<00:02:21.290> see<00:02:22.290> right

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
so we have the center open see right

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.430 
so we have the center open see right
there<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.800> can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.280> center<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:25.260> right

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
there you can see the center all right

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.620 
there you can see the center all right
we're<00:02:26.310> gonna<00:02:26.400> put<00:02:26.640> this<00:02:26.760> aside<00:02:26.940> because<00:02:27.120> we're

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
we're gonna put this aside because we're

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.920 
we're gonna put this aside because we're
done<00:02:27.870> with<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.230> okay<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:30.390> once<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.900> have

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
done with it okay now once you have

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.009 
done with it okay now once you have
fanned<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.220> loops<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.420> we<00:02:33.840> have

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
fanned out your loops and we have

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.320 
fanned out your loops and we have
flattened<00:02:34.500> them<00:02:34.650> down<00:02:34.830> just<00:02:35.130> a<00:02:35.340> tad<00:02:35.580> you're

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330

the center and we're gonna put the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.170 
the center and we're gonna put the
twisted<00:02:42.870> bow<00:02:43.049> on<00:02:43.709> top<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.489> then<00:02:44.730> secure<00:02:45.150> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
twisted bow on top and then secure it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.710 
twisted bow on top and then secure it
with<00:02:45.269> thread<00:02:46.730> once<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.940> have<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.390> twisted

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
with thread once you have your twisted

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.590 
with thread once you have your twisted
boutique<00:02:49.650> bow<00:02:49.860> in<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.310> middle<00:02:50.340> now<00:02:51.299> we're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
boutique bow in the middle now we're

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.150 
boutique bow in the middle now we're
gonna<00:02:51.690> take<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.140> loops<00:02:52.440> that<00:02:52.860> are

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
gonna take the loops that are
