 one of the maximum representations that we have in the city of the angels of 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.619
 the Mexican culture is of course that of the Baires wolves from the 40s to the 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.900
 pachucos and later with the Chicano movement in the sixties the love for 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.739
 the Mexicans and those of 100 teeth of Mexicans for making the cars of 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.870
 a totally bizarre way impossible cars that were 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:53.210
 practically in disuse before Swiss eros and that these gentlemen with a talent 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.210
 absolutely ginormous 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.000

 maximum expressions of these brothers is the car they made in 1979 that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.610
 these actions back this car is amazing they took away the part of the 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.920
 capote this absolutely all engraved with motives to this case to support

 mind endorse it in the air 'entity the pride of Mexican culture in a 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.060
 place where probably if this did not exist, the roots would be lost

 this car has a value of 70 thousand dollars and the most incredible of all
