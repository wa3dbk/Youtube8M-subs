00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
well hello there battery kids welcome to

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.070 
well hello there battery kids welcome to
the<00:00:09.860> lemon<00:00:10.860> battery<00:00:11.480> experiment<00:00:12.480> today<00:00:12.900> we're

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the lemon battery experiment today we're

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.060 
the lemon battery experiment today we're
going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.230> see<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.559> we<00:00:13.590> can<00:00:13.799> get<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.950> little

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
going to see if we can get a little

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.240 
going to see if we can get a little
electricity<00:00:14.849> flowing<00:00:15.719> through<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.529> piece<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
electricity flowing through a piece of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.450 
electricity flowing through a piece of
fruit<00:00:17.699> so<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:19.350> materials<00:00:19.830> eternity<00:00:20.220> for

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
fruit so the materials eternity for

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.870 
fruit so the materials eternity for
today<00:00:20.699> would<00:00:21.119> be<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.869> very<00:00:22.250> nice<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.580> juicy

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
today would be one very nice and juicy

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.800 
today would be one very nice and juicy
lemon<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:25.609> copper<00:00:26.609> penny<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:28.320> two<00:00:28.380> inch<00:00:29.039> long

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
lemon a copper penny and a two inch long

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.560 
lemon a copper penny and a two inch long
galvanized<00:00:30.810> zinc<00:00:31.430> nail<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.239> there

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
galvanized zinc nail and so there

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.000 
galvanized zinc nail and so there
shouldn't<00:00:33.750> be<00:00:33.840> too<00:00:34.110> hard<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.380> find<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
shouldn't be too hard to find but you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.170 
shouldn't be too hard to find but you
might<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.460> looking<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.790> some<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
might have to go looking for some of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.340 
might have to go looking for some of
these<00:00:36.239> things<00:00:36.480> we're<00:00:36.630> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> need<00:00:36.870> and

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
these things we're going to need and

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.959 
these things we're going to need and
later<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.829> you're<00:00:38.430> gonna<00:00:38.550> need<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.790> find

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
later on you're gonna need to find

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.139 
later on you're gonna need to find
yourself<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.750> voltmeter<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:41.100> will<00:00:41.309> measure

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
yourself a voltmeter that will measure

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.270 
yourself a voltmeter that will measure
the<00:00:42.420> electric<00:00:42.809> current<00:00:43.020> coming<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:44.070> this

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the electric current coming from this

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.700 
the electric current coming from this
lemon<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.079> might<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.289> asking<00:00:46.379> yourself

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
lemon so you might be asking yourself

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
lemon so you might be asking yourself
how<00:00:47.340> are<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.090> turn<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.750> piece<00:00:48.930> of

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
how are we going to turn a piece of

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.700 
how are we going to turn a piece of
fruit<00:00:49.350> into<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> battery<00:00:51.199> what<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.289> need<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.559> do

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
fruit into a battery what we need to do

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
fruit into a battery what we need to do
is<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.610> cut<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.120> small<00:00:55.100> area<00:00:56.100> into

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
is first you to cut a small area into

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.400 
is first you to cut a small area into
one<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.850> sides<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> lemon<00:00:57.480> just<00:00:58.199> big

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
one of the sides of the lemon just big

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.099 
one of the sides of the lemon just big
enough<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.770> take<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.160> penny<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.840> push<00:01:00.840> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
enough to take the penny and push it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.260 
enough to take the penny and push it
into<00:01:01.379> not<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> way<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
into not all the way so there's just a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.759 
into not all the way so there's just a
little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.750> penny<00:01:03.960> sticking<00:01:04.350> out<00:01:04.470> and

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
little bit of the penny sticking out and

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.609 
little bit of the penny sticking out and
on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.790> opposite<00:01:06.330> side<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> lemon<00:01:07.020> take

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
on the opposite side of the lemon take

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.420 
on the opposite side of the lemon take
the<00:01:07.770> nail<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.700> just<00:01:08.909> stick<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.479> inside

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
the nail and just stick it right inside

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.330 
the nail and just stick it right inside
so<00:01:11.430> it's<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:12.210> far<00:01:12.570> in<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:12.990> but<00:01:13.860> not<00:01:14.010> far

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so it's pretty far in there but not far

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
so it's pretty far in there but not far
enough<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.790> touching<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.270> penny<00:01:15.479> on

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
enough that it's touching the penny on

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.410 
enough that it's touching the penny on
the<00:01:15.689> other<00:01:15.840> side<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> we<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:17.850> created<00:01:18.119> here

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the other side so we just created here

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.350 
the other side so we just created here
our<00:01:18.630> positive<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.500> negative<00:01:19.979> electrodes<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
our positive and negative electrodes the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.660 
our positive and negative electrodes the
negative<00:01:21.810> electrode<00:01:21.900> being<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> nail<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
negative electrode being the nail and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
negative electrode being the nail and
the<00:01:23.970> positive<00:01:24.450> electrode<00:01:24.540> being<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.950> coin

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
the positive electrode being the coin

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.050 
the positive electrode being the coin
and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:28.280> basically<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.430> have<00:01:29.610> created<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and so basically we have created a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.969 
and so basically we have created a
battery<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.840> there's<00:01:31.049> free<00:01:31.380> electrodes

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
battery and so there's free electrodes

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.249 
battery and so there's free electrodes
in<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.280> lemon<00:01:32.640> juice<00:01:32.670> inside<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.479> lemon<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
in the lemon juice inside the lemon that

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.219 
in the lemon juice inside the lemon that
can<00:01:34.409> now<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:35.030> between<00:01:36.030> these<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.570> these<00:01:37.170> two

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
can now go between these two these two

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.490 
can now go between these two these two
opposite<00:01:38.090> electrodes<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.200> order<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
opposite electrodes and so in order to

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.010 
opposite electrodes and so in order to
measure<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.810> amount

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
measure that and see the the amount

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
measure that and see the the amount
that's<00:01:43.170> flowing<00:01:43.439> between<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> when<00:01:44.640> we

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that's flowing between there is when we

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
that's flowing between there is when we
need<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:44.970> take<00:01:45.149> our<00:01:45.329> bolts<00:01:45.689> meter<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> attach

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
need to take our bolts meter and attach

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
need to take our bolts meter and attach
it<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> should<00:01:48.090> read<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it to it and what it should read it is a

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.609 
it to it and what it should read it is a
reading<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:50.070> around<00:01:50.189> point<00:01:50.909> 9<00:01:51.210> 2<00:01:51.659> volts

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
reading of right around point 9 2 volts

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.499 
reading of right around point 9 2 volts
volt<00:01:53.280> shows<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.820> speed<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
volt shows the speed at which the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.999 
volt shows the speed at which the
electrodes<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.110> flowing<00:01:55.409> through<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
electrodes are flowing through there so

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
electrodes are flowing through there so
we're<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> go<00:01:56.460> ahead<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.420> attach<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
we're going to go ahead and attach the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.160 
we're going to go ahead and attach the
voltmeter<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.340> lemon<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.479> what<00:02:01.020> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
voltmeter to the lemon and see what it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.679 
voltmeter to the lemon and see what it
says<00:02:01.909> it'll<00:02:02.909> bounce<00:02:03.060> around<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.540> bit

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
says it'll bounce around a little bit

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.449 
says it'll bounce around a little bit
but<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.259> see

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.759 

and<00:02:12.459> has<00:02:12.579> settled<00:02:12.969> at<00:02:13.120> point<00:02:13.450> nine<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:14.170> seven

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
and has settled at point nine to seven

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.170 
and has settled at point nine to seven
which<00:02:15.579> is<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.819> which<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.540> an<00:02:16.780> accurate<00:02:16.959> reading

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
which is a which is an accurate reading

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.520 
which is a which is an accurate reading
because<00:02:19.180> like<00:02:19.390> i<00:02:19.540> said<00:02:19.569> earlier<00:02:19.900> right<00:02:20.319> around

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
because like i said earlier right around

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.330 
because like i said earlier right around
a<00:02:20.829> point<00:02:21.250> 92<00:02:21.909> is<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:23.260> average<00:02:23.799> speed<00:02:24.099> at

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
a point 92 is the the average speed at

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.429 
a point 92 is the the average speed at
which<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:25.209> electrodes<00:02:25.689> could<00:02:25.930> pass<00:02:26.109> from<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:26.439 
which the electrodes could pass from the

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:28.949 
which the electrodes could pass from the
positive<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.889> the<00:02:27.010> negative<00:02:27.129> side<00:02:27.700> this<00:02:28.629> isn't

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
positive to the negative side this isn't

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.119 
positive to the negative side this isn't
quite<00:02:29.109> enough<00:02:29.200> electricity<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.859> light<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
quite enough electricity to light a

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.619 
quite enough electricity to light a
light<00:02:30.370> bulb<00:02:30.609> or<00:02:30.760> anything<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.150> if<00:02:31.510> you

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
light bulb or anything like that if you

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:33.449 
light bulb or anything like that if you
attach<00:02:31.900> enough<00:02:32.290> limits<00:02:32.709> together<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.310> would

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
attach enough limits together you would

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.819 
attach enough limits together you would
actually<00:02:33.639> get<00:02:33.939> enough<00:02:34.379> electrodes<00:02:35.379> passing

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
actually get enough electrodes passing

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:37.890 
actually get enough electrodes passing
through<00:02:36.040> them<00:02:36.219> to<00:02:36.670> power<00:02:36.909> a<00:02:37.030> lightbulb<00:02:37.329> so<00:02:37.870> I

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
through them to power a lightbulb so I

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.479 
through them to power a lightbulb so I
hope<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.379> enjoyed<00:02:38.709> learning<00:02:39.040> about<00:02:39.250> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
hope you enjoyed learning about the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.670 
hope you enjoyed learning about the
lemon<00:02:39.879> battery<00:02:40.299> experiment<00:02:41.170> I<00:02:41.319> look<00:02:41.469> forward

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
lemon battery experiment I look forward

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.349 
lemon battery experiment I look forward
to<00:02:41.769> seeing<00:02:41.829> you<00:02:42.040> all<00:02:42.069> here<00:02:42.489> next<00:02:42.790> time<00:02:43.060> on
