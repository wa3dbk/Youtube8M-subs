00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:06.799
 Billigheim was the name of the market and around 1 the 4 is the turnoff to us 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:07.740
 back then 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.049
 yes final two angels 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.319
 very 

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:16.570
 MWC 11 Koster celebrates discrepancies which was launched by her more 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 or less or where yes a youtube video access 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.939
 the child was me when I wanted to 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.189
 then have exempted the situation because that is today 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.409
 then in hindsight, at least a little differently presented 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.890
 yes many customers now video did not see the first part and it was from 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.300
 Information content more 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.910
 but certainly something 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.790
 and that's why I want to try because of course that many people are interested 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.490
 what happened there around 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.550
 Try to describe as detailed as possible 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.590
 yes to get Thelon's office around that 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920
 the frolow 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.580
 four screens a week and one should also be aware 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.790
 I have that too 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.710
 The AP Photo will be around in the process 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.040
 an ass to 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 Mind an Anna Aberg Eissing idea invited a taster from the community 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.050
 until now no Castor was but simply accepted 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.030
 and then percent 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.260
 May the community again in what to play 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.370
 Basic percent of the behavior official Kiera 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.060
 and although she has also endeavored has made further casts 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.160
 There is no question about it but the Father and has something in the last stint 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.190
 I hunted it around the neckline det I had not before I will now 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.210
 here Klemm because I do not want me here at this point 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380
 here was alone in the pillory, the gate very clearly say that would be 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.100
 English 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.520
 Well, what has made her here, first of all, industries around me has something 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.439
 approached me a bit Angel throws verbal because you can still over it 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.700
 I ignore the fact that I personally find something awkward but that should not be 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.890
 role-play 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 at the same time, she then enjoyed it and left the team. "She was fix here 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.390
 Tenant but was advertised by Frohburg steaks speak so happy us also mine 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.580
 Person have since in terms of support to the relatively much done 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.090
 and then got down 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 We have to let it and then it is to wipe the colleagues from the SC 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.349
 went 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.879
 and percent 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 in the same stream this Friday a few days ago 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.189
 around there they became official then 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.199
 welcomed round announced 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:27.749
 and then, after a decade, there was still some discussion about it 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.639
 evolve and save 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.779
 yes, I think so 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:33.989
 Stumbling block and was ultimately Dr 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.030
 that someone wiping out as a representative of sc2 issue 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.419
 then 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.359
 Mainzer that the photo site is stagnating 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.989
 that you would not get further there and dumb 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.620
 Kira then came to si TU Munich and this someone around 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.349
 In fact, one percent has been someone who has worked on what they need to do 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.739
 Year does not work in a large framework accordingly 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.829
 Percent I quote at this point, Bauer advised little light 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.450
 and ZenJA this someone is of course flown then just now 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:10.949
 a few minutes ago because there was just a conference between photo 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:11.939
 Bochum dpa 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.829
 around Blake's the Ko Kasper of Friday and of yours truly, and there 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.139
 Then we have to try to find in the common market denominator 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:22.620
 the quintessence of the conversation was ultimately like 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.489
 the steering 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.560
 all four speak Frolow, microbubbles Pichler agreed 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.299
 that we actually do not want camp separation we want a community this one 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.119
 Thoughts have just passed by and I've always been following them 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.959
 around 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.269
 Of course, Bodo Meter has also applied us and the other way I think that is 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.899
 clear at each and therefore found it so incredibly strange that we then 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.649
 been deceived too 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.299
 because ultimately percent 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.900
 It turned out that until they have to do animals has raised animals percent 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.870
 that was advertised on a string that was gladly advertised 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.109
 of course unfavorable to 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.689
 It turned out that there was a communication difficulties 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.519
 the facts were misrepresented or otherwise told 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.139
 when that was really the case 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.689
 of course, there are no more facts in the speech that finally 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.649
 folds 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.639
 That's how the whole story developed 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:13.530
 around 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.709
 yes, how do we proceed we are we stayed at the first man 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.710
 Case for sure some have seen that were percent inside 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.939
 from the shortest time over twice US $ 30 million 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:26.999
 I've stayed that way "that of course I'm at this point first 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.339
 I apologize for being relatively rabid because they do 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.349
 have to play well over it 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.349
 I think that Besold do at this point what I have done with too 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.349
 I think that percent is still up to BSC Turin 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.449
 Nonetheless, I still think that is 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.620
 clumsy 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.970
 that one does not take a position on the part of the historical, that will be fine 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.659
 even so stay around they have another organization 1 we have them 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.469
 around them things look different they clarify things internally we do 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.939
 we do not obviously draw an exhibition when someone approaches us 

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:02.650
 and when s hot around 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.180
 Jamie are deceitful and accordingly from the team leader 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.230
 Missing tourism was not known at all so speaks Bonn Mika 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.490
 By name, al-wasl did not know anything about all this was a year ago 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.500
 is unfortunate nevertheless you will find a statement here 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.680
 Maybe it was not the worst choice and I think with that thought 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.069
 you can have it quiet 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.409
 I hope so a little light into the dark Crumble in tons this 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.559
 Circus goal is to really have the percent of course when I'm in the 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:33.400
 BASF 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.520
 if anything is unclear about us because it was more accurate than Fourth PPP 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.110
 Video footage in Kiel called Fust sign proof I will not be online 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.659
 Place right says 

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.710
 anyone 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.509
 would like to put in the pillory 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.189
 I think that was one 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.069
 a big communication problem our mistake was a bit worry means mistake 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.099
 was certainly 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:55.750
 first that maybe I reacted too fast that I was a bit too 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:59.349
 rabid in my language selection was year 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:03.840
 I do not think I had to wipe the line of bc2 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:06.419
 I was not exactly sent 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.300
 in reverse, I also find that sc2 wipe made the mistake 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.999
 Problems on the word of people to trust even there you would have percent 

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.029
 A feedback can certainly take into account to get on with it 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.520
 Photo or with me 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.389
 and I also think that Baumann as I said you could expect it 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:26.600
 the tourists of position to position refers to it I think about it 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.190
 We do not give ourselves to the game us because nothing I think this Rome lamp 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:33.689
 These mud battles should never end and percent 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:37.300
 Nevertheless, for me as I said percent in this case quickly 

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:40.369
 awkward if you do not choose a responsible person Wilding 

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:43.430
 it was not written out i think everybody has it 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.069
 carry his part to both 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:49.059
 I hope that we can now what had to start 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:51.389
 I trap who did not see the first part because as I said 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:55.860
 deleted around this video more or less structure south in 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.020
 The ton knock because then you can not do anything color the 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.069
 which builds up the whole situation and promptly into the percent between you and 

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:08.169
 me photo why the patent and sc2 need not have noticed 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.900
 and they are also supposed to just open their eyes and pretend that nothing is wrong 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.669
 been 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:17.770
 and Seppi that's it then to this situation of my person as I said 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.620
 if there are any questions describing meaning comments i will definitely ask 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.009
 Answers no question 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.759
 and I will certainly not lie there too i'll do all the stuff like that 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:29.090
 represent as they were Bruns um 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.940
 yes, in this sense, I hope that percent fell interested in the 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:37.660
 Situation something to be able to describe more accurately and remain like 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.720
 I am of course always here tour is still after this beautiful 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.400
 who is unbelievable how about 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:47.530
 how exciting Kaarster life can be if you had such a thing 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.330
 Things on the Rhine moves to I digress 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.849
 I have Merck off 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:54.569
 yes in this sense Erich Vock is the whole and straight
