the X button to shift up or down and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
the X button to shift up or down and
that's<00:01:54.659> normally<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
that's normally not that much of a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.819 
that's normally not that much of a
problem<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.750> still<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.649> that

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
problem but in this I still got that

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.010 
problem but in this I still got that
grinding<00:01:59.430> Gear<00:01:59.700> sensation<00:02:00.390> even<00:02:00.689> when<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> was

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
grinding Gear sensation even when I was

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
grinding Gear sensation even when I was
placing<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.469> clutch<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.430> got<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> lot

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
placing the clutch and I got it a lot

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.120 
placing the clutch and I got it a lot
when<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.570> breaking<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.380> got<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> lot<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.770> slow

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
when I was breaking I got a lot of slow

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.889 
when I was breaking I got a lot of slow
gear<00:02:05.460> changes<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.060> had<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.299> adjust<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
gear changes so I had to adjust the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
gear changes so I had to adjust the
layout<00:02:07.110> changing<00:02:07.710> gear<00:02:07.979> I<00:02:08.190> had<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.879> much

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
layout changing gear I had to do it much

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
layout changing gear I had to do it much
quicker<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:10.319> sharper<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.160> had<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
quicker much sharper and I had a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.920 
quicker much sharper and I had a
constant

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
constant

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.140

create a lot more you really had to

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
create a lot more you really had to
focus<00:02:14.439> when<00:02:15.439> you<00:02:15.469> were<00:02:15.620> driving<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:16.099> car

said<00:02:19.489> especially<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.269> downshifting<00:02:21.049> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
said especially with the downshifting I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.300 
said especially with the downshifting I
want<00:02:21.319> to<00:02:21.379> mention<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.739> really<00:02:22.069> fast

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
want to mention that really fast

want to mention that really fast
normally<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.150> just<00:02:23.450> hold<00:02:23.689> down<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.079> clutch<00:02:24.319> and

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
normally I just hold down the clutch and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.559 
normally I just hold down the clutch and
shift<00:02:24.829> down<00:02:25.219> and<00:02:25.549> hold<00:02:25.760> down<00:02:25.909> the<00:02:26.060> break<00:02:26.299> with

shift down and hold down the break with

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.869 
shift down and hold down the break with
like<00:02:26.750> my<00:02:27.019> two<00:02:27.079> fingers<00:02:27.469> and<00:02:27.799> that<00:02:28.489> does<00:02:28.670> not

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
like my two fingers and that does not

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.970 
like my two fingers and that does not
work<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.359> a<00:02:29.450> gt3<00:02:30.019> car<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.439> thing<00:02:30.620> will

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
work in a gt3 car the thing will

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.339 
work in a gt3 car the thing will
clumsily<00:02:31.670> change<00:02:32.090> gear<00:02:32.359> really<00:02:32.750> slowly<00:02:33.079> and

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
clumsily change gear really slowly and

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.470 
clumsily change gear really slowly and
you<00:02:33.620> have<00:02:33.739> no<00:02:34.010> control<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:34.790> slides<00:02:35.090> a<00:02:35.299> lot

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
you have no control and it slides a lot

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.089 
you have no control and it slides a lot
really<00:02:36.230> what<00:02:36.439> you<00:02:36.530> have<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.769> do<00:02:36.859> when<00:02:37.010> you're

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
really what you have to do when you're

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.830 
really what you have to do when you're
going<00:02:37.250> into<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.549> corner<00:02:37.969> is<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.269> just<00:02:38.480> have<00:02:38.659> to

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
going into a corner is you just have to

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.280 
going into a corner is you just have to
let<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.769> force<00:02:40.189> of<00:02:40.519> like<00:02:41.329> the<00:02:41.540> downshifting

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
let the force of like the downshifting

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.500 
let the force of like the downshifting
slow<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:42.680> down<00:02:43.010> it's<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.400> really<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:44.060> weird

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
slow you down it's a really really weird

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.720 
slow you down it's a really really weird
sensation<00:02:45.319> but<00:02:45.889> once<00:02:46.069> you<00:02:46.189> get<00:02:46.340> used<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.669> it

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
sensation but once you get used to it

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.069 
sensation but once you get used to it
you'll<00:02:46.939> know<00:02:47.000> what<00:02:47.239> I'm<00:02:47.329> talking<00:02:47.359> about<00:02:47.780> you

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
you'll know what I'm talking about you

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.990 
you'll know what I'm talking about you
just<00:02:48.200> kind<00:02:48.349> of<00:02:48.409> shift<00:02:48.680> down<00:02:48.919> and<00:02:49.220> left<00:02:49.579> lift

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
just kind of shift down and left lift

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.569 
just kind of shift down and left lift
off<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.269> brake<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.079> it's<00:02:51.709> like<00:02:51.889> oh<00:02:52.040> this<00:02:52.340> kind

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
off the brake and it's like oh this kind

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.949 
off the brake and it's like oh this kind
of<00:02:52.639> slowed<00:02:52.819> me<00:02:52.939> down<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.150> little<00:02:53.389> bit<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.840> it

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
of slowed me down a little bit you do it

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.420 
of slowed me down a little bit you do it
again<00:02:54.169> and<00:02:54.349> again<00:02:54.409> until<00:02:54.829> you're<00:02:55.159> at<00:02:55.310> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
again and again until you're at the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.309 
again and again until you're at the
corner<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.269> kind<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.659> shift<00:02:57.079> down

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
corner so you kind of like shift down

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.250 
corner so you kind of like shift down
and<00:02:57.530> coast<00:02:57.889> into<00:02:58.579> the<00:02:59.150> turn<00:02:59.389> it's<00:02:59.659> really

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
and coast into the turn it's really

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.459 
and coast into the turn it's really
weird<00:03:00.469> but<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.950> get<00:03:01.069> used<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.489> now<00:03:02.469> the

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
weird but you get used to it now the

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.440 
weird but you get used to it now the
other<00:03:03.620> factor<00:03:03.829> with<00:03:04.129> gt3<00:03:04.549> cars<00:03:04.790> obviously<00:03:05.299> is

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
other factor with gt3 cars obviously is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.690 
other factor with gt3 cars obviously is
speed<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.200> unfortunately<00:03:07.189> this<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.549> where

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
speed and unfortunately this is where

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.030 
speed and unfortunately this is where
the<00:03:07.790> SLS<00:03:08.239> I<00:03:08.419> felt<00:03:08.840> like<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.139> left<00:03:09.349> me<00:03:09.530> down<00:03:09.739> it

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the SLS I felt like it left me down it

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.500 
the SLS I felt like it left me down it
still<00:03:10.609> has<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.500> 550<00:03:12.500> horsepower<00:03:13.209> 6.2<00:03:14.209> liter

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
still has that 550 horsepower 6.2 liter
