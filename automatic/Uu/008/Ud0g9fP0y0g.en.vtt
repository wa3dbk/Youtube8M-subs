 Alexandra Evstigneeva 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:21.599
 this is no easy job raising out of the swamp 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.609
 pieces of aircraft 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.279
 winch pulls twisted

 broken by the Germans on the pyramid lie 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.219
 clay georgette at a depth of 8 meters 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:32.839
 try hooking on such conditions 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:34.760
 only desperate divers can work 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.550

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.460
 commenting on the situation 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.540
 personal growth from the wreckage of parachutes 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.490
 the weapons of the pilots all this swamp 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.810
 mothballed novelty at the bottom no 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.730
 oxygen so the gun stechkin and 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520
 not rusted and chucks like new 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.700
 even walked the domes remained snow white 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.110
 moment of truth in silence from the bottom 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.430
 understand the remains of the pilot now csp 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 ardennes others never straighten tobacco 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.789
 flight pocket 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.660
 in the bosom letter from home 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.850
 need las rosas if on deployment 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.480
 infrastructure 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.570
 I am pleased that at night 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.360
 line completed 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.980
 closer to the heart in the left pocket of the tunic 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.400
 party card and this is important now 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.300
 search engine do not know the twelfth of January 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.800
 forty-fourth in the sky of Pskov died 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.940
 the pilot Gregory Finger like with 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.330
 him deals and you eagles when on screens 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.360
 we will tell you there was no chance of escape 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.940
 the crew died while still being a stone car 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.960
 way down 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.909
 This is how the plane looked like the remains 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.219
 which now lie the other day of this swamp 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.179
 a total of 36 thousand 600 stormtroopers were released 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.529
 il 2 however if this armada is already after 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:45.030
 war failed to save 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.180
 not one operating machine that 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.070
 could rise to the sky when aviation 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.960
 became reactive took admitted 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.920
 destroyed even the tape drawings of the ages 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.590
 so each such find is a clutch 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.020
 for aviarestavratsiya possible and technology 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.200
 restored and if you're lucky even take 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 parts from all planes there 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.360
 ways 20 30 40 here's fellow 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.360
 original 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.329
 difficult but possible 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.709
 this time lucky survived altimeter 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.139
 control knobs temperature sensors 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:19.129
 cabin fragments almost half 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.339
 aircraft will be sent to Novosibirsk in this 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.969
 workshop aha restorers already 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.569
 few years restore two 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.139
 attack aircraft il 2 I promise that one of the machines 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.909
 take off in a couple of years well for dominance 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.339
 additionally three four five oscars therefore 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.499
 it's easy to earn ad infinitum 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:36.999
 there is one dead plane from the dead 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.499
 girls need to keep doing 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:40.359
 lift into the air and planes on which 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.149
 grandfathers fought this idea by aristocrats 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.740
 he thinks 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.579
 deed of honor as soon as russia 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.959
 aviation power won in the second 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:48.879
