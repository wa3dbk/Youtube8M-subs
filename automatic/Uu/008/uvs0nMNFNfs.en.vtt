00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello clipe I have to confess you a 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.910
 thing, look, I get gas and things to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.860
 I could try and test but I was doing 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.380
 a lot of time that I did not receive anything that 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.509
 it made me so much so much illusion and it's 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.510
 something that is not an ipad anything for the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.360
 style but a case for iphone 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.520
 but is that look that casing 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.920
 is that it looks like a real camera then 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.960
 clear if you see it the other way around and without having 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.910
 put the iphone really is this is 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.750
 try the git mons the git system 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.810
 mont and here and are made of 32 pieces 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.600
 of beige polycarbonate is this is 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.260
 black but they also have a beautiful 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.320
 in white with finishes then in silver 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.809
 so you can combine with your iphone 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.730
 to mount it you can see that this 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.500
 example then it is not a real goal 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.950
 in fact now I'm going to teach you a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.829
 trick 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.199
 we take it apart we remove the pieces 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.100
 and it stays in nothing here we already have the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.100
 iphone we put it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.800
 we put this other piece here 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:19.110
 we put this together again 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.110
 we set up this other part of here 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.210
 and we have an iphone with a nice one 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.800
 not the retro look and such the casing 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.200
 leaves you full freedom to use 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.520
 all your controls for example here 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.630
 we would have the power button turned off 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:39.280
 and these two buttons would be the controls 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.140
 of volume increase volume and lower volume 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.330
 but well the beauty of that is also 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.240
 use it as a camera 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.920
 the camera would still be in this 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.260
 little corner here with which you what 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.370
 you would put in this position and you would have to 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.590
 keep in mind that what you're looking at 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.880
 in this but good as you already know and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.230
 the one in front will give equal 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.570
 with tell him to look here and just 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.820
 it's worth almost almost we could almost have 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 even a true viewer that is this one 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.850
 here although good does not have so much to do 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 with what it frames but what it does 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.399
 we have is that this button that is the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.900
 shot is really the shooting 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.659
 but you can also complement that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.269
 because if you realize this part of 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.230
 here it has an oversize 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:22.830
 because you can put 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.810
 a series of cool goals that already 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.030
 it teaches some that were magnetic what 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.830
 good thing about this is that being threaded 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.209
 you know you're never going to fall 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 because I have more than once been 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.680
 dropped to the ground with this not because this 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.810
 it stays completely fixed and then 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.270
 we have this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:44.040
 do not tell me it's not cool this 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.959
 example is a fisheye lens but 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.300
 not only you can put targets but 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.860
 that you can also put filters this 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.860
 for example it is a polarizing filter 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.590
 we put it 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.709
 this filter for example would serve to 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.000
 avoid reflexes and increase the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.190
 saturation of colors 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.930
 it also has telephoto lenses 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.080
 macro and goals as fun as 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.270
 this is a creative goal that 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.620
 does a kaleidoscope effect and that 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.260
 lack of iphone to be a camera 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.730
 better then that you can put a 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.500
 tripod to avoid movements and 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.650
 the trepidations for that also has 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.080
 this little piece that also comes with the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.470
 housing kit here I already have mounted 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.180
 one that is in this gorilla hobby pod 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.650
 what are these compact tripods 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.530
 articulable and what I would do then it would be 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.560
 ride it and the result would be this 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.240
 retro photo camera ahead iphone 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.220
 from behind we would put it in the 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.050
 surface that we want and with this already 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.120
 we can make our photos and our 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.430
 videos with the iphone but with 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.650
 stability but the system that mónica 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.020
 it is not the only thing that has also account 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.700
 well with a car accessory with 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.760
 flash with a remote trigger 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.110
 and this from here that is my favorite that is 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:09.290
 a leather case a leather case that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.959
 It also allows you to leave the air 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.730
 goal so you can put what you can 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.850
 put out the screwed-in lens and 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.850
 such and that here behind also 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.680
 you see the iphone perfectly and what remains 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.330
 the sea ​​of ​​pimp the truth where you can 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 find this then in different stores 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.220
 like amazon new online sites is not 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.860
 very hard to find them the prices are 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 the carcasas about 50 euros the cover of 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.550
 skin more or less also about 50 and 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.979
 for example then the objectives then to 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.780
 from about 20 22 euros then it comes out 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:40.310
 clip &amp; is this has been all with this already 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.750
 I have the perfect kit to do the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.849
 competition to these guys who do 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.550
 photos of a magnum 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.270
 of something like that they are called the eclipse is the 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.270
 next video flame
