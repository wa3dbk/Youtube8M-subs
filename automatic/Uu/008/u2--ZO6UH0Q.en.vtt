hopefully you know you succeed and it's
easy<00:02:21.420> because<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.830> don't<00:02:23.040> move<00:02:23.220> your<00:02:23.430> if

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
easy because if you don't move your if

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.540 
easy because if you don't move your if
you<00:02:24.870> don't<00:02:25.080> move<00:02:25.260> your<00:02:25.440> controller<00:02:25.980> up<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
you don't move your controller up and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.220 
you don't move your controller up and
down<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.360> move<00:02:27.569> it<00:02:27.690> left<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.019> right

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
down and you just move it left and right

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.470 
down and you just move it left and right
you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.550> kills<00:02:29.849> pretty<00:02:30.209> easily

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
you can you can get kills pretty easily

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.140 
you can you can get kills pretty easily
and<00:02:30.989> what<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:31.590> mean<00:02:31.800> by<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.010> moving<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.849> up<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and what I mean by not moving it up and

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.809 
and what I mean by not moving it up and
down<00:02:33.300> is<00:02:33.780> because<00:02:34.620> if<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.040> move<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.519> or

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
down is because if you move it up or

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.140 
down is because if you move it up or
down<00:02:35.880> you<00:02:36.569> you<00:02:37.440> have<00:02:37.739> a<00:02:37.769> less<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.610> target<00:02:38.819> to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
down you you have a less of a target to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.530 
down you you have a less of a target to
hit

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
hit

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.440 
hit
the<00:02:39.959> higher<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.500> move<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.040> closer<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the higher you move it the closer to a

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
the higher you move it the closer to a
headshot<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.349> will<00:02:43.530> be<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.610> head<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.120> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
headshot you will be and the head is a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.140 
headshot you will be and the head is a
very<00:02:45.510> small<00:02:45.840> radius<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.890> it's<00:02:47.819> gonna<00:02:47.970> be

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
very small radius and it's gonna be

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.850 
very small radius and it's gonna be
harder<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.569> hit<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.870> person<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.500> want<00:02:49.739> to

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
harder to hit that person so you want to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.170 
harder to hit that person so you want to
aim<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.250> as<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.910> torso<00:02:51.510> at<00:02:51.630> all<00:02:51.780> times<00:02:52.079> so<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
aim it as a torso at all times so or you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.880 
aim it as a torso at all times so or you
know<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.450> chest<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:55.079> it's<00:02:55.260> pretty<00:02:55.500> easy<00:02:55.650> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
know the chest and it's pretty easy to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.229 
know the chest and it's pretty easy to
do<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.040> if<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:56.579> move<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.880> controller

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
do that if you don't move the controller

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.300 
do that if you don't move the controller
as<00:02:57.450> much<00:02:57.720> just<00:02:58.410> make<00:02:58.620> sure<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.890> move<00:02:59.010> it<00:02:59.130> left

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
as much just make sure you move it left

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.000 
as much just make sure you move it left
and<00:02:59.519> right<00:02:59.579> and<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.209> there's<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.890> there's<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and right and if there's a there's a

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.009 
and right and if there's a there's a
slope<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.730> know<00:03:02.970> just<00:03:03.269> move<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.599> little<00:03:03.840> bit

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
slope you know just move in a little bit

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.960 
slope you know just move in a little bit
but<00:03:04.290> you<00:03:04.950> don't<00:03:04.980> want<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> move<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.549> as<00:03:05.670> much

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
but you don't want to move it as much

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.120 
but you don't want to move it as much
because<00:03:06.239> if<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.720> do<00:03:06.870> that<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.260> know<00:03:07.410> you're

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
because if you do that you know you're

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.309 
because if you do that you know you're
gonna<00:03:08.250> mess<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.610> your<00:03:08.640> shot<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:09.120> see<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.110> many

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
gonna mess up your shot I see so many

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.949 
gonna mess up your shot I see so many

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
snipers just dragging the controller

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.800 
snipers just dragging the controller
like<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.060> a<00:03:15.150> squiggly<00:03:15.569> line

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
like it's like it's a squiggly line

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.720 
like it's like it's a squiggly line
they'll<00:03:16.260> be<00:03:16.410> like<00:03:16.560> up-down<00:03:17.459> left-right

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
how to control the controller you don't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.000 
how to control the controller you don't
have<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.690> move<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.139> much<00:03:22.350> just<00:03:22.560> move<00:03:22.829> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.910 
have to move it that much just move it
lightly<00:03:23.639> it's<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.630> like<00:03:24.930> it's<00:03:25.650> like<00:03:25.769> a

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
as I was saying just to recap on what I

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.870 
as I was saying just to recap on what I
said<00:04:12.269> be<00:04:13.049> some<00:04:13.380> moves<00:04:13.620> with<00:04:13.950> your<00:04:14.069> motion<00:04:14.609> and

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
said be some moves with your motion and

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.539 
said be some moves with your motion and
make<00:04:15.599> sure<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.320> if<00:04:16.680> you're<00:04:17.070> trying<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> go

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
make sure that if you're trying to go

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.300 
make sure that if you're trying to go
for<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.849> kill<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.049> intervention<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.890> it

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
for a kill with the intervention and it

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.650 
for a kill with the intervention and it
is<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:20.700> quick<00:04:21.000> scope<00:04:21.349> left

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
is a quick scope left

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.640 
is a quick scope left
-<00:04:23.110> right<00:04:23.380> right<00:04:23.950> -<00:04:24.010> left<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.080> if<00:04:26.080> there<00:04:26.440> is<00:04:26.530> an

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
- right right - left and if there is an

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.090 
- right right - left and if there is an
occasional<00:04:27.280> slope<00:04:28.170> just<00:04:29.170> slightly<00:04:29.680> move<00:04:29.920> it

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
occasional slope just slightly move it

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.230 
occasional slope just slightly move it
you<00:04:30.220> don't<00:04:30.370> have<00:04:30.400> to<00:04:30.580> move<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.820> as<00:04:30.940> much

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
you don't have to move it as much

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.660 
you don't have to move it as much
because<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.680> won't<00:04:32.920> really<00:04:33.040> matter<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.550> you

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
because it won't really matter if you

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.690 
because it won't really matter if you
move<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.320> sniper<00:04:35.320> rifles<00:04:35.830> are<00:04:36.130> meant<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.520> do

move it sniper rifles are meant to do

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.230 
move it sniper rifles are meant to do
that<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.980> I<00:04:38.980> don't<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.610> that's<00:04:39.850> pretty<00:04:40.150> much

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
that and I don't know that's pretty much

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.320 
that and I don't know that's pretty much
all<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.480> can<00:04:40.720> say<00:04:40.960> between<00:04:41.620> moving<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.520> the

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
all I can say between moving and the

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.170 
all I can say between moving and the
other<00:04:43.480> thing<00:04:43.810> I<00:04:44.080> saw<00:04:44.770> people<00:04:44.980> do<00:04:45.310> is<00:04:45.610> if<00:04:45.970> they

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
other thing I saw people do is if they

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.060 
other thing I saw people do is if they
see<00:04:46.240> someone<00:04:46.600> moving<00:04:46.870> from<00:04:47.380> left<00:04:47.650> to<00:04:47.740> right

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
see someone moving from left to right

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.200

they<00:04:48.880> will<00:04:49.120> they<00:04:49.570> will<00:04:49.980> drag<00:04:50.980> their<00:04:51.430> sniper

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
they will they will drag their sniper

towards the enemy you don't have to do

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.430 
towards the enemy you don't have to do
that<00:04:54.460> just<00:04:54.730> leave<00:04:55.210> it<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.510> a<00:04:55.630> certain<00:04:55.840> spot<00:04:56.260> and

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
that just leave it in a certain spot and

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.920 
that just leave it in a certain spot and
time<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.950> correctly<00:04:57.130> and<00:04:57.730> then<00:04:58.240> quick<00:04:58.540> scope

he<00:05:27.670> does<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.000> drag<00:05:28.420> the<00:05:28.570> sniper<00:05:28.870> to<00:05:29.230> a<00:05:29.430> foreign

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
he does is drag the sniper to a foreign

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.390 
he does is drag the sniper to a foreign
destination<00:05:31.270> and<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:32.590> just<00:05:32.800> pisses<00:05:33.010> me<00:05:33.220> off

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
destination and it just pisses me off

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.550 
destination and it just pisses me off
when<00:05:33.580> all<00:05:34.180> he<00:05:34.390> has<00:05:34.510> to<00:05:34.540> do<00:05:34.810> is<00:05:34.960> just<00:05:34.990> scope<00:05:35.380> in

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
when all he has to do is just scope in

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.680 
when all he has to do is just scope in
and<00:05:35.710> shoot<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.310> mean<00:05:36.940> I<00:05:37.090> do<00:05:37.150> that<00:05:37.420> occasionally

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
and shoot I mean I do that occasionally

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.960 
and shoot I mean I do that occasionally
but<00:05:38.140> I've<00:05:38.230> trained<00:05:38.530> myself<00:05:38.680> not<00:05:39.280> to<00:05:39.550> do<00:05:39.700> that

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
but I've trained myself not to do that

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.840 
but I've trained myself not to do that
and<00:05:40.390> you<00:05:40.900> want<00:05:41.110> to<00:05:41.200> make<00:05:41.410> sure<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:42.220> you<00:05:42.400> stand

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
and you want to make sure that you stand

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.310 
and you want to make sure that you stand
still<00:05:43.270> don't<00:05:43.480> move<00:05:43.630> when<00:05:44.140> you're

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
still don't move when you're

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.100 
still don't move when you're
quickscoping<00:05:45.130> or<00:05:45.280> aiming<00:05:45.490> just<00:05:46.390> stand<00:05:46.720> still

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
quickscoping or aiming just stand still

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.150 
quickscoping or aiming just stand still
and<00:05:48.000> once<00:05:49.000> you<00:05:49.090> see<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.270> guy<00:05:49.450> stop<00:05:49.960> moving<00:05:50.410> quick

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
and once you see a guy stop moving quick

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.659 
and once you see a guy stop moving quick
scope<00:05:51.550> aim<00:05:52.000> out<00:05:52.750> it's<00:05:53.410> easy<00:05:53.770> simple<00:05:54.370> as<00:05:54.460> that

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
scope aim out it's easy simple as that

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.740 
scope aim out it's easy simple as that
and<00:05:55.350> if<00:05:56.350> you<00:05:57.040> wanna<00:05:57.310> if<00:05:57.730> you<00:05:57.790> want<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.540> break

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
and if you wanna if you want to break

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.880 
and if you wanna if you want to break
down<00:05:59.520> the<00:06:00.520> whole<00:06:00.550> quickscoping<00:06:01.510> method<00:06:02.080> into

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
down the whole quickscoping method into

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.180 
down the whole quickscoping method into
steps<00:06:03.310> it's<00:06:03.960> it's<00:06:04.960> gonna<00:06:05.200> be<00:06:05.470> it's<00:06:05.710> gonna<00:06:05.860> be

fundamentals and if you want to learn

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.590 
fundamentals and if you want to learn
how<00:06:15.550> to<00:06:15.580> quickscope<00:06:15.850> you<00:06:16.150> got<00:06:16.300> to<00:06:16.390> break<00:06:16.570> it

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
how to quickscope you got to break it

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.040 
how to quickscope you got to break it
down<00:06:16.950> stop<00:06:17.950> moving<00:06:18.610> centering<00:06:19.540> the<00:06:19.690> enemy

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
down stop moving centering the enemy

a melt continue moving it's as simple as

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.409 
a melt continue moving it's as simple as
that<00:06:29.200> but<00:06:30.160> you<00:06:30.310> know<00:06:30.430> it's<00:06:30.640> pretty<00:06:30.850> hard<00:06:31.150> to

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
that but you know it's pretty hard to

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.830 
that but you know it's pretty hard to
actually<00:06:32.140> combine<00:06:32.530> it<00:06:32.740> into<00:06:32.890> one<00:06:33.070> because

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
actually combine it into one because

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.439 
actually combine it into one because
people<00:06:34.840> will<00:06:35.020> do<00:06:35.200> stuff<00:06:35.470> like<00:06:35.590> a

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:36.449 
people will do stuff like a
