that I've been working on for the past
several<00:00:08.429> weeks<00:00:08.580> make<00:00:09.090> some<00:00:09.420> modifications<00:00:10.110> to

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
several weeks make some modifications to

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.640 
several weeks make some modifications to
here<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.639> can<00:00:11.790> see<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.150> overall<00:00:12.420> view<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
here you can see an overall view of the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.950 
here you can see an overall view of the
grinder<00:00:14.460> sitting<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.179> on<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.420> table<00:00:15.630> this

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
grinder sitting here on this table this

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.660 
grinder sitting here on this table this
isn't<00:00:16.260> where<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> normally<00:00:16.650> sits<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
isn't where it normally sits but I

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.000 
isn't where it normally sits but I
thought<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:17.970> would<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> good<00:00:18.330> for<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.570> video<00:00:19.010> let

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
thought it would be good for a video let

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.519 
thought it would be good for a video let
me<00:00:20.100> just<00:00:20.279> show<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.490> some<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.529> overall

right<00:00:56.940> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.230> way<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.980> x-axis<00:00:59.609> hang

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
right out of the way of the x-axis hang

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.130 
right out of the way of the x-axis hang
the<00:01:00.239> candle<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:01.590> lets<00:01:01.829> me<00:01:02.010> move<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:03.140> table

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the candle this lets me move the table

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.980 
the candle this lets me move the table
back<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> forth<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.479> right<00:01:06.479> hand<00:01:06.720> thread

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
back and forth it's a right hand thread

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.920 
back and forth it's a right hand thread
3/8<00:01:07.590> inch<00:01:07.860> fine<00:01:08.189> thread<00:01:08.670> lead<00:01:09.240> screw<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
3/8 inch fine thread lead screw on that

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.359 
3/8 inch fine thread lead screw on that
so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> fairly<00:01:11.640> fine<00:01:11.909> feed<00:01:12.270> with<00:01:12.930> that

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
so I get a fairly fine feed with that

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
so I get a fairly fine feed with that
the<00:01:14.369> other<00:01:16.460> quickly<00:01:17.460> changeable<00:01:18.259> parameter

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the other quickly changeable parameter

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.800 
the other quickly changeable parameter
is<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.740> height<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.549> motor<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:21.450> loosening

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is the height of the motor by loosening

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.160 
is the height of the motor by loosening
this<00:01:22.110> lever<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.070> can<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.270> crank

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
this lever here I can then just crank

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.240 
this lever here I can then just crank
the<00:01:25.380> motor<00:01:25.500> down<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.520> crank<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:28.070> to<00:01:29.070> get

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
the motor down or crank it up to get

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.289 
the motor down or crank it up to get
whatever<00:01:29.579> height<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.150> need<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> lets<00:01:33.150> me<00:01:33.270> use

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
whatever height I need just lets me use

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.200 
whatever height I need just lets me use
different<00:01:33.689> sized<00:01:33.900> rhinestones<00:01:34.560> and

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
different sized rhinestones and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.190 
different sized rhinestones and
accommodates<00:01:36.210> different<00:01:36.600> angles<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.020> so

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
accommodates different angles and so

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.810 
accommodates different angles and so
forth<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> yeah<00:01:40.130> down<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.400> side<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
forth on the yeah down on the side of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
forth on the yeah down on the side of
the<00:01:42.270> motor<00:01:42.479> over<00:01:42.840> here<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.680> can

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
the motor over here on the right you can

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.420 
the motor over here on the right you can
see<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> switch<00:01:44.780> it's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.930> three<00:01:46.140> position<00:01:46.430> it's

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
see a switch it's a three position it's

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.050 
see a switch it's a three position it's
currently<00:01:47.759> it's<00:01:47.970> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.509> position

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
currently it's in the off position

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.030 
currently it's in the off position
moving<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.180> forward<00:01:51.649> causes<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.829> rotate

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
moving it forward causes it to rotate

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340 
moving it forward causes it to rotate
this<00:01:53.369> way<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.939> putting<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.720> back<00:01:54.869> makes<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
this way and putting it back makes it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.200 
this way and putting it back makes it
rotate<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.920> way

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
rotate that way

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.530 
rotate that way
once<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.750> have<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> switch<00:01:58.380> on<00:01:59.240> then<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.509> use

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
once I have the switch on then I can use

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.310 
once I have the switch on then I can use
my<00:02:00.689> variac<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:06.210> back<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.170> use

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
my variac to get back to that I can use

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.690 
my variac to get back to that I can use
the<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:07.710> act<00:02:07.920> back<00:02:08.160> here<00:02:09.080> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.940 

turn<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.330> motor<00:02:13.510> on<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.140> vary<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> speed

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
turn the motor on and vary the speed

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850 
turn the motor on and vary the speed
right<00:02:15.910> now<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.330> zero<00:02:16.810> but<00:02:17.050> as<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.319> crank<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.770> up

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
right now it's zero but as I crank it up

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.360 
right now it's zero but as I crank it up
you<00:02:18.069> see<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.430> starts<00:02:18.760> up<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:21.010> spin<00:02:21.220> it

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
you see it starts up and I can spin it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.059 
you see it starts up and I can spin it
up<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.610> whatever<00:02:21.880> speed<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.209> want<00:02:23.010> I've<00:02:24.010> got

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
up to whatever speed I want I've got

this<00:02:24.370> stop<00:02:24.700> right<00:02:24.730> here<00:02:25.240> because<00:02:25.660> that's<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
this stop right here because that's the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.760 
this stop right here because that's the
maximum<00:02:26.290> safe<00:02:26.920> speed
