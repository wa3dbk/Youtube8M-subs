we're going to explore basic elements of

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.549 
we're going to explore basic elements of
movement<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.610> how<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.630> utilize<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
movement and how you can utilize them to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.819 
movement and how you can utilize them to
create<00:00:35.040> dynamic<00:00:35.340> dance<00:00:36.290> as<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.380> choreographer

innovative and exciting choreography so

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.310 
innovative and exciting choreography so
let's<00:01:16.680> begin<00:01:17.479> first<00:01:18.479> we're<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.080> review

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
let's begin first we're going to review

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
let's begin first we're going to review
the<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:19.799> basic<00:01:20.310> elements<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:21.000> movement<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the three basic elements of movement and

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.820 
the three basic elements of movement and
the<00:01:22.259> first<00:01:22.500> basic<00:01:22.920> element<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> space<00:01:24.680> you<00:01:25.680> can

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
the first basic element is space you can

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.679 
the first basic element is space you can
think<00:01:26.070> about<00:01:26.130> space<00:01:26.580> like<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> birthday<00:01:27.450> cake

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
think about space like a birthday cake

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.510 
think about space like a birthday cake
with<00:01:27.960> three<00:01:28.560> layers<00:01:28.770> high<00:01:29.810> medium<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.990> low

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
with three layers high medium and low

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.399 
with three layers high medium and low
those<00:01:32.520> are<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.729> three<00:01:33.000> levels<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.659> space<00:01:34.049> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
those are the three levels of space and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.620 
those are the three levels of space and
you<00:01:34.530> want<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.159> utilize<00:01:35.280> all<00:01:35.850> three<00:01:36.390> when

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you want to utilize all three when

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.260 
you want to utilize all three when
you're<00:01:36.780> creating<00:01:37.070> choreography<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:39.090> also

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you're creating choreography you also

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.670 
you're creating choreography you also
want<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.290> travel

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
want to think about how you travel

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.580 
want to think about how you travel
through<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.400> space<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:42.450> called<00:01:42.899> paths

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
through the space that's called paths

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.609 
through the space that's called paths
through<00:01:44.399> space<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.990> straight<00:01:46.290> across

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
through space do you go straight across

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.069 
through space do you go straight across
do<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.399> move<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> diagonal<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.899> move

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
do you move on a diagonal do you move

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.940 
do you move on a diagonal do you move
with<00:01:49.320> curves<00:01:49.710> these<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.850> things<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> consider

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
with curves these are things to consider

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.280 
with curves these are things to consider
also<00:01:52.950> entrances<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.000> exits<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.780> part<00:01:55.200> of

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
also entrances and exits are a part of

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.039 
also entrances and exits are a part of
space<00:01:55.619> how<00:01:56.549> many<00:01:56.729> dancers<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.600> have<00:01:57.840> on

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
space how many dancers do you have on

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.580 
space how many dancers do you have on
the<00:01:58.170> stage<00:01:58.439> are<00:01:58.770> they<00:01:59.130> entering<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.790> exiting

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
the stage are they entering and exiting

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
the stage are they entering and exiting
so<00:02:01.590> right<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:01.979> let's<00:02:02.189> take<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> look<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:02.939> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
so right now let's take a look at the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:11.910 
so right now let's take a look at the
basic<00:02:03.960> element<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> space

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.800 

here<00:02:12.920> are<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.190> answers<00:02:13.610> moving<00:02:14.090> at<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.390> medium

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
here are the answers moving at a medium

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:29.350 
here are the answers moving at a medium
level

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:46.150 

here<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.570> dancers<00:02:31.050> moving<00:02:31.500> at<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.710> low<00:02:32.010> level
