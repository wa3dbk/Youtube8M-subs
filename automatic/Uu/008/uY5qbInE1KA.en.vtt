00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 apart 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:13.680
 hello everyone nice nonsense I wanted to afp 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.130
 today I present you an Indian chicken recipe eleven fine 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.749
 so to start this recipe you will take obese cutlets from 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:26.659
 organic chicken and for you have removed all the crab and therefore makes some 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:27.890
 small pieces 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.710
 so 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.180
 it's pretty much 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.180
 I'm not three inches here is not bigger 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.630
 then when you finish carving out your problem you put it 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.340
 in a small dish and you reserve it after you have to peel an onion from where 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.980
 the cut in two they removed the massy gers in hand and after you do 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.680
 girls frank like that step by step too thick 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.190
 then you will take a large Dutch oven and put some oil 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.300
 from olives to the fact you put% and onions 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.310
 for sure a mean medium-to-end fire and there you put the spices so 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.200
 that there is cinnamon sweet pepper them curcumin 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.390
 and percent to finish the cumin seeds 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 then you can% to put these spices you can put some 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.610
 easily double 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.570
 because it still remains fragrant but if you really like it will be 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 even more fragrant 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.580
 you can easily add the double there it was a recipe it ends 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.450
 of the asa so it was a try I did not want percent do not put too much 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.660
 the hole of a blow 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.960
 for what it was going to give 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.960
 and in the end we can easily add more 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.060
 so that when you put all the spices you mix well 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.660
 so always on a medium-high heat and there you will sweat the onions 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.780
 who should he become 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.740
 the day a transmission 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.070
 and when the onions are ready you will be able to add the pieces 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.270
 of chicken 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.210
 here is the ja I have you meat 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.720
 so after davos renÃ© lange again again on an average rate of 8 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.840
 so you mix that Germans are fine with chicken 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.880
 then you will be able to add a pinch of salt 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.770
 eric dupont haven of the mill 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.770
 and lets you change the preparation again 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.899
 so a few seconds and think you're going to add the flaked almonds 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.899
 so a small handful% 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.829
 to dare a little like do you want a little handle 1 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.919
 and to thank you for this preparation 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.520
 so then so you mix well 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.440
 and to leave you like that to leather a little nearly two minutes so on a 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.609
 year 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.820
 co-founded it's a little bit on a fire 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.899
 from where means and there you will be able to add the crushed tomatoes 1 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:44.249
 so even if the chicken has not finished leather if the parties that are going to 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:44.680
 breast 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.830
 it does not matter because anyway it will simmer again at 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.040
 the hour in the little thing or who will finish leather quietly 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.559
 then you mix well when you put the first part of the tomatoes 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:56.500
 crushed 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.360
 had almost three minutes 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.650
 and then when telefonica create a little bit you add the rest of the 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.929
 crushed tomatoes so about 100 grams 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:06.429
 but adding twice 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.449
 and for you hands wrapped up again the preparation 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:14.499
 you will lower the fire so that it will be really at a minimum so a fire 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:15.310
 very sweet to 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.310
 and there you will discover for about 15 minutes 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.779
 so here after 15 minutes the chicken is cooked the sauce to the 

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.089
 reduced a little bit 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:28.209
 so there you turn off the fire and then you have more than 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.399
 lay the plates 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.309
 then you prepare their squat of 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:36.569
 the bowl of rice is presenting you in a large plate 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.979
 so rice then on one side you put% and the little chicken mixture% 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.699
 with the meeting the fines he turned to land 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.259
 the mayor was presenting 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.669
 not like you want a month I did like his mother m 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.709
 and then after for decoration you put some flaked almonds on the 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.489
 above 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.519
 and if you have and you can even fresh coriander so Sicilian 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.260
