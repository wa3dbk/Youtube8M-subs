00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:05.520 
what are we supposed to do stop thing
and<00:01:02.469> find<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.219> right<00:01:03.460> solution<00:01:04.269> these<00:01:04.989> plants

and find the right solution these plants

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.680 
and find the right solution these plants
are<00:01:05.680> tropical<00:01:05.979> they<00:01:06.580> can't<00:01:06.940> survive<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.600> the

are tropical they can't survive in the
cold<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.610> means<00:01:09.940> we<00:01:10.180> can<00:01:10.360> stop<00:01:10.720> them

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
cold and that means we can stop them
