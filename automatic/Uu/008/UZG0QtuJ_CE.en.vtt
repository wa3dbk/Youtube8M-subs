00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello, good afternoon, my name is Pablo 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.019
 martinez and I'm the webmaster of this 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.360
 website that we are seeing I am also 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.610
 the guy who manages the east channel of 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.730
 Youtube 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.540
 and well I wanted to tell you today that I'm 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.400
 very upset with your attitude with 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.190
 the attitude of the people who consult this 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.800
 channel because even though there are a couple 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.240
 of thousands of daily reproductions I 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.059
 I think this does not grow, I'm 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.270
 splitting the chest here the tenderloin the skirt 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.940
 and the hands throwing the hours leaving my 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.920
 view on the screen to have 400 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.280
 video and you do not have the minimum 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.870
 embarrassed to help me make this number 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.950
 sad and small miserable there 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.920
 400,000 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.710
 but that had to put 100 thousand 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.210
 millions there at least and no if not and 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.739
 you do not give me a hand and you do not want 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 make more videos if you do not want me to do 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.980
 more videos say it but do not follow 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.540
 torturing me in this way 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.330
 because there is no right, there is no here 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.060
 let's go with the video we go with the video 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.470
 that this is that you are making me good 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 was to be doing many beautiful things 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.720
 does makes color graphics does ago 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.250
 graphs of steel bars of lines and 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.590
 with a lot of things for example 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 graphics also do but one of the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:37.210
 nice things you have is that I put 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:41.680
 here for example let's look at 10 on 100 50 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:44.830
 is 500 and these numbers are passed to 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.500
 Roman numbers like that 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.590
 quick as that what I'm going to teach you 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.560
 me in this video 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.780
 that what is recommending the page 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 is the YouTube channel to your buddies 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.819
 how do we do this how do we make this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.550
 number is transformed is transformed 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.810
 transform 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:11.290
 it becomes a in a Roman numeral 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.770
 it's easy we put an equal we put number 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.300
 point 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.350
 Roman we open a parentheses selected 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.610
 the box I close the parenthesis and it knows 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.380
 what will happen when I give to the entity 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.090
 that the gatron at a trans to convert into 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.040
 a Roman numeral that he means 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.620
 that is going to put a spear that is going to 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.420
 put a helmet with a pen and that will 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.300
 put a shield to the numerous what happens 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.170
 lets go see it 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.490
 there you have it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.490
 also the shield 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.150
 to make the video more enjoyable now the 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
 the rest dragged him down like a 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.770
 Creeping and this gives me the numbers will 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.000
 they gave simple basic numbers 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.700
 because I wanted to make a first 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.170
 basic demonstration of the potential of 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.790
 this but not a person because now we're going 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:08.100
 complicate we will complicate puts 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:10.349
 two thousand 458 748 of 88 also the 849 and 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.370
 2012 which is a year that is going to be a 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:18.209
 good year as we see this is complicated already 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.440
 a little bit is half complicated they appear 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.260
 big long numbers there a numbers 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 gigantic 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.319
 and it can be simplified you can do it 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.829
 we can send a subliminal message to 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:36.590
 I'm going to copy this I could paste here 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.180
 down and this well I also copy it 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.990
 hit here down and dragged him 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 OK 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.340
 we can simplify these numbers to 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.320
 that are more chiquititos as we do 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.270
 double click to edit the pileup this 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.660
 we come here after b 7 and 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.660
 we put 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.080
 point comma and I put a 4 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.110
 enter 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.030
 we see that he has modified the number 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.370
 see you let's do it with others 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.980
 to see if they simplify we also see 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.610
 like this one is also smaller 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.739
 This tc cx lv has removed the X by 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.320
 example here we also see how it has not been 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:20.010
 simplified that as we do it then 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.989
 simply putting coma 4 we can 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.470
 setting values ​​between 1 and 44 is the 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.760
 what more simplifies is worth in fact if 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.280
 you really put 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.680
 if you start editing it, we see that 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.180
 it comes out more concise more concise more concise 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.940
 and simplified now I can put the 2 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.040
 more concise to see what happens then nothing 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.860
 here it remains as it is worth 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.380
 with 4 it is the shortest one that makes the 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.930
 Roman number well such there is also another 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.110
 way to write Roman numerals 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.360
 which is the next you put it like 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.730
 Roman point number to be seen the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.670
 parentheses directly put 45 closes 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:05:01.900
 the parenthesis directly proposes vale 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.250
 we repeat the same number Roman point 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.550
 spoke the parenthesis and here I put for 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.290
 example the thousand 487 and I close the 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.390
 Parenthesis is valid and that's where the 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.460
 number that I want to simplify the number 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:15.930
 directly because nothing lame I come 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.770
 here I put equal number Roman point 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:23.020
 bracket thousand 487 semicolon four 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.880
 I close the parenthesis and there they put it 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.850
 simplified 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.050
 as we see very simple to do be 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.360
 at the expense of this so that any 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.190
 man post 1 but the kid there 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.470
 he has some child in the house he knows 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.260
 Someone who has a boy is a 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.370
 way that kids can do 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.440
 then the conversion and they can study 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.450
 the Roman numerals al is simple 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.180
 because you can put the one on two the 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:51.270
 three the 5 the 10 the 50 the 100 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.610
 in 500 and 1000 and I think it did not let me 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:57.470
 none and this then I compare it you go to 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:00.660
 numbers puts them Roman numerals 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.550
 parentheses the 1 closes parentheses and you 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.600
 you go down and this you take and what 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.580
 drag if you take 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.830
 here you have a 235 10 50 100 500 and 1000 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.810
 and there you have them there the kids 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.640
 They can learn as to convert 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.030
 numbers to write them and to pass them 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.100
 agreement was just that and apologize 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:23.200
 for this presentation that I have had but 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.930
 is that I can not avoid looking with 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.460
 sadness and with and with great sadness this 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.610
 youtube channel that I see that does not grow and 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.289
 what 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.289
 and that is already putting a lot of effort
