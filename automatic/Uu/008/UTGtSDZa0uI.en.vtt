00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.080
 ay protect is called I've said but what 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.610
 I have yes and jailbreak because I 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.039
 they said that if I open it with the programs 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.619
 can not enter viruses is true that I am 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.590
 very new with my iphone a thousand thanks 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.759
 forget about viruses, there are no viruses 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.310
 rigid on the iphone 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.310
 no more mental any sink 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.760
 according to I have understood is almost 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.950
 impossible for Apple products 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.989
 go into virus who is virtually 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.430
 impossible because of security policies 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.560
 that has the system that has the 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.550
 systems 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:45.410
 in fact many people say that is the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:48.770
 people who know some everything explains how 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.470
 the system works you have an iphone or 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.290
 you have an ipad at the moment that you 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.450
 you do the jailbreak and what happens is that 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.660
 is replacing code in that 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.660
 device 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.680
 and when signing the code is also 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.510
 can open doors the thing here is that 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.979
 for example the group of people who 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.950
 develop these tools for 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.560
 perform the jailbreak or to perform 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.820
 the blogs of the baseband are very groups 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.040
 peak very small 510 people are the 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.600
 they work on the tools and nobody 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.030
 more you know about that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.700
 there is a possibility that you enter 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.520
 some malicious software because the 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 principle of jailbreak is to make the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.600
 phone think or that the device 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.500
 think you are running applications 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.729
 authorized by apple for but in 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.060
 reality is not authorized are 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.119
 cydia applications that's the idea 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.600
 perform the jailbreak then the 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.299
 aid system has when you have a 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.830
 protection system called good 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.630
 it is a chain of actions that 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.390
 they have to make the system so that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.009
 can learn are seven steps that 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.470
 they have to perform the system and 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.210
 then it is told that there is a step that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.460
 is step 4 but from the phone 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.410
 then you learn it there is happening 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.310
 One step, I remember now, how it 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.310
 call 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.549
 appears to me then there is wood passes 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.310
 information to the second step that is other 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.370
 other system check this second 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.400
 step verifies that the first step is not 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.700
 corrupt is not corrupted if it gives if it gives 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.550
 a fire value if it gives green light 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.880
 I'm fine I'm factory 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.120
 then the second step calls the third 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.760
 step true 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.940
 the third step verifies that the second 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.349
 step is not modified and so are seven 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.420
 phases that have to pass one and 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.640
 share can learn correctly the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.159
 principle of jailbreak is to make the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.170
 first step to modify the first 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.780
 step and make him generate the second step 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.030
 that has not been modified ok 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.349
 there it is and that's where the boil occurs 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:03.079
 ok then that's why that's the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.360
 principle of the jjoo text understand of 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:08.239
 to modify the first step to 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.980
 always at the kernel level that the 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.310
 kernel is what makes the phone 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.260
 boot ok is the basis of the system the 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.930
 essence of the system is the term us 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.470
 modify in the kernel and make the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.200
 first step modify but do not know 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.870
 modify but do not make the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.010
 second step that has not been modified and 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.650
 this is how the jailbreak works 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 understand if the first step is modified 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.269
 and he is not made to believe in the second step 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.000
 that has not been modified is there when 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.219
 the phone surprises is why that's 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 what happens when you have a deal break 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.879
 federer that's why you have to connect the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.530
 phone and perform the jailbreak of 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:53.370
 again ok then followed someone with 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:57.750
 the necessary knowledge of how to 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:04:01.319
 how to enter the system in that way what 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.879
 does but with Martynas intentions and if 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.310
 can reach a serious system of 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:08.010
 security but I repeat to you how they are 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.720
 very small teams that develop 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.810
 these tools is practically 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:17.310
 impossible that it could happen and more 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.769
 because as you know support because as 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.580
 support for 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.020
 march march the two 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.819
 operating systems 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.090
 characterization and with each update 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.740
 the errors that 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.939
 they used these hackers to be able to 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.670
 do all this that I just did 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:37.980
 explain 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:37.980
 that is tie-break now understand it 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.580
 is the essence of grass and because a lot 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.110
 people talk about the jailbreak and all good 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.110
 that 's the essence, it works
