00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello today in our sequence 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.440
 lessons we will talk about 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.969
 small compartment of the game determining if 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.080
 you want to progress and especially 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.080
 lowered your index very quickly 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.760
 we will start by talking about the grip 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 the way we hold the club 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.520
 unlike the big games where our 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.740
 name to the clubs in the fingers for 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.970
 operate the wrists at putting us 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.490
 let's take the club a lot more 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.750
 in the palms of the hands for precisely 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.960
 lock our wrists and serve us 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.130
 many more arms and shoulders the 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.809
 putting motion is a movement 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.809
 which is done with the arms the shoulders 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 forming a triangle evolving so 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 symmetrical with a uniform rhythm 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.260
 to make this move so 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.329
 simple and natural posture is a 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.589
 determining element the two key points 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 of a good putting posture are the 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:01.079
 position that you are going to have before the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.960
 ball is the position of the ball in 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.340
 your sense here is the position you 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.200
 must adopt in front of the ball 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.479
 firstly the spacing of the feet that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.409
 must be the size of your shoulders 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 then at the level of the legs 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.930
 you just have to unlock the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.539
 knees at the pelvis level let you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.270
 the pelvis lean the belt itself 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.550
 bend to find your head at 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.880
 above small labatt checking one 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.110
 ball between your eyes you drop 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.340
 you are well placed regarding the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240
 position of the ball in your stance 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.830
 the latter must be placed a ball 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.409
 left of center so you can 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.390
 take the ball slightly up 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.720
 and therefore give him a road 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.720
 perfect 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.990
 training for the course pads in 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.289
 general people are afraid of mates 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.670
 course 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.890
 to do this we will train 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.409
 at a potter size by positioning 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 city ​​around a hole and so perform 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.380
 the round of the hole with all the doors 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.590
 that we will be able to find around 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.590
 of it 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.470
 second training for the peoples 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.790
 have for the feeling the dosage too much 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.770
 often people leave on the course 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.210
 without having the speed of the greens and this 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.920
 very often costs them a lot of 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.450
 three pals quite simple workout 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.950
 you need two chopsticks or 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:44.780
 ti clubs and a ball obviously from a 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:51.530
 little green you go place is on a 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:03:01.120
 not too steep slope a wand a 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:03:04.880
 big not one ti and 8 m another shot 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.410
 then the wand the exercise being 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.150
 for about ten minutes with a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.880
 ball to put the ball every time 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.230
 between the ti and the wand for so 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.530
 have the 2 am park created to go on the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.530
 course 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.940
 practice putting may seem 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.560
 much less fun than it does 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.360
 big koundara big practice but I 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.040
 Guaranteed that with these exercises you 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.420
 will have a lot of fun and your index 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.420
 will fall at great speed v
