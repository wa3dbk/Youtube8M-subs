00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
initial location or does it just

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.180 
initial location or does it just
disappear<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.780> Zach<00:00:46.020> revives<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.070> I'm

for the Thresh neither he finally does

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.880 
for the Thresh neither he finally does
throw<00:02:54.299> it<00:02:54.330> but<00:02:54.569> he<00:02:54.750> cannot<00:02:55.080> take<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.500> as<00:02:55.620> well

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
throw it but he cannot take it as well

so<00:02:56.130> what<00:02:56.549> we<00:02:56.700> have<00:02:56.819> learned<00:02:57.060> from<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.330> is

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
so what we have learned from this is

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.509 
so what we have learned from this is
that<00:02:57.569> no<00:02:57.959> clones<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:58.560> take<00:02:58.769> Thresh<00:02:59.100> lantern

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
that no clones can take Thresh lantern

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.640 
that no clones can take Thresh lantern

so<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:26.010> for<00:03:26.130> testing<00:03:26.459> purposes<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.090> try

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
so just for testing purposes we try

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.509 
so just for testing purposes we try
doing<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> zillion<00:03:28.470> this<00:03:28.650> time<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.370> see

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
doing it on the zillion this time to see

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.770 
doing it on the zillion this time to see
if<00:03:29.609> it<00:03:29.700> has<00:03:29.820> any<00:03:29.850> form<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.480> different

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
if it has any form of different

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.990 
if it has any form of different
interactions<00:03:31.410> but<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:32.040> did<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
interactions but it did not and the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.729 
interactions but it did not and the
other<00:03:33.180> zillions<00:03:33.660> bomb<00:03:33.900> will<00:03:34.109> simply<00:03:34.500> cancel

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
other zillions bomb will simply cancel

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.020 
other zillions bomb will simply cancel
out<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.130> first<00:03:35.370> ones<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.790> make<00:03:35.910> it

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
out the first ones and make it

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.880 
out the first ones and make it
automatically<00:03:36.600> explode<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.739> final

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
automatically explode and the final

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.770 
automatically explode and the final
thing<00:03:38.070> we<00:03:38.280> did<00:03:38.459> again<00:03:38.790> just<00:03:39.209> for<00:03:39.329> testing

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
thing we did again just for testing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.930 
thing we did again just for testing
purposes<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.590> try<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.130> do<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.700> bombs

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
purposes is to try and do for bombs

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.180 
purposes is to try and do for bombs
sequentially<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.049> I<00:03:43.079> use<00:03:43.380> my<00:03:43.560> bomb<00:03:43.829> on<00:03:44.010> him

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
sequentially so I use my bomb on him

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.590 
sequentially so I use my bomb on him
which<00:03:44.430> then<00:03:44.579> he<00:03:44.760> follows<00:03:45.060> up<00:03:45.180> with<00:03:45.209> his<00:03:45.450> own

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
which then he follows up with his own

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.599 
which then he follows up with his own
bomb<00:03:45.810> on<00:03:45.959> himself<00:03:46.140> that<00:03:46.859> of<00:03:47.010> course<00:03:47.040> used<00:03:47.489> up

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
bomb on himself that of course used up

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.370 
bomb on himself that of course used up
my<00:03:47.730> first<00:03:48.030> bomb<00:03:48.269> then<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.510> put<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.720> second<00:03:49.230> one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
my first bomb then I put a second one

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590 
my first bomb then I put a second one
using<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:49.859> W<00:03:50.250> than<00:03:50.400> cute<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.940> he<00:03:51.150> did<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.390> same

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
using my W than cute and he did the same

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.360 
using my W than cute and he did the same
thing<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.019> it<00:03:52.109> just<00:03:52.290> simply<00:03:52.440> cancels<00:03:52.950> my<00:03:53.069> bomb

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
thing and it just simply cancels my bomb

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.270 
thing and it just simply cancels my bomb
so<00:03:53.640> that<00:03:53.790> was<00:03:53.910> for<00:03:54.180> bombs<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.780> row<00:03:55.280> alright
