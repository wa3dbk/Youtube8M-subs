 more advanced submarines like 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.340
 claim constructors today have none 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.450
 one world army this event is very important 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.670

 nuclear submarines and these are large 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.680
 countries leading parties in terms of

 hide from him is impossible as well as from 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.650
 you are marine almost silent 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.610
 able to dive to a depth of 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.500
 half a kilometer 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.630
 and be offline sailing more

 territorial waters reach any 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.160
 points of the northern hemisphere and stop 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.290
 none of them are capable of them today 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.950
 space defense complexes now 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.690
 2 serial boats are completed
