the<00:00:27.390> twins<00:00:27.689> in<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.699> combo<00:00:29.699> dryer<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> washer<00:00:30.949> so

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
the twins in a combo dryer and washer so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.830 
the twins in a combo dryer and washer so
first<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.110> all<00:00:34.200> we<00:00:34.530> make<00:00:34.770> sure<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.100> unplugged

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
first of all we make sure it's unplugged

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.369 
first of all we make sure it's unplugged
so<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> cord<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.770> unplugged<00:00:39.050> and<00:00:40.050> then

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so we see the cord is unplugged and then

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.860 
so we see the cord is unplugged and then
we<00:00:40.559> start<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> front<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.719> to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
we start with the front here you have to

00:00:42.870 --> 00:01:04.289 
we start with the front here you have to
start<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:43.469> screws

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.310 

you<00:01:05.299> don't<00:01:05.479> want<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.720> lose<00:01:05.869> this<00:01:06.020> little

you don't want to lose this little

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.930 
you don't want to lose this little
rubber<00:01:06.470> thing<00:01:06.799> because<00:01:07.190> that's<00:01:07.670> an

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
rubber thing because that's an

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.340 
rubber thing because that's an
anti-vibration<00:01:09.729> and<00:01:10.729> it<00:01:11.000> it<00:01:11.720> helps<00:01:12.050> when<00:01:12.200> you

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
anti-vibration and it it helps when you

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:51.550 
anti-vibration and it it helps when you
open<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:12.920> lid<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.310> sticks<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.880> this<00:01:48.220> oh<00:01:50.560> maybe

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
open the lid it sticks to this oh maybe

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:08.699 
open the lid it sticks to this oh maybe
a<00:01:51.710> screwdriver<00:01:52.250> or<00:01:52.550> or<00:01:53.149> a<00:01:53.210> thing<00:01:53.479> like<00:01:53.690> this

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
to get at is inside of here it's two

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.930 
to get at is inside of here it's two
screws<00:03:04.780> way<00:03:05.110> down<00:03:05.680> underneath<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.580> you<00:03:06.790> have

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
screws way down underneath that you have

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:41.390 
screws way down underneath that you have
to<00:03:07.120> get<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:18.900> there's<00:03:19.900> a<00:03:19.990> little<00:03:20.230> screw<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.650> here

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:50.400 

there's<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.730> piece<00:03:48.300> now<00:03:49.300> the<00:03:49.360> element<00:03:50.140> is<00:03:50.230> in

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
there's that piece now the element is in

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.820 
there's that piece now the element is in
here<00:03:50.890> and<00:03:51.850> then<00:03:52.120> over<00:03:52.570> here<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:52.990> side<00:03:53.230> is

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
here and then over here on the side is

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.250 
here and then over here on the side is
the<00:03:54.720> thermostat<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:57.330> thermal<00:03:58.330> cutoff<00:03:58.570> up

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
the thermostat and the thermal cutoff up

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.490 
the thermostat and the thermal cutoff up
here<00:03:59.890> and<00:04:01.380> generally<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.700> thing<00:04:04.030> will<00:04:04.330> blow

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
here and generally this thing will blow

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.950 
here and generally this thing will blow
or<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:06.160> element<00:04:06.820> will<00:04:06.940> be<00:04:07.090> bad<00:04:07.380> and<00:04:09.960> here's

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
or the element will be bad and here's

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.460 
or the element will be bad and here's
the<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:13.720> new<00:04:13.930> set<00:04:15.150> these<00:04:16.150> things<00:04:16.510> come<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.320> a

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
the the new set these things come in a

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.430 
the the new set these things come in a
kit<00:04:17.770> because<00:04:18.489> it<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.510> say<00:04:19.660> this<00:04:19.900> thing<00:04:20.200> one

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
kit because it is to say this thing one

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.680 
kit because it is to say this thing one
of<00:04:20.560> these<00:04:20.680> blows<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.640> usually<00:04:22.000> means<00:04:22.150> it's

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
of these blows it usually means it's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.690 
of these blows it usually means it's
best<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.080> replace<00:04:23.440> them<00:04:23.650> both<00:04:23.830> so<00:04:24.190> they<00:04:24.430> come

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
best to replace them both so they come

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.080 
best to replace them both so they come
in<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.910> kit<00:04:25.120> like<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:29.640> I'll<00:04:30.640> show<00:04:30.850> you<00:04:30.880> the

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
in a kit like that and I'll show you the

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.880 
in a kit like that and I'll show you the
way<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.900> test<00:04:32.200> them<00:04:32.410> actually<00:04:32.950> I<00:04:34.560> have<00:04:35.560> a<00:04:35.590> bad

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
way to test them actually I have a bad

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:44.090 
way to test them actually I have a bad
one<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.190> these<00:04:36.460> from<00:04:37.030> there<00:04:37.270> right<00:04:37.780> here

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.320 

this<00:04:45.100> thing<00:04:45.400> is<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.150> put<00:04:46.360> it<00:04:46.480> on<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:48.090> to<00:04:49.090> see

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
this thing is you put it on the to see

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.820 
this thing is you put it on the to see
if<00:04:49.480> there's<00:04:49.750> continuity<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:52.470> that's<00:04:53.470> a<00:04:53.620> bad

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
if there's continuity and that's a bad

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.900 
if there's continuity and that's a bad
one<00:04:54.130> there's<00:04:54.340> no<00:04:54.580> continuity<00:04:54.970> there<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:57.700> good

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
one there's no continuity there the good

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.040 
one there's no continuity there the good
one<00:04:58.120> has<00:04:58.630> continuity<00:04:59.470> between<00:04:59.890> so<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.810> same

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
one has continuity between so the same

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.890 
one has continuity between so the same
way<00:05:02.260> with<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.040> element<00:05:06.270> to<00:05:07.270> show<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.510> how<00:05:07.720> to

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
way with the element to show you how to

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.520 
way with the element to show you how to
test<00:05:08.200> the<00:05:08.440> element<00:05:13.110> you<00:05:14.110> want<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.380> make<00:05:14.500> sure

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:14.530 
test the element you want to make sure

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.550 
test the element you want to make sure
there's<00:05:15.010> continuity<00:05:15.600> there<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:17.080> can<00:05:17.260> hear<00:05:17.440> it

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
there's continuity there you can hear it

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.360 
there's continuity there you can hear it
beep<00:05:17.830> between<00:05:18.790> them<00:05:19.260> there<00:05:20.260> but<00:05:20.980> you<00:05:21.130> don't

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
beep between them there but you don't

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.130 
beep between them there but you don't
