00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
going to like lose the spawns so see I'm

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.500 
going to like lose the spawns so see I'm
just<00:03:40.450> covering<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.049> spawn<00:03:41.320> right<00:03:41.470> here<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.510> I

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
just covering the spawn right here and I

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.080 
just covering the spawn right here and I
think<00:03:44.380> he<00:03:44.500> slows<00:03:44.769> it<00:03:44.950> down<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.549> show<00:03:45.760> that<00:03:45.940> they

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
think he slows it down to show that they

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.340 
think he slows it down to show that they
just<00:03:46.239> spawned<00:03:46.570> out<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.780> midair<00:03:46.959> like<00:03:47.140> right

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
just spawned out of midair like right

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.949 
just spawned out of midair like right
there<00:03:47.560> and<00:03:49.980> this<00:03:50.980> was<00:03:51.190> just<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.959> couldn't

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
there and this was just I couldn't

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.509 
there and this was just I couldn't
believe<00:03:53.140> this<00:03:53.380> happened<00:03:53.530> after<00:03:53.920> I<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.160> it<00:03:54.370> I

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
believe this happened after I got it I

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.850 
believe this happened after I got it I
was<00:03:55.000> going<00:03:55.209> crazy<00:03:55.390> I'm<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.410> I<00:03:56.560> got<00:03:56.709> two

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
was going crazy I'm like I got two

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.440 
was going crazy I'm like I got two
hundred<00:03:57.100> kills<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.549> think<00:03:58.180> my<00:03:58.299> best<00:03:58.750> for<00:03:59.260> was<00:03:59.470> 79

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
hundred kills I think my best for was 79

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.920 
hundred kills I think my best for was 79
so<00:04:01.450> you<00:04:02.170> know<00:04:02.519> 204<00:04:03.519> and<00:04:03.850> 22<00:04:04.510> minutes<00:04:04.540> every

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
so you know 204 and 22 minutes every

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.319 
so you know 204 and 22 minutes every
knot<00:04:05.079> is<00:04:05.230> a<00:04:05.260> huge<00:04:05.650> difference<00:04:05.860> and<00:04:06.370> there<00:04:07.150> was

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
knot is a huge difference and there was

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.710 
knot is a huge difference and there was
one<00:04:07.690> game<00:04:08.609> I'm<00:04:09.609> pretty<00:04:09.940> sure<00:04:10.060> there<00:04:10.359> was<00:04:10.450> one

on the
they<00:04:26.750> stayed<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.050> the<00:04:27.230> game<00:04:27.380> they're<00:04:28.100> just

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
they stayed in the game they're just

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760 
they stayed in the game they're just
retarded<00:04:28.430> I<00:04:28.970> guess<00:04:29.600> or<00:04:30.410> they<00:04:30.530> don't<00:04:30.650> care

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
retarded I guess or they don't care

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.320 
retarded I guess or they don't care
about<00:04:30.890> the<00:04:31.040> KD<00:04:31.340> at<00:04:31.550> all<00:04:31.670> because<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.030> think<00:04:32.210> the

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
about the KD at all because I think the

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.980 
about the KD at all because I think the
best<00:04:32.540> guy<00:04:32.720> on<00:04:32.750> their<00:04:33.020> team<00:04:33.050> went<00:04:33.470> like<00:04:33.650> 30<00:04:34.490> in

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
best guy on their team went like 30 in

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.970 
best guy on their team went like 30 in
137<00:04:35.990> or<00:04:36.260> something<00:04:36.440> like<00:04:36.500> that<00:04:36.590> I<00:04:36.710> might<00:04:36.920> even

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:36.980 
137 or something like that I might even

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.240 
137 or something like that I might even
sure<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:39.410> was<00:04:39.530> one<00:04:39.740> there<00:04:39.950> was<00:04:40.070> two

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
sure but that was one there was two

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.320 
sure but that was one there was two
rounds<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.670> now<00:04:40.760> there's<00:04:40.910> still<00:04:41.150> another

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
rounds and now there's still another

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.590 
rounds and now there's still another
round<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.690> go<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:42.640> as<00:04:43.640> you<00:04:44.060> can<00:04:44.210> see<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.390> just

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
round to go and as you can see I just

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.120 
round to go and as you can see I just
rushed<00:04:44.810> right<00:04:45.050> back<00:04:45.260> another<00:04:45.530> spawn<00:04:45.830> I<00:04:45.860> get<00:04:46.100> a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
rushed right back another spawn I get a

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.130 
rushed right back another spawn I get a
blackbird<00:04:46.640> I<00:04:46.940> think<00:04:47.390> I'm<00:04:47.480> really<00:04:47.840> close<00:04:47.960> to

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
blackbird I think I'm really close to

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.350 
blackbird I think I'm really close to
the<00:04:48.170> dogs<00:04:48.410> again<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:49.040> I<00:04:49.370> get<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.880> dogs<00:04:50.090> I<00:04:50.300> know

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
the dogs again and I get the dogs I know

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.870 
the dogs again and I get the dogs I know
that<00:04:50.920> but<00:04:51.920> you'll<00:04:52.220> see<00:04:52.430> at<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:52.550> end<00:04:52.640> of<00:04:52.790> the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
that but you'll see at the end of the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.380 
that but you'll see at the end of the
game<00:04:52.910> that<00:04:53.420> I<00:04:53.630> get<00:04:54.050> dogs<00:04:54.320> in<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.680> last<00:04:54.920> couple

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
game that I get dogs in the last couple

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.820 
game that I get dogs in the last couple
seconds<00:04:56.390> so<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:56.840> basically<00:04:57.080> would<00:04:57.500> have<00:04:57.620> beaten

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
seconds so I basically would have beaten

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.730 
seconds so I basically would have beaten
a<00:04:58.130> or<00:04:58.280> five<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:59.060> already<00:04:59.750> got<00:05:00.050> more<00:05:00.320> kills<00:05:00.530> in

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
a or five I already got more kills in

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.050 
a or five I already got more kills in
him<00:05:00.890> which<00:05:01.100> was<00:05:01.280> really<00:05:01.430> annoying<00:05:01.700> because<00:05:01.940> I

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
him which was really annoying because I

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.470 
him which was really annoying because I
was<00:05:02.180> trying<00:05:02.480> to<00:05:02.540> get<00:05:02.630> more<00:05:02.840> kills<00:05:03.020> than<00:05:03.110> him

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
was trying to get more kills than him

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.850 
was trying to get more kills than him
but<00:05:05.480> you<00:05:05.840> know<00:05:05.960> you<00:05:06.050> can't<00:05:06.350> do<00:05:06.470> anything<00:05:06.650> when

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
but you know you can't do anything when

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.220 
but you know you can't do anything when
the<00:05:06.920> game<00:05:07.100> ends<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:10.030> i'm<00:05:11.030> gonna<00:05:11.180> i<00:05:11.480> just

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.460 
before you'll notice the spawns right
away<00:05:31.460> gyno<00:05:32.360> the<00:05:32.480> spawns<00:05:32.750> on<00:05:32.990> a<00:05:33.020> lot<00:05:33.230> of<00:05:33.350> mass

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
away gyno the spawns on a lot of mass

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:34.960

for demolition and for new town

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.360

basically<00:05:35.260> it's<00:05:36.260> just<00:05:36.380> right<00:05:36.650> there<00:05:36.890> in<00:05:37.310> the

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
basically it's just right there in the

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.860 
basically it's just right there in the
back<00:05:37.700> does<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.210> only<00:05:38.420> spawn<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:41.210> think<00:05:41.810> I

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
back does the only spawn and I think I

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.400 
back does the only spawn and I think I
was<00:05:42.050> level<00:05:42.410> 6<00:05:43.370> 17<00:05:44.000> before<00:05:44.330> this<00:05:44.450> started<00:05:44.870> so<00:05:45.200> I

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:45.410 
was level 6 17 before this started so I

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.440

if they're going to and also a firing

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.950 
if they're going to and also a firing
range<00:06:18.080> domination<00:06:19.010> are<00:06:19.100> 24<00:06:19.670> 7<00:06:20.030> because<00:06:20.810> i

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
range domination are 24 7 because i

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.830 
range domination are 24 7 because i
really<00:06:21.500> like<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:21.980> small<00:06:22.220> maps<00:06:22.490> I<00:06:22.820> don't<00:06:23.780> like

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
really like the small maps I don't like

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.470 
really like the small maps I don't like
like<00:06:24.200> array<00:06:24.560> I<00:06:24.950> don't<00:06:25.580> like<00:06:25.700> those<00:06:25.880> maps<00:06:26.150> I

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480 
like array I don't like those maps I

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.630 
like array I don't like those maps I
think<00:06:26.780> that<00:06:26.840> if<00:06:27.050> they<00:06:27.200> do<00:06:27.260> a<00:06:27.730> new<00:06:28.730> town<00:06:29.000> 24-7<00:06:29.960> a

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
think that if they do a new town 24-7 a

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.280 
think that if they do a new town 24-7 a
fire<00:06:31.640> and<00:06:31.850> raise<00:06:31.940> 24-7<00:06:32.750> that<00:06:32.870> you<00:06:32.930> have<00:06:33.020> to<00:06:33.110> buy

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
fire and raise 24-7 that you have to buy

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.350 
fire and raise 24-7 that you have to buy
that's<00:06:33.620> really<00:06:33.860> cheap<00:06:34.130> I<00:06:34.430> think<00:06:35.120> that'd<00:06:35.210> be<00:06:35.330> a

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
that's really cheap I think that'd be a

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.600 
that's really cheap I think that'd be a
great<00:06:35.570> idea<00:06:35.690> I<00:06:36.260> think<00:06:37.010> that's<00:06:37.160> another<00:06:37.370> way

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
great idea I think that's another way

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.890 
great idea I think that's another way
that<00:06:37.640> they<00:06:37.970> can<00:06:38.030> make<00:06:38.180> money<00:06:38.450> because<00:06:38.660> I<00:06:38.840> know

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
that they can make money because I know

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.090 
that they can make money because I know
that<00:06:39.140> they're<00:06:39.320> all

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
that they're all

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.740 
that they're all
wendling<00:06:40.520> making<00:06:40.850> money<00:06:41.030> and<00:06:41.180> stuff<00:06:41.450> and

wendling making money and stuff and

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.250
