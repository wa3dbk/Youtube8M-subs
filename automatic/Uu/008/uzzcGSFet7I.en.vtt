00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
okay let's talk a little bit about the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.860 
okay let's talk a little bit about the
process<00:00:07.910> once<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.059> get<00:00:09.210> your<00:00:09.330> building

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
process once you get your building

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.259 
process once you get your building
permits<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:11.010> post<00:00:11.250> them<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.670> fence<00:00:11.969> along

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
permits you post them to the fence along

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.839 
permits you post them to the fence along
with<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> copy<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.900> your<00:00:13.080> plan<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.639> the

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
with a copy of your plan so that the

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.700 
with a copy of your plan so that the
contractors<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.809> access<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> if<00:00:16.590> they

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
contractors have access to it if they

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.320 
contractors have access to it if they
need<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> if<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> building<00:00:18.270> department

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
need it and if the building department

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.760 
need it and if the building department
wants<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.869> stop<00:00:19.080> by<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.410> check<00:00:19.529> on<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
wants to stop by and check on the

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.730 
wants to stop by and check on the
progress<00:00:19.949> they<00:00:20.310> can<00:00:20.550> now<00:00:21.449> once<00:00:22.289> that's<00:00:22.470> done

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
progress they can now once that's done

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.089 
progress they can now once that's done
that<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.970> process<00:00:24.420> takes<00:00:24.539> place<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.289> here's

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
that the process takes place and here's

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.160 
that the process takes place and here's
the<00:00:26.279> list<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.670> things<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.119> happen<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.689> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the list of things that happen in the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.650 
the list of things that happen in the
order<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.710> happen<00:00:29.099> they<00:00:29.880> excavate<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
order that they happen they excavate the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
order that they happen they excavate the
pool<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.500> prior<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.769> excavating<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.430> pool

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
pool but prior to excavating the pool

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.680 
pool but prior to excavating the pool
they're<00:00:32.730> actually<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.180> paint<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
they're actually going to paint that the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.380 
they're actually going to paint that the
pool<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.920> ground<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.270> see

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
pool on the ground so that you can see

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.970 
pool on the ground so that you can see
it<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.630> yourself<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.230> then<00:00:37.710> once<00:00:37.860> they

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
it for yourself and then once they

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.530 
it for yourself and then once they
excavate<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> pool<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
excavate the pool it's going to be a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.500 
excavate the pool it's going to be a
foot<00:00:39.870> deeper<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.800> foot<00:00:41.070> wider<00:00:41.510> to

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
foot deeper in a foot wider to

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.029 
foot deeper in a foot wider to
incorporate<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:44.280> actual<00:00:44.610> gun<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.320> once<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
incorporate the actual gun I so once the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.340 
incorporate the actual gun I so once the
pool<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:47.610> been<00:00:47.760> excavated<00:00:48.390> they're<00:00:49.140> going

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
pool it has been excavated they're going

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.700 
pool it has been excavated they're going
to<00:00:49.440> call<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.030> plumbers<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
to call in the plumbers and the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
to call in the plumbers and the
electricians<00:00:53.280> as<00:00:53.579> well<00:00:53.850> as<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> steel<00:00:54.420> guys

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
electricians as well as the steel guys

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.520 
electricians as well as the steel guys
now<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.710> come<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> different<00:00:56.129> orders

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
now they can come in different orders

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.689 
now they can come in different orders
typically<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> be<00:00:59.190> plumbing<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
typically it's going to be plumbing and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
typically it's going to be plumbing and
electrical<00:01:00.149> before<00:01:00.510> steel<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.020> sometimes

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
electrical before steel that sometimes

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.439 
electrical before steel that sometimes
I've<00:01:01.890> seen<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> where<00:01:02.460> steel<00:01:02.699> comes<00:01:02.969> first<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I've seen it where steel comes first and

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.350 
I've seen it where steel comes first and
then<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> plumbers<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> put<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
then the plumbers have to put the the

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
then the plumbers have to put the the
piping<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.510> what<00:01:07.229> through<00:01:07.860> underneath<00:01:08.460> this

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
piping in what through underneath this

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.240 
piping in what through underneath this
steel<00:01:09.060> which<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.479> be<00:01:09.630> kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.170> headache<00:01:10.650> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
steel which can be kind of a headache so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.469 
steel which can be kind of a headache so
you<00:01:11.310> want<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> plumbers<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you want to get the plumbers and you

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.760 
you want to get the plumbers and you
want<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> steel<00:01:13.080> guys<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.500> first

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
want to get the steel guys in first

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
want to get the steel guys in first
typically<00:01:14.189> and<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.680> after<00:01:16.680> plumbing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
typically and then after plumbing

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850 
typically and then after plumbing
electrical<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> steel<00:01:18.680> they're<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.799> to

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
electrical and steel they're going to

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.810 
electrical and steel they're going to
have<00:01:20.009> gun<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.869> typically<00:01:21.869> gunite<00:01:22.549> will<00:01:23.549> come

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
have gun and typically gunite will come

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.030 
have gun and typically gunite will come
in<00:01:24.740> prior<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.310> after<00:01:27.170> I'm<00:01:28.170> sorry<00:01:28.409> prior<00:01:28.740> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
in prior or after I'm sorry prior to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.880 
in prior or after I'm sorry prior to
concrete<00:01:29.670> decks<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.780> sometimes<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.530> after

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
concrete decks but sometimes it's after

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.460 
concrete decks but sometimes it's after
also<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.420> gunite<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.900> basically<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
also so the gunite is basically the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.289 
also so the gunite is basically the
concrete<00:01:34.920> shell<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> pool<00:01:35.610> once<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
concrete shell of the pool once the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
concrete shell of the pool once the
steel<00:01:36.540> cage<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.079> in<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.310> plumbing

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
steel cage is in and all the plumbing

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.149 
steel cage is in and all the plumbing
and<00:01:38.700> electrical<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.770> then<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.799> gunite

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and electrical is in then the gunite

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.310 
and electrical is in then the gunite
people<00:01:41.460> come<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.060> blow<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
people come in and they blow the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
people come in and they blow the
concrete<00:01:43.979> into<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> walls<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> floor

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
concrete into the walls and to the floor

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
concrete into the walls and to the floor
of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> pool<00:01:46.439> now<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.009> gunite<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> heavy

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
of the pool now the gunite is a heavy

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060 
of the pool now the gunite is a heavy
sand<00:01:48.420> mixture<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.560> under<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.799> high

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sand mixture and it's under a high

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.490 
sand mixture and it's under a high
pressure<00:01:50.399> like<00:01:50.700> high<00:01:50.970> pressure<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:52.259> there's<00:01:52.470> a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
pressure like high pressure so there's a

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.170 
pressure like high pressure so there's a
lot<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> air<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.790> becomes<00:01:54.030> very

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
lot of air in it so it becomes very

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.240 
lot of air in it so it becomes very
sticky<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:55.409> they<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.680> blow<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:55.920> into<00:01:56.130> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
sticky so they can blow it into the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.149 
sticky so they can blow it into the
walls<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.790> into<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> floor<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> then<00:01:58.740> after

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
walls and into the floor and then after

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.380 
walls and into the floor and then after
that<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.840> concrete<00:02:01.290> decks<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.710> poured<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
that the concrete decks are poured and

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.680 
that the concrete decks are poured and
then

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
then

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.380 
then
the<00:02:04.110> plaster<00:02:04.560> comes<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.580> plaster<00:02:05.970> guys<00:02:06.150> come

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the plaster comes the plaster guys come

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.320 
the plaster comes the plaster guys come
in<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.780> they<00:02:06.840> they<00:02:07.620> put<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.010> thin<00:02:09.000> coat<00:02:09.300> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
in and they they put a thin coat of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.850 
in and they they put a thin coat of
smooth<00:02:10.080> plaster<00:02:10.680> over<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.160> rough<00:02:11.340> gunite<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
smooth plaster over the rough gunite and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
smooth plaster over the rough gunite and
once<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:14.070> plaster<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.730> done<00:02:15.050> they

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
once the plaster is done they

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.540 
once the plaster is done they
immediately<00:02:16.260> start<00:02:16.830> filling<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> pool

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
immediately start filling the pool

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.180 
immediately start filling the pool
because<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> plaster<00:02:19.200> has<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.980> cure

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
because the plaster has to cure

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.520 
because the plaster has to cure
underwater<00:02:20.310> and<00:02:20.850> that<00:02:21.660> usually<00:02:21.960> takes<00:02:22.230> two<00:02:22.410> to

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
underwater and that usually takes two to

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.570 
underwater and that usually takes two to
three<00:02:22.740> days<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.450> after<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:26.040> gunite<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
three days so after the gunite and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.110 
three days so after the gunite and
plaster<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.210> done<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:29.100> equipment<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.610> turned

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
plaster is done the equipment is turned

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.390 
plaster is done the equipment is turned
on<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.900> equipment<00:02:31.140> set<00:02:31.380> usually<00:02:31.920> takes<00:02:32.190> place

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
on the equipment set usually takes place

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.600 
on the equipment set usually takes place
during<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:34.440> after<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.830> concrete<00:02:35.400> is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
during the right after the concrete is

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.060 
during the right after the concrete is
installed<00:02:36.510> they<00:02:37.020> place<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.590> equipment<00:02:37.950> in

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
installed they place the equipment in

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.470 
installed they place the equipment in
hook<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.490> all<00:02:38.640> up<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.910> plumbing<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
hook that all up to the plumbing the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.230 
hook that all up to the plumbing the
electrical<00:02:39.510> and<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:41.010> pool<00:02:41.280> fires<00:02:41.580> up<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> it

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
electrical and the pool fires up and it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.080 
electrical and the pool fires up and it
should<00:02:42.450> be<00:02:42.480> ready<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.990> go<00:02:43.110> within<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.500> few<00:02:43.650> days

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
should be ready to go within a few days

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.150 
should be ready to go within a few days
you<00:02:45.090> want<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.330> give<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.230> plaster<00:02:46.800> time<00:02:47.010> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
you want to give the plaster time to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.800 
you want to give the plaster time to
cure<00:02:47.340> underwater<00:02:47.460> two<00:02:48.030> to<00:02:48.150> three<00:02:48.330> days<00:02:48.480> and

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
cure underwater two to three days and

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.540 
cure underwater two to three days and
then<00:02:49.320> also<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.620> want<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.860> get<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.070> chemistry

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
then also you want to get the chemistry

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.190 
then also you want to get the chemistry
