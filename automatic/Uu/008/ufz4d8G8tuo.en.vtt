00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 I'll try to explain the idea that 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.210
 I have notice that right now I have the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.190
 dirty crushed hair I'm not combed 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.650
 but as I'm traveling hair I do not know about you but 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.509
 I'm not going to see him with clean hair and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.130
 how am I doing right now because the truth is not 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.560
 I have prepared this video before 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.660
 been all like a little of this you say 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.519
 I want a change and a day to 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.510
 another you ask for an appointment and you have the idea 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.260
 head 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.220
 the case is that 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:33.290
 I 'm sorry I have dirty hair and those things 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.750
 well I will explain a little what 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.680
 I have in my mind right now as 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.899
 You see led the spotlight camera lights 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.309
 or what is being wicks 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.449
 Californians right downtown 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.449
 then I root 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.680
 It is not my natural color as life 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.280
 same and it 's the tip I wear the same color 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.800
 that the root 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.320
 therefore good to have the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.020
 darker tip looks like 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.710
 healthier hair when it is 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.040
 combed everything and if then then it follows 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.000
 giving a lot of light to the face what is the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.270
 center strip 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.820
 I already told you about this I will leave you in the 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 information and so you can see how 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.110
 I stay and all this the idea now is 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 I want to cut it a little bit because 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.060
 the more I'm having it longer 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.580
 lacio is I see it because it weighs 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.150
 more does not have giving movement then 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.820
 The idea is to cut me off, what do you give me? 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 lots have to have this alone of 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 here not that it's like 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.500
 like five fingers then what's more 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 or less around here and that way already in 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.340
 when I do a couple of waves with the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.530
 iron and so on, as it is going to 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.440
 have more volume and more hair 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.560
 movement that's the idea then it's going to 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.800
 continue to be part of the tip in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.420
 dark and what I want is to raise the noise 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.180
 because I have already grown a lot and I want 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.610
 go back up a lot without reaching 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.410
 touch root because I want to keep having 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.450
 this advantage of not having to be 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.030
 dyeing every month but so 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.800
 I do not want to raise the idea enough that I 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.790
 I have also is to put a bit of 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.640
 darkness in this inner zone and in the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.590
 outside area remove some lock 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.140
 more blonde me for example this is not 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.510
 discoloration this is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:33.330
 and coconut oil if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.690
 which is less aggressive then clarifies 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.000
 two tones but without doing all the damage of 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.430
 deco then my idea is to go back to 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.100
 come up with coconut oil but get me a 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.440
 couple of strands with deco and take them 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:52.140
 almost to white with a silver hue that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 is the idea that I carry is what you 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.310
 I told my hairdresser that every day I 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.950
 look with more face the pot goes away 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.450
 mogollÃ³n also as it is something that 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.459
 it comes to my mind because it's not that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.370
 find pictures online to be able to 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.470
 take him and explain him it's not me 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.150
 I explain and then she and the truth that 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.239
 it almost always succeeds then good the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.540
 idea is that to see again a 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.130
 I tell you that for me there will be six 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.569
 hours until I come back here in front 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 of the camera because then everything many 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.200
 Things to Do 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.280
 to see what happened 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.410
 well, this is the result as 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.450
 you see in the end he left me a lot more 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.190
 short of what I thought at first 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.710
 but I say goes mine already put to cut 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.410
 Well, it has cut me a lot 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.600
 As you can see, the whole interior is more 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.550
 dark I 've gone up a lot the blonde but 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.330
 a lot and I have removed the strands as 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.450
 whiter 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:56.170
 I wanted to in the front at the end we have 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.880
 left one meter from the darker site 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.670
 is going to come out like that and also 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.430
 in case I get ponytail so it does not look 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.980
 only blond and good as you see 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.080
 I continue with my with my result this bet 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.120
 to not have to have me then 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.970
 as the time passes, the washes and 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.080
 the rest is clearing up a lot this 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:19.359
 tone is a 5-1 that is like me my tone of 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.400
 natural root but as follows the blonde 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.840
 below it will clear up a bit, it will go 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.120
 intermingling and will be staying 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.260
 more integrated than based on everything like 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.970
 pretty shocking 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.620
 over all the white that is that I 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.470
 I love I have a couple of locks like that 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.140
 like super blond and I like a lot 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.270
 that was here here also led 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.790
 another lock as in 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:46.120
 as in vertical darker and good then 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.180
 this is how it is finally 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.930
 what we wanted short with movement and 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.970
 a bit like that the touches of color that 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.610
 gone a little on the fly the truth 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.620
 because one thing will be explained like that later 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.260
 it is drying it is seen and at the end 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.820
 these tufts have been removed at the end 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.820
 because it was very blond in the end 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.080
 a mess because you're going to go with your idea and me 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.090
 is that I'm going a lot the pot the hair 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.890
 so nothing, this is the new look 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.200
 to give a lot more blonde and nothing because then 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.980
 is that way you'll see me from now on 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.810
 and you already mention to me I like it a lot 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:29.160
 all the two I will do the truth is that 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:33.360
 I like to change and those things so 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:36.920
 nothing up here the change and I said 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.920
 you will see more videos
