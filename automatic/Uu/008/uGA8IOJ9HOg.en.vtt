little tongue pull pull tab thingy with
the<00:02:54.900> number<00:02:55.140> one<00:02:55.350> on<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.769> actually<00:02:56.160> comes

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the number one on it it actually comes

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.990 
the number one on it it actually comes
from<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.850> cost<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.260> 2's<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.790> little

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
from the cost in 2's you so little

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.630 
from the cost in 2's you so little
things<00:03:00.150> like<00:03:00.300> that<00:03:00.450> are<00:03:01.220> kind<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.430> had

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
things like that are kind of it had

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.630 
things like that are kind of it had
inspired<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.630> whole<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:05.489> whole<00:03:05.640> thing<00:03:05.670> I

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
inspired this whole the whole thing I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.979 
inspired this whole the whole thing I
didn't<00:03:08.640> want<00:03:08.670> any<00:03:08.970> anything<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> upper

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
didn't want any anything in the upper

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.060 
didn't want any anything in the upper
but<00:03:10.140> then<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.380> had<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.590> figure<00:03:10.769> out<00:03:10.920> how<00:03:11.010> to

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
but then we had to figure out how to

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.590 
but then we had to figure out how to
detail<00:03:11.579> it<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.850> make<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.090> look<00:03:12.180> like<00:03:12.299> there<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
detail it to make it look like there is

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.030 
detail it to make it look like there is
something<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.110> we<00:03:13.200> added<00:03:13.440> these<00:03:13.530> stitch<00:03:13.769> lines

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
something so we added these stitch lines

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.940 
something so we added these stitch lines
and<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.570> there's<00:03:15.570> some<00:03:15.780> Gulf<00:03:16.260> inspiration

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
and like there's some Gulf inspiration

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.160 
and like there's some Gulf inspiration
too<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.519> know<00:03:17.670> when<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.720> line<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.110> a

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
too you know when you like line up a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870 
too you know when you like line up a
putt<00:03:19.410> it's<00:03:20.010> just<00:03:20.190> kind<00:03:20.370> of<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.519> inspiration

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
putt it's just kind of this inspiration

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.479 
putt it's just kind of this inspiration
of<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.299> stitch<00:03:21.570> lines<00:03:21.920> maybe<00:03:22.920> some<00:03:23.220> people

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
of the stitch lines maybe some people

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.069 
of the stitch lines maybe some people
will<00:03:23.579> know<00:03:23.730> done<00:03:23.970> like<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.540> angle<00:03:24.870> of<00:03:24.959> their

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
will know done like the angle of their

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.420 
will know done like the angle of their
foot<00:03:25.350> should<00:03:25.560> be<00:03:25.680> right<00:03:25.890> here<00:03:25.920> for<00:03:26.340> this

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
foot should be right here for this
