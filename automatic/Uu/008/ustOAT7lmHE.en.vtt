00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280 

so<00:00:00.870> I'm<00:00:01.079> here<00:00:01.380> with<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> spiky<00:00:02.370> hack<00:00:02.870> the<00:00:03.870> reason

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
so I'm here with a spiky hack the reason

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.299 
so I'm here with a spiky hack the reason
why<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.799> taking<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.339> video<00:00:05.609> is<00:00:07.130> because<00:00:08.130> I

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
why I'm taking a video is because I

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.620 
why I'm taking a video is because I
can't<00:00:08.490> distribute<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.000> code<00:00:09.240> yet<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.540> not

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
can't distribute this code yet it's not

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.570 
can't distribute this code yet it's not
really<00:00:09.870> ready<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.110> that<00:00:10.290> but<00:00:11.010> I<00:00:11.070> did<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
really ready for that but I did want to

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.289 
really ready for that but I did want to
show<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.179> it's<00:00:12.870> real<00:00:13.429> it<00:00:14.429> actually<00:00:14.759> runs<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
show that it's real it actually runs I

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.210 
show that it's real it actually runs I
mean<00:00:15.450> it's<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.260> hack<00:00:16.440> maybe<00:00:16.710> real<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.130> an

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
mean it's a hack maybe real is an

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.560 
mean it's a hack maybe real is an
overstatement<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:17.940> mean<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.240> does

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
overstatement but I mean it is does

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.510 
overstatement but I mean it is does
exist<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.260> really<00:00:19.439> does<00:00:19.619> live<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.279> works

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
exist and it really does live and works

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.080 
exist and it really does live and works
and<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.830> quick<00:00:23.460> hack<00:00:23.699> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
and so what it is is a quick hack that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.349 
and so what it is is a quick hack that
to<00:00:24.420> access<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.050> spykee<00:00:25.500> robot<00:00:25.529> from<00:00:26.359> an

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
to access the spykee robot from an

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
to access the spykee robot from an
iphone<00:00:27.570> /<00:00:28.050> edge<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.160> Wi-Fi<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
iphone / edge or over Wi-Fi so it's a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.350 
iphone / edge or over Wi-Fi so it's a
pretty<00:00:32.160> basic<00:00:32.460> app<00:00:32.850> for<00:00:33.120> now<00:00:33.210> I've

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
pretty basic app for now I've

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.209 
pretty basic app for now I've
implemented<00:00:33.719> only<00:00:33.960> some<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.590> features<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
implemented only some of the features of

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
implemented only some of the features of
the<00:00:36.090> spiky<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.829> in<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.010> iphone<00:00:38.760> app<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.780> here

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the spiky in in this iphone app but here

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.760 
the spiky in in this iphone app but here
you<00:00:40.110> can<00:00:40.260> see<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:41.040> app<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> screen<00:00:41.969> here

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
you can see the app on the screen here

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.229 
you can see the app on the screen here
so<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.980> got<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> picture<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> live

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
so it's got a picture that is a live

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.029 
so it's got a picture that is a live
picture<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> happens<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:46.860> I've

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
picture so it happens that I've

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.250 
picture so it happens that I've
implemented<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.670> some<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.180> movement<00:00:48.930> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
implemented is some of the movement so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.350 
implemented is some of the movement so
you<00:00:49.320> can<00:00:49.469> see<00:00:49.590> there's<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> delay<00:00:50.129> but<00:00:51.120> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you can see there's a delay but that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.380 
you can see there's a delay but that
robot<00:00:51.719> does<00:00:51.989> move<00:00:52.289> when<00:00:53.070> instructed<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
robot does move when instructed to and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
robot does move when instructed to and
this<00:00:55.050> app<00:00:55.260> could<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.649> happening<00:00:55.860> already<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
this app could be happening already so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
this app could be happening already so
it's<00:00:56.699> been<00:00:56.850> designed<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.809> low<00:00:57.960> res

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
it's been designed for for low res

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.130 
it's been designed for for low res
environments<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.510> it<00:01:00.510> does<00:01:00.690> let<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> robot

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
environments and it does let the robot

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.740 
environments and it does let the robot
move<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> also<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.940> activate<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> few<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
move and it also can activate a few of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.399 
move and it also can activate a few of
the<00:01:03.809> features<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> light<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
the features like the light and so on

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.550 
the features like the light and so on
but<00:01:07.409> mostly<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.670> have<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.380> see

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
but mostly it does have a way to see

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.320 
but mostly it does have a way to see
that<00:01:10.740> what<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.979> camera<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.310> looking<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:12.240> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that what the camera is looking at so it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.789 
that what the camera is looking at so it
just<00:01:12.360> takes<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> snapshot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> but<00:01:13.710> if

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
just takes a snapshot of that but if

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.950 
just takes a snapshot of that but if
you'll<00:01:13.979> notice<00:01:14.189> if<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.670> movement<00:01:15.479> again<00:01:15.750> or

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you'll notice if I do movement again or

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.830 
you'll notice if I do movement again or
if<00:01:16.049> i<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.590> robot<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.159> can<00:01:18.150> spin<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.540> robot

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
if i turn the robot I can spin the robot

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.120 
if i turn the robot I can spin the robot
around<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.530> these<00:01:25.710> frames

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
around and you can see these frames

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.310 
around and you can see these frames
update<00:01:26.549> now<00:01:27.030> there's<00:01:27.240> another<00:01:27.330> mode<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
update now there's another mode that you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.800 
update now there's another mode that you
can<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.030> return<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> robot<00:01:30.780> a

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
can do that I can return the robot a

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.060 
can do that I can return the robot a
little<00:01:31.049> further<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> little

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
little further so you can see a little

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.630 
little further so you can see a little
bit<00:01:32.220> more<00:01:32.400> what's<00:01:32.820> going<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.350> and<00:01:34.350> now<00:01:34.640> there's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
bit more what's going on and now there's

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.969 
bit more what's going on and now there's
another<00:01:35.790> mode<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.390> robot<00:01:36.659> are<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.680> this

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
another mode of the robot are that this

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.289 
another mode of the robot are that this
app<00:01:38.159> has<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.610> if<00:01:38.700> you're<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.000> situation

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
app has that if you're in a situation

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.819 
app has that if you're in a situation
once<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> frames<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.320> update<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> little

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
once the frames to update a little

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.880 
once the frames to update a little
quicker<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:41.939> hit<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.049> low<00:01:43.259> resolution

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
quicker you can hit this low resolution

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.130 
quicker you can hit this low resolution
mode<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.210> get<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> grainy<00:01:45.659> picture

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
mode and then you get a grainy picture

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319 
mode and then you get a grainy picture
but<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.280> rough<00:01:47.490> idea<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.790> movement<00:01:48.240> in

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
but you get a rough idea of movement in

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.149 
but you get a rough idea of movement in
motion<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.990> what's<00:01:49.170> visible<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.829> camera

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
motion and what's visible in the camera

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
motion and what's visible in the camera
and<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.090> over<00:01:51.329> edge<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.840> would<00:01:51.990> go<00:01:52.140> somewhat

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and so over edge that would go somewhat

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.460 
and so over edge that would go somewhat
faster<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.490> particularly<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:55.170> would<00:01:55.320> let

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
faster is particularly and it would let

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.370 
faster is particularly and it would let
you<00:01:55.670> perhaps<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.290> more

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you perhaps be a little bit more

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
you perhaps be a little bit more
interactive<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.189> robot<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.729> least

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
interactive with the robot or at least

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.050 
interactive with the robot or at least
see<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.360> seeing<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.939> it

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
see what it's seeing you can make it

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
see what it's seeing you can make it
take<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> snapshot<00:02:03.570> with<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.229> camera<00:02:04.740> button

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
take a snapshot with the camera button

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.800 
take a snapshot with the camera button
there<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.520> can<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.450> turn<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
there you can you can turn on the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.089 
there you can you can turn on the
surveillance<00:02:07.110> mode<00:02:07.380> what<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> found<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.979> bit

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
surveillance mode what I found a bit

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
surveillance mode what I found a bit
flaky<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> robot<00:02:08.940> anyway<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.420> seems<00:02:09.569> to

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
flaky and the robot anyway it seems to

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.530 
flaky and the robot anyway it seems to
reset<00:02:10.140> itself<00:02:10.940> periodically<00:02:11.940> into

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
reset itself periodically into

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.020 
reset itself periodically into
of<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.019> app<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> let's<00:02:14.489> say<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> had<00:02:14.879> this

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
of this app so let's say I had this

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.929 
of this app so let's say I had this
picture<00:02:15.269> on<00:02:15.719> the<00:02:16.019> robot<00:02:16.349> that's<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.609> can<00:02:17.760> see

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
picture on the robot that's you can see

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.399 
picture on the robot that's you can see
it's<00:02:18.090> not<00:02:18.239> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.629> grainy<00:02:18.870> mode<00:02:19.109> will<00:02:19.290> let

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
it's not kind of in grainy mode will let

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's not kind of in grainy mode will let
that<00:02:19.560> camera<00:02:19.920> focus<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:20.969> you<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.150> see<00:02:21.299> that's

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
that camera focus so you can see that's

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.970 
that camera focus so you can see that's
a<00:02:21.569> grainy<00:02:21.780> mode<00:02:21.989> picture<00:02:22.379> but<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.829> see

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
a grainy mode picture but you can see

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
a grainy mode picture but you can see
that<00:02:23.010> it's<00:02:23.519> got<00:02:23.609> that<00:02:23.939> update<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.810> now<00:02:24.900> okay<00:02:25.140> I

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
that it's got that update so now okay I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.630 
that it's got that update so now okay I
want<00:02:25.379> to<00:02:25.469> clear<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.799> up<00:02:25.859> okay<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.459> that

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
want to clear that up okay that that

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.099 
want to clear that up okay that that
picture<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.120> interesting<00:02:27.510> now<00:02:27.629> I<00:02:27.659> want<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.959> go

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
picture is interesting now I want to go

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.690 
picture is interesting now I want to go
ahead<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.379> take<00:02:28.469> the<00:02:28.650> time<00:02:28.829> to<00:02:29.010> push<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.430> a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
ahead and take the time to push in a

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.420 
ahead and take the time to push in a
higher<00:02:30.359> res<00:02:30.629> version<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:32.220> click

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
higher res version of that I can click

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.369 
higher res version of that I can click
that<00:02:32.579> resolution<00:02:32.939> button<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.140> get<00:02:34.349> a

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
that resolution button and then get a

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:35.539 
that resolution button and then get a
clear<00:02:34.680> picture<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.129> you<00:02:35.189> can<00:02:35.310> see<00:02:35.519> that

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
clear picture and you can see that

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:38.000 
clear picture and you can see that
that's<00:02:36.180> maximum<00:02:36.810> resolution<00:02:37.170> of<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> robot

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
that's maximum resolution of the robot

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.369 
that's maximum resolution of the robot
it's<00:02:38.250> normal<00:02:38.670> resolution<00:02:39.329> so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.810> clear

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
it's normal resolution so you can clear

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.569 
it's normal resolution so you can clear
up<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.590> picture<00:02:40.950> so<00:02:41.099> you<00:02:41.129> can<00:02:41.220> move<00:02:41.430> around

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
up that picture so you can move around

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.869 
up that picture so you can move around
in<00:02:42.000> sort<00:02:42.629> of<00:02:42.689> low<00:02:42.810> resolution<00:02:43.439> mode<00:02:43.760> still<00:02:44.760> get

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
in sort of low resolution mode still get

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.429 
in sort of low resolution mode still get
snapshots<00:02:45.389> and<00:02:45.629> the<00:02:45.930> frame<00:02:46.170> will

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
snapshots and the frame will

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.860 
snapshots and the frame will
automatically<00:02:47.189> update<00:02:47.220> if<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:48.420> point<00:02:48.689> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
automatically update if we point this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.379 
automatically update if we point this
robot<00:02:49.319> if<00:02:49.470> there's<00:02:49.650> motion<00:02:49.889> in<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.370> frame<00:02:50.700> it

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
robot if there's motion in that frame it

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.119 
robot if there's motion in that frame it
will<00:02:51.629> automatically<00:02:52.169> update<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.799> that

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
will automatically update that that

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.610 
will automatically update that that
portal<00:02:54.030> window<00:02:54.389> of<00:02:54.689> what<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.079> robots<00:02:55.409> doing

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
portal window of what the robots doing

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.819 
portal window of what the robots doing
so<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> don't<00:02:56.549> have<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> move<00:02:57.510> it<00:02:57.689> or<00:02:57.930> or<00:02:58.139> do

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
so I don't have to move it or or do

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.440 
so I don't have to move it or or do
something<00:02:59.099> every<00:02:59.400> time<00:02:59.639> I<00:02:59.669> want<00:02:59.909> to<00:02:59.970> refresh<00:03:00.269> I

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
something every time I want to refresh I

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.940 
something every time I want to refresh I
can't<00:03:00.689> do<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> manual<00:03:01.169> refresh<00:03:01.470> with<00:03:01.799> that

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
can't do a manual refresh with that

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.520 
can't do a manual refresh with that
update<00:03:02.250> button<00:03:02.489> which<00:03:02.760> updates<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.389> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
update button which updates all the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.619 
update button which updates all the
components<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.829> see<00:03:05.040> in<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.549> the<00:03:05.579> app<00:03:05.790> but

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629 
components you see in the in the app but

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.899 
components you see in the in the app but
it<00:03:06.900> also<00:03:07.079> will<00:03:07.379> update<00:03:07.560> automatically<00:03:08.250> if

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
it also will update automatically if

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.940 
it also will update automatically if
there's<00:03:09.329> motion<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.930> for<00:03:10.409> instance<00:03:10.470> if<00:03:10.799> one

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
there's motion like for instance if one

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.849 
there's motion like for instance if one
of<00:03:11.040> my<00:03:11.129> dogs<00:03:11.840> comes<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.109> robot<00:03:13.439> let<00:03:13.650> me<00:03:13.739> see

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
of my dogs comes to the robot let me see

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.470 
of my dogs comes to the robot let me see
if<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.040> can<00:03:14.189> make<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.669> of<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.849> dogs<00:03:15.030> do<00:03:15.269> that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
if I can make one of the dogs do that

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.339 
if I can make one of the dogs do that
morocco<00:03:17.060> everybody<00:03:20.720> so<00:03:21.720> you<00:03:21.840> can<00:03:21.959> see<00:03:22.169> as

morocco everybody so you can see as

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:24.920 
morocco everybody so you can see as
there's<00:03:22.889> motion<00:03:23.129> into<00:03:23.609> the<00:03:23.729> frame<00:03:24.060> there's

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
there's motion into the frame there's

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.589 
there's motion into the frame there's
one<00:03:25.199> of<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.409> dogs<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.979> she'll<00:03:26.909> you<00:03:27.239> can<00:03:27.389> see

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
one of the dogs and she'll you can see

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.629 
one of the dogs and she'll you can see
her<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:27.810> real<00:03:27.989> life<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.530> she's<00:03:28.739> there<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.220> a

her in real life so she's there and a
little<00:03:29.819> while<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.269> camera<00:03:30.599> frame<00:03:30.900> should

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
little while the camera frame should

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.920 
little while the camera frame should
update<00:03:31.319> you'll<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.459> snapshot<00:03:32.729> DC<00:03:33.419> and<00:03:33.599> now

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
update you'll get a snapshot DC and now

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.439 
update you'll get a snapshot DC and now
the<00:03:33.989> picture<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.650> iphone<00:03:35.159> has<00:03:35.310> updated<00:03:35.699> to

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
the picture on the iphone has updated to

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.740 
the picture on the iphone has updated to
include<00:03:36.479> the<00:03:36.959> dog<00:03:37.250> and<00:03:38.250> you<00:03:39.030> can<00:03:39.180> see<00:03:39.389> that<00:03:39.419> now

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
include the dog and you can see that now

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.479 
include the dog and you can see that now
she's<00:03:40.290> out<00:03:40.409> of<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.560> frame<00:03:40.829> in<00:03:40.979> its<00:03:41.099> updated

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
she's out of the frame in its updated

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.699 
she's out of the frame in its updated
again<00:03:41.609> so<00:03:42.389> as<00:03:42.569> these<00:03:42.720> dogs<00:03:43.049> come<00:03:43.409> in<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.650> out

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
again so as these dogs come in and out

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.469 
again so as these dogs come in and out
of<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.919> frame<00:03:44.159> you'll<00:03:44.340> get<00:03:44.489> new<00:03:44.639> snapshots<00:03:45.209> to

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
of the frame you'll get new snapshots to

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.180 
of the frame you'll get new snapshots to
show<00:03:45.659> they<00:03:46.049> were<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.409> frame<00:03:46.650> at<00:03:46.799> that<00:03:46.949> time

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
show they were in the frame at that time

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
show they were in the frame at that time
you<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.459> see<00:03:47.639> there<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.849> a<00:03:47.879> delay<00:03:48.150> she's<00:03:48.359> in

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
you can see there is a delay she's in

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.869 
you can see there is a delay she's in
the<00:03:48.599> frame<00:03:48.840> now<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.260> real<00:03:49.440> life<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:49.949> she's<00:03:50.760> not

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
the frame now in real life but she's not

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.390 
the frame now in real life but she's not
updated<00:03:51.479> on<00:03:51.569> the<00:03:51.659> iphone<00:03:52.019> yet<00:03:52.229> takes<00:03:53.129> a<00:03:53.250> little

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
updated on the iphone yet takes a little

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.890 
updated on the iphone yet takes a little
while<00:03:53.579> and<00:03:53.790> there<00:03:53.940> she<00:03:54.090> is<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.479> can<00:03:54.599> see<00:03:54.750> your

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
while and there she is you can see your

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.759 
while and there she is you can see your
updated<00:03:55.709> there<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:56.870> it<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:57.930> automatic<00:03:58.590> it's

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
updated there so it is automatic it's

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.240 
updated there so it is automatic it's
not<00:03:58.949> a<00:03:58.979> real-time<00:03:59.519> picture<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.389> streaming

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
not a real-time picture of streaming

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.039 
not a real-time picture of streaming
this<00:04:02.250> is<00:04:02.400> designed<00:04:02.669> in<00:04:02.849> particular<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.870> deal

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
this is designed in particular to deal

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.140 
this is designed in particular to deal
with<00:04:04.260> low<00:04:04.889> bandwidth<00:04:05.310> situations<00:04:05.909> so<00:04:06.060> it

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
with low bandwidth situations so it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.729 
with low bandwidth situations so it
doesn't<00:04:06.449> do<00:04:06.540> streaming<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.139> also<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> was

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
doesn't do streaming and also that was

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.949 
doesn't do streaming and also that was
just<00:04:07.889> too<00:04:08.010> much<00:04:08.040> work<00:04:08.189> for<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.609> past<00:04:08.849> one<00:04:09.090> but<00:04:09.840> it

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
just too much work for a past one but it

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.770 
just too much work for a past one but it
is<00:04:10.079> interesting<00:04:10.259> you<00:04:10.590> got<00:04:10.829> the<00:04:10.979> spykee<00:04:11.370> robot

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
is interesting you got the spykee robot

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.659 
is interesting you got the spykee robot
operating<00:04:12.780> on<00:04:13.409> an<00:04:13.500> iphone<00:04:13.889> so<00:04:14.759> thanks
