your home turf anymore so I would say be

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.800 
your home turf anymore so I would say be
prepared<00:01:16.620> as<00:01:17.040> far<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:18.390> attempts<00:01:18.690> you're

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810

going to take be realistic how high your

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.190 
going to take be realistic how high your
warm-up<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> intense<00:01:21.600> feel<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:21.990> sure<00:01:22.110> you

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
warm-up that intense feel make sure you

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.470 
warm-up that intense feel make sure you
open<00:01:22.350> up<00:01:22.560> light<00:01:22.830> enough<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:23.970> able<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
open up light enough so you're able to

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.620 
open up light enough so you're able to
have<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:24.900> choice<00:01:25.230> to<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.620> out<00:01:25.800> and<00:01:26.540> that's<00:01:27.540> about

have a choice to go out and that's about

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.940 
have a choice to go out and that's about
it<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:28.020> long<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.200> you're<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.410> overtraining

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
it as long as you're not overtraining

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.080 
it as long as you're not overtraining
all<00:01:29.160> your<00:01:29.280> training<00:01:29.460> work<00:01:29.640> correctly<00:01:29.970> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
all your training work correctly you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
all your training work correctly you
should<00:01:30.240> hit<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.510> number<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> want

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
should hit the number you want

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.290 
should hit the number you want
it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.560> make<00:01:32.400> sure<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.940> warm<00:01:33.120> up

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
it's just make sure that you warm up

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.470 
it's just make sure that you warm up
properly<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.830> pace<00:01:35.070> yourself<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.670> take

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
properly and you pace yourself and take

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.020 
properly and you pace yourself and take
the<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:36.920> take<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.040> rent<00:01:38.190> attempts<00:01:38.520> that's

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the right take the rent attempts that's

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.640 
the right take the rent attempts that's
pretty<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> we<00:01:41.520> got<00:01:41.640> Rob<00:01:41.970> Maury<00:01:42.300> I

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
pretty much it and we got Rob Maury I

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.600 
pretty much it and we got Rob Maury I
think<00:01:43.650> he's<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:43.860> Canada<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:46.070> how<00:01:47.070> would<00:01:47.160> one
