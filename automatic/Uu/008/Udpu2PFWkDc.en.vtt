00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.519
 Yes, that's why mg Gundam version 3.0 will be made now 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.910
 I think I want to go 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:14.800
 Yes I would like to measure the production time, but as always 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:20.090
 In a place called only gate processing without it surface treatment Shima sanding None can nippers 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:22.560
 I think So start and want to measure the time to look up Saku extremely trivial 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.029
 While saying that it can be made crispy 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.470
 a Seeing or eating something or being diluted against being present 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:38.190
 It will take some time If you are yours, you are all yours 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:42.579
 I think that I can make it in about 34% of the time It is quite late It is a little possible children Amenity 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.079
 I say this Shah partner ne great'm told such a place 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.640
 No such tiny but 3 in advance 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.230
 I wow 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:56.600
 Yes finally time it took but I cut out has been completed of the parts and called the 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.260
 Dawn it took an hour and 50 minutes and teamed up as usual unallowable leisurely 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.350
 I will 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:06.659
 Yes I think you will do quite a lot of plastic models too 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:10.170
 It 's a very enjoyable edition year that is a kind of work of making a brightening 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:16.590
 In my case recently while watching that television already 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:22.799
 This is It is surprisingly are making while watching it is a program that reservoir Torne Re-recording of ps 3 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:26.650
 It is usually want to or look at the Toka two say whether the program you have not seen the traffic program to choose at that time 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:31.210
 I What is the Toka movie because the movie is not looking at the screen and information 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.590
 Since it is not not enter into the Nde What Is the movie not a thing to enjoy a look at the picture 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 When making a plastic model, your eyes must face the plastic model 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:45.970
 That news program or such information variety like that Cambria palace 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.640
 A program that contains almost all the important information from 8 delicious is quite good 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.450
 in the meantime 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 Move your hand a 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:55.469
 It is quite fun time that c can also make a plastic model 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.969
 Yes, we will work together from now on 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:05.880
 It looks like it's a manual that pulls up from the core fighter. 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:08.470
 But certainly it Neeee this later in this work angry is to little trouble stinking earlier even than 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.760
 I think that it will be assembled as a package 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:19.930
 It might make sense to meet you. It is great. Now this is Core Fighter 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:25.090
 The do's but something like this small parts out is fitted in this way put into this gap 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.870
 Somehow this part will not hold down this side so that this side will not fall apart 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.800
 I think that I have a role 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.820
 It amazing tricks are fine 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:37.170
 It is already common sense to the person who is partnering with this rg 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:41.300
 I wonder if 2.0 was so great, I guess this core fighter's gimmick 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.400
 I'm still in a group and I 'm in here, but here's a copy and an example comes out 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 There are a lot of emotions I'm sorry I'm a great ugly this gimmick this core fighter was closed 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.910
 By the way, the cockpit and the nine joints work together and it is amazing how the fins finally appear 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.660
 this 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:02.700
 That's why it 's small , yes, from there 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:06.180
 So you Tamiya's is here because nippers had received a comment that what do you use 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.260
 It is a craft thin blade nipper and I put a link 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.900
 I 'm still a plastic model beginner beginner level but still 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.700
 It is said that what kind of tool other than plastic model is good from acquaintance 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.360
 At the same time, I would like to do nothing else I would like to buy something good with Nippa 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.069
 Good 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.810
 Now it says that I'm not need Toka ne other adhesive is my friend quite 30s 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:31.239
 Well I'm surprised 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:33.890
 Because only the nipper is saying that buying cheap goes forward, because I do not know that it is better than this either 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.920
 If you say there is a better one 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:42.210
 I hope you can tell us in the comments section etc. 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:46.410
 Yes This is the feeling that the core fighter is assembled The wheels below are clear parts 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.490
 Do not say that here is a block in this standing com do not remove this wheel 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.020
 It looks like you shouldn't 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:55.860
 We did not have a gimmick, such as Well be convolved I truly ever 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.060
 A gimmick like a perfect grade or maybe a wheel being folded up 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.730
 Is it become 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.569
 Yes is what 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.569
 It is completed in the junior
