su too many radio interviews so it's

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.100 
su too many radio interviews so it's
definitely<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.610> little<00:02:10.090> different<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:10.989> was

really<00:02:11.319> fun<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.709> guess<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.040> was<00:02:12.129> maybe<00:02:12.310> some

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
really fun I guess what was maybe some

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.130 
really fun I guess what was maybe some
