everything we have developed all the
tools<00:02:35.989> for<00:02:36.380> ourselves<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:37.340> we<00:02:37.790> are<00:02:37.910> on

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
tools for ourselves so we are on

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.900 
tools for ourselves so we are on
simulator<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.650> only<00:02:39.860> use<00:02:40.100> device<00:02:40.520> control

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
simulator we only use device control

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.170 
simulator we only use device control
manager<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:41.510> now<00:02:41.810> develop<00:02:42.650> our<00:02:43.580> own<00:02:43.610> vision

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
system because since we do research in

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.170 
system because since we do research in
all<00:02:48.260> these<00:02:48.380> areas<00:02:48.620> it's<00:02:49.250> very<00:02:49.580> good<00:02:49.790> to

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
all these areas it's very good to

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.840 
all these areas it's very good to
develop<00:02:50.810> everything<00:02:51.320> about<00:02:51.440> ourselves<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.370> we

develop everything about ourselves so we

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.449 
develop everything about ourselves so we
can<00:02:52.880> make<00:02:56.230> chat<00:02:57.230> about<00:02:57.500> results<00:02:58.190> and

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
can make chat about results and

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.410 
can make chat about results and
expectations<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.870> last<00:03:00.080> years<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:02.000> have

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
centimeters per second this here we

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.550 
centimeters per second this here we
might<00:03:12.590> be<00:03:12.830> a<00:03:13.160> little<00:03:13.310> bit<00:03:13.610> faster<00:03:14.150> than<00:03:14.180> that

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
might be a little bit faster than that
