00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.810
 you finally caused st 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.780
 undecided have caused in development so 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.359
 a 10 inch screen 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.180
 vincenti offering diagonal doctors 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:23.740
 a much larger screen than if you 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.110
 technically, odyx offers 79 % of 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.240
 more 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.000
 reading surface so that offers 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.590
 really a page that is much more 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.980
 great than we are used to seeing 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.420
 for example on possible targets 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.910
 it's on others 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.899
 it's a product that will benefit from a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.589
 reading interface that has been revisited 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:49.710
 for on the ocean that goes completely 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.269
 still finalized but with for example 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.670
 without text setting of 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.250
 innovations the management of a lineage of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.640
 margins whose new theix size 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.010
 example police cÃ©cilia adapted to these 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.289
 products there 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.030
 after there was a big job that was 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.030
 done on taking notes 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.060
 to really manage the notes 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.250
 they 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.230
 because we had dictionary ediciones and 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.490
 search index 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.350
 we were going 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.970
 so here we can have all of 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.910
 what are occurrences 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.960
 of the word jean the book so the skin of the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 literature is moderately 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.740
 interesting but on the other hand it will be 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.300
 interesting for 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.980
 the documentation 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.230
 jean heating we will also see a 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.540
 new pdm engine manager 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.970
 will be able to manage the epidemic 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.550
 stylized sound but that has me 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.350
 completely finished yet so this is a 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.340
 product that will be sincere 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.640
 this year 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.920
 after how nabla on the show 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.409
 we have finalized it's longer street 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.659
 and we apologize but we are all 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.040
 very want to go out for two years 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.659
 that we develop but like my screen that 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.030
 nobody uses a screen size 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.970
 real lambs and news 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.020
 features 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:15.390
 and it's a bit longer than you 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.800
 advantage of the screen develop 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.560
 against another very important element 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.530
 of the product is its finesse the climbs 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.880
 because in fact there are some 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.710
 almost a year ago we asked 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.020
 the 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.650
 to our fans what they've been waiting for since 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.750
 big screen and you could be too 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.090
 constraints sign the contracts 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.790
 it was the nomadic side he had very 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.610
 fear response is finer nomad 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.220
 what we see is that when we 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.010
 see this product there tomorrow it does this 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.930
 night m the reader was able to finalize 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.840
 even when we put a blanket that we have 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.010
 wanted or very very fine also we get 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.260
 found with a product extremely 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.510
 nomadic to wear 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.670
 evening 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.819
 saleh 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:04.010
 for the quality there in the big m 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.870
 the bone is nomadic 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.350
 da product that is a reader who must 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.140
 to be wandered on Tuesday 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.180
 and so we are less than 180 euros with 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.040
 the cover today we are sure 79 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.470
 maybe a little bit less to 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.310
 finalize and a true and abusive and 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.530
 to add 2 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.090

 bragelonne lend his memories Walloon 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.980
