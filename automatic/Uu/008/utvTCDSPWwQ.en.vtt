00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
so what you saw there is dust 514 and

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.649 
so what you saw there is dust 514 and
it's<00:01:33.930> developed<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.890> consoles<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.479> is

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
it's developed for consoles so this is

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's developed for consoles so this is
basically<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.289> take<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.039> a<00:01:38.100> console<00:01:38.610> em<00:01:38.789> home

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
basically our take on a console em home

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.690 
basically our take on a console em home
so<00:01:39.750> stead<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.289> doing<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.250> milliner

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so stead of doing like a milliner

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.850 
so stead of doing like a milliner
consoles<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.719> looked<00:01:42.929> hard<00:01:43.259> at<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.619> people

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
consoles we looked hard at what people

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.819 
consoles we looked hard at what people
want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> do<00:01:44.399> with<00:01:45.119> her<00:01:45.270> other<00:01:46.020> pain<00:01:46.470> relievers

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
want to do with her other pain relievers

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.510 
want to do with her other pain relievers
staying<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.850> there<00:01:48.030> t0<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.319> we<00:01:50.280> thought<00:01:50.460> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
staying in there t0 and we thought of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.719 
staying in there t0 and we thought of
doing<00:01:50.789> like<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> special<00:01:52.200> name<00:01:52.439> experience<00:01:53.159> for

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
doing like a special name experience for

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.169 
doing like a special name experience for
that<00:01:53.909> platform<00:01:54.590> sending<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> IP<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.610> then

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
that platform sending the IP and then

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.020 
that platform sending the IP and then
connecting<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.990> with<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.289> I'm<00:01:59.250> going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.700> talk

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
connecting it with it I'm going to talk

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.449 
connecting it with it I'm going to talk
a<00:02:00.060> little<00:02:00.240> about<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.869> later<00:02:01.289> but<00:02:02.009> dust

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
a little about that later but dust

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.120 
a little about that later but dust
itself<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.599> this<00:02:03.840> awesome<00:02:04.170> first<00:02:04.530> milk<00:02:04.799> sugar

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
new technology enhancement into the eip

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.210 
new technology enhancement into the eip
where<00:02:27.209> people<00:02:27.660> no<00:02:27.810> longer<00:02:27.930> have<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.349> be<00:02:28.470> pilots

where people no longer have to be pilots

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.090 
where people no longer have to be pilots
able<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.849> be<00:02:30.090> close<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:31.200> these<00:02:31.380> are<00:02:31.739> soldiers

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
able to be close so these are soldiers

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.750

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.120 
dust 514 with a lot of strategic
elements<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.829> employ<00:02:59.100> various<00:02:59.190> with

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130

when he will be able to control the
planet<00:04:02.620> and<00:04:02.769> therefore<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.790> solar<00:04:04.120> system

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
planet and therefore the solar system

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.910 
planet and therefore the solar system
and

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.089

for the constellation and the region

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.729 
for the constellation and the region
easily<00:04:08.099> how<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.340> fight<00:04:09.120> with<00:04:09.480> your<00:04:09.780> fleet<00:04:10.110> but

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
easily how to fight with your fleet but

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.470 
easily how to fight with your fleet but
you<00:04:10.830> will<00:04:10.950> also<00:04:11.099> have<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.430> contract<00:04:11.970> people

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
you will also have a contract people

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.260 
you will also have a contract people
that<00:04:12.660> lenders<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.800> consult<00:04:14.280> animal<00:04:14.760> which

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
that lenders the consult animal which

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.270 
that lenders the consult animal which
then<00:04:15.510> feeds<00:04:15.780> into<00:04:16.230> the<00:04:16.500> sovereign<00:04:16.709> control

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
then feeds into the sovereign control

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.750 
then feeds into the sovereign control
system<00:04:17.820> okay<00:04:18.030> then<00:04:18.600> if<00:04:18.930> its<00:04:19.200> value<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:20.010> get

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
system okay then if its value that get

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.909 
system okay then if its value that get
by<00:04:21.359> funding<00:04:22.730> mercenaries<00:04:23.730> given<00:04:24.389> them<00:04:24.540> both

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
by funding mercenaries given them both

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.110 
by funding mercenaries given them both
etc<00:04:25.919> so<00:04:26.370> it's<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:26.669> very<00:04:28.850> introduces<00:04:29.850> and

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
etc so it's a very introduces and

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.000 
etc so it's a very introduces and
especially<00:04:30.450> when<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.930> bring<00:04:31.200> these<00:04:31.470> two

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
especially when you bring these two

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.570 
especially when you bring these two
communities<00:04:32.880> together<00:04:33.030> where<00:04:33.870> they<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:34.139> the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
communities together where they have the

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.129 
communities together where they have the
aircraft<00:04:35.580> and<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:35.880> pc<00:04:36.210> animal<00:04:36.630> crowd<00:04:36.870> and

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
aircraft and the pc animal crowd and

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.070 
aircraft and the pc animal crowd and
there's<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.130> way<00:04:38.669> estimates<00:04:39.300> these<00:04:39.570> two

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
there's a way estimates these two

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.020 
there's a way estimates these two
communities<00:04:40.710> were<00:04:40.889> open<00:04:41.250> developer<00:04:41.880> behind

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
communities were open developer behind

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.659 
communities were open developer behind
that<00:04:42.870> will<00:04:42.990> probably<00:04:43.229> start<00:04:43.919> by<00:04:44.430> having

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
that will probably start by having

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.110 
that will probably start by having

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
so that you have a Mayan system

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.350 
so that you have a Mayan system
specifically<00:05:00.870> formed<00:05:01.729> control<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.880> part<00:05:03.210> of
