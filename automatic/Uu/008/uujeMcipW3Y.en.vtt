subtracting<00:00:03.959> across<00:00:04.259> zeros<00:00:05.000> when<00:00:06.000> I'm

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
subtracting across zeros when I'm

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.540 
subtracting across zeros when I'm
subtracting<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:07.170> any<00:00:07.500> problem<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:08.250> always

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
subtracting in any problem I always

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
subtracting in any problem I always
start<00:00:08.940> with<00:00:09.000> my<00:00:09.210> lowest<00:00:09.630> place<00:00:09.900> value<00:00:10.380> in<00:00:10.620> this

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
start with my lowest place value in this

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.250 
start with my lowest place value in this
case<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.330> ones<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.110> my<00:00:13.799> lowest<00:00:14.040> place<00:00:14.429> value<00:00:14.910> I

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
case the ones is my lowest place value I

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.269 
case the ones is my lowest place value I
can't<00:00:16.260> take<00:00:16.529> six<00:00:16.859> away<00:00:17.760> from<00:00:18.000> zero<00:00:19.010> so<00:00:20.010> I'm

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
can't take six away from zero so I'm

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.349 
can't take six away from zero so I'm
going<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> go<00:00:21.180> try<00:00:21.240> an<00:00:21.660> ungroup<00:00:22.170> next<00:00:22.830> door

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
going to go try an ungroup next door

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.250 
going to go try an ungroup next door
there's<00:00:24.359> nothing<00:00:24.810> there

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
there's nothing there

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.070 
there's nothing there
in<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> tens<00:00:25.859> place<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.430> have<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> zero<00:00:27.050> that<00:00:28.050> I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
in the tens place we have a zero that I

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.800 
in the tens place we have a zero that I
can't<00:00:28.500> ungroup<00:00:28.920> from<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.279> tens<00:00:29.519> place<00:00:29.810> now

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can't ungroup from the tens place now

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.200 
can't ungroup from the tens place now
let's<00:00:31.050> go<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.529> hundreds<00:00:32.369> place<00:00:32.460> up

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
let's go to the hundreds place up

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.870 
let's go to the hundreds place up
there's<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> zero<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> still<00:00:35.399> can't<00:00:35.700> do

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
there's a zero there I still can't do

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.869 
there's a zero there I still can't do
anything<00:00:36.680> let<00:00:37.680> me<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.280> thousands

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
anything let me go to the thousands

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.100 
anything let me go to the thousands
place<00:00:38.969> there's<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:39.960> seven<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:41.370> ungroup<00:00:42.110> I'll

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
place there's a seven I can ungroup I'll

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.069 
place there's a seven I can ungroup I'll
cross<00:00:43.649> out<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.129> seven<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.420> will<00:00:45.570> become<00:00:45.899> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
cross out the seven and it will become a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.610 
cross out the seven and it will become a
six<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:47.180> going<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.300> take<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.469> those

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
six I'm going to take one of those

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.310 
six I'm going to take one of those
groups<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.730> thousands<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.570> I'm<00:00:52.020> going

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
groups from the thousands and I'm going

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.850 
groups from the thousands and I'm going
to<00:00:52.379> add<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.399> hundreds<00:00:53.850> place<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.829> now<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to add it to the hundreds place so now I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.540 
to add it to the hundreds place so now I
have<00:00:56.250> ten<00:00:56.670> in<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.690> hundreds<00:00:58.170> place<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have ten in the hundreds place but that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.430 
have ten in the hundreds place but that
still<00:01:00.030> didn't<00:01:00.329> help<00:01:00.600> me<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> ones<00:01:01.260> place

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
still didn't help me in the ones place

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.509 
still didn't help me in the ones place
so<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.609> gonna<00:01:02.820> cross<00:01:03.210> off<00:01:03.480> my<00:01:03.510> ten<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.519> I'm

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so I'm gonna cross off my ten and I'm

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
so I'm gonna cross off my ten and I'm
going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.000> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> nine<00:01:07.130> I'm<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
going to make it a nine I'm going to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
going to make it a nine I'm going to
take<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.850> one<00:01:09.150> group<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.869> hundreds

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
take that one group from the hundreds

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.740 
take that one group from the hundreds
place<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:10.920> bring<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> over<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.450> tens

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
place and bring it over to the tens

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.990 
place and bring it over to the tens
place<00:01:14.090> now<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.509> ten<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.229> tens<00:01:16.500> place

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
place now I have ten in the tens place

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.999 
place now I have ten in the tens place
but<00:01:18.000> again<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.900> still<00:01:19.290> did<00:01:19.470> not<00:01:19.590> help<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
but again that still did not help me in

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.580 
but again that still did not help me in
the<00:01:20.189> ones<00:01:20.400> place<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.600> must<00:01:21.900> cross<00:01:22.140> off<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the ones place so I must cross off the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.480 
the ones place so I must cross off the
ten<00:01:23.210> make<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> nine<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.340> take

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
ten make it a nine and I'm going to take

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
ten make it a nine and I'm going to take
that<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.909> group<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.680> create<00:01:28.680> 10<00:01:29.310> in<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.939> ones

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
that one group and create 10 in the ones

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.010 
that one group and create 10 in the ones
place<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.430> take<00:01:32.610> away<00:01:32.759> six<00:01:33.210> from<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
place now I can take away six from the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.969 
place now I can take away six from the
number<00:01:34.409> ten<00:01:35.329> ten<00:01:36.329> minus<00:01:37.049> six<00:01:37.259> equals<00:01:37.850> 4<00:01:39.979> then

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
number ten ten minus six equals 4 then

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.670
