 Hello everyone, on the eve of the holiday 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.480
 March 8, we will examine the songs of Eugene aspen 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:13.799
 March 8 in the key of A minor and 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.500
 tonality native g minor 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.619
 I raised higher on tanchik will be easier 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.380
 play virtually no bars and so 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.510
 let's play the intro verse chorus and i 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.510
 tell you what to play went 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.340
 opa opapa 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.340
 anapa 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 but 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.770
 avatar 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.800
 and water 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.800
 but 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.320
 but 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.640
 and dad 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.650
 abaza 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:09.530
 he 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:13.380
 how I loved you I know all the guys like 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.899
 you walked zopo c2 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:23.100
 and then it will all be you somewhere here 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:27.950
 through walks in Moscow 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.759
 and all of which claimed the scudo 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.759
 and learned to walk night in a dream 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:52.850
 so let's take the fight to play it so I 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 slowly show ira to me from above 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:02.300
 down the stub two times to the top then 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.300
 and out stub 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.690
 and last hit up 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.709
 when we play up we do not play in all 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.329
 the strings we play about four 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.390
 lower 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:22.939
 no need to play up will be a lot of dirt 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.939
 when we don't play we play for all the strings 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.819
 and also depending all the strings we 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.829
 play a chord if a minor 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.909
 preferably without 6 strings and if ram nur 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:37.879
 preferably without the fifth and sixth strings 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.859
 there will be a lot of dirt again 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.280
 you see, you just need four lower ones 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.650
 but on such a plan about the city 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.620
 Now there is such a plan chords in E Major and 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.769
 sol fa 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.769
 played on all strings here in C major 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.470
 You can also play all the strings well 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:04.349
 possible 6 preferably preferably higher 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.840
 without 6 although it does not interfere here 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.030
 chords i signed basically nothing 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.560
 there is nothing difficult to tell 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.329
 try it for sure 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.329
 thank you all bye
