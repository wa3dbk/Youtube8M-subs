pasta is a great medium for its

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.410 
pasta is a great medium for its
versatility<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:29.190> paint<00:00:29.850> it<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.120> several

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
versatility you can paint it on several

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.680 
versatility you can paint it on several
several<00:00:31.110> supports<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:32.010> a<00:00:32.370> lot<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.330> different

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
several supports and a lot of different

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.390 
several supports and a lot of different
things<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.350> it

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
things with it

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.970 
things with it
the<00:00:35.640> reason<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.090> really<00:00:36.360> like<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.990> because<00:00:37.230> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
the reason I really like it is because I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.610 
the reason I really like it is because I
can<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:39.150> it<00:00:39.420> with<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.750> underpainting<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
can use it with an underpainting of

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.150 
can use it with an underpainting of
watercolor<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.309> acrylic<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.350> rub<00:00:43.830> it<00:00:43.860> off

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
watercolor or acrylic you can rub it off

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
watercolor or acrylic you can rub it off
or<00:00:44.370> brush<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.640> off<00:00:44.970> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.390> wet<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.989> start

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
or brush it off you can wet it and start

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
or brush it off you can wet it and start
working<00:00:46.770> again<00:00:46.890> there's<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.030> sorts<00:00:48.480> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
working again there's all sorts of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.810 
working again there's all sorts of
things<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.400> really

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
things you can do with it it's a really

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.090 
things you can do with it it's a really
is<00:00:50.970> a<00:00:51.000> marvelous<00:00:51.510> medium<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.140> experimenting

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
is a marvelous medium for experimenting

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.640 
is a marvelous medium for experimenting
and<00:00:53.309> sort<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.520> messing<00:00:53.970> about<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> end<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:55.650 
and sort of messing about at the end is

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.170 
and sort of messing about at the end is
you<00:00:55.860> might<00:00:56.070> get<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:56.880> interesting

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
you might get a really interesting

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.050 
you might get a really interesting
painting<00:00:57.870> or<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.500> might<00:00:58.890> just<00:00:59.130> not<00:00:59.790> it

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
painting or you might just not it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.880 
painting or you might just not it
doesn't<00:01:00.360> really<00:01:00.510> matter<00:01:00.810> it's<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> sort<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
doesn't really matter it's the sort of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
doesn't really matter it's the sort of
experimentation<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.780> medium<00:01:04.140> that's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
experimentation with the medium that's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.520 
experimentation with the medium that's
important<00:01:08.509> I've<00:01:09.509> had<00:01:09.690> a<00:01:09.720> good<00:01:09.930> look<00:01:10.050> at<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
important I've had a good look at it and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.520 
important I've had a good look at it and
I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.910> needs<00:01:11.940> pulling<00:01:12.540> together<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.140> bit

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
I think it needs pulling together a bit

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
I think it needs pulling together a bit
and<00:01:13.800> one<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.340> ways<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
and one of the ways I do this is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.070 
and one of the ways I do this is
actually<00:01:16.259> by<00:01:16.649> dropping<00:01:17.220> pure<00:01:18.180> water<00:01:18.509> over

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
actually by dropping pure water over

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.160 
actually by dropping pure water over
some<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> past<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.360> has<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.570> effect

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
some of the past or which has the effect

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100 
some of the past or which has the effect
of<00:01:22.850> turning<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.060> Pastore<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.600> into<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.899> sort

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of turning the Pastore back into a sort

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.680 
of turning the Pastore back into a sort
of<00:01:25.200> solid<00:01:25.440> pigment<00:01:26.100> rather<00:01:26.760> like<00:01:27.120> gouache

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
of solid pigment rather like gouache

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.840 
of solid pigment rather like gouache
really<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.830> does<00:01:29.040> tend<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.430> knit<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
really but it does tend to knit the

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
really but it does tend to knit the
whole<00:01:30.030> thing<00:01:30.330> together<00:01:31.130> one<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.280> problems

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
whole thing together one of the problems

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.640 
whole thing together one of the problems
with<00:01:32.790> pastel<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.360> implicitly<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.110> find<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.620> that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
with pastel is implicitly I find is that

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800 
with pastel is implicitly I find is that
it<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.190> become<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.479> disjointed

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it can become a little bit disjointed

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.770 
it can become a little bit disjointed
probably<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.010> you're<00:01:38.159> trying<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.460> mix

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
probably because you're trying to mix

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.140 
probably because you're trying to mix
the<00:01:39.780> colors<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.320> certain<00:01:40.619> extent<00:01:40.979> on<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.520> on

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the colors to a certain extent on the on

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.350 
the colors to a certain extent on the on
the<00:01:42.420> paper<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:43.049> support<00:01:43.909> rather<00:01:44.909> than<00:01:45.119> sort<00:01:45.299> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
the paper or support rather than sort of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
the paper or support rather than sort of
mixing<00:01:45.659> them<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.900> palette<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.680> by<00:01:46.890> doing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
mixing them in a palette so by doing

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.260 
mixing them in a palette so by doing
this<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.770> knocks<00:01:50.460> everything<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.240> a

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
this it just knocks everything back a

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.020 
this it just knocks everything back a
few<00:01:51.600> tones<00:01:51.990> which<00:01:52.350> very<00:01:52.680> often<00:01:53.189> has<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
few tones which very often has the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.640 
few tones which very often has the
effect<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.750> pulling<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.830> thing<00:01:56.010> together

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
effect of pulling the thing together

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:06.100 
effect of pulling the thing together
I<00:02:03.460> like<00:02:04.460> this<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:04.850> quite<00:02:05.060> effective<00:02:05.210> from

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
I like this it's quite effective from

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.850 
I like this it's quite effective from
just<00:02:06.980> picking<00:02:07.370> out<00:02:07.520> certain<00:02:08.619> shapes<00:02:09.619> and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
just picking out certain shapes and

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.240 
just picking out certain shapes and
drawing<00:02:10.250> around<00:02:10.430> them<00:02:11.770> drawing<00:02:12.770> around<00:02:12.890> them

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
drawing around them drawing around them

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.800 
drawing around them drawing around them
completely<00:02:13.640> about<00:02:13.970> leaving<00:02:14.360> sort<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.630> lost

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
completely about leaving sort of lost

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:22.360 
completely about leaving sort of lost
and<00:02:15.020> found<00:02:15.320> edges<00:02:19.840> just<00:02:21.010> doing<00:02:22.010> really<00:02:22.190> what

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
and found edges just doing really what

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.350 
and found edges just doing really what
takes<00:02:22.550> your<00:02:22.790> fancy<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:24.910> think<00:02:25.910> it's<00:02:26.060> got<00:02:26.240> to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
takes your fancy I think it's got to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.420 
takes your fancy I think it's got to
quite<00:02:26.570> an<00:02:26.690> interesting<00:02:26.930> stage<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:27.860> so<00:02:27.890> I

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
quite an interesting stage now so I

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.550 
quite an interesting stage now so I
don't<00:02:28.790> do<00:02:28.970> many<00:02:29.120> still<00:02:29.510> lifes<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.410> quite

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
don't do many still lifes so it's quite

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.690 
don't do many still lifes so it's quite
an<00:02:30.740> adventure<00:02:31.250> really<00:02:36.160> as<00:02:37.160> you<00:02:37.280> can<00:02:37.400> see<00:02:37.580> I've

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
an adventure really as you can see I've

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.610 
an adventure really as you can see I've
completed<00:02:38.300> all<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.540> watercolor<00:02:38.990> washes<00:02:39.230> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
completed all the watercolor washes and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.010 
completed all the watercolor washes and
it<00:02:39.740> was<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.890> very<00:02:40.520> exciting<00:02:41.000> process<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.720> doing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
it was a very exciting process in doing

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.250 
it was a very exciting process in doing
that<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:43.370> I've<00:02:43.790> got<00:02:43.940> some<00:02:44.090> nice<00:02:44.330> fluid<00:02:44.720> washes

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that and I've got some nice fluid washes

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.460 
that and I've got some nice fluid washes
now<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:47.150> next<00:02:47.390> stage<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.840> to<00:02:48.020> start

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
now and the next stage is to start

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.790 
now and the next stage is to start
putting<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.860> passed<00:02:49.100> along<00:02:49.490> so<00:02:50.470> here<00:02:51.470> we<00:02:51.590> go

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
putting the passed along so here we go

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.490 
putting the passed along so here we go
just<00:02:52.240> select<00:02:53.240> a<00:02:53.360> few<00:02:53.570> colors<00:02:53.990> from<00:02:54.260> the

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
just select a few colors from the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
just select a few colors from the
various<00:02:55.010> boxes<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:59.590> start<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.740> process<00:03:00.950> I

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
various boxes and start the process I

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.140 
various boxes and start the process I
think<00:03:02.060> we<00:03:02.300> can<00:03:02.450> get<00:03:02.600> some<00:03:03.700> touches<00:03:04.700> of<00:03:04.730> color

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
think we can get some touches of color

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.460 
think we can get some touches of color
in<00:03:05.360> maybe<00:03:05.600> in<00:03:05.840> this<00:03:06.850> shop<00:03:07.850> warning<00:03:08.450> for<00:03:09.320> the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
in maybe in this shop warning for the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.190 
in maybe in this shop warning for the
color<00:03:10.060> just<00:03:11.060> putting<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.630> in<00:03:11.780> again<00:03:12.050> with

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
color just putting it out in again with

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:20.110 
color just putting it out in again with
the<00:03:12.290> side<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.769> past<00:03:13.010> or<00:03:18.820> well<00:03:19.820> I<00:03:19.850> think

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
the side of the past or well I think

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.340 
the side of the past or well I think
that's<00:03:20.390> about<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.780> really

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
that's about it really

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.440 
that's about it really
I<00:03:21.860> could<00:03:22.370> go<00:03:22.519> on<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.790> do<00:03:22.910> more<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.300> great

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
I could go on and do more the great

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.820 
I could go on and do more the great
thing<00:03:23.600> about<00:03:23.690> past<00:03:24.110> two<00:03:24.260> days<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.500> can<00:03:24.650> come

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
thing about past two days I can come

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.620 
thing about past two days I can come
back<00:03:24.980> again<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:25.310> look<00:03:25.640> at<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.970> tomorrow<00:03:26.360> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
back again and look at that tomorrow and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.420 
back again and look at that tomorrow and
perhaps<00:03:26.989> find<00:03:27.260> something<00:03:27.650> else<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.950> do<00:03:28.130> on<00:03:28.280> it

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
perhaps find something else to do on it

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:41.310 
perhaps find something else to do on it
but<00:03:28.850> for<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> moment<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.570> think<00:03:29.660> that's<00:03:30.110> in

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.270 

it's<00:03:42.320> just<00:03:42.530> a<00:03:42.620> question<00:03:42.770> really<00:03:43.220> of<00:03:44.260> working

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
it's just a question really of working

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.760 
it's just a question really of working
in<00:03:46.280> an<00:03:46.430> experimental<00:03:47.300> way<00:03:47.540> trying<00:03:48.500> different

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
in an experimental way trying different

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.510 
in an experimental way trying different
techniques<00:03:49.220> and<00:03:50.410> seeing<00:03:51.410> what<00:03:51.560> happens<00:03:51.950> if

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
techniques and seeing what happens if

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.430 
techniques and seeing what happens if
you<00:03:52.730> adopt<00:03:53.360> this<00:03:53.450> approach<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:54.020> can<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.380> an

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
you adopt this approach it can be an

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.610 
you adopt this approach it can be an
extremely<00:03:54.740> rewarding<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:56.240> exciting<00:03:56.750> way<00:03:57.440> of

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
extremely rewarding and exciting way of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.690 
extremely rewarding and exciting way of
working<00:03:57.860> so<00:03:58.520> have<00:03:59.180> a<00:03:59.210> go
