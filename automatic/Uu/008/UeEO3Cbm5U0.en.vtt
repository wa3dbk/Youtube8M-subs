00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:11.200
 Burton's 2016 New Model 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:16.330
 I'd like to introduce you to skip jack 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:21.850
 It is this model, but length is 152, too 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:27.150
 It's aspirator Kedomo I can see and get a look suddenly at this video 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.150
 It moves in detail and quite click 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:36.790
 In change the nickname from next season but is sputum call me s locker until last year 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.190
 Is it a directional camber ? 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:49.590
 Well s locker You have a locker on the nose and camber board 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.590
 Because it is a base camber board, pressed snow also cuts off carving properly 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:58.010
 this day is 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.600
 New snow is about 5 cm to 10 cm 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.870
 It was feeling but 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.390
 It will move quickly in the tree 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.890
 I have no third here 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.570
 It was quite crowded with trees though 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.000
 The operability also moved without problems at all 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.140
 Kew 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.730
 Kew 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.180
 Hey do you say I felt 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.740
 Quite 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.740
 It will move quickly 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:39.119
 Tail It is a short type Te 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.780
 fx was pretty soft too, but it runs well without heavy rundown even with heavy snowfall 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.780
 Gave me 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:54.590
 The tail is 20 mm taper afterward, and the tail becomes thinner. 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.590
 I think that to go further is also a kind 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.600
 It will be the next season 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.810
 Please see the explanatory note below the video for details. Thank you
