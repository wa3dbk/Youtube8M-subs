00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
even if you know if it's already

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.240 
even if you know if it's already
experienced<00:02:42.790> once<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.510> mean<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.709> a<00:02:44.770> small<00:02:45.040> map

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
experienced once I mean it's a small map

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.979 
experienced once I mean it's a small map
so<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.550> experience<00:02:45.910> won't<00:02:46.000> be<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.870> know

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
so the experience won't be that you know

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.390 
so the experience won't be that you know
that<00:02:47.380> different<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:47.980> think<00:02:48.160> it's<00:02:48.280> more

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
that different and I think it's more

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.680 
that different and I think it's more
exciting<00:02:48.790> with<00:02:48.850> other<00:02:49.000> players<00:02:49.239> even<00:02:49.570> though

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
exciting with other players even though

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.630 
exciting with other players even though
like<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.590> could<00:02:50.739> see<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.160> there<00:02:51.459> was<00:02:51.580> a
