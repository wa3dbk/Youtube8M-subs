00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.789
 hello how about here Ã¡lex in minecraft 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.529
 version 1.3 point 2 with a new mode 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.410
 that makes our world of 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.029
 minecraft in a world full of cubes and 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.400
 of mails but Ã¡lex the pot has gone away 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.489
 or that if minecraft is already a world of 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.020
 cubes yes but this makes it a 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:35.210
 world of cubes literally 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:39.710
 your world will be composed of 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.540
 these cubes here that are songs and each 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.140
 one of these crashes will have a biome 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.750
 different and according to good you can see that 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.920
 they are surrounded by glass and such 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:55.130
 and nothing happens because of the height and you can 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.830
 have ocean biomes in the layer more 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.579
 go down to the high garze layer, so 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:03.190
 they are well distributed 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.839
 and for example that more we see we have 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.899
 because here we have desert forest 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:12.220
 ocean up here we have one of 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:14.880
 minerals if a biome of minerals look 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 it seems there are two mixed 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.040
 also because everything in charge a 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.500
 bit 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.020
 if you do not have a computer more or less 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 good 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.310
 you can pass what to me 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.050
 but good 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.050
 yes 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.549
 I spent gold surely there is something of 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.549
 diamond over here blue 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.720
 even if it is not seen, it must be inside the 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.770
 Diamond 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.770
 obviously there we are 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.300
 with these cubes of minerals 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.920
 simply they hold minerals and 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.110
 little stone to distribute the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 minerals but good 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.980
 even the creator of the map is creating 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.770
 fungi biome cubes recipes 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.340
 you arrived 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.580
 of villages biomes of caves so 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.569
 set for the 1.3 point two are 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.629
 very young this mod 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.519
 and a little more I only have one little thing left 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.920
 teach you that I'm going to teach you in a 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.079
 moment and in the I come I will teach them 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.680
 I just created this neder portal and we're going 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:33.760
 to see how the leader's language is 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760
 this mod 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.340
 because you have patience to carry and I have 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.860
 said so little in loading about everything 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.460
 when Alberto the map has taken 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.460
 quite 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.930
 well here we are perfect 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.220
 obviously what he does is convert 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:03:00.250
 the world of mnr in a world full of 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.400
 glass cube rushes 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.200
 yes sir and we also have different 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.330
 types of cubes for example here we have 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.350
 a sea of lava and it seems that they have 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.220
 joined several simply one giant 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.940
 they are pretty big 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.580
 here we have a normal soul salt 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.500
 sam 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.980
 zombie the party has a lot of 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.980
 they dance 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.319
 good 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.829
 let's see if I find others even though I want 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.829
 teach 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.270
 I do not know where I can read one because I eat 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.380
 I have this here to the minimum we go extreme 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.380
 super luck 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.620
 and there is another other chong 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.239
 this 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.239
 the stone is normal 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.530
 good will be a challenge for you 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.130
 a survival map with this mount 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:14.230
 because what such move from Cuba 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.430
 of list if you do not go with the creative has 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.430
 to be super crappy 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.120
 look at one of gladstone 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 what happened 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.500
 once loustau 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.830
 there is my portal 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.080
 another sauce 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.770
 well I'm going to that meeting the show that 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.630
 I'm looking for and I'm good at the end 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.710
 I could find the chon I was looking for 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.530
 it was simply 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.130
 a dungeon of the level in a 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.040
 chunk yes I've seen them I 've seen two what 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:56.310
 I swear they exist but you will not find it that way 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:00.820
 that we can teach it and nothing else 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:02.230
 this is the mod the world 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.750
 and nothing I hope you liked the 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.730
