00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.090 
didn't do a haul this year just because
I<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:18.150> didn't<00:03:18.390> buy<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.600> lot<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.110> things<00:03:19.320> most

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.680 
I I just didn't buy a lot of things most
of<00:03:20.220> them<00:03:20.370> are<00:03:20.430> for<00:03:20.610> my<00:03:20.700> parents<00:03:21.090> anyways<00:03:21.450> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
of them are for my parents anyways and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.750 
of them are for my parents anyways and
so<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.110> didn't<00:03:22.650> want<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.830> like<00:03:22.950> show<00:03:23.190> them<00:03:23.430> what

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
so I didn't want to like show them what

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.220 
so I didn't want to like show them what
I<00:03:23.790> got<00:03:24.000> them<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:24.480> they<00:03:24.630> watch<00:03:24.810> our<00:03:24.930> videos

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
I got them because they watch our videos

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.040 
I got them because they watch our videos
