brought a lot of clarity into what it is
that<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.720> was<00:01:52.810> doing<00:01:53.079> and<00:01:53.200> again<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.470> was<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.799> was

that I was doing and again I was I was

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.480 
that I was doing and again I was I was
living<00:01:54.880> my<00:01:55.149> dream<00:01:55.750> but<00:01:56.350> when<00:01:56.619> you're<00:01:57.130> faced

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
with death or when it comes that close I

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.490 
with death or when it comes that close I
think<00:02:00.670> there's<00:02:01.179> always<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.630> reexamination

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
think there's always this reexamination

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.620 
think there's always this reexamination
that<00:02:02.649> goes<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:03.039> and<00:02:03.369> after<00:02:03.909> I'd<00:02:04.270> sort<00:02:04.600> of

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
that goes on and after I'd sort of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.289 
that goes on and after I'd sort of
evaluated<00:02:05.289> all<00:02:05.470> those<00:02:06.030> experiences<00:02:07.030> I

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
evaluated all those experiences I

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.449 
evaluated all those experiences I
started<00:02:08.170> realizing<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.890> they<00:02:09.429> were

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
started realizing that they were

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.670 
started realizing that they were
becoming<00:02:09.729> less<00:02:10.030> important<00:02:10.630> to<00:02:10.690> me<00:02:10.780> because<00:02:11.110> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
becoming less important to me because it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.100 
becoming less important to me because it
really<00:02:12.010> didn't<00:02:12.370> signify<00:02:12.880> me<00:02:13.299> making<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.840> larger

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
really didn't signify me making a larger

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.860 
really didn't signify me making a larger
impact<00:02:14.260> on<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.830> world<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.390> this<00:02:16.390> was<00:02:16.599> a<00:02:16.630> great

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
impact on the world and this was a great

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.640 
impact on the world and this was a great
reason<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.349> was<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> catapult<00:02:17.980> to<00:02:18.870> kick<00:02:19.870> me<00:02:20.140> into

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
reason it was a catapult to kick me into

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.460 
reason it was a catapult to kick me into
gear<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.069> pursue<00:02:21.370> this<00:02:22.060> new<00:02:22.480> new<00:02:23.140> set<00:02:23.380> of

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.960 
get information it was a very closed
environment<00:02:32.560> so<00:02:32.980> I<00:02:33.010> wanted<00:02:33.519> to<00:02:33.640> flip<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:33.910> on

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
environment so I wanted to flip that on

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.849 
environment so I wanted to flip that on
its<00:02:34.060> head<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.540> be<00:02:34.780> giving<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.290> information

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
its head and be giving that information

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.860 
its head and be giving that information
away<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.220> free<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.609> in<00:02:36.700> doing<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.630> turned

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
away for free and in doing so it turned

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.000 
away for free and in doing so it turned
out<00:02:37.930> that<00:02:38.079> there<00:02:38.200> was<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.350> lot<00:02:38.470> of<00:02:38.590> people<00:02:38.829> that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
out that there was a lot of people that

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.610
