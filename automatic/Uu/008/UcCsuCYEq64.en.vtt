already<00:01:57.869> I'm<00:01:58.170> sure<00:01:58.729> link<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:00.960> can't

already I'm sure link but they can't

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
already I'm sure link but they can't
possibly<00:02:01.499> be<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> visible<00:02:02.399> difference<00:02:02.609> at<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
possibly be a visible difference at this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.410 
possibly be a visible difference at this
stage<00:02:03.270> they<00:02:03.450> can't<00:02:03.689> be<00:02:03.869> because<00:02:04.079> that

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
stage they can't be because that

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.100 
stage they can't be because that
not<00:02:05.200> real<00:02:05.439> but<00:02:05.890> it<00:02:06.159> certainly<00:02:06.850> feels<00:02:07.689> better

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
not real but it certainly feels better

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.710 
not real but it certainly feels better
it'll<00:02:08.920> take<00:02:09.220> about<00:02:09.340> 12<00:02:09.759> weeks<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.239> see<00:02:10.420> any

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
it'll take about 12 weeks to see any

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.220 
it'll take about 12 weeks to see any
results<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.640> can't<00:02:13.450> wait<00:02:13.569> for<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.810> 12<00:02:14.020> weeks

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
results so I can't wait for the 12 weeks

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.520 
results so I can't wait for the 12 weeks
to<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.530> over<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.010> I'll<00:02:15.099> see<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.370> then
