00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.670
 invest in a magazine or you will see the difference in taste 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.740
 125 grams of flour against 125 grams of sugar sarrazin butter 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:31.890

 other 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 while the German idea is divided by an electric mixer 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.149
