stage<00:02:02.579> where<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.810> was<00:02:04.110> quite<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.710> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
stage where it was quite a bit of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.170 
stage where it was quite a bit of
finesse<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> point<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.850> think<00:02:05.880> where<00:02:06.119> he

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
finesse up to the point I think where he

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.120 
finesse up to the point I think where he
want<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.450> man<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.750> Gronk

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
want this man is Gronk

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.040 
want this man is Gronk
and<00:02:07.729> after<00:02:07.969> that<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.420> never<00:02:08.630> saw<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.050> again<00:02:09.170> and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
and after that I never saw it again and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.250 
and after that I never saw it again and
I<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.560> he<00:02:12.650> seems<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.099> have<00:02:13.270> gone<00:02:14.270> back<00:02:15.200> a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I think he seems to have gone back a

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.199 
I think he seems to have gone back a
little<00:02:15.530> bit<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:15.739> terms<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.040> how<00:02:16.099> charges<00:02:16.790> it's

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
little bit in terms of how charges it's

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.030 
little bit in terms of how charges it's
very<00:02:17.390> very<00:02:17.599> fast<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.050> needs<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.739> be<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.890> bit

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
very very fast but needs to be a bit

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.280 
very very fast but needs to be a bit
delicate<00:02:19.190> grows<00:02:20.000> on<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:20.690> mean<00:02:20.840> he's<00:02:20.930> become

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
delicate grows on you mean he's become

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.080 
delicate grows on you mean he's become
too<00:02:21.530> much<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.950> hard<00:02:22.099> charger<00:02:22.489> yeah<00:02:22.700> I'm<00:02:22.940> not

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
too much of a hard charger yeah I'm not

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.540 
too much of a hard charger yeah I'm not
enough<00:02:23.360> of<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.750> delicate<00:02:24.319> yeah<00:02:24.950> exactly<00:02:25.130> some

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
enough of a delicate yeah exactly some

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.360 
enough of a delicate yeah exactly some
of<00:02:25.580> those<00:02:25.670> bits<00:02:25.940> worth<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.720> boat<00:02:27.410> s<00:02:27.650> stuck

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
of those bits worth like boat s stuck

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
of those bits worth like boat s stuck
with<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.849> all<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.450> style<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:29.989> the<00:02:30.140> way

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
with that all that style all the way

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.710 
with that all that style all the way
through<00:02:30.530> or<00:02:30.769> he's<00:02:30.920> sticking<00:02:31.340> with<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
through or he's sticking with it and

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.589 
through or he's sticking with it and
yeah<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.170> i<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:34.069> overtook<00:02:34.819> him<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.239> the

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
yeah and and i think overtook him as the

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.059 
yeah and and i think overtook him as the
season<00:02:36.080> went<00:02:36.230> by<00:02:36.380> and<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.860> more

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
season went by and it was more

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.780 
season went by and it was more
successful<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> interesting<00:02:40.489> point<00:02:40.700> is

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
successful and the interesting point is

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.850 
successful and the interesting point is
that<00:02:40.849> Maldonado<00:02:41.630> didn't<00:02:41.989> notice<00:02:42.380> that<00:02:42.590> as

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
that Maldonado didn't notice that as

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.130 
that Maldonado didn't notice that as
boat<00:02:43.099> s<00:02:43.310> was<00:02:43.519> doing<00:02:43.549> it<00:02:43.940> he<00:02:43.970> didn't<00:02:44.330> what<00:02:45.019> he

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
boat s was doing it he didn't what he

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.110 
boat s was doing it he didn't what he
wasn't<00:02:45.290> he<00:02:45.530> didn't<00:02:45.769> look<00:02:45.890> inwards<00:02:46.400> he<00:02:46.819> looked

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
wasn't he didn't look inwards he looked

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.280 
wasn't he didn't look inwards he looked

and I really hope that he it's got

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.140 
and I really hope that he it's got
enough<00:02:54.860> stuff<00:02:55.040> embedded<00:02:55.640> in<00:02:55.760> there<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.000> say

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
in that new environment in which he

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.520 
in that new environment in which he
finds<00:03:08.660> himself<00:03:08.810> because<00:03:09.079> Gregor<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.440> was

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
finds himself because Gregor I was

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.069 
finds himself because Gregor I was
already<00:03:09.769> there<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.340> doing<00:03:10.970> that<00:03:11.120> well<00:03:11.630> he's

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
already there and doing that well he's

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.059 
already there and doing that well he's
gonna<00:03:12.290> run<00:03:12.530> I'm<00:03:12.620> pretty<00:03:12.859> close<00:03:13.100> because

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
gonna run I'm pretty close because

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.099 
gonna run I'm pretty close because
Grosjean<00:03:16.069> went<00:03:16.910> through<00:03:17.180> that<00:03:17.359> phase<00:03:17.630> and

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
Grosjean went through that phase and

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.780 
Grosjean went through that phase and
ended<00:03:18.530> up<00:03:18.680> looking<00:03:19.010> like<00:03:19.220> he<00:03:19.400> had<00:03:19.519> great

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
ended up looking like he had great

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.599 
ended up looking like he had great
finesse<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.510> and<00:03:21.230> was<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.769> driving<00:03:22.430> in<00:03:22.519> a

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
finesse and and was just driving in a

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.479 
finesse and and was just driving in a
fantastically<00:03:23.269> mature<00:03:23.660> way<00:03:23.900> now<00:03:24.500> this<00:03:25.190> season

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
fantastically mature way now this season

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.080 
fantastically mature way now this season
when<00:03:26.299> it's<00:03:26.569> and<00:03:26.720> now<00:03:26.840> I'm<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.170> team<00:03:27.350> leader

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
when it's and now I'm the team leader

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.680 
when it's and now I'm the team leader
and<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:30.560> assuming<00:03:31.340> is<00:03:31.430> going<00:03:31.489> to<00:03:31.790> be<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.269> with

and or assuming is going to be and with

a car that's still not proven and may
work<00:03:35.750> which<00:03:36.739> hope<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.069> does<00:03:37.250> for<00:03:37.519> them<00:03:37.700> but

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
work which hope it does for them but

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.819 
work which hope it does for them but
it's<00:03:38.480> going<00:03:38.750> to<00:03:38.989> probably<00:03:39.170> need<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.470> little<00:03:39.650> bit

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
it's going to probably need a little bit

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.360 
it's going to probably need a little bit
of<00:03:39.920> work<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.870> does<00:03:41.870> he<00:03:42.109> revert<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.769> type<00:03:42.799> do<00:03:43.250> we

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
of work and does he revert to type do we

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.789 
of work and does he revert to type do we

as much about the driving it's going to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.970 
as much about the driving it's going to
be<00:04:09.620> how<00:04:10.220> do<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.880> take<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.900> team<00:04:12.139> with<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.739> and

working and
that's<00:04:16.479> where<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:17.289> need<00:04:17.319> broad<00:04:17.889> shoulders

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
that's where you need broad shoulders

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.210 
that's where you need broad shoulders
you<00:04:18.909> need<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.810> not<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:19.989> say<00:04:20.259> give<00:04:20.829> me<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:21.039> good

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
you need to not just say give me a good

work with the entire team and say look
okay<00:04:27.219> we've<00:04:27.400> got<00:04:27.580> these<00:04:27.729> problems<00:04:28.210> assuming

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
okay we've got these problems assuming

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.330 
okay we've got these problems assuming
that<00:04:29.020> there<00:04:29.169> are<00:04:29.319> and<00:04:29.650> that's<00:04:29.830> an<00:04:30.039> assumption

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
that there are and that's an assumption

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.209 
that there are and that's an assumption
and<00:04:30.849> then<00:04:31.479> say<00:04:31.780> look<00:04:32.020> we<00:04:32.530> can<00:04:32.740> work<00:04:32.979> through

00:04:33.209 --> 00:04:33.219 
and then say look we can work through

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:35.249 
and then say look we can work through
this<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:34.180> you've<00:04:34.389> got<00:04:34.719> to<00:04:34.930> take<00:04:35.110> the

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
this but you've got to take the

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.140 
this but you've got to take the
mechanics<00:04:35.800> with<00:04:35.949> you<00:04:36.069> you've<00:04:36.219> got<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.580> work

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
mechanics with you you've got to work

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.899 
mechanics with you you've got to work
with<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:37.659> engineers<00:04:38.229> you<00:04:38.740> know<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.669> is

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
with the engineers you know and that is

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.159 
with the engineers you know and that is
the<00:04:40.090> measure<00:04:40.300> of<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.509> person<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.080> that's

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
the measure of a person and that's

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.170 
the measure of a person and that's
something<00:04:41.439> that<00:04:41.590> Mary<00:04:42.340> Andretti<00:04:42.729> would<00:04:43.000> do

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
something that Mary Andretti would do

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.119 
something that Mary Andretti would do
Ronnie<00:04:44.139> Peterson<00:04:44.349> would<00:04:44.680> just<00:04:44.800> drive<00:04:44.949> the<00:04:45.099> car

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
Ronnie Peterson would just drive the car

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.420 
Ronnie Peterson would just drive the car
fast<00:04:45.550> that's<00:04:46.150> something<00:04:46.659> that<00:04:47.219> you<00:04:48.219> know<00:04:48.400> that

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
fast that's something that you know that

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.730 
fast that's something that you know that
John<00:04:49.270> Lacey<00:04:49.449> probably<00:04:50.020> didn't<00:04:50.319> do<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:50.530> he<00:04:50.620> got

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
John Lacey probably didn't do but he got

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.249 
John Lacey probably didn't do but he got
on<00:04:50.830> well<00:04:51.009> with<00:04:51.069> the<00:04:51.159> people<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:52.000> know<00:04:52.259> one

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259

on well with the people you know one
thing<00:04:53.469> we<00:04:53.590> have<00:04:53.770> seen<00:04:53.949> ramarajan<00:04:54.639> do

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 
thing we have seen ramarajan do

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:56.879 
thing we have seen ramarajan do
character-wise<00:04:55.629> is<00:04:56.319> have<00:04:56.560> that<00:04:56.680> opportunity

winning races in a in an Enrico scale of

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.339 
winning races in a in an Enrico scale of
browny<00:05:05.680> engineered<00:05:06.099> gt40<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.990> then<00:05:08.110> coming

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
browny engineered gt40 and then coming

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:09.930 
browny engineered gt40 and then coming
back<00:05:08.469> into<00:05:08.620> Formula<00:05:08.949> One<00:05:09.069> so<00:05:09.219> he<00:05:09.340> does<00:05:09.550> have

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
back into Formula One so he does have

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.309 
back into Formula One so he does have
that<00:05:10.180> ability<00:05:10.330> to<00:05:11.460> regroup<00:05:12.460> and<00:05:12.669> think<00:05:12.969> and

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:13.319 
that ability to regroup and think and

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.179 
that ability to regroup and think and
develop<00:05:14.319> so<00:05:14.590> it'll<00:05:14.860> be<00:05:14.919> really<00:05:15.069> interesting

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:15.189 
develop so it'll be really interesting

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.860 
develop so it'll be really interesting
to<00:05:15.610> see<00:05:15.639> a<00:05:15.789> chance<00:05:16.090> that<00:05:16.270> the<00:05:16.389> two<00:05:16.509> of<00:05:16.539> them<00:05:16.719> get

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
to see a chance that the two of them get

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.240 
to see a chance that the two of them get
it's<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.110> very<00:05:17.349> good<00:05:17.500> point<00:05:17.710> he's<00:05:17.889> had<00:05:18.009> a<00:05:18.039> few

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
it's a very good point he's had a few

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.709 
it's a very good point he's had a few
knocks<00:05:18.460> mmm<00:05:18.909> and<00:05:19.029> he's<00:05:19.120> come<00:05:19.389> back<00:05:19.569> and

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
knocks mmm and he's come back and

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.439 
knocks mmm and he's come back and
showing<00:05:19.930> us<00:05:20.199> so<00:05:20.379> therefore<00:05:21.039> yeah<00:05:21.909> it<00:05:22.180> could

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
showing us so therefore yeah it could

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.390 
showing us so therefore yeah it could
but<00:05:22.750> it'll<00:05:22.990> be<00:05:23.110> a<00:05:23.139> test<00:05:23.440> for<00:05:23.770> them<00:05:23.949> both<00:05:24.129> but

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
but it'll be a test for them both but

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.420 
but it'll be a test for them both but
that's<00:05:24.550> going<00:05:24.759> to<00:05:24.879> be<00:05:25.000> fireworks<00:05:25.210> that<00:05:26.430> could

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
that's going to be fireworks that could

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.469 
that's going to be fireworks that could
be<00:05:27.490> interesting<00:05:27.879> as<00:05:28.000> the<00:05:28.259> Ferrari<00:05:29.259> won
