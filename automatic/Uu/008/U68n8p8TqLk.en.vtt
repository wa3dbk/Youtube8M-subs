00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.830
 diagonal of the display in the smartphone it is like 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.019
 the dollar always pushes the bar 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.730
 normalities a little further remember how 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.860
 classmates at the university managed to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 read whole books on one and a half inch 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.369
 moka displays 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 24 inch business smartphones were considered 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.510
 chic a 2 and 8 huge 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.700
 but then came the iphone and raised the bar 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
 normalcy for a long time his all 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.980
 caught up and then a new frontier was taken 4 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.530
 inches I have a shorter long intro 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.960
 today we look at it this huawei s7 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.300
 flagship smartphone maker with 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 6-inch display seems to want and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.020
 joke but even the new motorola nexus 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.020
 has the same display diagonal 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.510
 from where 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.339
 this is really a big smartphone however 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.080
 looking at other players in his size 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.850
 looks quite normal design 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.229
 turned out to be very ordinary here 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.630
 items for which you can cling 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.460
 simple black bar happy that he 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.290
 metallic build quality at a very 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 high level by the way metal in the case 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.110
 more than 99 percent and the display area 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 more than 83 percent and this is very cool 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.530
 the frameworks are subtle on countries like 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.630
 usually volume control keys 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.090
 lock slots for sim cards and cards 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.840
 memory and microusb connector and 35 each 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.880
 millimeter jack 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.500
 the display has a convenient LED out of 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.509
 unusualness under the main camera posted 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.070
 fingerprint scanner which 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:38.750
 for the first time after iphone works well 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.369
 let its location and not by itself 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.539
 successful especially when the smartphone lies 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.340
 scanner unavailable 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.080
 but taking your hands even press nothing 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.270
 you just need to touch the scanner and 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.039
 smartphone unlocked instantly everything would 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.539
 good but after the frost the scanner starts 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:52.820
 a little stupid you have to wait until 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.009
 smartphone warms up ips display 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.710
 has full hd resolution at six inches 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.780
 that's 367 pixels per inch that's enough with 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.039
 head not chasing after whom it rains and you 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 won in autonomy and 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.580
 performance well done picture me 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.259
 Very pleased with the display bright and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.429
 contrast with maximum angles 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.899
 review maximum and minimum 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.700
 brightness and allow comfortable 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.319
 use your smartphone in the sun 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.450
 light and in total darkness all facial 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.220
 side protected by gorilla glass 3 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 the camera is something engineers have 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.550
 bother well frontal on 5 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.310
 megapixels with full recording capability 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.709
 hd video and aperture 24 main 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
 13 megapixel with aperture 2 video 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.730
 also write a 4-ke not flash drive 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.110
 supported pleases that at the maximum 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.239
 resolution photos are obtained 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.130
 4 to 3 quality ratio 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.080
 images are very good both at 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.370
 good light and evening camera 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.800
 This is what I can safely recommend. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.220
 what is this smart processor 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.050
 development and silicone kelin 925 from 920 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.360
 the model is characterized by the presence of a coprocessor 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.310
 smart 3 responsible for the operation of the scanner and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.010
 sensor processor consists of four 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.450
 cores cortex a15 4 cortex a7 between 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.489
 which are distributed surrender in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.280
 depending on the resource intensity of the schedule 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:00.020
 prayer 628 mp4 ram 2 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.970
 gigabyte user 16 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.200
 the ability to expand the smartphone can not 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.060
 name the leader judging by 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.950
 benchmarks but in all games he leads 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.379
 yourself great and most liked 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.269
 autonomy from 4100 mile amp time 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.890
 This battery will live longer than 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.810
 almost 100 percent can 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.850
 rental including motorola droid turbo 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.709
 and in all modes but with versions 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.720
 huawei android is not always smooth 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.640
 for example here android 4 4 2 s 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.410
 interface emotion 40 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.000
 there is no usual menu, everything is located 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 on the working screens can be installed 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.050
 custom themes 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.820
 This all looks quite I would say so 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.470
 myself, I would have immediately changed the interface is 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.780
 but there are a lot of cool chips 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.940
 Angle turned out great phablet I would 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.260
 said one of the best and although still 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.690
 I do not quite understand why an ordinary 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.040
 a smartphone display of this size 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.080
 who does he really need him 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.940
 like here and high-quality housing and 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.770
 excellent autonomy and camera not 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.410
 I liked a little boring design 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.360
 like the smartphone itself and the interface but 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.950
 firstly it is a matter of taste and secondly it 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.690
 and the other is easy to customize while 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.410
 bumper assistance and launcher change 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.410
 respectively
