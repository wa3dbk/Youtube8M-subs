code<00:01:17.660> that<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:17.900> have<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.140> rewrite<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.770> more

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
code that we have to rewrite the more

code that we have to rewrite the more
money<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.490> save<00:01:19.670> in<00:01:20.360> terms<00:01:20.630> of<00:01:20.840> developer

time<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.650> time<00:01:21.800> per<00:01:21.890> market<00:01:24.040> we<00:01:25.040> chose<00:01:25.220> QT<00:01:25.670> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
time and time per market we chose QT and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.370 
time and time per market we chose QT and
because<00:01:26.120> it<00:01:26.300> was<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.810> most<00:01:27.020> complete

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
because it was the most complete

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.770 
because it was the most complete
cross-platform<00:01:28.450> toolkit<00:01:29.450> that<00:01:29.690> was

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
cross-platform toolkit that was

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.090 
cross-platform toolkit that was
available<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:30.200> us<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:30.650> actually<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.010> would

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
available to us and actually I would

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.860 
available to us and actually I would
still<00:01:31.340> say<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.640> is<00:01:31.760> we<00:01:32.060> felt<00:01:32.300> that<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.540> had<00:01:32.690> the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
still say it is we felt that it had the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.510 
still say it is we felt that it had the
best<00:01:33.140> options<00:01:33.800> for<00:01:33.860> support

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520

get up and running with cute it was

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.270 
get up and running with cute it was
actually<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> very<00:01:56.690> easy<00:01:57.080> transition<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:58.070> found

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
actually a very easy transition we found

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.160 
actually a very easy transition we found
that<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.520> was<00:01:58.610> fairly<00:01:58.850> easy<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.150> learn<00:01:59.300> and<00:01:59.720> to

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
that it was fairly easy to learn and to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.840 
that it was fairly easy to learn and to
get<00:02:00.290> started<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.740> in<00:02:00.890> terms<00:02:01.070> of<00:02:01.340> productivity

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
get started and in terms of productivity

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.090 
get started and in terms of productivity
it<00:02:02.150> was<00:02:02.270> certainly<00:02:02.750> faster<00:02:03.200> than<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.830> had<00:02:03.979> been

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
it was certainly faster than it had been

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.859 
it was certainly faster than it had been
in<00:02:04.160> previous<00:02:04.310> code<00:02:05.030> bases<00:02:05.420> where<00:02:05.660> we<00:02:05.780> were

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
in previous code bases where we were

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.120 
in previous code bases where we were
trying<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.140> do<00:02:06.290> all<00:02:06.470> of<00:02:06.500> our<00:02:06.680> own<00:02:06.740> development

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
trying to do all of our own development

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.370 
trying to do all of our own development
all<00:02:07.820> of<00:02:07.940> our<00:02:08.060> own<00:02:08.300> abstractions<00:02:09.110> where<00:02:09.290> we

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
all of our own abstractions where we

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.600 
all of our own abstractions where we
would<00:02:09.500> end<00:02:09.619> up<00:02:09.679> writing<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.070> same<00:02:10.190> GUI<00:02:10.369> code

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
would end up writing the same GUI code

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.490 
would end up writing the same GUI code
several<00:02:10.850> times<00:02:11.090> or<00:02:11.270> so

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.710 

I<00:02:13.530> believe<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> cute<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:14.820> future-proof<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
I believe the cute is future-proof you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.510 
I believe the cute is future-proof you
just<00:02:15.930> an<00:02:15.990> open<00:02:16.200> source<00:02:16.410> product<00:02:16.710> so<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:17.370> have

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
just an open source product so we have

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.830 
just an open source product so we have
the<00:02:17.670> source<00:02:17.880> code<00:02:17.970> for<00:02:18.240> everything<00:02:18.720> that

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
the source code for everything that

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.480 
the source code for everything that
we're<00:02:18.990> using<00:02:19.140> today<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.620> we<00:02:19.860> will<00:02:20.010> be<00:02:20.100> able<00:02:20.220> to

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
we're using today and we will be able to

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.430 
we're using today and we will be able to
maintain<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:21.150> continue<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.630> use<00:02:21.840> cute<00:02:22.200> in

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
maintain and continue to use cute in

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.720 
maintain and continue to use cute in
products<00:02:22.920> moving<00:02:23.100> forward

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
products moving forward

future<00:02:32.610> is<00:02:32.820> pretty<00:02:33.060> simple<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.630> want<00:02:33.810> to

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
future is pretty simple we want to

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.210 
future is pretty simple we want to
continue<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.380> make<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> best<00:02:34.830> products

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
continue to make the best products

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.260 
continue to make the best products
available<00:02:35.310> for<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:35.940> marine<00:02:36.180> electronics

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
available for the marine electronics

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.210 
available for the marine electronics
industry<00:02:37.110> we<00:02:37.410> want<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> grow<00:02:37.800> our<00:02:37.830> market

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
industry we want to grow our market

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.860 
industry we want to grow our market
share<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.700> need<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:38.940> right<00:02:39.120> tools<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.510> do<00:02:39.690> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
share to need the right tools to do that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.660 
share to need the right tools to do that
we've<00:02:40.170> been<00:02:40.290> very<00:02:40.470> happy<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.220> way<00:02:41.340> cute

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
we've been very happy that the way cute

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.550 
we've been very happy that the way cute
is<00:02:41.790> implemented<00:02:42.540> into<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.810> products<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.410> so

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
is implemented into the products and so

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.430 
is implemented into the products and so
we'll<00:02:43.680> continue<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:44.100> use<00:02:44.280> it
