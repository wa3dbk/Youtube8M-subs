00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:03.929
 in the gate of the Augsburger stood ex-club Gremio conflict of the city in the German 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.470
 as if Vincent had something to guard the goal 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.700
 The sponsor warns for probably being stressed that the players 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.499
 of the evening no 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.120
 his first goal came in the sixth minute 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.120
 1 0 for Augsburg but Grant Stevenson 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.299
 but pursuers with good in the after also thanks to some punishments 

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:26.429
 against the panthers 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.599
 Mike Wehrstedt even managed the much-acclaimed equalizer in excess 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.599
 Seconds before the break 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.469
 the assessment of coach Ken Latta as it is now appreciated in the summer 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.490
 now no discussion the band is satisfied with team 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.700
 for the first 20 minutes 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.350
 we play open as the two titles and it was the expected Grandpa Knicksen 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.280
 Duracell started killing the whole two either suggested to me 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.020
 What exactly can also Hopper concentrated concentrated seemed lazy 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.390
 zweikampf weak 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.080
 also forums with penalty times and from 29 minutes then on the same numbers 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 disadvantage 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.500
 a little later then that had 1 3 by Mike 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.960
 Music and more after what one to four for the Panther technique of Smith 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.320
 At the latest now, the spell seemed to have been broken at Augsburg 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.220
 Koppold storms tired after the hard preparation and not fit 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.470
 seems 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.470
 one by five again by Nathan Smith 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.270
 The last section of the game was again turbulent 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.510
 with the first shot in the third limited every cent to 1 to 6 for the 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.510
 Guests 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 a little later then the 1 to 7 by Justin Fletcher 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.390
 followed by the factual remain or 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 from that time one so flat by Peter 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.730
 then the first artisanal dispute about the ice hockey in the third 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.450
 quarter 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.560
 completely unnecessary in the score of 1 to 9 in a preparatory game 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.619
 Ice hockey was then briefly played again and is not like the former one 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.619
 use 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:17.559
 Afterwards, the spectators got less ice hockey as team has succeeded 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.989
 To see martial arts 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.150
 A total of three wineries sell at the practical seconds distance 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.099
 the good news was the Augsburg made with the 1 12 by one 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.889
 Penalty finish scoring goals 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.889
 the pictures and probably their last concert there are dozens of languages 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.230
 after the game, no monkey was surprised what not so dissatisfied 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.609
 as you might expect 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:45.449
 we have kind of first 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:49.249
 Eichsfeld me on that Thuringia and then but tactician or 10 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.209
 Percent trains but it is around 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.329
 That was to less, Forbes again clearly hit 10 percent in April 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.999
 with us-team percent 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.229
 the carpentry job 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:03.239
 we showed ourselves why and why in the room storm and in the 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.449
 study 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.619
 I think Alaric white sauce some of the best, many citizens still want 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.959
 but once pleasing, Maha will count 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.409
 two play two helpers on these and seven solo attempts 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.429
 have you chosen from it 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:22.439
 then shoot up after the game first shoot at 1 5 3 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.929
 affected that 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:27.559
 It's okay if I am so if you have so many 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:30.679
 AR chances Ausrastern will therefore still 

00:03:30.679 --> 00:03:33.729
 you have to know about the same hardest thing 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:37.089
 to September we have yet time to record it in their 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:38.899
 serious leagues 

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.679
 but until then, especially the pursuers have to do a lot
