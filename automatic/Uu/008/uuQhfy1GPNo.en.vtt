00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.590
 it's gone m5 e39 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.150
 so I think they could finally 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.040
 here at rallies I went 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.360
 the first time I go because I 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.760
 often finally when I spend here it's 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:33.620
 all every Friday last two months 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.620
 who polled but who do not finish 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.700
 me 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.700
 m 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.170
 it's crazy how it brakes well 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.170
 still 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.980
 and blood and second VallÃ©e de Joux 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 no these four seconds 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.990
 take five seconds or so 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:28.020
 already made a race against the n 3 bat 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.750
 against the m3 e36 there the 46 go better in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 done that's what we did I had seen in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.300
 done at the coast on the good 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.350
 corner i saw that the m3 e46 that we were 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.520
 much more than m5 e39 yeah but 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.750
 this is the consumer who are 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.750
 sought also that's why it 's 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.509
 played enormously also at the base I 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.659
 wanted 46 but I took that I found 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.659
 it 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.340
 later I got 46 cats back on the 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.240
 track I love and then an evolution of 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.400
 career next to the 46 level 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.090
 consumption what gives that of his 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.090
 three matches 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.979
 that's really the world you are 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.550
 activities with pubs heard when you 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.550
 take the doubt 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.820
 you 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.990
 ah yeah already two are downright this 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.990
 cake 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200
 or 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.819
 ankama gathering yeah it's not 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.120
 very cool guy who is getting fat 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.740
 fights 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.100
 you are 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.100
 friendly 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.280
 good 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.800
 that's what I noticed while doing 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.140
 turn between the n 5 she m 3 i 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.580
 the impression that the most sporty m3 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.310
 what she likes is also this 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.110
 impression that's why 46 me 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.690
 compare to a loss of 46 seconds I 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.819
 already tested skylight that's what it is 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.890
 really different rather different that 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.620
 Dad is a car which these flights 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.959
 programmed with a lot of power 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.340
 while barclays had 46 that would be 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.470
 plus the sports tower for the track that 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.400
 them what I believe she plays 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.580
 many and also at the level of 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.580
 suspensions 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.289
