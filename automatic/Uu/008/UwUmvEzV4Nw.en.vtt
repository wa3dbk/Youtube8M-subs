00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is what I'm recreating today I got this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.900 
is what I'm recreating today I got this
look<00:00:15.719> that's<00:00:15.929> right<00:00:16.170> here<00:00:16.680> um<00:00:16.830> it's<00:00:17.730> not

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
look that's right here um it's not

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.370 
look that's right here um it's not
perfect<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.690> actually<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.170> time

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
perfect this was actually the first time

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.050 
perfect this was actually the first time
I've<00:00:19.560> ever<00:00:19.590> done<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.160> i<00:00:20.310> literally<00:00:20.699> just<00:00:20.730> saw<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I've ever done it i literally just saw a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.609 
I've ever done it i literally just saw a
picture<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:21.720> hopped<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.140> camera<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
picture and like hopped on camera and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
picture and like hopped on camera and
recreated<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.060> probably<00:00:24.210> will<00:00:24.390> take<00:00:24.570> a

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
recreated it so it probably will take a

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.790 
recreated it so it probably will take a
little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:24.990> practice<00:00:25.350> nor<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.710> me

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
little bit of practice nor for me

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.890 
little bit of practice nor for me
perfected<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.029> identical<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
perfected and it's not identical to the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.450 
perfected and it's not identical to the
picture<00:00:28.170> because<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> picture<00:00:28.859> starting<00:00:29.400> my

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
picture because the picture starting my

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.620 
picture because the picture starting my
phone's<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:29.910> but<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.330> picture<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
phone's going off but the picture is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
phone's going off but the picture is
like<00:00:30.869> absolutely<00:00:31.380> perfect<00:00:31.830> so<00:00:31.980> it<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
like absolutely perfect so it is a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
like absolutely perfect so it is a
little<00:00:32.340> bit<00:00:32.460> different<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.059> as<00:00:33.210> good<00:00:33.329> as

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
little bit different it's not as good as

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.700 
little bit different it's not as good as
the<00:00:33.540> picture<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.290> kind<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.440> wanted<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the picture but I just kind of wanted to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.049 
the picture but I just kind of wanted to
give<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> guys<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.190> idea<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> guys<00:00:35.820> can

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
give you guys the idea and you guys can

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.790 
give you guys the idea and you guys can
twist<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.390> yourself<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> look<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
twist up yourself so this is a look that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.119

so now obviously I'm doing the same
thing<00:02:13.300> to<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.569> other<00:02:13.599> side<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.709> what<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.010> did

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
thing to the other side and what I did

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580 
thing to the other side and what I did
was<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:15.910> tied<00:02:16.420> off<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.989> other<00:02:17.230> rates

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
was I actually tied off the other rates

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.809 
was I actually tied off the other rates
I'm<00:02:17.769> going<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.190> same<00:02:18.370> thing<00:02:18.580> with<00:02:18.670> this

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
I'm going to do the same thing with this

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.699 
I'm going to do the same thing with this
one<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.209> way<00:02:19.330> doesn't<00:02:19.599> fall<00:02:19.930> out<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.349> then

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
one that way doesn't fall out and then

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.110 
one that way doesn't fall out and then
at<00:02:20.830> the<00:02:20.950> very<00:02:20.980> end<00:02:21.250> when<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.580> connect<00:02:21.940> them

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
at the very end when I connect them

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.210 
at the very end when I connect them
together<00:02:22.269> I<00:02:22.510> end<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:22.959> taking<00:02:23.410> off<00:02:23.620> those<00:02:23.860> last

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220

00:02:24.220 --> 00:03:32.740 
together I end up taking off those last
pieces
