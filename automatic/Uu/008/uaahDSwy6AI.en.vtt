00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello people in this video it works 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.330
 easy to provision or 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 producing hot water over the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.080
 range electrolysis and for how should 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.029
 he sees a dry cell or one 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 wet cell come to use 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.310
 it should be determined which 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.000
 of these two systems it is now the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.080
 30 or this the websale or at night 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.540
 still called 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.969
 the most effective is as you see 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.850
 the cells are almost identical that's it 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.850
 the dry season 30 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.190
 and that is the wet cell is indeed 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.370
 already known and of the size ago 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.469
 if you see, they are identical 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.629
 fits over the other version too 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.879
 were made 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 so and now has the question 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.149
 if you have the two different ones 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.850
 systems with the same power output 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:12.920
 it says the dry cell 12 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.920
 volt and 20 amps and the wet cell with 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 12 25 ampere 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 or you go and say yes okay 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 compares it to function of the Vaud 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.670
 speaks 220 watts and there 220 watts and 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.610
 As you can see here is the two 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 cells in the unit of time the larger 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.280
 amount of hot water can provide 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.500
 and with word effectiveness 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.549
 That's what it says 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.689
 shall be 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.060
 and now my question to you what 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.920
 guess how is this comparison 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.159
 what's going to happen right now? 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.189
 happened is the dry cell or is 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 the wet cell becomes the more effective 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.790
 the challenge 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.430
 at the moment I say thank you for 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.430
 watch it until the next video bye
