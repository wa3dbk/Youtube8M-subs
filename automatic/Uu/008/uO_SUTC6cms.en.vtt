00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.890
 in tonight we're here to talk about the race rest 80s I'd like to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.320
 that you introduce yourself 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.059
 so I'm going with the law 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.369
 runner in front of the eternal optimist mountaineers keen on running in the mountains 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.219
 and also coordinator of the race and the unions are working 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.720
 you're here tonight we talked a little bit 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.939
 courses of this race or more precisely courses actually 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.079
 courses because there are two loops 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.469
 so we wished to leave corte arrived at cortÃ© the 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.460
 price difference with the internate who was going to confuse the terrible 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.400
 European 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.780
 irene difference of an extra economic dimension 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 and that's from the parking lot obviously from the city of corte 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.610
 so both ends there is one that is going to be a little bit long was 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.730
 reserved for long distance runners 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.060
 clifford at 68 km for 5000 meters of elevation gain 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.860
 so for connoisseurs I will list a little bit the points because 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.890
 that handles and features and beautiful things to see by the way 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.380
 besides, you wear in car parks to run to the adq at 3 in 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.480
 then going on march marc wore only an authority of nature 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.790
 to then go to the glass and talk to the letters 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.090
 okaka there and we go down on cognac 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.120
 then downhill after 4 km of track to know where and it's not bad 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.600
 we're on the stage so it's a year instead of the barbados 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.830
 exploitation of setbacks in Corsica 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.630
 and the voices of the brawl 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.970
 then we go back to the green jury of three open houses goes to 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.900
 swing instead of steeve 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080
 well known 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.420
 we ride after the man behind the ni-ni 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.270
 we pass boca stadium either with the petrify 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.650
 and that's where the heck have you been bent on making the hole with 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.330
 a ronaldo in front 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.870
 we go back to bakary diallo the place that had put with the lever to launch a 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.359
 jack or a pda moniste all summer 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.309
 we go back to the culminating point of germaine who is the vase boka the doors 

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:48.860
 to 2300 meters 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.380
 to pass on the dates of capturing the sea water we will go to the neck 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.220
 of capitalism there too the place of a fantastic view 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.170
 but the water the roads and the network would have fallen so much to mans 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.570
 about the old way to restore them first right bank to 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.010
 graph then left bank muscat at cesar hochfelden 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.020
 going up again when they want to climb 700 meters of elevation 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.429
 to the employer 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.109
 besides a refueling located shepherd for him he is drunk cortenaise 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:17.859
 usa and there we will come back talking about tavullia so 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.859
 in euro highlights for facts including suez return span 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.659
 las cissÃ© is a difficult course 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.879
 very technical 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.219
 he is immediately under the 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.579
 open to all abilities just for scanning home 16h then 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.479
 to everyone in this case what would not make it does that some 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.819
 month 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.290
 Yes, yes, you still have to be a racer 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.120
 long be used to these races there 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.240
 to make this race he will have time barriers that will be fixed 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.969
 to be respected the integrity of the head and its physical integrity 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.189
 possible 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.279
 that's why you decided that there would be a second course 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:56.659
 actually we wanted to create a second course reserved for him 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.049
 no to the unit of noon included to the riders a neophyte courses beginners 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.640
 and even the good walkers 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.010
 to do it because there will be no time barrier cima deezer in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.189
 walk is very good 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.659
 and it's a gorgeous promo that pointed the old paths of 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.010
 old dance styles that follow the same path to the 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.639
 scene 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.949
 that the first 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.429
 but here we go to the water of the valley it goes back on a match 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:20.059
 and here we are again clear of his upcoming shock 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.749
 finally after thirty kilometers for 2016 winter summit 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.249
 for the team 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:26.490
 of this race 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.900
 she pulled out the heads at the start of 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.020
 to bring you into the city center this is what is planned 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.019
 so I guess there are sides to this race on one side and 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.040
 economic 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.220
 and on the other hand a year 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.210
 we wanted to create the event on race laps and for the 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.519
 first year where starts timidly but we start anyway 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.299
 the other years we will try to create an event around itself 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.139
 around the mountain culture the environment 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.089
 this year the actions we have you want to put in place and that the 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.969
 Friday night he will have a projection of the film of gore this warming 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.099
 climatic 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.429
 with the participation of cnrs researchers so much respected what is 

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:05.189
 goes to the level of the press it can interest a lot of players 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.299
 this is the first animation concept loses the best a photo exhibition 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.359
 over 100 m 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.979
 the Corsican mountains on pastoral and other activities 

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.889
 we'll stop here for this year 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.620
 no more question of running a race for the little ones 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.000
 a treasure hunt coat worn with the high places of the city with 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.569
 pascal paoli and% and padua 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:25.650
 of Bonaparte 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.900
 he will have won a real treasure that will be projected this buyer for london 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.289
 that's for the little ones in the morning 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.430
 and the evening after the court on a awards ceremony and will be a little late I think 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.669
 because they will arrive a little late the runners 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.809
 r the awards ceremony will yoann not know 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.870
 the animation of evenings with the group the host countries 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.410
 so this is a loaded program in perspective 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.000
 you need a motivated team to handle this whole organization 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.960
 we have a very motivated team 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.850
 and the stores and fuzer bring it's sword ladies won so that fuse 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.710
 not bad and we have fun but there is a lot of work actually he 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.729
 there is work in the field because you have to prepare for the markup 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.020
 we will have to be 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.800
 there were a lot of volunteers giving us a helping hand 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.020
 nearly 150 volunteers is not nothing you have to organize all that is 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.379
 still work highlights the fact in joy and good mood 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.509
 so it must go on and I hope that in the secret without 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.430
 Appointment 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.280
 three hundred against 5 cents thank you thank you to you
