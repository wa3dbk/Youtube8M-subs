00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello and welcome to bobby fun here 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.450
 at high the tv I'm glad bebop 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:18.300
 And I think it's time for ours 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:22.970
 first sound unfortunately let us with the c major 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.189
 beginning of scale also called unit 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.080
 what is there a high pitch unfortunately the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 we play in the first step 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.190
 the basic tone is the next step 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 whole atom then another whole atom then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.040
 then follow half a tower again 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.620
 a whole atom a whole tower a whole zoo 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.670
 and half a day 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:54.629
 what does that mean for us in one of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.899
 workshops at previous workshops 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.830
 I explain that a bunch each one 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.979
 half tone higher means ok so 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.850
 been 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.850
 a colorful higher is a half tone 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:14.400
 as a result, two frets become whole 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:21.960
 okay we want the c major scale 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:29.340
 The game consists of cdefgh and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:33.170
 c ok so more of our reason now understood 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.170
 on the a-side in the third bunch 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.090
 the next ton who is a ton more pronounced 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.750
 two frets 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.750
 who then does that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.250
 the next sound again a whole 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:52.410
 ton say two frets would be our e 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.090
 she was on the a-side in and 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.670
 now follows in the there unfortunately one 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.900
 do it halfway 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.190
 that is a colorful higher 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.940
 that means then for us in the 8th 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.850
 when we get our network 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.300
 then again a whole tone follows 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.560
 say two frets 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.840
 and on the side of the g then we would have 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.850
 again a whole tone 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.570
 who is virtually in the twelfth fret on the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.570
 a-side usa 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:30.250
 then we have a whole tone again 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.160
 Step means for us two frets in the 14th 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.120
 and h 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.409
 and at the end half a tone 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.409
 that means a higher level again 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.390
 count among them 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.530
 okay those are the ingredients first 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.530
 the cdu unfortunately do 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.440
 ok now you know where the sounds 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.240
 but we are from c major on your side 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.280
 they do not just play on one side 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.780
 but we will put you in a position 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.910
 play meaning position 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.450
 that means we will try the sounds 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:27.340
 to look for me in the position where the cs 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.290
 So speak a bunch with a finger 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.750
 sentence 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.910
 Unfortunately this cd can play ok 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.880
 we know our tone is located 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.250
 be wonderful in it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.800
 and the next sound would be the dsw 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.800
 in the fifth bunch on the a side 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.510
 it also corresponds to our teacher's side 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:52.730
 speaks between d and e is on again 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.640
 whole tone step means two for us 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 alliances would be here in the second bund 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.090
 our e 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.260
 okay between e and f is at the 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:08.099
 cell scale a half tone step 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.590
 means for us a bunch so here is 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.860
 our f 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:19.829
 between f and g a whole tone step 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:21.419
 speak two frets okay 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.470
 Of course, that tone is the same again 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.840
 our highest page were namely ag 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:31.409
 between ge and again a whole tone 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:35.009
 say two reasons so you in the second 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:37.800
 bunch on the b side a arm between a 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.739
 and again a whole tone speak 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.389
 two reasons 

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:45.209
 if we are here in the fourth fret on the 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.929
 b-side our hair and between hair and 

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:55.199
 they are called a half tone speak a bunch 

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:56.879
 we have it here in the fifth bunch if it is 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:59.339
 now so fast was no problem 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:02.610
 as with the the vorgegangenen 

00:04:59.339 --> 00:05:04.079

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.749
 you the notes and also the 

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:09.529
 tablatures the load can I do 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:09.529
 together again 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.150
 we are allowed the second finger of 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.770
 our grab in the third volume 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.420

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.960
 second bunch on the pillar 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.100
 picked up in the second finger in the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:40.070
 third bunch on the b side 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.020

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:44.560
 fourth finger 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:53.949
 in 2 on the b side resorted to eating 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:56.889
