of dented in where you know has you know

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.420 
of dented in where you know has you know
muscle<00:01:33.010> would<00:01:33.130> be<00:01:33.220> flexing<00:01:33.610> their<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:35.430> pretty

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
muscle would be flexing their and pretty

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.680 
muscle would be flexing their and pretty
good<00:01:36.549> articulation<00:01:36.790> like<00:01:37.240> we<00:01:37.360> sat<00:01:37.540> in<00:01:37.630> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
good articulation like we sat in the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.920 
good articulation like we sat in the
arms<00:01:39.090> not<00:01:40.090> really<00:01:40.330> a<00:01:40.390> whole<00:01:40.510> lot<00:01:40.540> anywhere

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
arms not really a whole lot anywhere

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.270 
arms not really a whole lot anywhere
else<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.320> waist<00:01:41.500> does<00:01:41.740> pivot<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.930> head<00:01:44.080> does

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
else the waist does pivot the head does

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.710 
else the waist does pivot the head does
moves<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.369> little<00:01:45.490> bit<00:01:45.729> side<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:46.060> side<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.540> guess

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
moves a little bit side to side I guess

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.800 
moves a little bit side to side I guess

for<00:01:52.900> me<00:01:53.049> actually<00:01:53.260> because<00:01:53.590> this<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.189> not

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
for me actually because this is not

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.510 
for me actually because this is not
really<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> true<00:01:56.560> spider-man<00:01:57.070> figure<00:01:57.340> if<00:01:57.460> you

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
painting detail for this to me is a

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.010 
painting detail for this to me is a
little<00:02:55.860> bit<00:02:56.070> off<00:02:56.420> if<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.900> back

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
little bit off if you see on the back

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.210 
little bit off if you see on the back
here<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.440> didn't<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.710> look<00:02:58.830> like<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.190> did

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
here it didn't really look like they did

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.950 
here it didn't really look like they did
a<00:02:59.370> very<00:02:59.640> good<00:02:59.760> job<00:02:59.940> of<00:03:00.150> painting<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:00.720> all<00:03:00.840> the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
a very good job of painting in all the

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.730 
a very good job of painting in all the
black<00:03:01.190> I<00:03:03.020> guess<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.200> kind<00:03:04.350> of<00:03:04.410> gives<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
black I guess it kind of gives the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.770 
black I guess it kind of gives the
figure<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> retro<00:03:05.490> feel<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.120> but<00:03:06.480> still

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
figure like a retro feel to it but still

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.190 
figure like a retro feel to it but still
it<00:03:06.930> needs<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.200> be<00:03:07.320> as<00:03:07.470> black<00:03:07.800> as<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.130> can<00:03:08.250> be<00:03:08.430> in

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
it needs to be as black as it can be in

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.750 
it needs to be as black as it can be in
the<00:03:10.200> neck<00:03:10.440> here<00:03:10.740> they<00:03:11.250> didn't<00:03:11.460> really<00:03:11.550> do<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
the neck here they didn't really do a

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.260 
the neck here they didn't really do a
whole<00:03:11.850> lot<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.360> yeah<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:14.120> swooped<00:03:15.120> up

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
whole lot with yeah just swooped up

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.390 
whole lot with yeah just swooped up
black<00:03:15.630> lines<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.230> yeah<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.070> there's

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
black lines and yeah it's just there's

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.450 
black lines and yeah it's just there's
no<00:03:17.610> real<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.300> know<00:03:18.770> any<00:03:19.770> pattern<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.220> that

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
no real you know any pattern to that

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.540 
no real you know any pattern to that
there<00:03:21.470> you<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.830> see<00:03:22.860> like<00:03:23.130> we<00:03:23.280> talked<00:03:23.490> about

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
there you can see like we talked about

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.400 
there you can see like we talked about
earlier<00:03:23.700> muscle<00:03:24.120> definition<00:03:24.390> like<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:25.020> straps

nonetheless as you know hardly any

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.240 
nonetheless as you know hardly any
articulation<00:03:30.900> but<00:03:31.740> it<00:03:31.830> is<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:31.980> classic

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
