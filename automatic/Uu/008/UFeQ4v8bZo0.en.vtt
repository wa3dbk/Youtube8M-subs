enough RAM for this so if you're gonna
play<00:01:38.070> games<00:01:38.460> i<00:01:39.060> recommend<00:01:40.130> six<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.369> eight

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
play games i recommend six to eight

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.109 
play games i recommend six to eight
gigabytes<00:01:42.150> since<00:01:42.810> most<00:01:43.350> games<00:01:43.770> are<00:01:44.189> usually

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
gigabytes since most games are usually

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.190 
gigabytes since most games are usually
two<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> four<00:01:46.140> gigabytes<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.930> with<00:01:48.930> six

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
two to four gigabytes and and with six

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.149 
two to four gigabytes and and with six
it'll<00:01:49.530> run<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.189> run<00:01:50.610> smoothly<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> once<00:01:53.009> you've

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it'll run it run smoothly so once you've

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.380 
it'll run it run smoothly so once you've

recorded take take the files and then i

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.510 
recorded take take the files and then i
recommend<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:58.229> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> iMovie<00:01:59.340> and
