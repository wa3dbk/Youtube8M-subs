take<00:00:05.680> honey<00:00:05.979> off<00:00:06.220> of<00:00:06.430> this<00:00:06.580> high<00:00:06.790> of<00:00:06.849> today<00:00:07.240> and

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
take honey off of this high of today and

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.680 
take honey off of this high of today and
I'm<00:00:08.200> going<00:00:08.349> to<00:00:08.410> use<00:00:08.470> a<00:00:09.160> chemical<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:10.269> this

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:10.690 
I'm going to use a chemical and this

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.320 
I'm going to use a chemical and this
chemical<00:00:11.019> is<00:00:11.230> called<00:00:11.530> honey<00:00:11.769> robber<00:00:12.209> this<00:00:13.209> is

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
chemical is called honey robber this is

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.629 
chemical is called honey robber this is
a<00:00:13.389> chemical<00:00:13.719> it<00:00:14.110> the<00:00:14.530> bees<00:00:14.830> do<00:00:15.070> not<00:00:15.249> like<00:00:15.459> the

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
a chemical it the bees do not like the

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.070 
a chemical it the bees do not like the
odor<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:16.240> smells<00:00:16.600> like<00:00:16.840> vomit<00:00:17.260> and<00:00:17.890> it<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
odor it smells like vomit and it it

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.200 
odor it smells like vomit and it it
drives<00:00:20.470> them<00:00:20.740> down<00:00:21.010> it<00:00:21.400> doesn't<00:00:21.820> hurt<00:00:21.940> them<00:00:22.090> at

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
drives them down it doesn't hurt them at

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.940 
drives them down it doesn't hurt them at
all<00:00:22.330> just<00:00:22.660> they<00:00:22.810> don't<00:00:22.840> say<00:00:23.200> it<00:00:23.290> repels<00:00:23.710> them

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
all just they don't say it repels them

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.750 
all just they don't say it repels them
and<00:00:24.220> they<00:00:24.430> move<00:00:24.640> down<00:00:25.290> away<00:00:26.290> from<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.590> odor<00:00:26.890> so

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
and they move down away from the odor so

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.150 
and they move down away from the odor so
what<00:00:27.940> we<00:00:28.090> use<00:00:28.240> to<00:00:28.270> do<00:00:28.600> it<00:00:28.630> with<00:00:28.960> is<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.740> honey

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
what we use to do it with is the honey

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.180 
what we use to do it with is the honey
robber<00:00:30.540> and<00:00:31.540> also<00:00:31.930> this<00:00:32.200> is<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.379> solar<00:00:32.739> fume

robaron and the solar the heat of this
vaporizes<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:50.640> chemical<00:00:51.640> and<00:00:53.190> spreads<00:00:54.190> it

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
vaporizes the chemical and spreads it

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:55.829 
vaporizes the chemical and spreads it
through<00:00:54.489> the<00:00:54.579> colony<00:00:55.059> through<00:00:55.390> the<00:00:55.479> top<00:00:55.690> of

through the colony through the top of

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:58.349 
through the colony through the top of
the<00:00:55.899> colony<00:00:56.289> it<00:00:56.379> drives<00:00:56.739> the<00:00:56.949> bees<00:00:57.129> down<00:00:57.489> now

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
the colony it drives the bees down now

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.149 
the colony it drives the bees down now
this<00:00:58.659> doesn't<00:00:58.899> work<00:00:59.199> when<00:00:59.440> it<00:00:59.559> starts<00:01:00.100> getting

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
this doesn't work when it starts getting

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.969 
this doesn't work when it starts getting
cold<00:01:00.550> doesn't<00:01:01.030> work<00:01:01.239> very<00:01:01.269> well<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.710> if

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
cold doesn't work very well or if

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.390 
cold doesn't work very well or if
there's<00:01:03.190> brood<00:01:03.519> present<00:01:04.120> inside<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.400> colony

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
there's brood present inside the colony

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.090 
there's brood present inside the colony
where<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.570> honey<00:01:07.780> is<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.380> bees<00:01:08.590> will<00:01:08.860> not

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
where the honey is the bees will not

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.010 
where the honey is the bees will not
leave<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.579> brood<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.210> it<00:01:10.299> doesn't<00:01:10.509> work<00:01:10.780> well

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
leave the brood so it doesn't work well

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.600 
leave the brood so it doesn't work well
in<00:01:11.290> that<00:01:11.469> circumstance

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
in that circumstance

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.360 
in that circumstance
but<00:01:13.270> in<00:01:13.390> general<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:14.230> works<00:01:14.590> very<00:01:14.890> well<00:01:15.040> to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
but in general it works very well to

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.550 
but in general it works very well to
pull<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.670> honey<00:01:15.880> off<00:01:16.200> once<00:01:17.200> I<00:01:17.320> put<00:01:17.530> the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
pull the honey off once I put the

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.300 
pull the honey off once I put the
chemical<00:01:18.130> on<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.490> takes<00:01:18.700> about<00:01:18.970> seven<00:01:19.510> minutes

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
chemical on it takes about seven minutes

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.280 
chemical on it takes about seven minutes
approximately<00:01:21.310> for<00:01:22.150> it<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.660> drive<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.080> bees

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
approximately for it to drive the bees

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.740 
approximately for it to drive the bees
out<00:01:23.500> of<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.680> first<00:01:23.950> super<00:01:24.430> so<00:01:25.120> we'll<00:01:25.270> take<00:01:25.510> off

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
out of the first super so we'll take off

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.750 
out of the first super so we'll take off
then<00:01:26.170> what<00:01:26.410> we'll<00:01:26.560> do<00:01:26.680> is<00:01:26.860> we'll<00:01:26.980> take<00:01:27.040> off<00:01:27.430> one

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
then what we'll do is we'll take off one

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.290 
then what we'll do is we'll take off one
super<00:01:28.630> put<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.760> down<00:01:30.760> here<00:01:31.150> on<00:01:31.270> this<00:01:31.420> palette

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
super put it down here on this palette

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.870 
super put it down here on this palette
will<00:01:34.300> cover<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.840> with<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.920> screen<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.610> stop

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
will cover it with the screen to stop

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.870 
will cover it with the screen to stop
robbing<00:01:37.540> we'll<00:01:38.080> put<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:38.830> back<00:01:39.100> on<00:01:39.340> and

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
robbing we'll put this back on and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.660 
robbing we'll put this back on and
attack<00:01:40.750> then<00:01:40.960> by<00:01:41.170> then<00:01:41.350> it<00:01:41.500> starts<00:01:42.250> working<00:01:42.400> a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
attack then by then it starts working a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.390 
attack then by then it starts working a
little<00:01:42.760> faster<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.600> the<00:01:44.590> trick<00:01:44.830> with<00:01:45.100> honey

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
little faster and the trick with honey

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.510 
little faster and the trick with honey
robber<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.869> warmer<00:01:47.380> it<00:01:47.410> is<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.860> better<00:01:48.040> works

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
robber the warmer it is the better works

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.840 
robber the warmer it is the better works
if<00:01:48.790> it's<00:01:49.000> 85<00:01:49.630> degrees<00:01:49.660> out<00:01:50.410> on<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> sunny<00:01:51.070> day<00:01:51.190> it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
if it's 85 degrees out on a sunny day it

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.060 
if it's 85 degrees out on a sunny day it
really<00:01:52.270> works<00:01:52.630> good<00:01:52.960> it<00:01:53.140> drives<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.619> bees<00:01:53.830> out

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
really works good it drives the bees out

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.499 
really works good it drives the bees out
you<00:01:54.280> know<00:01:54.369> there<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.550> not<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> beat<00:01:55.119> in<00:01:55.360> the

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
you know there is not a beat in the

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.499 
you know there is not a beat in the
super<00:01:55.930> if<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.830> 65<00:01:57.580> degrees<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:58.149> does<00:01:58.330> not

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
super if it's 65 degrees it does not

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.469 
super if it's 65 degrees it does not
work<00:01:58.720> as<00:01:58.960> good<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.250> all<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.490> do<00:02:00.759> to<00:02:00.790> use<00:02:01.180> this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
work as good so all you do to use this

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.740 
work as good so all you do to use this
and<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:02.320> do<00:02:02.380> not<00:02:02.649> use<00:02:02.890> smoke<00:02:03.280> on<00:02:03.580> top<00:02:03.850> because<00:02:04.570> I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and I do not use smoke on top because I

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.270 
and I do not use smoke on top because I
don't<00:02:04.990> want<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.229> bees<00:02:05.440> eating<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.009> honey

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
don't want the bees eating the honey

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.570 
don't want the bees eating the honey
that<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:07.240> stops<00:02:07.720> them<00:02:07.990> from<00:02:08.020> moving<00:02:08.770> down<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.550> i

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
that it stops them from moving down so i

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.050 
that it stops them from moving down so i
won't<00:02:09.820> use<00:02:09.970> any<00:02:10.179> smoke<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> all<00:02:12.489> i<00:02:12.580> do<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.790> just

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
won't use any smoke so all i do is just

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.340 
won't use any smoke so all i do is just
take<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:13.510> i<00:02:13.690> make<00:02:13.989> a<00:02:14.020> double<00:02:14.350> X<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:17.110> thin

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
take this i make a double X just a thin

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.330 
take this i make a double X just a thin
stream

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 

I'll<00:02:23.879> give<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.239> little<00:02:24.390> bit<00:02:24.599> extra<00:02:24.750> because

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I'll give it a little bit extra because

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.509 
I'll give it a little bit extra because
it's<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.099> nozzles<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:28.519> the

nozzles a little thin too thin of a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.600 
nozzles a little thin too thin of a
screen<00:02:32.910> if<00:02:33.720> you<00:02:33.780> make<00:02:34.110> sure<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.459> not

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
screen if you make sure that it's not

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.040 
screen if you make sure that it's not
dripping<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.209> all<00:02:36.330> because<00:02:36.569> we<00:02:36.660> don't<00:02:36.840> want<00:02:36.959> to

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
dripping it all because we don't want to

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.380 
dripping it all because we don't want to
drip<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> frames<00:02:40.910> we<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.120> gently

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
drip it on the frames we just gently

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.940 
drip it on the frames we just gently
take<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.810> covers<00:02:43.319> off<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.830> aren't

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950

and you can see it's all covered with

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.680 
and you can see it's all covered with
bees<00:03:02.280> here<00:03:04.760> we'll<00:03:05.760> leave<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:05.970> on<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.570> we'll

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
bees here we'll leave that on and we'll

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.740 
bees here we'll leave that on and we'll
come<00:03:06.900> back<00:03:07.140> in<00:03:07.380> about<00:03:08.090> seven<00:03:09.090> minutes<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.510> see

come back in about seven minutes and see

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.720 
come back in about seven minutes and see
how<00:03:09.900> it's<00:03:10.110> doing

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.250 

well<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:18.850> been<00:03:19.000> about<00:03:19.180> seven<00:03:19.630> minutes<00:03:19.810> or<00:03:20.080> so

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
well it's been about seven minutes or so

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.380 
well it's been about seven minutes or so
since<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.680> put<00:03:20.890> this<00:03:21.040> on<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.210> pretty

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
since I put this on and it is pretty

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.660 
since I put this on and it is pretty
warm<00:03:22.660> out<00:03:22.840> today<00:03:22.900> it's<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.650> low<00:03:23.980> 80s<00:03:24.430> so

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
warm out today it's in the low 80s so

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.940 
warm out today it's in the low 80s so
this<00:03:24.940> is<00:03:25.120> working<00:03:25.390> pretty<00:03:25.690> good<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:26.740> you're

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
this is working pretty good if you're

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.460 
this is working pretty good if you're
doing<00:03:27.190> multiple<00:03:27.670> colonies<00:03:28.270> it's<00:03:29.200> nice<00:03:29.440> to

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
doing multiple colonies it's nice to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.340 
doing multiple colonies it's nice to
have<00:03:29.710> 125<00:03:33.510> shoulder<00:03:34.510> few<00:03:34.780> words<00:03:35.020> with<00:03:35.290> you

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
have 125 shoulder few words with you

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.240 
have 125 shoulder few words with you
just<00:03:35.800> because<00:03:35.920> the<00:03:37.530> Gilkey<00:03:38.530> keep<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.040> busy

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
just because the Gilkey keep you busy

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.850 
just because the Gilkey keep you busy
going<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:40.000> along<00:03:40.360> by<00:03:41.020> spreading<00:03:41.350> them<00:03:41.590> out<00:03:41.680> on

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
going all along by spreading them out on

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.170 
going all along by spreading them out on
many<00:03:42.040> colonies<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:45.310> it's<00:03:45.550> cold<00:03:45.760> or<00:03:46.000> I'll

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
many colonies and if it's cold or I'll

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.090 
many colonies and if it's cold or I'll
cooler<00:03:46.570> out<00:03:46.720> you'd<00:03:46.930> run<00:03:47.140> more<00:03:47.380> fume<00:03:47.740> boards

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
cooler out you'd run more fume boards

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.580 
cooler out you'd run more fume boards
and<00:03:48.310> if<00:03:48.400> it's<00:03:48.550> warmer<00:03:48.940> out<00:03:49.060> you'd<00:03:49.270> run<00:03:49.510> less<00:03:49.810> so

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
and if it's warmer out you'd run less so

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.930 
and if it's warmer out you'd run less so
we're<00:03:50.770> going<00:03:50.860> to<00:03:50.950> check<00:03:51.160> this<00:03:51.340> one<00:03:51.550> out<00:03:51.610> right

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
we're going to check this one out right

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.260 
we're going to check this one out right
now<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:56.650> can<00:03:56.800> see<00:03:57.010> that<00:03:57.040> all<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:57.850> bees<00:03:58.030> have

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
now you can see that all the bees have

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:05.000 
now you can see that all the bees have
left<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.600> top<00:03:58.840> here

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.000 

and<00:04:06.010> pull<00:04:07.000> out<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.209> frame

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.460 

one<00:04:13.010> errant<00:04:13.370> be<00:04:13.549> but<00:04:14.540> you<00:04:14.629> can<00:04:14.810> see<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.319> it

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
one errant be but you can see that it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.670 
one errant be but you can see that it
really<00:04:15.890> does<00:04:16.160> work<00:04:16.400> very<00:04:16.459> good<00:04:16.880> for<00:04:17.810> driving

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
really does work very good for driving

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.729 
really does work very good for driving
the<00:04:18.709> bees<00:04:19.009> out<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.519> brims<00:04:19.850> know<00:04:20.660> when<00:04:21.620> you

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
the bees out of the brims know when you

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.350 
the bees out of the brims know when you
take<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.690> when<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.780> take<00:04:24.020> it<00:04:24.169> off<00:04:25.180> you<00:04:26.180> want

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
take this when you take it off you want

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.450 
take this when you take it off you want
to<00:04:26.479> put<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> screen<00:04:27.080> on<00:04:27.289> to<00:04:27.530> get<00:04:27.710> stop<00:04:28.009> the<00:04:28.220> beads

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
to put a screen on to get stop the beads

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.860 
to put a screen on to get stop the beads
from<00:04:28.610> robbing<00:04:29.150> it<00:04:29.240> because<00:04:29.419> they'll<00:04:29.570> be<00:04:29.690> right

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
from robbing it because they'll be right

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.499 
from robbing it because they'll be right
on<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.229> already<00:04:32.320> and<00:04:33.320> then<00:04:33.590> you<00:04:33.740> just<00:04:34.330> put<00:04:35.330> your

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
on it already and then you just put your

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:37.810 
on it already and then you just put your
fuel<00:04:35.810> board<00:04:36.080> up<00:04:36.289> back<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:37.160> repeat<00:04:37.789> the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
fuel board up back on and repeat the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.119 
fuel board up back on and repeat the
process<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.889> then<00:04:39.889> just<00:04:40.100> keep<00:04:40.280> adding

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.549 

adding<00:04:43.909> to<00:04:43.939> the<00:04:44.029> Super's<00:04:44.569> put<00:04:44.899> the<00:04:45.050> screen<00:04:45.379> on

00:04:45.549 --> 00:04:45.559 
adding to the Super's put the screen on

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:49.809 
adding to the Super's put the screen on
top<00:04:46.330> taking<00:04:47.330> off<00:04:47.479> the<00:04:47.659> last<00:04:47.869> one<00:04:48.669> put<00:04:49.669> the

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
top taking off the last one put the

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.239 
top taking off the last one put the
cover<00:04:50.059> on<00:04:50.179> and<00:04:50.839> then<00:04:51.020> go<00:04:51.199> to<00:04:51.259> your<00:04:51.349> next<00:04:51.709> colony

00:04:52.239 --> 00:04:52.249 
cover on and then go to your next colony

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.999 
cover on and then go to your next colony
or<00:04:52.429> if<00:04:53.300> you're<00:04:53.509> using<00:04:53.869> multiple<00:04:54.469> colonies

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
or if you're using multiple colonies

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.820 
or if you're using multiple colonies
just<00:04:55.279> check<00:04:55.969> one<00:04:56.239> take<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:56.779> super<00:04:57.169> off<00:04:57.319> put<00:04:57.709> it

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
just check one take the super off put it

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.679 
just check one take the super off put it
on<00:04:57.949> the<00:04:58.099> air<00:04:58.219> check<00:04:58.580> another<00:04:58.909> one<00:04:59.209> and<00:04:59.479> just
