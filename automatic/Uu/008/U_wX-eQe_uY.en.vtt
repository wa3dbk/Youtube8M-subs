00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
in this review so first let's take a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.179 
in this review so first let's take a
look<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.590> pretty<00:00:19.740> nice<00:00:19.980> looking

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
look at it it's a pretty nice looking

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.340 
look at it it's a pretty nice looking
thing<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.820> pretty<00:00:21.570> show<00:00:21.840> accurate<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:22.230> looks

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
thing it's pretty show accurate it looks

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
thing it's pretty show accurate it looks
pretty<00:00:22.590> nice<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.039> more<00:00:23.640> clear<00:00:23.939> green<00:00:24.210> than

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
pretty nice it's more clear green than

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.990 
pretty nice it's more clear green than
it<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.720> cartoon<00:00:25.350> green<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.550> overall<00:00:26.820> it's

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
it is cartoon green but overall it's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.700 
it is cartoon green but overall it's
pretty<00:00:27.119> nice<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.570> if<00:00:28.019> they've<00:00:28.199> slimmed<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
pretty nice it's if they've slimmed it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.620 
pretty nice it's if they've slimmed it
down<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> little<00:00:29.189> bit<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.490> seems<00:00:29.699> more<00:00:30.480> than

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
down a little bit it seems more than

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
down a little bit it seems more than
last<00:00:30.810> year's<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.619> still<00:00:31.769> a<00:00:31.830> little<00:00:31.949> bit

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
last year's but it's still a little bit

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
last year's but it's still a little bit
clunky<00:00:32.279> looking<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.570> order<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.870> fit<00:00:34.020> the

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
clunky looking but in order to fit the

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
clunky looking but in order to fit the
life<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.410> sounds<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.739> suppose<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> do

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
life and sounds I suppose I have to do

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.180 
life and sounds I suppose I have to do
that<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:36.870> adult<00:00:37.350> wrist<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.770> kid<00:00:37.950> risk

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
that if it's on adult wrist and kid risk

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.850 
that if it's on adult wrist and kid risk
quite<00:00:38.460> nicely<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> Omnitrix

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
quite nicely I know that the Omnitrix

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.319 
quite nicely I know that the Omnitrix
alien<00:00:41.190> viewer<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.550> came<00:00:41.700> out<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> don't<00:00:42.180> know

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
alien viewer that came out I don't know

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.420 
alien viewer that came out I don't know
if<00:00:42.450> anybody<00:00:42.809> got<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:44.040> had<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> hard

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
if anybody got that but it had a hard

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.770 
if anybody got that but it had a hard
time<00:00:44.520> popping<00:00:44.969> off<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.329> new<00:00:45.510> type<00:00:45.750> of

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
time popping off with this new type of

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.869 
time popping off with this new type of
wrist<00:00:46.590> strap<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.280> stays<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> quite

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
wrist strap but this one stays on quite

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.160 
wrist strap but this one stays on quite
nicely<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.629> like<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.840> let<00:00:51.840> me<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
nicely and I like it so let me show you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.639 
nicely and I like it so let me show you
what<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.410> does<00:00:52.680> standardly<00:00:54.260> okay<00:00:55.260> first<00:00:55.530> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
what this does standardly okay first you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.779 
what this does standardly okay first you
want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> turn<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.100> on<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.309> this<00:00:56.399> switch<00:00:56.610> down

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
want to turn it on with this switch down

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
want to turn it on with this switch down
here<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> bottom<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> we'll<00:00:58.020> make<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
here on the bottom and we'll make that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
here on the bottom and we'll make that
noise<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.520> want<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> push<00:00:59.879> this

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
noise and then you want to push this

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
noise and then you want to push this
button<00:01:00.210> that's<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.629> here<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.410> activate<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
button that's right here to activate it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.260 
button that's right here to activate it
now<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.489> twist<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> around<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.090> it'll

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
now you can twist it around and it'll

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.660 
now you can twist it around and it'll
make<00:01:06.470> noise<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:08.040> nailing<00:01:08.520> any

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
make noise if you're nailing any

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.730 
make noise if you're nailing any
another<00:01:08.880> no<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
another no one in there right now and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.870 
another no one in there right now and
then<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.100> push<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> down<00:01:11.430> it'll<00:01:11.670> just

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
then when you push it down it'll just

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.190 
then when you push it down it'll just
make<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.060> generic<00:01:12.299> noise<00:01:13.850> now<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.630> real<00:01:15.840> genius

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
make a generic noise now the real genius

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.440 
make a generic noise now the real genius
in<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.560> toy<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.640> alien<00:01:18.030> figures<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.390> can

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in this toy is the alien figures you can

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
in this toy is the alien figures you can
pop<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:18.960> they'll<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.290> say<00:01:19.680> their<00:01:19.860> name

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
pop on here they'll each say their name

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.620 
pop on here they'll each say their name
such<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:20.670> Ben<00:01:20.850> does<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> show<00:01:21.420> many

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
such as Ben does in the show many

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.810 
such as Ben does in the show many
transforms<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:25.820> now

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
transforms which I have right there now

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.340 
transforms which I have right there now
this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.180> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.540> drag<00:01:27.780> feature<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.259> you

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
this is kind of a drag feature if you

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
this is kind of a drag feature if you
don't<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.590> collecting<00:01:28.950> figures<00:01:29.610> because

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
don't like collecting figures because

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
don't like collecting figures because
it'll<00:01:30.090> cost<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.720> little<00:01:31.320> bit<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.740> all

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it'll cost you a little bit to get all

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.289 
it'll cost you a little bit to get all
of<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.130> but<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.369> does<00:01:32.490> come<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.700> swamp<00:01:33.060> fire

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
of them but it does come a swamp fire

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.920 
of them but it does come a swamp fire
which<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:35.430> here<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.390> swamp<00:01:36.689> fire

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
which is right here this swamp fire
