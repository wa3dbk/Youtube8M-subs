 and thank you all for being here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.230
 to help me overcome this ordeal 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 because it's a sick tweet 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 so so as you can see gp 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.820
 task so if my first time banal 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.510
 stop repeating ourselves then so that 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.360
 yes that's so then its face value on 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.640
 scene tonight so I start my 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.020
 career in front of you and when we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.340
 start to cries of comedians so we 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.680
 is obliged to go through a first 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
 step that is mandatory unless we 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.940
 be total to social is the fact of 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.680
 announce it to his parents actually it's up to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 to say that you have to tell your parents 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.100
 you want to win the girl to say 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 bullshit and so we all have each 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.130
 Of all of you, we have all known at least 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.320
 once in his life this moment enough 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.080
 particular where you do not know how you 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.040
 want to explain confessed announce some 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.410
 thing of two genomes of the parents by 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.649
 example you little bank that is in front 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.970
 you had to announce to 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.290
 parents who vote national front you 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.530
 went out with a big black they 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.000
 dined in the cities of 93 and you 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.860
 whoever has lengthened in a fairly 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.350
 particular you had nothing there is very 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 a long time ago launched to your parents you that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.250
 you were homosexual but I think the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.580
 mylene farmer's concert day had it 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.580
 already understood 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.340
 but so for me so so 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.540
 actually I am Tunisian so what 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.560
 which means that my mother is Arab 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.510
 I leave you already now 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.070
 imagine the reaction he had when 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.810
 I announced to him while I was 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.580
 only graduates of the family and that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.980
 blow it's you know since four 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.260
 generations after hugh graduates so 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.520
 suddenly it was a potential wasted it's 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.410
 to say she could have done and that's it 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.780
 look at the doctors in the family a 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.770
 doctor press except that when I 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.470
 I told him I wanted to get started 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.610
 in the showbiz she wanted to punish good 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.610
 to come to my exit that 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.950
 a wooden spoon this is my 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:25.330
 exit this object the terror of the little 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.900
 butter who coach anyone who has known the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.200
 wrath of this beautiful toy excellence and 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.160
 the boat will not be able to support the 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.160
 old fashioned mashed potatoes 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 m 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:03:04.340
 I have a hole has also widened than yours 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:03:05.700
 suspicious city hall 9 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.800
 girls 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.290
 forget your opinion about tear gas 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.850
 but a lot of foot where it bothers you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.050
 feel safe on the street with that 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.040
 the wooden spoon 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.630
 practice near douala and here and there I 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.500
 Strikes me the bumps and the first time 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.210
 we got back the end is not 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 never good 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.120
 one kids we do not care so 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.130
 actually this object is discreet 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.870
 you have seen he holds in faith I 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.550
 is there a version there is a version 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.720
 shortcut that can go into 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.660
 any small handbag from 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:41.070
 bitch his design is timeless it's 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.540
 to say that really it can fit into 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.300
 any kitchen whether the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.800
 modern kitchens with a fridge that 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.640
 cost four thousand euros or so the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.640
 cuisines of the RhÃ´ne 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.090
 ergonomic its tight shape but 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.290
 slightly curved can replace 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.290
 any pine 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.390
 it is well there are some who imagined 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.410
 I do not even have to tell you 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.320
 you already have the nice people you 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.780
 fus is the fact of the best scene 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.780
 open to paris this summer to say that 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.490
 but so actually when I was doing 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.400
 nonsense my mother wanted to type me 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.870
 with that then no do not imagine 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.960
 a little way tiger woods so if 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.770
 if it's small smi is actually this 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.610
 object has two advantages 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.289
 the first is that since it's enough 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:47.220
 tense there is to bring suddenly there is 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.240
 no direct physical contact what is 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.560
 well because my mother when the 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.539
 kitchens and that she had a hand in 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.039
 parsley 6th football and buffets 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.389
 with his hand after I had the honor 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.560
 for a week and so has the 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.990
 second advantage but it is that these 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:05.820
 hollow stop all hollow so has it suddenly 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 it makes noise and when it makes sense 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.850
 low noise it's scary 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.430
 so the little brother he wanted to 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.050
 tile next yes actually my mother 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.210
 apply the same principle as for a 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.260
 public performance 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.979
 on this there is nice paris that starts 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.190
 which I leave you 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:19.190
 ciao 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.960
 Yes 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.319
 bages and facts it's not bad 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.599
 oh yes but I really thank you 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:06:00.550
 because I do not know if you have 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:06:00.550
 noticed but like that or not 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.229
 well then I have no current because 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:07.249
 that as we told you I do not have 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.330
 still doing sketches before tonight 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.169
 it's really my first scene a 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.539
 internship is this the first time you 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.399
 found before you kills that kind in 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.259
 more blood codes I work more 

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:16.520
 watches at the velodrome but you worry 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:19.360
 I do not usually debate but 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.360
 like all that alone 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:25.579
 I'm not used to not alone 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:25.579
 in this case, say m
