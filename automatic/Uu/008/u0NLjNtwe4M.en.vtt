products any creams that are in

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.910 
products any creams that are in
containers<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.840> can<00:03:36.989> just<00:03:37.170> take<00:03:37.440> off<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.739> top

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920

layer<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:39.750> this<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.020> may<00:03:40.110> be<00:03:40.170> easier<00:03:40.530> to

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
layer and for this it may be easier to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.199 
layer and for this it may be easier to
put<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.220> alcohol<00:03:41.520> in<00:03:41.640> a<00:03:41.700> little<00:03:41.880> spray<00:03:42.180> bottle

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.880 
so you can just spray the top I don't
have<00:03:44.850> to<00:03:44.970> dunk<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.600> into<00:03:45.810> little<00:03:46.170> jars<00:03:46.560> maybe

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.620 
have to dunk it into little jars maybe
you're<00:03:47.100> easier<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.880> also<00:03:48.180> spray<00:03:48.450> a<00:03:48.480> little

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
you're easier it also spray a little

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.930 
you're easier it also spray a little
alcohol<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.320> powder<00:03:49.739> products<00:03:50.220> if<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.640> want
