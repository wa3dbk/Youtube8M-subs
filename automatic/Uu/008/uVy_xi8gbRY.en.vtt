00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.680
 will start with this 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.639
 a little here the model sold is this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.459
 clean wave is on and let's start 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.039
 explain the air filter I am 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.720
 here is this black box that is in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.160
 highlighted in particular by several prisoners who 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.439
 You come here then. 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.720
 1 e 34 jataÃ­ previously show us more 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.570
 there are others who are here behind 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.360
 of this box and at the bottom of the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.830
 bike so we will begin to dismantle and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.790
 I have already previously disassembled 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.470
 screw 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.540
 the race is not so great and 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:45.180
 so absurd and goes on to explain the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.390
 bolts win here in jaru upon the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.610
 exterior with greater here exactly or 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.520
 is the same that is here is bad and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.250
 others here and still this one stays 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.220
 inside the engine compartment 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.900
 on the other side also because bcp has 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.600
 also a screw that we also have 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.870
 that you take off both by pulling that screw 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.910
 pull up has this little piece that 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.700
 I stay someone who makes the height between 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:31.080
 dam teixeira pps also prestigious 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:34.140
 this is also here is already 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.420
 we only use 12mm key 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.900
 nothing but a key 2 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.280
 millimeters and a philips key here 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.710
 precisely the same is us 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.070
 when we take a floor until the rain is 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.760
 that piece height that this piece that 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.680
 Let's put here are also 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.850
 slightly different from the others. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.049
 consider this no difference 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.180
 of pps is much better 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.390
 Let's make this time and this is fine. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.979
 shorter does not confuse cida we 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.979
 need a philips key 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 You can see there but it 's a key. 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.280
 from roland garros so 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.000
 now I'm going to close here I'm going and I'm going 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.739
 raise the area where we stand 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 example to now see that the two 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.370
 screws a little seen three days 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.519
 but this one is missing and because of these 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:39.829
 two we have to take the image off and 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.450
 hang the environmental scoundrel now here 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.709
 brought in here the prisoners who will 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.180
 disappointed I was just basically 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:53.060
 almost every show 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:53.060
 I just think that some of you to see is 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:06.060
 the more complicated it gets even if it loses 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:16.829
 here this model still has thanks to a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:19.349
 engine on the album is pretty well dirty though 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:28.889
 even more beast fuze this profuse here 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:30.449
 and let's take it now I'm always with a 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:41.730
 key debuted a key philips like 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:44.069
 You want to call and another now only 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.669
 realize this is my first video 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.620
 so I hope there's something 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:52.889
 there are very few viruses actually done 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.659
 Why the Portuguese are out there? 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.099
 out 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.859
 people who are making so the 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.479
 short videos to help others 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.199
 to start I will be the first to 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:06.060
 make a difference 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:08.160
 this is the old man's movie 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.180
 I'm going to come here now and I bought a filter. 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.130
 have to be even on the wave can not 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.739
 get as filter unless love 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.639
 own time even you do not walk 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:23.250
 This is the difference of a filter other 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:27.120
 agreement already exists a great difference 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.350
 is now not only applied to the 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.550
 reverse order is cover 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:44.940
 now let's start by putting pq aki 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:46.889
 place of the other screw already in the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.889
 put it there is only doing this with a 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:55.350
 hand that was acting a little like this one 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:56.700
 little harder we could think so 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.070
 that we are capable 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.770
 I think this is a problem that I 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.389
 has grown slightly slightly 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.260
 oil 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:20.930
 I think death in the morning of this trick 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:24.870
 here at home a token check 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.500
 I should start going out here. 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:34.320
 to cheer 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:36.539
 I think the dollar happened the fact that 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:40.860
 other all the dirtiest use 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:46.289
 so here's a tip not put 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:49.410
 soon 90 for a little less than 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:51.870
 a little more convenient the movie is already with 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.669
 the car now replaces 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:59.150
 would do everything exactly the other way around 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.440
 replace the cover 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.760
 We have so I'll try only 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.720
 fitted 0 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.300
 saying that it has very little 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:18.669
 training battery now that tight 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:23.120
 one two three four five six screws 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:27.050
 then we can then download again 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:33.129
 partnership would be like this you 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:33.129
 You see, it was five years ago. 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.340
 in reverse order everything is back 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.870
 normal 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.629
 let's just say screw the 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.789
 next game is normal 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:07:07.669
 then iron first 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:07:10.270
 then himself because he wanted to do the 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:18.669
 same side and put these products here 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:18.669
 another here and so does an air filter
