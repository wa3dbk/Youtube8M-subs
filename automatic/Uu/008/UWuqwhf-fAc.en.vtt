shoulder shimmy said just because your
shoulders<00:00:49.360> move<00:00:49.690> does<00:00:50.290> not<00:00:50.530> mean<00:00:50.710> you're

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
shoulders move does not mean you're

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:52.799 
shoulders move does not mean you're
doing<00:00:50.920> a<00:00:51.100> chest<00:00:51.340> genie<00:00:51.640> however<00:00:52.090> a<00:00:52.420> lot<00:00:52.780> of

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
doing a chest genie however a lot of

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.090 
doing a chest genie however a lot of
times<00:00:52.930> when<00:00:53.230> you<00:00:53.320> do<00:00:53.410> in<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.590> chest<00:00:53.829> genie

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
times when you do in a chest genie

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.440 
times when you do in a chest genie
you're<00:00:54.280> actually<00:00:54.640> moving<00:00:54.820> your<00:00:55.000> forms<00:00:55.360> as

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:55.450 
you're actually moving your forms as

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.880 
you're actually moving your forms as
well<00:00:55.600> the<00:00:55.930> two<00:00:56.050> things<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.290> connects<00:00:56.680> it<00:00:56.800> so

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
well the two things that connects it so

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.690 
well the two things that connects it so
you<00:00:56.980> cannot<00:00:57.160> have<00:00:57.250> two

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
you cannot have two

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.180 
you cannot have two
so<00:00:58.030> just<00:00:58.510> genie<00:00:58.750> is<00:00:58.989> basically<00:00:59.379> your<00:00:59.649> moves<00:00:59.890> it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
so just genie is basically your moves it

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.290 
so just genie is basically your moves it
moving<00:01:00.670> side<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:00.910> side

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.970 
moving side to side

the<00:01:47.140> move<00:01:47.320> but<00:01:47.860> don't<00:01:48.250> push<00:01:48.430> too<00:01:48.460> far<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.119> the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
the move but don't push too far to the

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.550 
the move but don't push too far to the
point<00:01:49.479> where<00:01:49.689> you're<00:01:49.810> stretching<00:01:50.350> the

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
point where you're stretching the

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.620 
point where you're stretching the
muscles<00:01:51.009> in<00:01:51.100> your<00:01:51.130> chest<00:01:51.549> because<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.390> want

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
muscles in your chest because you want

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.080 
muscles in your chest because you want
it<00:01:52.689> to<00:01:52.840> be<00:01:52.960> relaxed<00:01:53.710> in<00:01:53.829> order<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.490> shake<00:01:54.820> them

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
it to be relaxed in order to shake them

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.330 
it to be relaxed in order to shake them
so<00:01:55.390> monetize<00:01:55.810> people<00:01:56.170> what's<00:01:56.710> too<00:01:56.920> far<00:01:57.159> and

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
so monetize people what's too far and

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.219 
so monetize people what's too far and
they<00:01:57.490> do<00:01:57.549> things<00:01:57.880> like<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:58.659> then<00:01:59.140> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
they do things like this and then the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.330 
they do things like this and then the
Aybar<00:01:59.530> gets<00:01:59.770> shaken

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
Aybar gets shaken

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.359 
Aybar gets shaken
well<00:02:00.790> the<00:02:01.090> muscles<00:02:01.570> in<00:02:01.840> your<00:02:01.869> chest<00:02:02.409> are<00:02:02.649> too

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
well the muscles in your chest are too

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.770 
well the muscles in your chest are too
stretched<00:02:04.030> out

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
stretched out

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.350 
stretched out
you<00:02:05.020> cannot<00:02:05.409> relax<00:02:05.950> enough<00:02:06.549> to<00:02:06.790> shake<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.299> you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
you cannot relax enough to shake so you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.030 
you cannot relax enough to shake so you
want<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:07.659> be<00:02:07.750> pushing<00:02:08.259> forward<00:02:08.679> just<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
want to be pushing forward just to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.469 
want to be pushing forward just to
highlight<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.399> move<00:02:09.640> that<00:02:10.060> it's<00:02:10.179> not<00:02:10.299> really

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
highlight the move that it's not really

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.940 
highlight the move that it's not really
a<00:02:10.509> small<00:02:10.810> motion<00:02:10.989> like<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.500> it's<00:02:11.739> not<00:02:11.890> like

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
a small motion like this it's not like

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.620 
a small motion like this it's not like
this<00:02:12.370> which<00:02:12.820> by<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.150> way<00:02:13.239> doesn't<00:02:13.450> look

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
this which by the way doesn't look

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.600 
this which by the way doesn't look
elegant<00:02:13.900> at<00:02:14.140> all<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.739> just<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.070> little<00:02:15.160> bit<00:02:15.370> push

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
elegant at all so just a little bit push

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
elegant at all so just a little bit push
forward<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.690> see<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.049> movement

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
forward so we can see the movement

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.600 
forward so we can see the movement
you<00:02:17.660> can<00:02:17.780> see<00:02:17.960> the<00:02:18.080> repeat<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:19.040> know<00:02:19.190> coming

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
you can see the repeat you know coming

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.130 
you can see the repeat you know coming
out<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.000> we<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.240> highlight<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> move<00:02:20.900> and

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
out so we can highlight the move and

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.890 
out so we can highlight the move and
then<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.560> really<00:02:21.770> basically<00:02:22.160> relax<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.420> don't

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
then we really basically relax and don't

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.360 
then we really basically relax and don't
think<00:02:24.050> about<00:02:24.140> moving<00:02:24.590> any<00:02:24.830> other<00:02:25.010> part<00:02:25.340> of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
think about moving any other part of

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.710 
think about moving any other part of
your<00:02:25.490> body<00:02:25.550> so<00:02:25.910> another<00:02:26.090> mistake<00:02:26.420> everybody

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
your body so another mistake everybody

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.600 
your body so another mistake everybody
makes<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.590> know<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:27.830> dip<00:02:28.010> starts<00:02:28.310> doing

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
makes is you know the dip starts doing

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.160 
makes is you know the dip starts doing
this<00:02:28.730> why<00:02:29.210> should<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.450> need<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.780> chase<00:02:29.990> you

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
this why should I need you to chase you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.930 
this why should I need you to chase you
should<00:02:30.410> make<00:02:30.530> sure<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:31.160> really<00:02:31.400> relax<00:02:31.760> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
should make sure you really relax the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.230 
should make sure you really relax the
hips<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.290> really<00:02:33.530> focus<00:02:33.860> just<00:02:34.070> on<00:02:34.280> you

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
hips and then really focus just on you

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.660 
hips and then really focus just on you
know<00:02:35.360> bouncing<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> fat<00:02:36.350> in<00:02:36.890> your<00:02:36.950> breasts<00:02:37.580> I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
know bouncing the fat in your breasts I

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.880 
know bouncing the fat in your breasts I
just<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.090> that's<00:02:38.330> all<00:02:38.600> there<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.620> okay

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
just like that's all there is to it okay

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.660 
just like that's all there is to it okay
so<00:02:40.370> just<00:02:40.670> kind<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> wake<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.540> side<00:02:41.840> motion<00:02:42.670> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
so just kind of wake this side motion it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.080 
so just kind of wake this side motion it
does<00:02:43.910> take<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.710> know<00:02:45.710> some<00:02:46.070> relaxing<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:46.790> lot

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
does take you know some relaxing a lot

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.150 
does take you know some relaxing a lot
of<00:02:47.150> time<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.510> find<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.900> easier<00:02:48.320> to<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.710> by

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
of time so I find it easier to do by

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.470 
of time so I find it easier to do by
just<00:02:49.190> closing<00:02:49.580> your<00:02:49.910> eyes<00:02:50.060> and<00:02:50.090> kind<00:02:50.390> of

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
just closing your eyes and kind of

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.480 
just closing your eyes and kind of
feeling<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.990> motion<00:02:51.470> rather<00:02:51.890> than<00:02:52.160> trying<00:02:52.370> to

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
feeling the motion rather than trying to

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.430 
feeling the motion rather than trying to
look<00:02:52.730> at<00:02:52.880> yourself<00:02:53.270> in<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.570> mirror<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.080> try

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
look at yourself in the mirror and try

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.500 
look at yourself in the mirror and try
to<00:02:54.560> like<00:02:54.830> copy<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:56.090> know<00:02:56.180> because<00:02:56.420> you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.030 
to like copy and you know because you
can't<00:02:56.690> judging<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.470> then<00:02:57.710> you're<00:02:57.860> really

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
can't judging and then you're really

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.400 
can't judging and then you're really
like<00:02:58.280> don't<00:02:59.000> relax<00:02:59.300> are<00:02:59.660> you<00:02:59.720> really<00:02:59.900> watching

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
and then just feel you know the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.120 
and then just feel you know the
bounciness<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:06.020> your<00:03:06.170> breasts<00:03:06.470> going<00:03:06.860> side<00:03:07.100> to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
bounciness of your breasts going side to

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.820 
bounciness of your breasts going side to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
side and it really has nothing to do

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.990 
side and it really has nothing to do
with<00:03:09.860> the<00:03:10.070> size<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.400> your<00:03:10.460> chest<00:03:10.790> like

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
relax those muscles enough to be able to

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.380 
relax those muscles enough to be able to
see<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.260> motion<00:03:30.470> now<00:03:30.890> since<00:03:31.580> I've<00:03:31.790> decided<00:03:32.150> in

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
see the motion now since I've decided in

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:33.730 
see the motion now since I've decided in
their<00:03:32.510> chest<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.960> women<00:03:33.260> can<00:03:33.410> actually

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
their chest the women can actually

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.350 
their chest the women can actually
highlight<00:03:33.950> that<00:03:34.310> move<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:34.640> exactly<00:03:35.180> because

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
highlight that move in exactly because

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.050 
highlight that move in exactly because
we<00:03:35.630> have<00:03:35.780> more<00:03:35.930> fat<00:03:36.170> in<00:03:36.560> our<00:03:36.980> breasts<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:37.880> we

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
we have more fat in our breasts so we

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.460 
we have more fat in our breasts so we
should<00:03:38.240> be<00:03:38.360> able<00:03:38.450> to<00:03:38.570> relax<00:03:38.870> more<00:03:39.170> whether

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
should be able to relax more whether

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:40.810 
should be able to relax more whether
you're<00:03:39.620> small<00:03:39.800> or<00:03:40.130> big<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.520> makes<00:03:40.670> no

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
you're small or big it makes no

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.580 
you're small or big it makes no
difference<00:03:40.850> obviously<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:42.170> bigger<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.560> are

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
difference obviously the bigger you are

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.650 
difference obviously the bigger you are
the<00:03:42.800> more<00:03:42.980> pronounced<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.120> movements<00:03:44.510> will

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
the more pronounced the movements will

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.500 
the more pronounced the movements will
lead<00:03:44.780> but<00:03:45.080> the<00:03:45.260> movement<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.650> also<00:03:46.060> easy<00:03:47.060> and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
lead but the movement is also easy and

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.970 
lead but the movement is also easy and
possible<00:03:47.690> interfere<00:03:48.410> small<00:03:48.650> so<00:03:48.800> that's

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
possible interfere small so that's

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.949 
possible interfere small so that's
number<00:03:49.130> one<00:03:49.340> rule<00:03:49.550> is<00:03:49.670> relax<00:03:50.060> a<00:03:50.330> special<00:03:50.780> just

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
number one rule is relax a special just

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.430 
number one rule is relax a special just
for<00:03:51.050> a<00:03:51.200> bit<00:03:51.470> just<00:03:51.530> forward<00:03:52.010> enough<00:03:52.520> to

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
for a bit just forward enough to

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840 
for a bit just forward enough to
exaggerate<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.620> move<00:03:54.830> but<00:03:55.160> not<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.550> stretch

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
exaggerate the move but not to stretch

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.120 
exaggerate the move but not to stretch
the<00:03:56.090> muscles<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.140> chest<00:03:57.410> okay<00:03:57.740> the

them is always going to be pronounced to
more<00:04:23.830> depending<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.790> whether<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.120> do<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.330> a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
hips in place with your hands like this

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.700 
hips in place with your hands like this
and<00:04:48.160> then<00:04:48.460> try<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.730> do<00:04:48.910> a<00:04:48.970> chest<00:04:49.180> Jean<00:04:49.710> what

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
and then try to do a chest Jean what

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.140 
and then try to do a chest Jean what
that<00:04:50.890> does<00:04:51.040> is<00:04:51.190> not<00:04:51.340> necessarily<00:04:51.760> stop<00:04:52.030> it

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
that does is not necessarily stop it

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.520 
that does is not necessarily stop it
from<00:04:52.270> moving<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.660> helps<00:04:52.870> because<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.350> takes

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
from moving it helps because that takes

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.500 
from moving it helps because that takes
a<00:04:53.620> lot<00:04:53.740> more<00:04:53.800> practice<00:04:54.100> but<00:04:54.820> it<00:04:55.030> makes<00:04:55.360> you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
a lot more practice but it makes you

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.060 
a lot more practice but it makes you
more<00:04:55.570> aware<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.110> how<00:04:56.350> much<00:04:56.500> you're<00:04:56.560> moving

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
more aware of how much you're moving

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.500 
more aware of how much you're moving
your<00:04:57.190> hips<00:04:57.340> and<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.880> kind<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.030> helps<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> kind

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
your hips and it kind of helps to kind

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.930 
your hips and it kind of helps to kind
of<00:04:58.540> stabilize<00:04:58.810> in<00:04:59.380> yeah<00:04:59.590> so<00:05:00.100> you<00:05:00.160> really<00:05:00.520> focus

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
of stabilize in yeah so you really focus

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.560 
of stabilize in yeah so you really focus
on<00:05:01.419> the<00:05:01.900> chest<00:05:01.930> chi<00:05:02.590> another<00:05:03.220> way<00:05:03.430> I<00:05:03.460> like<00:05:03.820> to

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
on the chest chi another way I like to

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.270 
on the chest chi another way I like to
and<00:05:04.930> I<00:05:04.990> introduced<00:05:05.500> it<00:05:05.650> to<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.770> believe<00:05:06.010> in<00:05:06.220> a

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
and I introduced it to I believe in a

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.150 
and I introduced it to I believe in a
previous<00:05:06.610> video<00:05:07.140> was<00:05:08.140> just<00:05:08.590> sit<00:05:08.740> down<00:05:08.770> on<00:05:08.979> a

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
chair because sitting down on a channel

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.409 
chair because sitting down on a channel
really<00:05:11.740> isolates<00:05:12.340> a<00:05:12.520> lot<00:05:12.760> of<00:05:12.910> parts<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
something just because actually the only

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:34.350 
something just because actually the only
thing<00:05:33.220> you<00:05:33.370> could<00:05:33.490> possibly<00:05:33.550> move<00:05:34.180> without

thing you could possibly move without

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.870 
thing you could possibly move without
you<00:05:34.660> know<00:05:34.780> rocking<00:05:35.200> their<00:05:35.740> chair<00:05:36.100> so<00:05:36.400> try<00:05:36.669> that

as a little trick to learn okay

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:40.830 
as a little trick to learn okay
so<00:05:39.340> these<00:05:39.669> are<00:05:39.850> like<00:05:40.090> a<00:05:40.270> little<00:05:40.600> small

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
so these are like a little small

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.779 
so these are like a little small
mistakes<00:05:41.229> that<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.650> lot<00:05:41.860> of<00:05:41.890> people<00:05:42.220> make<00:05:42.370> and

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
mistakes that a lot of people make and

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.490 
mistakes that a lot of people make and
you<00:05:43.000> overthink<00:05:43.539> it<00:05:43.660> sometimes<00:05:44.080> trying<00:05:44.410> to

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
you overthink it sometimes trying to

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.900 
you overthink it sometimes trying to
move<00:05:44.620> water<00:05:44.740> on<00:05:45.070> a<00:05:45.100> part<00:05:45.340> of<00:05:45.400> the<00:05:45.490> body<00:05:45.640> at<00:05:45.850> the

same time and written a lot about
relaxing<00:05:48.400> and<00:05:48.850> a<00:05:48.940> lot<00:05:49.150> of<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.390> is<00:05:49.510> good<00:05:49.720> just

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
relaxing and a lot of it is good just

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.870 
relaxing and a lot of it is good just
kind<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.110> getting<00:05:50.289> over<00:05:50.680> that<00:05:50.800> stigma<00:05:51.310> as<00:05:51.490> well

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
kind of getting over that stigma as well

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.760 
kind of getting over that stigma as well
that<00:05:52.210> we<00:05:52.330> have<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.660> all<00:05:52.900> shaking<00:05:53.410> your<00:05:53.530> breasts

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
that we have of all shaking your breasts

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.560 
that we have of all shaking your breasts
socially<00:05:54.160> is<00:05:54.220> not<00:05:54.430> necessarily<00:05:54.880> acceptable

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
socially is not necessarily acceptable

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.090 
socially is not necessarily acceptable
and<00:05:55.690> so<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.840> lot<00:05:56.050> of<00:05:56.080> us<00:05:56.289> have<00:05:56.470> not<00:05:56.680> done<00:05:56.950> it

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.100 
and so a lot of us have not done it

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.680 
and so a lot of us have not done it
especially<00:05:57.640> I've<00:05:57.910> noticed<00:05:58.210> in<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.390> Western
