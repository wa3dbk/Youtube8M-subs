00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
see that my part is actually a side part

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.120 
see that my part is actually a side part
the<00:01:08.670> way<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.420> had<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.869> wig<00:01:10.049> made<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.650> was

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the way that I had the wig made it was

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.600 
the way that I had the wig made it was
installed<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.900> side<00:01:13.140> part<00:01:13.500> now<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.040> wore

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
installed with the side part now I wore

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
installed with the side part now I wore
the<00:01:14.790> side<00:01:15.000> part<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> while<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the side part for a while and kind of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.950 
the side part for a while and kind of
figured<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:16.979> side<00:01:17.610> parts<00:01:18.060> aren't<00:01:18.360> really<00:01:18.780> me

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
figured that side parts aren't really me

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
figured that side parts aren't really me
when<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.350> wearing<00:01:19.560> longer<00:01:20.009> hair<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.880> prefer<00:01:21.540> my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
when I'm wearing longer hair I prefer my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.690 
when I'm wearing longer hair I prefer my
side<00:01:22.020> parts<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.530> when<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> have<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> short<00:01:23.430> bob

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
side parts for when I have a short bob

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.399 
side parts for when I have a short bob
like<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.330> wearing<00:01:24.479> my<00:01:24.630> natural<00:01:25.200> hair

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
like when I'm wearing my natural hair

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.249 
like when I'm wearing my natural hair
out<00:01:25.680> when<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.670> installs<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.140> I'm

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
out when I have installs in and when I'm

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
out when I have installs in and when I'm
wearing<00:01:29.030> extensions

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
wearing extensions

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.780 
wearing extensions
I<00:01:30.420> really<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.470> middle<00:01:31.740> part<00:01:32.040> for<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.579> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I really like the middle part for me I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.050 
I really like the middle part for me I
just<00:01:33.060> hadn't<00:01:33.840> grown<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.460> side<00:01:35.700> part

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
just hadn't grown to like the side part

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.960 
just hadn't grown to like the side part
when<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> comes<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.869> loan<00:01:37.140> extensions<00:01:38.040> so<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
when it comes to loan extensions so I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.780 
when it comes to loan extensions so I
actually<00:01:39.390> decided<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.560> change<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.280> part<00:01:41.520> back

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
actually decided to change the part back

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.730 
actually decided to change the part back
to<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> middle<00:01:42.420> part<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.869> first<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to a middle part at first it was a

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
to a middle part at first it was a
little<00:01:43.829> bit<00:01:44.280> hard<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.240> change<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.079> because

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
little bit hard to change it because

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.480 
little bit hard to change it because
that<00:01:46.530> side<00:01:46.860> part<00:01:47.130> was<00:01:47.310> really<00:01:48.200> really

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
that side part was really really

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.170 
that side part was really really
prominent<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> definitely<00:01:51.810> had<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:53.090> part<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
prominent so I definitely had to part it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.389 
prominent so I definitely had to part it
down<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.479> middle<00:01:54.600> pluck<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> few<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
down the middle pluck out a few of the

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.569 
down the middle pluck out a few of the
hairs<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.939> then<00:01:57.390> use<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:58.110> wand<00:01:58.439> curler<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
hairs and then use my wand curler to

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
hairs and then use my wand curler to
flatten<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.570> hair<00:02:00.780> down<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.680> now<00:02:01.890> that

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
flatten it the hair down so now that

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
flatten it the hair down so now that
I've<00:02:02.219> had<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:03.360> middle<00:02:03.719> part<00:02:03.930> for

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
I've had it in this middle part for

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.760 
I've had it in this middle part for
about<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.579> weeks<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.930> relaxed<00:02:07.560> into

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
about two weeks it actually relaxed into

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.719 
about two weeks it actually relaxed into
the<00:02:08.039> part<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.970> whole<00:02:09.330> lot

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
the part so now it's a whole lot

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.820 
the part so now it's a whole lot
easier<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.539> wear<00:02:10.720> this<00:02:10.899> middle<00:02:11.230> part<00:02:11.379> I<00:02:11.590> don't

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
easier to wear this middle part I don't

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.360 
easier to wear this middle part I don't
have<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.190> constantly<00:02:13.019> flatiron<00:02:14.019> or<00:02:14.500> use<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
have to constantly flatiron or use the

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.750 
have to constantly flatiron or use the
wand<00:02:15.580> curl<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.420> lay<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.860> part<00:02:18.159> down<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
wand curl to lay the part down so that

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.490 
wand curl to lay the part down so that
it<00:02:18.970> looks<00:02:19.180> more<00:02:19.360> like<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.599> realistic<00:02:19.989> middle

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.460 
part so that was just a little kink a
little<00:02:23.650> bump<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.519> road<00:02:24.549> but<00:02:24.760> overall<00:02:25.510> now

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
little bump in the road but overall now

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.289 
little bump in the road but overall now
that<00:02:26.799> the<00:02:26.950> hair<00:02:27.129> has<00:02:27.370> relaxed<00:02:27.910> into<00:02:28.180> this

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299
