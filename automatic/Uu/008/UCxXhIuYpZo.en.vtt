00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.060
 Hello my friend, andress your island. 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.650
 I'll get late and remember. 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.230
 it's okay to put tv viewer 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.750
 mossoró touch only toxoplasmosis disease 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:30.380
 transmitted by cat feces that I 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.140
 Do not complicate me, but I saw it today. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.170
 a news that draws my attention 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.230
 an outbreak of human toxoplasmosis in the 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.140
 paraná region is for those who do not know the 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.620
 toxoplasmosis is a parasitic zoonosis 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.860
 transmitted through cat feces 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.500
 contaminated right is that it is a zoonosis 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.170
 transmitted by the infected cat is good 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.510
 that people have a clarification 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.720
 in this respect because there are a lot of people 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.900
 who has an aversion to a cat who thinks 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.180
 every cat in the street killed the cat 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.070
 transmits a lot of disease that the apple 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.799
 told me that I want to start with a 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.710
 Save the cat that is not well 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.469
 careful not only to transmit not only 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.549
 toxoplasmosis but goes but several other 

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:19.700
 diseases 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.189
 is not this disease is transmitted when the 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.929
 people started talking about cat year 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.420
 against direct contact with 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:29.149
 the feces of the infected cat or the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 be human and this may be the ingestion of 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.280
 raw meat undercooked meat do not speak 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.719
 direct contact with the stool or 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.789
 indirectly, right? 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.770
 is for example a food that has been 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.600
 engraved with background with water 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.810
 contaminated with feces 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.450
 this food can be transmitted 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.369
 even used the toxoplasma eggs of this 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.020
 portal and be transmitted to the 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.950
 the human being because we always 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.259
 recommends that you do not consume raw 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.310
 or underdone 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.609
 or vegetables that do not give us 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.270
 sanitized 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:07.849
 people confuse much with laundering 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.450
 vegetables washed food washed or 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.630
 for example a lettuce and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.880
 tomato a leaf any it should 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.760
 be hygienised with hypochlorite 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.310
 sodium that we know here as water 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.470
 sanitary is all housewife and only as 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.520
 does this and for people who have 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.440
 nor should it always be observed if it is possible 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.750
 I'm looking for a part to know the kitchen of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.430
 restaurant because sometimes the person 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.490
 acquires an illness like this 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.980
 toxoplasmosis and thinks it was directly 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.860
 has judged that house but necessarily 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.400
 not seen can also be transmitted by 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.130
 food or water contaminated back and 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.800
 any cat and what symptoms 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.520
 One always is because the symptoms they 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.980
 are 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.110
 are several in that person being off 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.900
 neurological science may have problems 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.600
 in the view that this west wave where 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.000
 people like the smell is not very 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.950
 seriously if you can not to lead to blindness 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.950
 this is very serious because the protozoan 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:13.100
 and it affects the retina then it can 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.410
 person to blindness in the animal does not 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.480
 practically only in acute phases and 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.670
 have symptoms but practically a cat 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.220
 with the best definitive host and reads 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.940
 practically asymptomatic ball takes 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.000
 also hepatitis pancreatitis is abortion 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.250
 in pregnant women in the first 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.680
 first text will be of gestation and 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.739
 complications can happen no 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.100
 for notions children can be born with 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:43.100
 the formation or even blind and then 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.130
 women who intend to become pregnant or 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.080
 who are pregnant and who have cats 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.640
 I do not recommend getting rid of the cat. 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.959
 it's not like that 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:55.370
 look for a veterinary teacher 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:59.209
 irritation deworming your pet make a 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.549
 clinical examination in animal logic takes 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.980
 Snow making clinical examination to wear 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.269
 health this cat because the cat well when 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.890
 He does not pass on why not 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.870
 matters when you approach this 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.580
 Andrew's topic as you told the cat 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.280
 everybody is scared right? 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.980
 anelka can not play with you cat 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.310
 there are no children who raise a cat but the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.359
 boy can be a pet 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.990
 usually without any problem if 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.120
 care for sure and a lot off and the 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.370
 basic care with cats dogs in 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.080
 In general, animals such as 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.720
 which should be done at each 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.180
 three months under medical supervision 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.440
 veterinary medicine, human beings can 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.110
 many problems like 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.110
 and if with the hygiene itself as per 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 example where you always go after 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.620
 wash the
