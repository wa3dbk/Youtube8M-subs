00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 almost sentimental where from below 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.250
 of my influence 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.030
 I want to communicate how much I love this 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.250
 gave me emotions up 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 now indescribable made me 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 to meet people who are not 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.279
 normal in the sense that I believed of 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.590
 be stupid 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.500
 but thanks to youtube I discovered that 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.469
 there are people more stupid than me and youtuber 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.719
 fantastic because even though many people 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.730
 complains is always there is always in 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.920
 ambush and does not want to escape from this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.180
 world wants to be part of it and I want to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.760
 be part of it 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 I have been making videos for two years now 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.309
 like the logic of the sequel to mine 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.219
 sign up and grow my ego 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:56.730

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.820
 be registered on youtube and I want to do 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.610

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.729
 people doing the same thing I did 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.010
 broke my balls really much of 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.909
 read about people who hates hate 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.159
 youtube but still everything is still there 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.390

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.280

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.880

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.000
