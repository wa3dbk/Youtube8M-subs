00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.090
 well I'm going to talk about the mushroom 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.470
 possibly the most used mushroom 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.210
 for several reasons not because it's the most 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.740
 rich but because we can have it all 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.529
 the year is possibly the mushroom of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.360
 crop that is most consumed throughout the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'm going to teach you how to clean it 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.849
 because we're used to giving it a 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.890
 cut over here take away the earth equal 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.610
 throw it in the pool to wash it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.770
 it can be a very good trick for 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.470
 clean it without having to wet it and over 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.990
 everything as we have it almost all year and 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.480
 we can consume it as someone who says almost 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.130
 every day it does not cost us anything or go 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.290
 to our first bad first macro that 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.540
 we find or directly they do not serve 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.990
 fresh home the day as they let 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.810
 I like to separate the clean stem the 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.310
 hat stalk you see the stem 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.800
 he removed the earth and then he can 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.920
 use for another elaboration and you see 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 What I do is make a small cut 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 in the hat part to remove 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.979
 let's say that cloth because that's what it does 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.520
 that is stuck to the stem you see with the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.520
 we remove it finger 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.210
 and with the knife giving a small 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.350
 pinch where we have done that cleaning 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 and turning the mushroom towards us what 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.970
 we are peeling in such a way that 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.610
 party that has been in contact with the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
 ground or with the transport box 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.590
 we managed to remove it and we do not have 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.090
 to put it in water that we get with 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.880
 that when we put it in the pan 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.980
 will not have that water that I have 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.410
 commented that when we throw a pan 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.510
 in a hot pan we throw the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.670
 mushroom and mushroom or any or 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.590
 any type of fungus if you have a lot 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.440
 excess water will go to the pan instead 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 to caramelize here you have a mushroom 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.619
 perfectly clean and ready to 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.619
 Cook 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.630
 well well finished cleaning all the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.940
 mushrooms 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 without having to go through the water 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.560
 we give it a strong fire with a little 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.010
 olive oil and will prepare a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.850
 stuffing for these mushrooms that then 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.160
 we will finish with a touch of oven is 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.350
 very simple a little salt to which you 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.090
 let's add a little leek and garlic 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.740
 tender 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:37.670
 this is going to be the basis of our filling 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.670
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.319
 and at medium heat we wait for it to be 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.319
 everything well poached 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.690
 once it is well poached 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.230
 the mixture of the agents and the leek 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.230
 we put peeled prawns 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.880
 a few to finish doing 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.130
 our filling 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.330
 we give it a couple of laps 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.790
 and just like that we can fill it 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:14.930
 the mushrooms because what are we going to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:17.090
 finish is giving them a blow of oven 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.900
 we place the mushroom directly on 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.900
 the oven plate 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.200
 we put them face up and put on top 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.780
 This filling of prawns with leeks and garlic 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.560
 tender you can also fill it with 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.400
 anything else gizzards 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.530
 and bacon make them 100% vegetables 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.860
 squid I do not know mussels I can think of 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.160
 a lot of things because nothing like that 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.069
 fillings 180 degrees 20 minutes and already the 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.620
 we have ready 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:56.140
 Well, we have those ready 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.810
 mushrooms stuffed with prawns 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.510
 well hot we can use it so much 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.230
 of skewer as a ration 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.060
 also as a garnish 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.790
 and the best thing is to serve them well 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.239
 hot, I'm going to prepare you a 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.700
 ration and we finished the dish with a little 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.829
 of liquefied mixed beet juice 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.400
 with a little olive oil to 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.690
 enhance the earthy flavor of these 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.970
 wonderful mushrooms that are the 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.860
 mushrooms the most consumed mushroom 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.969
 world 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.969
 there you have the plate 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.520
 do not
