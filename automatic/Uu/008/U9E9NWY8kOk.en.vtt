00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.209 
show you how all this works let's go and
let's<00:02:00.780> say<00:02:00.899> we<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.380> dial<00:02:01.619> number<00:02:02.040> now

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
let's say we want the dial number now

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.980 
let's say we want the dial number now
how<00:02:02.399> do<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.549> differentiate<00:02:03.000> between<00:02:03.210> sim<00:02:03.810> 1

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
how do you differentiate between sim 1

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.899 
how do you differentiate between sim 1
and<00:02:04.140> sim<00:02:04.320> 2<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:04.740> let<00:02:04.920> me<00:02:04.979> go<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.310> call<00:02:05.549> here

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
and sim 2 so let me go in the call here

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.469 
and sim 2 so let me go in the call here
and<00:02:06.140> then<00:02:07.140> let's<00:02:07.409> say<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.649> don't<00:02:07.799> know<00:02:08.009> you

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
and then let's say I don't know you

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.080 
and then let's say I don't know you
to<00:02:08.539> put<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.780> number<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.140> here<00:02:09.849> let's<00:02:10.849> say<00:02:11.000> you

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
to put a number in here let's say you

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.820 
to put a number in here let's say you
put<00:02:11.269> this<00:02:11.420> number<00:02:11.629> in<00:02:11.959> there<00:02:12.140> and<00:02:12.379> you<00:02:12.530> want<00:02:12.680> to

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
put this number in there and you want to

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.619 
put this number in there and you want to
call<00:02:13.040> this<00:02:13.250> if<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.819> look<00:02:13.970> down<00:02:14.120> here<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.360> says

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
call this if you look down here you says

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.350 
call this if you look down here you says
it<00:02:14.840> says<00:02:15.019> number<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:15.980> number<00:02:16.670> two<00:02:16.849> that's

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
it says number one and number two that's

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.309 
it says number one and number two that's
basically<00:02:17.569> how<00:02:17.720> you<00:02:17.750> differentiate<00:02:18.080> it

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
basically how you differentiate it

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.990 
basically how you differentiate it
number<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.680> remembers<00:02:19.069> my<00:02:19.190> Hong<00:02:19.400> Kong<00:02:19.640> number

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
number one remembers my Hong Kong number

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.580 
number one remembers my Hong Kong number
and<00:02:20.180> number<00:02:20.360> two<00:02:20.510> is<00:02:20.569> my<00:02:20.659> USA<00:02:21.049> so<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.260> get<00:02:21.500> to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
and number two is my USA so you get to

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.339 
and number two is my USA so you get to
pick<00:02:21.769> which<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.879> you<00:02:23.150> want<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.569> call<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
pick which one you want to call and the

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.559 
pick which one you want to call and the
same<00:02:24.590> thing<00:02:24.769> with<00:02:24.920> text<00:02:25.220> messages<00:02:25.760> you<00:02:25.970> know

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
same thing with text messages you know

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.770 
same thing with text messages you know
because<00:02:26.959> if<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.470> put<00:02:27.799> a<00:02:28.299> text<00:02:29.299> message<00:02:29.629> in

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
because if you put a text message in

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.470 
because if you put a text message in
here<00:02:30.049> it'll<00:02:30.620> give<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:30.860> same<00:02:31.099> option<00:02:31.580> you

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
here it'll give you the same option you

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.750 
here it'll give you the same option you
can<00:02:32.660> I<00:02:33.319> don't<00:02:34.190> know<00:02:34.280> if<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:34.519> see<00:02:34.640> the
