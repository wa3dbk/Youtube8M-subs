that's<00:01:44.460> pretty<00:01:44.610> much<00:01:44.880> what's<00:01:45.090> gonna<00:01:45.210> happen<00:01:45.570> a

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
that's pretty much what's gonna happen a

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.950 
that's pretty much what's gonna happen a
lot<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:47.670> guys<00:01:47.790> can<00:01:48.000> go<00:01:48.090> check<00:01:48.149> my<00:01:48.420> videos<00:01:48.720> out

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
lot you guys can go check my videos out

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
lot you guys can go check my videos out
I<00:01:49.200> run<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.250> play<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> ton<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.420> only

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
I run that play a ton and then the only

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.060 
I run that play a ton and then the only
other<00:01:51.720> time<00:01:52.049> I'll<00:01:52.229> throw<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.619> route<00:01:52.829> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
other time I'll throw that route is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
other time I'll throw that route is
versus<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> cover<00:01:53.909> two<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.390> versus<00:01:55.110> our<00:01:55.229> cover

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
versus a cover two and versus our cover

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
versus a cover two and versus our cover
to<00:01:55.590> you<00:01:55.680> what<00:01:55.799> you're<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.299> it's<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
to you what you're gonna do it's a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.520 
to you what you're gonna do it's a
little<00:01:57.630> different<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.110> you'll<00:01:58.259> still<00:01:58.409> be

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
little different but you'll still be

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.770 
little different but you'll still be
able<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> big<00:01:59.189> chunky<00:01:59.549> yardage<00:01:59.909> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
able to get a big chunky yardage so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.240 
able to get a big chunky yardage so
ideally<00:02:01.170> with<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.380> cover<00:02:01.590> -<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.159> to

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
ideally with the cover - you want to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249 
ideally with the cover - you want to
wait<00:02:02.399> until<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.909> zone<00:02:03.180> clears<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.110> want

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
wait until the zone clears is you want

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.500 
wait until the zone clears is you want
to<00:02:04.320> wait<00:02:04.439> until<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.680> closes<00:02:05.399> zone

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
to wait until it closes zone

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.080 
to wait until it closes zone
and<00:02:06.600> then<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:07.140> throw<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.729> bullet<00:02:08.729> pass

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and then you want to throw a bullet pass

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.920 
and then you want to throw a bullet pass
to<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.479> outside<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.130> this<00:02:11.220> case<00:02:11.460> it'll<00:02:11.700> be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
to the outside so in this case it'll be

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.150 
to the outside so in this case it'll be
I'll<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:13.110> throwing<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.560> square<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.070> I'll

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
I'll be throwing it to square and I'll

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.480 
I'll be throwing it to square and I'll
be<00:02:14.280> I'll<00:02:14.610> be<00:02:14.700> holding<00:02:15.200> left<00:02:16.200> on<00:02:16.470> my<00:02:16.830> analog

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
be I'll be holding left on my analog

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.240 
be I'll be holding left on my analog
stick<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:18.000> throw<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.510> outside<00:02:19.160> so<00:02:20.160> as

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
