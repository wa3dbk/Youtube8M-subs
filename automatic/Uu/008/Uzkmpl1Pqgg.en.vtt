00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello nice to welcome you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.450
 today I am with one of the crises 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.529
 I hope to welcome you very quickly 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 the new establishment that comes 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.490
 to open that's called freedom with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.260
 a whole range of products very 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.660
 similar to josephine but crilan on 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 means in a different atmosphere 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
 the cage not that comes from the idea in 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.849
 do I really like things a 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.080
 little playful actually in the universe of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.630
 gastronomy and things a little bit 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 diverted is always a small strand 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.780
 of humor something a little offbeat 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.219
 so here the idea was really 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.809
 to use so severe your as all the 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.790
 world knew so in the canteen with the 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.129
 nice game we had all we had 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.050
 asking how old we were at the bottom of the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.590
 glass so we tried to think about 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 a series of dessert around 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.649
 this worm so it was called so the tac 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:09.540
 and here I have so today we're going 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:12.600
 see the rom word of both started 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.700
 to realize therefore the syrup of the bobo is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.080
 to say that it is a syrup so from 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
 from above 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.560
 so I'm going to boil this syrup I 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 will put the cinnamon studio 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.990
 star anise 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.820
 I also use a pepper are from 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.070
 hot so it's a pepper that comes 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.740
 from Asia that has a connotation a little 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.619
 little citrus use or slightly minty 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.439
 a little bit that electrifies the tongue 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.869
 and here is his pretty signature on the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.979
 syrup the lemon zest and the 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.189
 lemons antilles and laurent and the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.189
 vanilla 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 we will be careful in fact in 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.670
 spice something very strong that's 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.750
 badiane from the boil we go 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.310
 let steep for two to three 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.380
 minutes and we will remove the badiane the 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.070
 badiane takes over too much on the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.740
 syrup and it's way too strong the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.709
 remains of spices it works in Japan is 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.099
 the ciron cool down around 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.989
 50 55 degrees and there I put so the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.380
 babas that were cooked and after drying 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:26.600
 so here is I imbibe them 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.489
 for about 25 minutes so then 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.459
 I'll make the whipped cream 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.980
 cream so obviously very cold 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.430
 10% sugar and therefore vanilla trading 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.900
 so the same thing as just now I 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.459
 always do it on one side for 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.920
 prevent the seeds from spreading 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.920
 everywhere and so after 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.480
 so here you go 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.780
 abounding 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.159
 a little trick actually to know 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.060
 when the cream is just mounted it works 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.920
 with liquid cream 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.989
 when you observe a liquid cream 2 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.940
 with cream the ekiden shines from then on 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.260
 where she starts to be riding cream 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.360
 becomes slightly dull 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.340
 as soon as she becomes that she started from 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.810
 this matify you have to stop either the 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.579
 Cream rises sufficiently so that's 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:26.940
 a little tip and that works 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:32.930
 really very well isolated so that's it 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:36.359
 so here we go the cream I really think 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.810
 that to matify a little bit is not 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.810
 the penalty of amendment 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:49.400
 we go there booked the aleba beat 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:52.650
 finally soaked there we'll let them 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.430
 drip nicely on a rack for 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:00.540
 to cool them the balloons were 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.159
 so a bidet and taste so slightly 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.690
 packed into his universe so now 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.519
 I will take the whipped cream 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.310
 I'm going to put on it I read them and 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:18.079
 whipped cream on the back so there we 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:23.750
 so we incorporate the small pipette 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.750
 filled with round and one small 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.139
 ah pastry cooks referent there are some 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.310
 I think many already I think 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:43.100
 I have my first pastry mom 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.680
 think I'm doing this job because thanks to 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:47.030
 she actually or because of her I 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.790
 a lot of cooking so that will give 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.100
 taste for cooking and cooking 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.510
 pastry we do this job on 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.010
 so happy when someone eats 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.150
 with the show it makes us happy that 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.860
 we have been good to love to do 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.240
 pleasure to people it is a job of 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.030
 meeting obviously so we 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.710
 always meets people on his 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.250
 way that help you fight 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.650
 transmission I met people from 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.419
 fabulous people including two in this job 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.270
 who me who are day references 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.919
 I started in Paris on pastry 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.620
 vergne de montcy so there I met 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.750
 the family of my shrink is the leader the 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.180
 jean claude chief vergne who have been 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.370
 very very important people and and who are 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.510
 very important in my in my 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.180
 universe makes it today 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.680
 after I met people like 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:37.360
 Helen Darroze I met people 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.800
 like and christophe felder people well 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.029
 obviously some enclosed stones that have 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:45.729
 always always everything is safe on 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.749
 dice the excellence of people also 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.229
 happy grand baker christophe 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:52.360
 to felder very influential people always 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.499
 admiring of the work they do and who 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.240
 Paul and their interest in 

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:57.039
 job so that's people the 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.580
 meetings after there are plenty of games 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:05.620
 So here we are always afraid of double 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:07.330
 there are people my pastry chef shot 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.490
 heart right now we worked around 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.949
 non-work around a pastry 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.080
 called it a reinterpretation 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.669
 always do it in the cream pie 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.219
 in fact it's really a pastry 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:22.060
 that we thought about two aspects 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:24.279
 cream in doing something 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.539
 very simple actually to eat a little the 

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.830
 cake that everyone knows that 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.469
 nobody has ever eaten it was a little 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:33.189
 a bit of an imaginary cake on the 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:35.110
 reference and then after we tried to 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.430
 think docked what we love 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.539
 eat what is it actually 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.520
 realizes that we have come to eat 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.430
 things that are pretty simple and with 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.110
 a quality of raw material that is 

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:45.849
 just in fact and so we worked 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.919
 all around the cream pie we have 

00:06:45.849 --> 00:06:50.789
 released a product that is really very 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.789
 very very very fast 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:58.250
 already it's true that cream is 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.840
 really a product that is hyper 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.550
 important in our pastry business 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.259
 because we only find one 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.020
 element in full of preparation 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.439
 that it be liquid whether it be in 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.870
 Crémant whipped cream it is 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:13.610
 just in jelly cream in crème brûlée 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.560
 so that's a product we've got 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.960
 need an excellent and have 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.550
 several properties of one that hold 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.279
 perfectly cooking that can 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.229
 abound with an outfit at the end that 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:27.159
 is optimal which is an event 

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.819
 regular then it's a support too 

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:29.900
 sorry we use a lot of 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:32.419
 vanilla it is true that one must have 

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.889
 supports that is sufficiently very 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.449
 good in fact quality to be able to 

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:38.110
 as sublime and his hummer has arrived 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.110
 fill the perfume
