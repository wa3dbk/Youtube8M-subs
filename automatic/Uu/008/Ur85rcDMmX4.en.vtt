the DMR now you use amp cards at any
point<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> game<00:00:39.420> before<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> game<00:00:39.989> during

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
point in the game before the game during

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.720 
point in the game before the game during
the<00:00:40.469> game<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.920> middle<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.370> match<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the game in the middle of a match in the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
the game in the middle of a match in the
middle<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> battle<00:00:42.180> but<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> have

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
middle of a battle but you have to have

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
middle of a battle but you have to have
them<00:00:43.590> selected<00:00:43.980> before<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.670> game<00:00:44.789> starts<00:00:45.149> now

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
them selected before the game starts now

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.810 
them selected before the game starts now
the<00:00:45.390> amp<00:00:45.660> Craver<00:00:45.989> features<00:00:46.530> explosive<00:00:47.489> rounds

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
the amp Craver features explosive rounds

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
the amp Craver features explosive rounds
so<00:00:48.090> my<00:00:48.239> idea<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.870> actual<00:00:48.960> crater<00:00:49.440> we

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so my idea is that the actual crater we

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
so my idea is that the actual crater we
an<00:00:49.770> actual<00:00:50.100> sniper<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.670> full<00:00:51.030> game<00:00:51.239> just

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
an actual sniper in the full game just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.299 
an actual sniper in the full game just
with<00:00:52.079> regular<00:00:52.410> bullets<00:00:52.620> into<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> explosive

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
with regular bullets into the explosive

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.590 
with regular bullets into the explosive
round<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.670> could<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.180> i<00:00:54.239> could<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.570> wrong

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
round I could be right i could be wrong

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.869 
round I could be right i could be wrong
but<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.350> do<00:00:55.410> feel<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:55.949> idea<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.579> pretty

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
but i do feel like my idea is pretty

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510 
but i do feel like my idea is pretty
probable<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.770> version<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probable that because it is a version of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.939 
probable that because it is a version of
every<00:01:00.000> other<00:01:00.149> gun<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> beta<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.920> now

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
every other gun in the beta so right now

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
every other gun in the beta so right now
you<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.579> we're<00:01:02.760> gonna<00:01:02.940> get<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> edge<00:01:03.390> with

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
you know we're gonna get it edge with

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
you know we're gonna get it edge with
the<00:01:03.750> burn<00:01:03.899> cards<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.890> die<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.100> lose

how useful the section a be besides it
looking<00:01:27.360> really<00:01:27.570> cool<00:01:27.750> but<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> gives<00:01:28.439> you

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
looking really cool but it gives you

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
looking really cool but it gives you
kind<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> like<00:01:28.860> an<00:01:28.950> Oracle<00:01:29.460> see-through<00:01:29.909> bones

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
kind of like an Oracle see-through bones

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.840 
kind of like an Oracle see-through bones
into<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> body<00:01:30.750> x-ray<00:01:31.140> effect<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:32.579> cool

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
into the body x-ray effect and it's cool

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.429 
into the body x-ray effect and it's cool
but<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.570> i<00:01:33.600> said<00:01:33.659> i'm<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.840> sure<00:01:34.110> how<00:01:34.200> useful

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
but like i said i'm not sure how useful

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.870 
but like i said i'm not sure how useful
it<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.740> actually<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.400> besides<00:01:35.700> like

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
it is actually gonna be besides like

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.859 
it is actually gonna be besides like
when<00:01:36.030> you're<00:01:36.119> kind<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.329> scope<00:01:36.509> people<00:01:36.780> out

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
when you're kind of scope people out

when you're kind of scope people out
we're<00:01:37.079> actually<00:01:37.229> camping<00:01:37.710> yourself<00:01:38.040> but

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
we're actually camping yourself but

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.160 
we're actually camping yourself but

really cook about the burn cards are you
can<00:01:40.290> call<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.619> at<00:01:40.710> any<00:01:40.829> time<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.220> know

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
can call them in at any time you know

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.620 
can call them in at any time you know
you<00:01:41.369> go<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.490> sorry<00:01:41.790> go<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> your<00:01:42.119> burn<00:01:42.270> cards

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
you go to sorry go to your burn cards

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.940 
you go to sorry go to your burn cards
and<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:42.930> call<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.200> an<00:01:43.259> image<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
and you just call it an image there it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.889 
and you just call it an image there it
works<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.610> there<00:01:45.299> are<00:01:45.390> some<00:01:45.509> actually<00:01:45.780> some

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
works and there are some actually some

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
works and there are some actually some
really<00:01:45.930> amazing<00:01:46.320> burkhard<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.009> know<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.579> can

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
really amazing burkhard you know you can

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.789 
really amazing burkhard you know you can
build<00:01:47.970> your<00:01:48.030> Titan<00:01:48.450> faster<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.380> increase

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
build your Titan faster you can increase

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.960 
build your Titan faster you can increase
your<00:01:49.860> running<00:01:50.250> speeds<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.729> can<00:01:50.790> make

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
your running speeds you can make

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.280 
your running speeds you can make
yourself<00:01:51.060> visible<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:52.020> longer

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
yourself visible for a little bit longer

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.620 
yourself visible for a little bit longer
so<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.579> use<00:01:53.759> those<00:01:53.909> things<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:54.299> burn

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
so if you do use those things right burn

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
so if you do use those things right burn
cards<00:01:54.960> are<00:01:55.079> gonna<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> huge<00:01:55.829> advantage<00:01:56.159> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
cards are gonna be a huge advantage to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.800 
cards are gonna be a huge advantage to
your<00:01:56.640> game<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.180> definitely<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
your game and you're definitely do a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.990 
your game and you're definitely do a
whole<00:01:58.140> lot<00:01:58.409> better<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.549> when<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.729> compared

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
whole lot better so now when I compared

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.670 
whole lot better so now when I compared
the<00:02:00.030> sniper<00:02:00.270> rifles<00:02:00.600> from<00:02:00.780> titanfall<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.530> some

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
the sniper rifles from titanfall to some

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.420 
the sniper rifles from titanfall to some
gundo<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:01.979> might<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> little<00:02:02.219> more

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
gundo you might be a little more

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.740 
gundo you might be a little more
knowledgeable<00:02:03.030> wouldn't<00:02:03.420> call<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
knowledgeable wouldn't call to the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.469 
knowledgeable wouldn't call to the
community<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.430> DMR<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> cipher<00:02:06.329> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
community so the DMR is a cipher the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.419 
community so the DMR is a cipher the
guys<00:02:06.600> see<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:07.439> much<00:02:07.500> everywhere<00:02:08.280> right

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
guys see pretty much everywhere right

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.160 
guys see pretty much everywhere right
now<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.819> i<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.690> definitely<00:02:10.080> compare<00:02:10.649> that

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
now and i would definitely compare that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.190 
now and i would definitely compare that
to<00:02:12.010> an<00:02:12.220> SVU<00:02:12.670> from<00:02:12.819> black<00:02:13.180> ops<00:02:13.420> 2<00:02:13.660> it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
to an SVU from black ops 2 it's

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.050 
to an SVU from black ops 2 it's
definitely<00:02:14.830> not<00:02:15.010> a<00:02:15.069> one-hit<00:02:15.340> kill<00:02:15.760> ants<00:02:15.940> we're

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
definitely not a one-hit kill ants we're

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.000 
definitely not a one-hit kill ants we're
hitting<00:02:16.239> the<00:02:16.270> head<00:02:16.540> but<00:02:17.140> you're<00:02:17.230> very<00:02:17.260> agile

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
hitting the head but you're very agile

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.470 
hitting the head but you're very agile
whether<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.310> can<00:02:18.370> move<00:02:18.580> around<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.090> can<00:02:19.239> jump

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
whether you can move around you can jump

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900 
whether you can move around you can jump
up<00:02:19.599> you<00:02:19.750> can<00:02:19.900> be<00:02:20.050> good<00:02:20.739> with<00:02:20.920> it<00:02:21.069> if<00:02:21.610> you<00:02:21.730> got<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
up you can be good with it if you got to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520 
up you can be good with it if you got to
aim<00:02:22.000> for<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.239> head<00:02:22.360> but<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.780> ACOG<00:02:23.080> scope<00:02:23.110> is

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
aim for the head but the ACOG scope is

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.010 
aim for the head but the ACOG scope is
quite<00:02:23.980> amazing<00:02:24.220> on<00:02:24.520> it<00:02:24.670> now<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.209> craver<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
quite amazing on it now the craver the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.449 
quite amazing on it now the craver the
other<00:02:26.260> sniper<00:02:26.590> rifle<00:02:26.920> was<00:02:27.010> kind<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.250> hard<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
other sniper rifle was kind of hard to

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.410 
other sniper rifle was kind of hard to
me<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> say<00:02:27.730> because<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:28.000> haven't<00:02:28.150> had<00:02:28.360> that

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
much hands-on time with it but what I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.479

anyways you know I think you'd be really
awesome<00:03:53.320> if<00:03:53.530> they<00:03:53.620> did<00:03:53.739> have<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.890> 66<00:03:54.519> just<00:03:54.730> human

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
awesome if they did have a 66 just human

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.699 
awesome if they did have a 66 just human
lobby<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:56.260> way<00:03:56.350> I<00:03:56.380> could<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.620> that

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
lobby and the way I could see that

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.020 
lobby and the way I could see that
happening<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.160> it<00:03:57.280> just<00:03:57.400> like<00:03:57.430> cut<00:03:57.670> off<00:03:57.760> parts

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
happening is it just like cut off parts

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.640 
happening is it just like cut off parts
of<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.209> map<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:58.390> know<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.810> in<00:03:59.230> call<00:03:59.530> of<00:03:59.560> duty

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
of the map you know and in call of duty

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.710 
of the map you know and in call of duty
black<00:03:59.920> ops<00:04:00.100> 1<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.790> believe<00:04:01.120> for<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.329> gun<00:04:01.510> game

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
black ops 1 I believe for a gun game

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.080 
black ops 1 I believe for a gun game
they<00:04:02.170> just<00:04:02.350> put<00:04:02.500> barriers<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.609> map<00:04:03.790> just

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
they just put barriers in the map just

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.550 
they just put barriers in the map just
to<00:04:04.540> not<00:04:04.660> make<00:04:04.810> it<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.019> big<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:05.319> think<00:04:05.470> it's

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
to not make it so big so think it's

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.660 
to not make it so big so think it's
definitely<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.010> doing<00:04:06.160> that<00:04:06.220> in<00:04:06.340> these<00:04:06.430> maps

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
definitely be doing that in these maps

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.390 
definitely be doing that in these maps
may<00:04:07.299> be<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.569> like<00:04:07.660> add<00:04:07.840> certain<00:04:08.769> areas<00:04:09.280> you

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
may be just like add certain areas you

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.750 
may be just like add certain areas you
can't<00:04:09.639> go<00:04:09.790> past<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:11.130> 66<00:04:12.130> could<00:04:12.310> be<00:04:12.459> an<00:04:12.549> actual

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
can't go past and 66 could be an actual

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.030 
can't go past and 66 could be an actual
thing<00:04:13.150> but<00:04:13.810> what<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:13.989> don't<00:04:14.079> see<00:04:14.380> being<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> thing

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
thing but what I don't see being a thing

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.120 
thing but what I don't see being a thing
is<00:04:15.479> 99<00:04:16.479> or<00:04:16.630> like<00:04:16.750> ground<00:04:16.959> board<00:04:17.200> because<00:04:17.680> even

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
is 99 or like ground board because even

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.979 
is 99 or like ground board because even
now<00:04:18.160> on<00:04:18.400> 66<00:04:18.880> when<00:04:19.120> there<00:04:19.239> are<00:04:19.450> at<00:04:19.570> least<00:04:19.599> like

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
now on 66 when there are at least like

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.420 
now on 66 when there are at least like
five<00:04:20.260> or<00:04:20.409> so<00:04:20.500> Titans<00:04:20.859> on<00:04:20.950> the<00:04:21.010> ground<00:04:21.159> at<00:04:21.250> once

five or so Titans on the ground at once

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.720 
five or so Titans on the ground at once
it<00:04:21.970> does<00:04:22.300> get<00:04:23.099> unbelievably<00:04:24.099> hectic

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
and confusing and kind of annoying

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.130

sometimes<00:04:27.580> so<00:04:28.360> if<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.630> imagine<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:29.110> being

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
sometimes so if you imagine there being

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.760 
sometimes so if you imagine there being
15<00:04:29.830> Titans<00:04:30.280> on<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.640> ground<00:04:30.880> at<00:04:31.060> once
