00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.599
 that's why the day in nine or ten or 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.759
 so no idea i just got it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.650
 Breakfasted and have no normal 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.110
 new program breakfast breakfast 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.989
 yogurt alternative to yogurt 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.630
 alternatively, there is no idea 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:31.070
 confesses biological vegetable youth 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.660
 alternative on soya basis 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.030
 I have addressed this new and that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.400
 somehow fits to mÃ¼li and otherwise 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 fruits and muesli can give and there 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
 Of course I had to do that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.079
 Try it right away and I found that 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
 really actually quite good I 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.500
 It had to be a little sweet because of it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.160
 rather, I believe for this sour 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.199
 but thought a bit 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.840
 Agaves of the father is really delicious 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.250
 in any case emerge and eventually 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.019
 even to buy again so I have 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.350
 done that now has normal cereal 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:05.039
 with a cut apple and a 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.860
 few cranberries and yes I really thought it was 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:11.640
 Delicious so it is definitely there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.899
 alternative to milk that existed today 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.429
 otherwise I do not know what it is 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.410
 Today I'll give up soon 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.880
 failed to make a weekly plan 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.759
 I have to start the week first 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.560
 started eating from one last 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.989
 Week plan was everything I was not 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.390
 So I ate for example the 

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:29.940
 Spartans here and so the rest of the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.899
 spartans here and so on and that 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.640
 parsnip risotto 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.380
 Maybe then I'll do the cinema today 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.090
 subscribers that is a very good idea 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.140
 I think we will see 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.979
 In any case, day no idea even for 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.110

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.800

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.840

 start and yes we are the same, so to speak 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.110
 Maybe I'll tell you if 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.000
 they gave cinema subscribers or not 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.250
 There were actually still the cinema 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.960
 What was not important to the cinema? 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.509
