00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
it's pretty much a bunch of computers

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
all right you know a box with the C
resembling<00:01:12.150> computers<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.530> bunch<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
resembling computers it's a bunch of

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.020 
resembling computers it's a bunch of
computers<00:01:14.640> connected<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:15.479> each<00:01:15.600> other<00:01:15.979> all

right so that's basically what a
computer<00:01:19.770> network<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:21.210> know<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.720> you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
computer network is and I know that you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
computer network is and I know that you
know<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> drew<00:01:22.680> these<00:01:22.860> awesome<00:01:23.220> computers

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
know I drew these awesome computers

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.789 
know I drew these awesome computers
right<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:24.659> whenever<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> say<00:01:25.229> computers

things<00:01:51.299> in<00:01:51.860> aside<00:01:52.860> from<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.340> know<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:54.119> these

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
things in aside from you know just these

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.300 
things in aside from you know just these
computers<00:01:54.960> being<00:01:55.409> part<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.920> computer

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
computers being part of a computer

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.340 
computers being part of a computer
network<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:57.060> also<00:01:57.240> have<00:01:57.540> other<00:01:57.780> parts<00:01:58.200> as

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
network you also have other parts as

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.480 
network you also have other parts as
well<00:01:58.500> as<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.860> guys<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.310> find

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
well as you guys you're going to find

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
well as you guys you're going to find
out<00:01:59.670> these<00:02:00.600> computers<00:02:01.170> need<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.530> way<00:02:01.860> to

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
out these computers need a way to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.950 
out these computers need a way to
communicate<00:02:02.610> with<00:02:02.759> each<00:02:02.790> other<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.810> this

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
communicate with each other and in this

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.080 
communicate with each other and in this
little<00:02:04.140> diagram<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.770> use<00:02:05.009> I'll<00:02:05.310> say<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.909> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
little diagram I use I'll say this is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.719 
little diagram I use I'll say this is
copper<00:02:06.390> cable<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.129> know<00:02:08.310> there's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
copper cable but as you know there's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.420 
copper cable but as you know there's
also<00:02:09.119> Wi-Fi<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.379> know<00:02:10.500> satellites<00:02:11.160> and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
also Wi-Fi and you know satellites and

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.890 
also Wi-Fi and you know satellites and
there<00:02:11.790> are<00:02:11.879> a<00:02:11.940> bunch<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.360> different<00:02:12.690> parts

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
there are a bunch of different parts

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
there are a bunch of different parts
that<00:02:13.140> make<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.500> in

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that make up in

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.580 
that make up in
entire<00:02:14.190> computer<00:02:15.060> network<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.960> isn't<00:02:16.380> just

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
entire computer network so isn't just

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.470 
entire computer network so isn't just
the<00:02:16.770> computers<00:02:17.280> themselves<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:18.090> we're<00:02:18.360> going

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
the computers themselves and we're going

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.290 
the computers themselves and we're going
to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.990> over<00:02:19.200> everything<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.910> basically

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
to be going over everything so basically

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.790 
to be going over everything so basically
let's<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.870> ahead<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.170> talk<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.320> little<00:02:22.590> bit

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
let's go ahead and talk a little bit

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.180 
let's go ahead and talk a little bit
about<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.640> copper<00:02:24.060> wire<00:02:24.300> or<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:25.290> Wi-Fi<00:02:25.770> waves

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
about the copper wire or the Wi-Fi waves

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.910 
about the copper wire or the Wi-Fi waves
you<00:02:27.090> need<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.690> part<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.530> computer<00:02:28.890> network

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
you need this part of a computer network

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.220 
you need this part of a computer network
because<00:02:29.580> whenever<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.330> connect<00:02:30.810> two

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
because whenever you connect two

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.220 
because whenever you connect two
computers<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:32.490> each<00:02:32.580> other<00:02:32.820> they<00:02:33.450> need<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.960> way

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
computers to each other they need a way

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.960 
computers to each other they need a way
to<00:02:34.260> pretty<00:02:34.770> much<00:02:34.890> transmit<00:02:35.670> data<00:02:35.970> or<00:02:36.180> share

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
to pretty much transmit data or share

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.110 
to pretty much transmit data or share
data<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.740> go<00:02:40.860> ahead<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.160> write<00:02:41.340> that<00:02:41.370> so

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
data just go ahead and write that so

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.180 
data just go ahead and write that so
that's<00:02:42.360> basically<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> purpose<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.800> a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
that's basically the purpose of a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.190 
that's basically the purpose of a
computer<00:02:44.610> network<00:02:44.640> because<00:02:45.300> if<00:02:45.570> you<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.050> go

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
computer network because if you just go

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.510 
computer network because if you just go
ahead<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.680> connect<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.250> bunch<00:02:47.400> of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
ahead and connect it a bunch of

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.110 
ahead and connect it a bunch of
computers<00:02:48.170> okay<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.890> is<00:02:50.040> pretty<00:02:50.280> cool<00:02:50.580> but

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
computers okay this is pretty cool but

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.850 
computers okay this is pretty cool but
why<00:02:51.390> on<00:02:51.660> earth<00:02:51.690> would<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.140> ever<00:02:52.410> want<00:02:52.770> to

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
why on earth would you ever want to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.979 
why on earth would you ever want to
connect<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.459> bunch<00:02:53.580> of<00:02:53.700> computer<00:02:54.120> as<00:02:54.209> well<00:02:54.390> the

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
connect a bunch of computer as well the

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.810 
connect a bunch of computer as well the
answer<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.530> right<00:02:55.709> here<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.190> share

a<00:05:40.389> computer<00:05:41.020> network<00:05:41.379> it's<00:05:41.650> basically<00:05:42.580> a

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
a computer network it's basically a

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.809 
a computer network it's basically a
bunch<00:05:43.180> of<00:05:43.479> that's<00:05:44.319> embarrassing<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.979> bunch<00:05:45.610> of

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:45.819 
bunch of that's embarrassing a bunch of

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.139 
bunch of that's embarrassing a bunch of
computers<00:05:46.509> connected<00:05:46.779> to<00:05:47.289> each<00:05:47.409> other<00:05:47.649> um<00:05:48.149> why

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:49.149 
computers connected to each other um why

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:50.579 
computers connected to each other um why
would<00:05:49.210> we<00:05:49.629> want<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:49.899> connect<00:05:50.199> a<00:05:50.319> bunch<00:05:50.469> of

00:05:50.579 --> 00:05:50.589 
would we want to connect a bunch of

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.679 
would we want to connect a bunch of
computers<00:05:51.009> to<00:05:51.039> each<00:05:51.339> other<00:05:51.550> well<00:05:52.120> for<00:05:52.539> one

00:05:52.679 --> 00:05:52.689 
computers to each other well for one

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:56.279 
computers to each other well for one
reason<00:05:53.039> sharing<00:05:54.039> data<00:05:54.580> and<00:05:54.939> what<00:05:55.599> exactly<00:05:55.930> do

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:56.289 
reason sharing data and what exactly do

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.529 
reason sharing data and what exactly do
we<00:05:56.319> mean<00:05:56.409> by<00:05:56.620> data<00:05:56.979> will<00:05:57.310> not<00:05:57.909> only<00:05:58.120> text

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
we mean by data will not only text

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.320 
we mean by data will not only text
documents<00:05:59.080> or<00:05:59.199> scholarly<00:06:00.159> documents<00:06:00.849> but
