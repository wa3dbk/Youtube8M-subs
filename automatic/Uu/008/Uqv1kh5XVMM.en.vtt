as<00:01:52.319> a<00:01:52.380> mirage<00:01:53.240> first<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.599> saw<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:57.080> form<00:01:58.080> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
as a mirage first I saw that form the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.410 
as a mirage first I saw that form the
pants<00:01:58.500> port<00:01:59.310> built<00:01:59.849> and<00:02:00.119> then<00:02:00.630> employed<00:02:01.439> an

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
pants port built and then employed an
