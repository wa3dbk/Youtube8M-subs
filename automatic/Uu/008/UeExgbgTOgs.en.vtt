okay<00:02:45.129> and<00:02:45.250> then<00:02:45.340> we<00:02:45.430> can<00:02:45.579> tighten<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:46.000> down<00:02:46.060> a

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
okay and then we can tighten that down a

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.449 
okay and then we can tighten that down a
little<00:02:46.389> bit<00:02:48.329> so<00:02:49.409> step<00:02:50.409> four<00:02:50.799> we're<00:02:51.190> going<00:02:51.370> to

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
little bit so step four we're going to

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.460 
little bit so step four we're going to
flip<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:52.299> working<00:02:52.690> yarn<00:02:52.720> back<00:02:53.670> behind<00:02:54.670> our

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
flip the working yarn back behind our

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.069 
flip the working yarn back behind our
knitting<00:02:56.470> needle<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.480> then<00:02:58.480> we'll<00:02:58.659> start

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
knitting needle and then we'll start

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.229 
knitting needle and then we'll start
repeating<00:02:59.590> again<00:03:00.010> from<00:03:00.220> step<00:03:00.489> three<00:03:00.909> so<00:03:01.090> we're

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
repeating again from step three so we're

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.199 
repeating again from step three so we're
going<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.389> grab<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.500> yarn<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.040> draw<00:03:04.000> it

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
going to grab the yarn and draw it

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.640 
going to grab the yarn and draw it
through<00:03:05.159> the<00:03:06.329> loop<00:03:07.329> that's<00:03:07.659> on<00:03:07.900> our<00:03:07.930> hook<00:03:08.379> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
through the loop that's on our hook and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.199 
through the loop that's on our hook and
then<00:03:09.549> we'll<00:03:09.780> bring<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.930> yarn<00:03:11.109> back<00:03:11.500> behind

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
then we'll bring the yarn back behind

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.610 
then we'll bring the yarn back behind
grab<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.450> yarn<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.900> draw<00:03:14.799> through<00:03:16.560> okay<00:03:17.560> so

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
grab the yarn and draw through okay so

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.839 
grab the yarn and draw through okay so
we're<00:03:17.829> going<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.040> repeat<00:03:18.549> steps<00:03:19.480> 3<00:03:19.599> &amp;<00:03:20.109> 4<00:03:20.849> until

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
we're going to repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 until

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.349 
we're going to repeat steps 3 &amp; 4 until
we<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.419> the<00:03:22.930> number<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.769> stitches<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.430> we

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
we have the number of stitches that we

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.970 
we have the number of stitches that we
need<00:03:25.690> for<00:03:26.319> our<00:03:26.709> cast<00:03:27.069> on<00:03:27.400> edge<00:03:28.239> so<00:03:28.989> depending

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
need for our cast on edge so depending

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.199 
need for our cast on edge so depending
on<00:03:30.099> how<00:03:30.340> many<00:03:30.629> stitches<00:03:32.519> your<00:03:33.519> pattern<00:03:33.549> calls

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
on how many stitches your pattern calls

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.839 
on how many stitches your pattern calls
for<00:03:34.359> then<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:35.049> would<00:03:35.169> do<00:03:35.319> that<00:03:35.590> same<00:03:36.400> number

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
for then you would do that same number

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:40.289 
for then you would do that same number
of<00:03:37.650> stitches<00:03:38.650> now<00:03:38.949> if<00:03:39.040> you're<00:03:39.159> doing<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.459> lot<00:03:40.000> of

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
of stitches now if you're doing a lot of

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.979 
of stitches now if you're doing a lot of
stitches<00:03:41.400> then<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:43.060> might<00:03:43.269> want<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.629> use<00:03:43.959> a

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
stitches then you might want to use a

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.610 
stitches then you might want to use a
stitch<00:03:44.349> marker<00:03:44.379> to<00:03:44.949> help<00:03:45.159> track<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:47.260> number

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
stitch marker to help track the number

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.759 
stitch marker to help track the number
of<00:03:47.769> stitches<00:03:47.949> that<00:03:48.159> you're<00:03:48.400> casting<00:03:48.879> on<00:03:49.090> and

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
of stitches that you're casting on and

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.250 
of stitches that you're casting on and
you<00:03:50.769> can<00:03:50.919> always<00:03:51.099> cast<00:03:51.819> on<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.299> couple<00:03:52.629> extra

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
you can always cast on a couple extra

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.330 
you can always cast on a couple extra
stitches<00:03:54.010> in<00:03:54.280> case<00:03:55.290> you're<00:03:56.290> not<00:03:56.500> positive<00:03:57.190> if

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
stitches in case you're not positive if

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.289 
stitches in case you're not positive if
you've<00:03:57.549> counted<00:03:58.000> properly<00:03:59.970> because<00:04:00.970> those

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
you've counted properly because those

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.170 
you've counted properly because those
will<00:04:01.510> be<00:04:01.659> easy<00:04:01.959> to<00:04:02.290> remove<00:04:03.780> when<00:04:04.780> needed

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
will be easy to remove when needed

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.520 
will be easy to remove when needed
alright<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:07.299> when<00:04:07.419> you've<00:04:07.599> cast<00:04:07.870> on<00:04:08.139> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
alright so when you've cast on the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.250 
alright so when you've cast on the
number<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.949> stitches<00:04:09.280> that<00:04:09.819> you<00:04:10.180> are<00:04:10.599> required

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
number of stitches that you are required

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.800 
number of stitches that you are required
by<00:04:11.530> your<00:04:11.680> pattern<00:04:12.159> then<00:04:12.909> we're<00:04:13.090> going<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.269> do<00:04:13.510> a

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
by your pattern then we're going to do a

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.800 
by your pattern then we're going to do a
little<00:04:15.510> set<00:04:16.510> of<00:04:16.539> crocheted<00:04:17.380> chain<00:04:18.060> loops<00:04:19.060> so

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
little set of crocheted chain loops so

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.779 
little set of crocheted chain loops so
we're<00:04:20.079> going<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.229> do<00:04:20.500> I<00:04:20.799> don't<00:04:21.250> know<00:04:21.279> three<00:04:21.639> or

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
we're going to do I don't know three or

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.899 
we're going to do I don't know three or
four<00:04:22.800> just<00:04:23.800> enough<00:04:24.099> to<00:04:24.310> give<00:04:24.430> you<00:04:24.580> an<00:04:24.729> idea

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
four just enough to give you an idea

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.940 
four just enough to give you an idea
that<00:04:25.539> this<00:04:25.900> is<00:04:26.229> the<00:04:26.500> a

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 
that this is the a

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.850 
that this is the a
that<00:04:27.430> you<00:04:27.580> want<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.880> unravel<00:04:28.330> from<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:29.050> we<00:04:29.710> can

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
that you want to unravel from so we can

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.720 
that you want to unravel from so we can
pull<00:04:30.070> some<00:04:30.370> excess<00:04:31.270> yarn<00:04:31.540> out<00:04:31.780> there<00:04:32.170> and<00:04:32.730> you

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
pull some excess yarn out there and you

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.550 
pull some excess yarn out there and you
can<00:04:33.880> either<00:04:34.090> cut<00:04:34.390> this<00:04:34.600> if<00:04:34.870> you'd<00:04:35.020> like<00:04:35.230> or

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
can either cut this if you'd like or

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.130 
can either cut this if you'd like or
just<00:04:35.890> let<00:04:36.040> it<00:04:36.070> hang<00:04:36.880> there<00:04:37.210> as<00:04:37.450> a<00:04:37.480> long<00:04:37.810> loop

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
just let it hang there as a long loop

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.080 
just let it hang there as a long loop
and<00:04:39.090> we'll<00:04:40.090> show<00:04:40.270> you<00:04:40.300> what<00:04:40.780> we<00:04:40.990> do<00:04:41.260> with<00:04:41.290> this

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
and we'll show you what we do with this

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.800 
and we'll show you what we do with this
in<00:04:43.090> just<00:04:43.360> a<00:04:43.450> minute

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.450 

all<00:04:46.810> right<00:04:46.990> so<00:04:47.140> we've<00:04:47.440> cast<00:04:47.920> on<00:04:48.070> all<00:04:48.220> the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
all right so we've cast on all the

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.850 
all right so we've cast on all the
stitches<00:04:48.820> that<00:04:48.850> we<00:04:49.150> will<00:04:49.660> need<00:04:49.900> for<00:04:49.960> this

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
stitches that we will need for this

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.370 
stitches that we will need for this
pattern<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:51.940> we<00:04:52.300> have<00:04:52.750> created<00:04:53.200> a

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
pattern and then we have created a

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.620 
pattern and then we have created a
little<00:04:53.800> extra<00:04:54.700> chain<00:04:55.030> here<00:04:55.630> for<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:57.600> flag<00:04:58.600> to

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
little extra chain here for a flag to

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.630 
little extra chain here for a flag to
let<00:04:59.080> us<00:04:59.170> know<00:04:59.350> this<00:04:59.920> is<00:05:00.100> the<00:05:00.190> side<00:05:00.400> we'll<00:05:00.610> be

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
let us know this is the side we'll be

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.110 
let us know this is the side we'll be
unraveling<00:05:01.570> our<00:05:01.780> provisional<00:05:02.460> yarn<00:05:03.460> from<00:05:03.700> so

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
unraveling our provisional yarn from so

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.560 
unraveling our provisional yarn from so
now<00:05:04.360> I'm<00:05:05.050> just<00:05:05.230> going<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.610> take<00:05:06.610> our<00:05:06.940> main

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
now I'm just going to take our main

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.140 
now I'm just going to take our main
color<00:05:07.870> of<00:05:07.990> yarn<00:05:08.350> and<00:05:08.710> start<00:05:08.920> knitting<00:05:09.760> into

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
color of yarn and start knitting into

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.840 
color of yarn and start knitting into
these<00:05:10.720> stitches<00:05:11.260> just<00:05:11.530> like<00:05:12.460> we<00:05:12.700> normally

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
these stitches just like we normally

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.150
