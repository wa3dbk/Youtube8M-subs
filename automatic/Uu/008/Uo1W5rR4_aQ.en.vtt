 hello girls how are i silvia and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.500
 this Thursday we are going to talk a little 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.840
 about caring for your hands so that 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.940
 your manicure lasts much longer because 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.380
 we are in our special week 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.300
 by neil art 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.279
 so today I 'm going to give you some tips 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.170
 to keep your enamel much more 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.460
 time and keep some hands like 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.020
 Princess 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.809
 to begin with you should always try to 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.610
 have them trimmed or cut if 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.860
 you like to have them very long 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.200
 ok but you have to take care that you do not 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 there is a lot of dirt under the nail 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 because this can generate germs and you 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.489
 you will not notice but when you eat 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.260
 something or you grab your skin you go and all that is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.750
 is going to go to your body then you 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.480
 you can wash you can get sick if you do not 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.430
 you take care of the cleaning of your dreams' to the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.500
 time to cut your nails the best thing is that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.499
 do it with a file and try to make the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.850
 lime is as well as flush with yours for 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:08.220
 that does not go in edges 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.470
 down when you have those edges 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 they also take the ill and the bad so that 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 Nothing remains inside your nails because 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.030
 with a nail clipper they will be very 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.250
 sharp and you can hurt yourself and it's a lot 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.500
 better to do it with a limits also 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 Another way to take care of your hands is to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 time to wash them try to use a soap 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 soft because it is what we are most 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.750
 washing in the day then I try to use 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.930
 a mild soap so it does not dry out 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.030
 skin do not use air dryers because 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.250
 this also dries it out a lot more and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.319
 always try to use a creampie 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
 after washing them to hydrate 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:45.149
 more also if your hands are very very 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.030
 dry if in these times where the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.490
 climate has changed radically the best is 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.420
 moisturize them at night with a 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.060
 Vaseline or some oil like coconut 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.580
 so that your hands wake up very very very 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560
 soft if you go so that you are more than last 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.259
 a lot of time always tries to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.409
 clean your nails before painting them with 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.660
 a very soft nail polish remover do not use 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.770
 acetone because it is dried out and mistreated 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.320
 very much the nails uses a quite 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.870
 with a cotton quoted removes the grease that 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.750
 in your nails use a protective base 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:23.320
 then point polish and at the end use 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.750
 another layer to protect and then not 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.910
 use your hands for about an hour 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.430
 an hour and a half like reaching into 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 bag open your wallet and do as 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.120
 sudden activities that have to do 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.800
 with your nails because otherwise your manicure will 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.870
 go spoil and those rays are going to be made 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.880
 hard you'll have to redo 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.580
 everything from the beginning and finally 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.830
 you also have to take good care of how we use 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.740
 our nails if we use them to open 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.020
 things to scratch or like our way 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.490
 to take out the stress by biting you're 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.550
 super bad because in addition to that we 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.830
 We have a lot of bacteria in our mouths 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.750
 our nails can lose their shape 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.090
 natural and they will see superman 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.590
 remember that the nails are our letter 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.140
 of presentation and it is also proven 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.730
 that if we have some pretty hands we're going 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.680
 to raise a lot of self-esteem 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.960
 then you have to take advantage of everything 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.210
 this and good girls because this has been 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.610
