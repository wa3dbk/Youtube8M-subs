00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.190 
days because I got a new goldfish and I
put<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:33.360> medicine

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
put in some medicine

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.569 
just to cure any diseases and I want to
make<00:00:36.930> sure<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> medicine<00:00:37.680> worked<00:00:38.070> right<00:00:38.340> so

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
make sure the medicine worked right so

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.440 
make sure the medicine worked right so
it<00:00:38.700> turned<00:00:38.940> off<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> fuck<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.850> filter<00:00:42.329> in

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
there for a while and I guess that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.130

caused<00:00:44.640> him<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:44.969> ammonia<00:00:45.480> burn<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.930> turned

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
caused him to have ammonia burn I turned

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.680
