00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
where we're going to turn wheels I've

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:07.940 
where we're going to turn wheels I've
been<00:00:06.750> talking<00:00:07.109> about<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.500> for<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> few<00:00:07.919> years

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
and I can turn them out pretty quickly

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.519 
and I can turn them out pretty quickly
and<00:00:19.970> we're<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.180> show<00:00:21.600> each<00:00:21.869> step<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
and we're going to show each step the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.380 
and we're going to show each step the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
first phase the first step is to do the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.689 
first phase the first step is to do the
back<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.170> wheel<00:00:25.350> now<00:00:26.340> I'm<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
back side of the wheel now I'm going to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
back side of the wheel now I'm going to
do<00:00:26.869> four<00:00:27.869> pair<00:00:28.140> trucks<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> eight

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
do four pair trucks which is eight

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.479 
set and then a couple of extras just a
half<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.800> about<00:00:37.980> 40<00:00:38.340> 42<00:00:38.670> wheels<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:40.190> I<00:00:41.190> don't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
half so about 40 42 wheels and I don't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.530 
half so about 40 42 wheels and I don't
know<00:00:41.640> how<00:00:41.730> long<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.000> gonna<00:00:42.149> take<00:00:42.239> me<00:00:42.390> I'm

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
know how long it's gonna take me I'm

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.910 
know how long it's gonna take me I'm
going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.750> time<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.680> how<00:00:43.770> long

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
going to time it and see what how long

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
going to time it and see what how long
it<00:00:44.070> takes<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.750> we're<00:00:45.750> gonna<00:00:45.840> pluck<00:00:46.140> primarily

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it takes but we're gonna pluck primarily

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
it takes but we're gonna pluck primarily
how<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> set<00:00:47.190> up<00:00:47.219> now<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.090> wheel<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
how I set up now this is the wheel in

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.889 
how I set up now this is the wheel in
the<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> Chuck<00:00:49.230> three<00:00:49.860> jaw<00:00:50.070> Chuck<00:00:50.899> three

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the in the Chuck three jaw Chuck three

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.410 
the in the Chuck three jaw Chuck three
jokes<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.469> heavy<00:00:52.649> eight<00:00:53.340> inch<00:00:53.670> three<00:00:54.180> job

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
jokes are a heavy eight inch three job

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
jokes are a heavy eight inch three job
Chuck<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:55.140> has<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> removable<00:00:56.149> jaws

Chuck it has a removable jaws
replaceable<00:00:57.899> jaws<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.530> jaws<00:00:58.739> are

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
replaceable jaws so the jaws are

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.180 
replaceable jaws so the jaws are
reversible<00:01:00.079> for<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.230> inside<00:01:01.710> out<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.010> hard

but<00:03:11.820> we're<00:03:12.299> cutting<00:03:12.570> car<00:03:12.750> a<00:03:12.959> cast<00:03:13.440> iron<00:03:13.769> which

but we're cutting car a cast iron which

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.490 
but we're cutting car a cast iron which
is<00:03:14.430> a<00:03:14.459> little<00:03:14.670> bit<00:03:14.760> softer<00:03:15.299> than<00:03:15.450> steel<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.410> you

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
is a little bit softer than steel so you

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.310 
is a little bit softer than steel so you
don't<00:03:16.650> need<00:03:16.739> as<00:03:16.829> much<00:03:17.010> pressure<00:03:18.019> one<00:03:19.019> thing<00:03:19.230> I

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
normally but then it's in the tool like

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.300
