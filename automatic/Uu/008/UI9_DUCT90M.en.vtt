00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
over everything but anyway let's get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.389 
over everything but anyway let's get
into<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:58.050> starting<00:00:58.469> over<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.219> what<00:00:59.370> I

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
into it so starting over here and what I

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.520 
into it so starting over here and what I
kind<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.210> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> call<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> dark<00:01:01.140> corner

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
kind of going to call the dark corner

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.110 
kind of going to call the dark corner
because<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.980> doesn't<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.370> used<00:01:02.579> as<00:01:02.789> much<00:01:02.969> as

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120
