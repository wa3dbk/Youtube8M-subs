wouldn't or the plastic wheels and then
went<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.800> inline<00:03:18.099> skates

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
went to the inline skates

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.650 
went to the inline skates
they<00:03:20.800> have<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.160> inline<00:03:21.610> statement<00:03:22.330> and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
they have the inline statement and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.160 
they have the inline statement and
that's<00:03:23.349> so<00:03:23.920> much<00:03:24.069> faster<00:03:24.730> and<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:26.110> much

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that's so much faster and so much

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.100 
that's so much faster and so much
prettier

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.970 

and<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.010> inline<00:03:32.460> skating<00:03:32.970> took<00:03:33.810> over<00:03:34.050> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
and so inline skating took over and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.680 
and so inline skating took over and
and<00:03:35.069> now<00:03:35.340> we're<00:03:35.730> starting<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.120> see<00:03:36.300> this<00:03:36.450> wee
