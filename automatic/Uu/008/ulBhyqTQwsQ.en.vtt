00:00:23.346 --> 00:00:27.606
(techno music)

00:00:27.606 --> 00:00:28.371
- [Voiceover] Hey guys.

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:29.208
- [Voiceover] Today we're gonna show you

00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:30.369
some super fun things to do

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.133
on your Spring Break staycation.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:33.445
- [Voiceover] And bonus,
we're gonna show you guys

00:00:33.445 --> 00:00:34.791
how we got ready using some products

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:36.759
from this month's Birch Box.

00:00:37.558 --> 00:00:39.533
- [Voiceover] You're on
vacation and so is your face,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.950
so that means minimal makeup.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.865
We're starting out with
a super awesome mascara

00:00:42.865 --> 00:00:43.771
from Benefit.

00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:45.372
It's their new Roller Lash mascara.

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:47.404
- [Voiceover] This mascara
really curls your lashes.

00:00:47.404 --> 00:00:48.890
No need for falsies.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.551
Spring is all about the glow,

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.803
so we're using Jelly Pong
Pong's Glow Getter highlight.

00:00:52.803 --> 00:00:53.812
- [Voiceover] It's a great gel formula

00:00:53.812 --> 00:00:55.333
that won't leave you feeling cakey.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:57.029
For cheeks we're using the Laura Geller

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:58.886
Blush-n-Brighten in Pink Grapefruit.

00:00:58.886 --> 00:00:59.512
- [Voiceover] This part's awesome

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.009
because it actually doubles
as a blush and highlight.

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:03.042
To finish everything off

00:01:03.042 --> 00:01:05.109
we used these Smashbox
Legendary Lip Gloss.

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:06.952
- [Voiceover] It's a really
pretty sheer wash up color

00:01:06.952 --> 00:01:08.312
and it's not sticky at all.

00:01:08.312 --> 00:01:10.426
You guys know how much
we love our lippies,

00:01:10.426 --> 00:01:13.217
so we wanna know what you're
loving down in the comments.

00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:14.349
- [Voiceover] Who has
time to wash their hair

00:01:14.349 --> 00:01:15.186
during spring break?

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:16.567
I know I don't, so we're gonna freshen up

00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:18.065
with some Anika dry shampoo.

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:19.586
- [Voiceover] This stuff smells amazing,

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:21.738
and it gives us tons of volume.

00:01:23.492 --> 00:01:25.390
- [Voiceover] We are so digging
the palazzo pants trend,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.678
and it's perfect for spring.

00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:28.653
- [Voiceover] Bonus, we
kept it super affordable.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:30.696
My jumpsuit is by the
brand Band of Gypsies,

00:01:30.696 --> 00:01:33.076
and I found it at TJ Maxx for $24.99.

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:34.178
- [Voiceover] If you're not into jumpsuits

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:36.176
you can opt for some palazzo pants.

00:01:36.176 --> 00:01:38.219
I found mine at Target for $24.99.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.078
They're by Mossimo.

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:40.401
For the rest of our outfit details

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:41.701
you can check down below.

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.095
- [Voiceover] If you're
looking for things to do

00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.724
on your spring break staycation,
we've got you covered.

00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:46.504
- [Voiceover] First things first

00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:48.992
you have a super cute outfit,
so you have to document it.

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:50.954
- [Voiceover] Time for a selfie sesh.

00:01:50.954 --> 00:01:52.255
- [Voiceover] Since you
didn't make it to the beach

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:54.135
you can always stop in
and get a spray tan,

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:55.494
so you can fake it.

00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:56.678
- [Voiceover] Until ya make it.

00:01:56.678 --> 00:01:58.639
Another fun thing to do
is explore your town.

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.753
Seriously, we are still
finding cool places

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:03.045
to visit in our city.

00:02:03.045 --> 00:02:03.992
- [Voiceover] A great way to beat the heat

00:02:03.992 --> 00:02:05.896
is popsicles or froyo.

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:07.416
We found this cute local place in our town

00:02:07.416 --> 00:02:10.458
that sells all natural popsicles
and they are super yummy.

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.652
- [Voiceover] We went for
raspberry-lemon and strawberry,

00:02:12.652 --> 00:02:14.219
but they have so many interesting flavors,

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:17.412
like hibiscus and strawberry-balsamic.

00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:19.060
- [Voiceover] Sometimes
you just have to stop

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.138
and take in a sunset.

00:02:20.138 --> 00:02:22.357
We decided to go down to
the river and catch it.

00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:24.970
Sometimes the simplest things
can be taken for granted.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.537
- [Voiceover] We decided
to enjoy the simple things

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:28.057
and have a sunset picnic.

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:30.090
We got some sandwiches
and chips and a blanket,

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.251
and made it happen.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.818
- [Voiceover] Thumbs up if
you guys are dorks like us

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:34.385
and like to try to catch
food in your mouth.

00:02:34.385 --> 00:02:35.921
- [Voiceover] Success.

00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:38.460
- [Voiceover] Sometimes
you have terrible aim.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.486
Yup, just did that.

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:41.978
- [Voiceover] Hopefully this
gave you guys some inspiration

00:02:41.978 --> 00:02:44.323
for things to do on your
spring break staycation.

00:02:44.323 --> 00:02:45.321
- [Voiceover] We'll have all the links

00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.807
