00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.010
 hello my name is oihana and the name of 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.260
 she is my 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.980
 it's called temporary maintained because the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980
 I will give in adoption 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.720
 look I found him on July 27, 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.269
 this year 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.269
 well rather I did not find it the rescue 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.120
 no no 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.500
 and a few months ago I had read by the 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.469
 social networks that threw live dogs 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.300
 in the trash in guajaca I think and they will be 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.860
 crushed by the truck 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.430
 obviously you read it on the internet but 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.730
 do not assimilate the news as such it gives you 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.890
 courage angers much each one 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.589
 have taken the time to take a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.649
 photograph instead of getting off or I do not know if 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:08.399
 go walking or go and save the dog but 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:11.240
 it was until that day on Friday I understood that 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.130
 evil exists or rather ignorance 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.940
 that animals are seen as objects 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.130
 which they have no value and therefore here 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.790
 here is the story of a girl 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.790
 Y 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.890
 one 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 i 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.540
 I shouted at them while I ran 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.660
 until they were perplexed and I asked them 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.160
 they just threw a live cat into the boat 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.680
 obviously they did not answer me because it was 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 when I ordered them to give me the cat 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.990
 and the blood boiled my hands are 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.000
 trembling but the only thing that I can 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.100
 to say is that if they knew that I could 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.190
 I claim that because the cat is a being 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.190
 alive 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.730
 i 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.680
 two 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.849
 and 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.859
 d 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:19.880
 I'll call the stars 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.609
 you have to go 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.240
 to this sudden 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.759
 I hope not to continue saving animals 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.879
 because I want to think and I want to believe that 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:07.099
 future generations will learn 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.099
 to respect they will learn to love 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 if not 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.290
