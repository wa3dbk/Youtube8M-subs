00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.200 
happened is her ear Asians that I hear
and<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.350> 12<00:00:34.829> inch<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.489> 14<00:00:35.940> inch

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and I have it in a 12 inch and a 14 inch

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.970 
and I have it in a 12 inch and a 14 inch
so<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.350> pretty<00:00:38.100> much<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.520> looks<00:00:38.730> like

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
so it's pretty much what it looks like

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.270 
so it's pretty much what it looks like
the<00:00:40.980> 12<00:00:41.309> inch<00:00:41.489> cost<00:00:42.620> $65<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.100> pay

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the 12 inch cost $65 and then you pay

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.330 
the 12 inch cost $65 and then you pay
extra<00:00:44.550> $10<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.989> every<00:00:46.289> inch<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.039> go<00:00:47.190> up

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
extra $10 for every inch that you go up

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.410 
extra $10 for every inch that you go up
so<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.120> 14<00:00:48.570> inch<00:00:48.840> was<00:00:49.079> $75<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.250> did<00:00:51.059> get<00:00:51.239> two

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so the 14 inch was $75 I did get two

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.439 
so the 14 inch was $75 I did get two
bundles<00:00:51.660> because<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:53.070> length<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.910> inches

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
bundles because of the length and inches

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.900 
bundles because of the length and inches
that<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.530> two<00:00:55.860> bundles<00:00:56.100> was<00:00:56.550> pretty

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910

a<00:02:45.940> higher<00:02:46.299> maintenance<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.590> always<00:02:48.010> have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
a higher maintenance and I always have

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.910 
a higher maintenance and I always have
resilient<00:02:48.760> hair<00:02:49.000> I'm<00:02:49.299> not<00:02:49.900> necessarily<00:02:50.019> hers

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
resilient hair I'm not necessarily hers

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
resilient hair I'm not necessarily hers
but<00:02:51.340> I've<00:02:51.489> had<00:02:51.870> resilient<00:02:52.870> hair<00:02:53.049> in<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> past

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
but I've had resilient hair in the past

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.009 
but I've had resilient hair in the past
so<00:02:53.859> I<00:02:54.100> wanted<00:02:55.030> something<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.450> was<00:02:55.600> different

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
so I wanted something that was different

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.259 
so I wanted something that was different
from<00:02:56.290> Brazilian<00:02:57.070> here<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.670> kind<00:02:58.090> of<00:02:58.120> figured

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
from Brazilian here so I kind of figured

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.960 
from Brazilian here so I kind of figured
the<00:02:58.570> Eurasian<00:02:59.019> was<00:02:59.170> more<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.500> my<00:02:59.620> Ally

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
the Eurasian was more of my Ally

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.490 
the Eurasian was more of my Ally
especially<00:03:00.970> since<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.480> was<00:03:01.510> low<00:03:02.290> maintenance

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
especially since it was low maintenance

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.750 
especially since it was low maintenance
because<00:03:02.950> I'm<00:03:03.190> not<00:03:03.609> really<00:03:04.150> into<00:03:05.760> doing

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
because I'm not really into doing

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.370 
because I'm not really into doing
different<00:03:07.150> crazy<00:03:07.269> things<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:07.930> hair<00:03:08.230> I'm

the<00:03:50.500> afternoon

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
the afternoon

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.510 
the afternoon
as<00:03:51.330> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.570> see<00:03:51.840> my<00:03:52.650> curls<00:03:53.010> are<00:03:53.190> still

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
as you can see my curls are still

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.430 
as you can see my curls are still
holding<00:03:53.910> up<00:03:54.120> pretty<00:03:54.300> well<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:55.140> it's<00:03:55.320> been

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
holding up pretty well because it's been

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.460 
holding up pretty well because it's been
a<00:03:55.470> couple<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.770> hours<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:57.360> I<00:03:57.690> think<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.110> blends

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
a couple of hours and I think it blends

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.850 
a couple of hours and I think it blends
