a<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:48.450> note<00:00:48.530> this<00:00:49.530> update<00:00:50.460> will<00:00:50.489> not<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.940> don't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
a side note this update will not I don't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.200 
a side note this update will not I don't
think<00:00:51.360> probably<00:00:51.809> will<00:00:52.170> not<00:00:52.289> bring<00:00:52.559> any<00:00:53.210> new

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
think probably will not bring any new

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.990 
think probably will not bring any new
features<00:00:55.250> so<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> don't<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:56.879> bring

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
features so I don't think it would bring

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
features so I don't think it would bring
them<00:00:57.239> ocelots<00:00:57.840> or<00:00:58.109> iron<00:00:58.350> golems<00:00:58.710> anything<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
them ocelots or iron golems anything of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.650 
them ocelots or iron golems anything of
that<00:00:59.219> like<00:00:59.489> yeah<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> don't<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.420> that'll<00:01:00.629> be

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that like yeah I don't think that'll be

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
that like yeah I don't think that'll be
coming<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.980> just<00:01:02.100> going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.460> be

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
coming I think this is just going to be

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.810 
coming I think this is just going to be
a<00:01:02.910> big<00:01:03.510> bug<00:01:04.049> fix<00:01:04.350> update<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.129> it'll<00:01:05.670> probably

explode<00:03:51.130> I<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:52.299> experienced<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.380> lot

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
explode I have experienced that a lot

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:56.099 
explode I have experienced that a lot
actually<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:54.280> must<00:03:55.120> admit<00:03:55.299> I<00:03:55.480> have<00:03:55.690> experienced

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
actually I must admit I have experienced

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.720 
actually I must admit I have experienced
at<00:03:56.200> a<00:03:56.260> lot<00:03:56.440> especially<00:03:56.739> when<00:03:57.310> you<00:03:57.400> spawn<00:03:57.640> them

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
at a lot especially when you spawn them

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.580 
at a lot especially when you spawn them
nem<00:03:58.030> world<00:03:58.239> not<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.569> good<00:03:58.780> idea<00:03:58.810> to<00:03:59.230> be<00:03:59.319> honest

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
nem world not a good idea to be honest

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.090 
nem world not a good idea to be honest
but<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:00.220> thought<00:04:00.489> why<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.299> spawn<00:04:01.569> a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
but I thought why not just spawn a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.650 
but I thought why not just spawn a
creeper<00:04:03.100> whack<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:03.819> and<00:04:04.150> then<00:04:04.239> let<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.480> end<00:04:04.569> of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
creeper whack it and then let the end of

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.630 
creeper whack it and then let the end of
jan<00:04:04.840> come<00:04:05.049> down<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.470> hit<00:04:06.220> but<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.609> thought

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
jan come down and hit but then I thought

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.490 
jan come down and hit but then I thought
why<00:04:06.970> just<00:04:07.299> use<00:04:07.450> TNT<00:04:08.549> so<00:04:09.549> yeah<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:11.139> didn't

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
why just use TNT so yeah that didn't

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.560 
why just use TNT so yeah that didn't
work<00:04:11.650> very<00:04:11.709> well<00:04:12.010> so<00:04:12.220> yeah<00:04:12.639> don't<00:04:12.910> use

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
work very well so yeah don't use

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.880 
work very well so yeah don't use
creepers<00:04:14.079> in<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.410> end<00:04:14.590> well

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
creepers in the end well

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.770 
creepers in the end well
