little bit of white and a little bit of

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.939 
little bit of white and a little bit of
this<00:00:24.720> yellow<00:00:24.900> green<00:00:25.199> mixture<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.829> it's

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
this yellow green mixture here see it's

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.509 
this yellow green mixture here see it's
right<00:00:26.130> there

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
right there

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.429 
right there
this<00:00:27.179> is<00:00:27.329> the<00:00:27.419> one<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> helps<00:00:27.929> define<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
this is the one that helps define this

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.460 
this is the one that helps define this
tree<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.739> little<00:00:28.890> bit<00:00:29.130> more<00:00:33.409> flatten<00:00:34.409> your

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
tree a little bit more flatten your

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.470 
tree a little bit more flatten your
brush<00:00:34.710> out<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.220> any<00:00:35.370> excess<00:00:35.699> moisture<00:00:35.940> out

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
brush out get any excess moisture out

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.329 
brush out get any excess moisture out
let's<00:00:37.350> go<00:00:37.559> ahead<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.949> a<00:00:37.980> little

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:38.339 
let's go ahead get this a little

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:40.280 
let's go ahead get this a little
brighter<00:00:38.730> once<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.089> can<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> basics<00:00:39.989> now

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
brighter once you can get the basics now

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
brighter once you can get the basics now
you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.739> come<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.010> here<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.390> how<00:00:42.479> that

this and this gives you that really nice
dimensional<00:00:57.690> shape<00:00:58.649> see<00:00:58.769> I'm<00:00:58.890> overlapping

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
dimensional shape see I'm overlapping

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.829 
dimensional shape see I'm overlapping
leaving<00:00:59.760> these<00:00:59.879> little<00:01:00.059> pockets<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> space

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
leaving these little pockets of space

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.939 
leaving these little pockets of space
like<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:02.600> these<00:01:03.600> trees<00:01:03.960> look<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.470> good<00:01:04.769> when

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
like this these trees look so good when

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.690 
like this these trees look so good when
you<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.190> them<00:01:05.309> going

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
you get them going

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.580 
you get them going
get<00:01:06.390> your<00:01:06.570> motor<00:01:06.690> started<00:01:07.289> you<00:01:07.380> start

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
get your motor started you start

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
get your motor started you start
building<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.009> little<00:01:08.160> confidence<00:01:08.759> these

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
building up a little confidence these

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
building up a little confidence these
kind<00:01:09.899> of<00:01:09.960> branch<00:01:10.259> this<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:10.679> soften<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
kind of branch this out soften it a

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.620 
kind of branch this out soften it a
little<00:01:11.399> bit<00:01:11.789> get<00:01:12.720> right<00:01:12.899> in<00:01:12.990> through<00:01:13.170> here

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
little bit get right in through here

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.969 
little bit get right in through here
then<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:15.869> end<00:01:16.289> of<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.800> in<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
then at the very end of it here in a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
then at the very end of it here in a
second<00:01:17.340> we'll<00:01:17.580> put<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> final<00:01:18.300> highlights

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
second we'll put the final highlights

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
second we'll put the final highlights
and<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.929> few<00:01:19.170> tree<00:01:19.380> limbs<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
and a few tree limbs up in there and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
and a few tree limbs up in there and
then<00:01:20.940> pow<00:01:21.240> you've<00:01:21.540> got<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> just<00:01:22.409> really

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
then pow you've got it it just really

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.660 
then pow you've got it it just really
looks<00:01:22.890> good

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.850 

once<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:28.750> kind<00:01:28.960> of<00:01:29.020> get<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.200> structure<00:01:29.680> where

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
once you kind of get a structure where

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.320 
once you kind of get a structure where
you<00:01:29.890> want<00:01:30.130> leaves<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.670> or<00:01:30.850> even<00:01:31.120> if<00:01:31.210> you're

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
you want leaves and or even if you're

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.240 
you want leaves and or even if you're
just<00:01:31.420> doing<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.660> big<00:01:31.840> modeling<00:01:32.500> background<00:01:33.130> of

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
just doing a big modeling background of

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.820 
just doing a big modeling background of
leaves<00:01:33.510> pick<00:01:34.510> the<00:01:34.660> appropriate<00:01:34.780> brush<00:01:35.590> for

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
leaves pick the appropriate brush for

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.470 
leaves pick the appropriate brush for
the<00:01:35.920> size<00:01:36.130> leaf<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.640> want<00:01:36.850> in<00:01:36.940> this<00:01:37.060> case<00:01:37.300> I'm

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
the size leaf you want in this case I'm

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.570 
the size leaf you want in this case I'm
going<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.630> pick<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.900> number<00:01:38.140> four<00:01:38.440> to<00:01:39.280> put<00:01:39.460> my

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
going to pick the number four to put my

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.880 
going to pick the number four to put my
leaves<00:01:39.820> on<00:01:40.000> here<00:01:40.120> now<00:01:40.270> let's<00:01:40.540> talk<00:01:40.690> about<00:01:40.890> the
