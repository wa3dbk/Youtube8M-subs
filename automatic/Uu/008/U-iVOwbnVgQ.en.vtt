 hello how about I'm the giorgio and I make 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.460
 crafts this time if you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.140

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.540
 show you how to make a bag 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 newspaper a little bit different from the one 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.200
 we made in advance in reality 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 The bag we made previously 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.119
 was about a color and this time it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.859
 it's about a bag that you will take a student 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.720
 difference lies mainly in that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 This bag has such depth 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.910

 the bag so good I'll give you a little 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 more space this time so that 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.680
 you can put your hand even and so 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.559

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.559
 that I'm going to place on this side about me 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.620

 with your videos to make projects of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.010

 subscribe well for this job 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.790
 we will need newspaper sheets and a 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.440
 straw for wrapping is a stiff straw 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 you can use a wooden stick 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.640
 we are also going to put it in the corner 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.920
 of the sheet and we're going to start rolling 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.500
 to go so forming the rolls once 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 coming to the opposite corner we are going to 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.390
 place some glue and let's 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.370
 remove the stick once wrapped come on 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.220
 to crush the roll and so on 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.870
 with each of them the fabric will be very 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.490
 simple let's place the tubes 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.100
 horizontally 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.680
 let's take one of the other tubes and 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.320
 we are going to go one up and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.540
 another one below another one above and another one 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 below and so on to 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.230
 facilitate the work we will lift 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.880
 everyone who corresponds to go by 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.489
 up one time 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.030
 we are going to place glue in this case 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.030
 it's tail 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.840
 and then we're going to download all of them 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.610
 only once in this way will the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.230
 woven one above and one below 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.390
 it will only be necessary to repeat the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.160
 operation in the case of these tubes that 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.410
 are left on the banks we are going to fold 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:36.670
 inwards and stick them with glue 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.650
 white to waterproof the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
 surface and so that we are not 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.560
 moisten so easy we will place it 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.230
 white tail generously with a brush 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.310
 on the entire surface of both sides and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.310
 we are going to let it dry 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.520
 once it is completely dry it will be 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.920
 necessary to paint the color is optional in 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.150
 this case and I will use a golden tone is 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.490
 I know a color a little flashy but you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.250
 you can choose the color that you like 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.080
 once painted we will upholster what 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.810
 I will do will be to place enough 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.030
 cold silicone contact glue in 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.310
 the entire surface emphasizing 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.100
 the banks and I'm going to put him in this 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.380
 Felt case pink I'll seal it 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.500
 but I'm going to leave a small shore without 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:29.960
 seal where I'm going to put an ear 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.030
 it is about this rectangle of the covenant 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.400
 skin which I will upholster one of his 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.500
 limbs with suede on both sides 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.110
 I'm going to seal it in the middle of the two 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.110
 fabrics to form one ear 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.540
 it will be necessary now to put the brooch 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.940
 this brooch that I got is from 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.950
 pressure so it will only be necessary 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.750
 crush to fit and on the side 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.209
 opposite taking the appropriate measure 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.970
 it should be a few holes for 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.690
 leave each one of the pins in its 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.030
 right place 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.580
 for the sides I will take the measure 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.830
 of the bag on the client 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.019
 I'll remember it and I'll know it 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.239
 about the kilos of the lining fabric that 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.420
 protrudes to leave well sewn well 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.140
 all its outline and subject on the side 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.140
 from the bag 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.310
 in the case of this ear that is left over 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.090
 end do not cut it just make it two 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.669
 cuts 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.520
 in this way to form three strips 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.639
 which are you going to put glue on 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.100
 contact in the center we are going to 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.290
 put a ring and we will seal them 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.970
 down in this way the ring 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.860
 this ring will be fastened 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.770
 later it will serve us to be able to 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.260
 put a strap to cover all this 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.210
 work and make it more aesthetically pleasing him 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.510
 we will place with the help of it 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.160
 glue a suede cap only 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.080
 you should be careful to double the 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.419
 edges inwards so that you have a 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.710
 aesthetic and clear finish we're going to 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.710
 seal with contact glue 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.850
 In this way, the 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.850
 sides and the front 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.210
 we have practically finished the bag 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.580
 the only thing that will remain is to place the 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.160
 chain in this case the chain to give it 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.780
 a little more design woven a strip 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.790
 suede only what's gone 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.800
 between the links and good now 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.960
 it will only be necessary to hold only 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.300
 the rings and we'll have finished 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.300
 so the bag ready to hang 

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:09.620
 i 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.440
 and well then the final result then 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.630
 it would be something like this is about a 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.770
 nice bag yes 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:21.590
 very functional but above all and about 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.420
 all very, very economical because no 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.860
 you are only saving money but 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.870
 that you are also contributing to the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.760
 recycling environment we are 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.560
 using newspaper I hope you put it 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.510
 in practice and I hope you share me
