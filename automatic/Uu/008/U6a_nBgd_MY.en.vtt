00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 Hi, I speak today about the fight club. 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:19.970
 People, I do not know how to talk about this. 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:25.369
 so I got organized with you 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.369
 I quit electric writing pencil 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.430
 long time ago I watched the movie many 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.430
 years surfing but I love the favorites 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 but so I can not tell if some 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 things are what or not what really 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.360
 It's been a long time since I watched and it's not 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.910
 how not to compare it does not have if you 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.800
 watch has no way to read the book without 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.989
 think about the movie 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:06.720
 so the incredible native book 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:10.049
 so it's the only way to tell a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:15.240
 story I do not remember seeing the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.560
 narrative in another book is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.479
 confused 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.640
 the swimmer counts mixed thus the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.860
 things does not follow a linear manner to 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.939
 story one paragraph is talking about 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.250
 gift 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.340
 in the case last year after around 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.570
 other in the present but that works 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.570
 it's amazing 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.780
 some things I read here 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.500
 immediately is cool since 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.899
 had forgotten 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.729
 remember the general story thus being 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.430
 so but I do not remember the way to 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.850
 tell the story of the movie is similar 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:01.469
 so the people that counts are the word usa 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.979
 if you have that same confusion of 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.950
 last December is confusing look only at 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.060
 mixing on top of that works great 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.580
 good 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.180
 me and him 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.410
 two footprints and like said his source 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.360
 it's big 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.480
 past suddenly and is very fast read it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.680
 does not roll and goes straight to the point account 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:36.730
 What you gotta tell, this is great. 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:40.170
 difficult for people with faces and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.440
 fandango how do you know the movie 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 so there is not much surprise 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.569
 after all here is different 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.569
 if you think it's worth the same 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.470
 like this 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.310
 It's nice to see that all the time during 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:06.400
 book all of it kind of gives you the hint of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.790
 end always spend but that's it 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.349
 if you know the story will read it goes 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.739
 Come back here, you're calling ahead. 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:22.750
 or if you want to watch the movie you can 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.540
 read twice i'm sorry stay say he 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:33.790
 Deliver the story even after all many 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:37.600
 times and it's amazing and make you understand 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.420
 counting leaving the part of the part 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.750
 social criticism of outside capitalism 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:47.829
 each has the right to strip their own 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.280
 conclusions or ignore this part of the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.930
 history of the quality of writing in 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.790
 quality of the story even the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:04.420
 characters 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:07.870
 he is the person but it is so a way 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.829
 single as I said 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:18.660
 You told me I'll be happy to 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:18.660
 answer for today is just 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.590
 ano
