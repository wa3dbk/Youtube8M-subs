them<00:01:47.440> out<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.700> know<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.060> took

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
them out and you know and took

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.149 
them out and you know and took
everything<00:01:49.659> out<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.020> I<00:01:50.409> got<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.740> water<00:01:50.950> to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
everything out and I got the water to

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.120 
everything out and I got the water to
drain<00:01:51.460> but<00:01:51.729> it<00:01:51.820> was<00:01:51.909> really<00:01:52.240> really<00:01:52.420> slow<00:01:52.810> and

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
drain but it was really really slow and

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.740 
drain but it was really really slow and
I<00:01:54.130> had<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:54.580> go<00:01:54.700> through<00:01:54.940> about<00:01:55.000> five<00:01:55.450> or<00:01:55.600> six

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
I had to go through about five or six

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960 
I had to go through about five or six
cycles<00:01:56.080> of<00:01:56.470> spinning<00:01:57.220> before<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:57.670> would<00:01:57.760> all

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
cycles of spinning before it would all

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.570 
cycles of spinning before it would all
drain<00:01:58.570> out<00:01:58.750> and<00:01:58.930> stay<00:01:59.140> out<00:01:59.170> so<00:02:00.070> something<00:02:00.430> was

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
drain out and stay out so something was

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.730 
drain out and stay out so something was
wrong<00:02:00.760> with<00:02:00.909> it<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.180> know<00:02:01.210> we<00:02:01.360> figured

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
wrong with it you know we figured

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.609 
wrong with it you know we figured
it<00:02:01.920> was<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.159> water<00:02:02.340> pump<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:02.790> something<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.619> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it was a water pump or something and so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.289 
it was a water pump or something and so
my<00:02:04.770> dad<00:02:04.950> came<00:02:05.159> over<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.549> we<00:02:05.670> looked<00:02:05.970> at<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
my dad came over and we looked at and

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.350 
my dad came over and we looked at and
looked<00:02:06.479> at<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.320> it<00:02:08.250> seemed<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
looked at it and and it seemed to be you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.690 
looked at it and and it seemed to be you
know<00:02:09.479> okay<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> water<00:02:11.160> pump<00:02:11.400> was

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
know okay you know the water pump was

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
know okay you know the water pump was
working<00:02:12.209> just<00:02:12.239> not<00:02:12.540> very<00:02:12.720> well<00:02:13.020> so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> figured

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
working just not very well so I figured

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.020 
working just not very well so I figured
well<00:02:13.709> something<00:02:14.069> was<00:02:14.160> inside<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.819> the

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
well something was inside there and the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.300 
well something was inside there and the
only<00:02:15.150> thing<00:02:15.239> we<00:02:15.450> could<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:15.989> was<00:02:16.770> soap

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
only thing we could think of was soap

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.150 
only thing we could think of was soap
and<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:18.630> turned<00:02:18.870> out<00:02:19.080> as<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.709> turned<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.040> was

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and it turned out as it turned out I was

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.460 
and it turned out as it turned out I was
using<00:02:20.459> more<00:02:21.090> soap<00:02:21.330> than<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.599> needed<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:22.230> I

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
using more soap than I needed which I

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.690 
using more soap than I needed which I
wish<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.739> would<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:22.920> known<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.459> could<00:02:23.610> have

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
wish I would have known of I could have

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.320 
wish I would have known of I could have
saved<00:02:23.819> some<00:02:24.000> money<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.870> know<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:26.330> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
saved some money but you know so the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.650 
saved some money but you know so the
soap<00:02:27.599> was<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.050> washer<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.099> was<00:02:29.660> not

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
soap was in the washer and that was not

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.449 
soap was in the washer and that was not
so<00:02:31.019> it<00:02:31.080> wasn't<00:02:31.349> creating<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.709> suction<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.250> it

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
so it wasn't creating a suction as it

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.390 
so it wasn't creating a suction as it
was<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.060> pump<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.599> get<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.140> water<00:02:34.290> out<00:02:34.440> so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
was in the pump to get the water out so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.960 
was in the pump to get the water out so
what<00:02:36.030> do<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:36.810> change<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.560> pump<00:02:37.970> no

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
what do we do do we change the pump no

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.460 
what do we do do we change the pump no
there<00:02:39.180> must<00:02:39.239> be<00:02:39.420> a<00:02:39.450> better<00:02:39.600> way<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:39.959> what<00:02:40.319> we

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
there must be a better way so what we

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.370 
there must be a better way so what we
did<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.100> took<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.910> hose<00:02:42.209> from<00:02:42.569> outside<00:02:43.110> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
did is we took a hose from outside and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.590 
did is we took a hose from outside and
the<00:02:44.069> drainage<00:02:44.459> holes<00:02:44.700> from<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:44.970> washer<00:02:45.239> we

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
the drainage holes from the washer we

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.370 
the drainage holes from the washer we
plugged<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> hose<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.739> turn<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:48.380> water

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
plugged the hose in and turn the water

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.940 
plugged the hose in and turn the water
pressure<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.980> full<00:02:50.250> blast<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.819> rut<00:02:51.239> round<00:02:51.600> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
pressure up full blast and rut round the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.850 
pressure up full blast and rut round the
water<00:02:52.950> up<00:02:53.190> through<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.580> pump<00:02:54.230> thus<00:02:55.230> ridding

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
water up through the pump thus ridding

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.949 
water up through the pump thus ridding
the<00:02:56.010> pump<00:02:56.280> of<00:02:56.489> the<00:02:56.760> excess<00:02:57.390> soap<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.810> was

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the pump of the excess soap that was

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.830 
the pump of the excess soap that was
inside<00:02:58.730> in<00:02:59.730> other<00:02:59.880> words<00:03:00.060> we<00:03:00.209> gave<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.630> wash

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
inside in other words we gave the wash

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.259 
inside in other words we gave the wash
machine<00:03:01.049> an<00:03:01.410> enema<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.790> been<00:03:02.940> working

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
machine an enema and it's been working

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:04.610 
machine an enema and it's been working
ever<00:03:03.390> since<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.810> was<00:03:04.110> three<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.440> half<00:03:04.590> years
