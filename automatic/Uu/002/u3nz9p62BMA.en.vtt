00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
it's a little bit safer I think for an

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.740 
it's a little bit safer I think for an
auto<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:58.099> because<00:01:58.459> you<00:01:59.000> actually<00:01:59.119> have<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.479> you

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750 
auto to because you actually have to you

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.359 
auto to because you actually have to you
know<00:01:59.840> get<00:02:00.020> this<00:02:00.259> damn<00:02:00.500> miss<00:02:00.740> motion<00:02:01.069> down<00:02:01.189> to

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
know get this damn miss motion down to

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.740 
know get this damn miss motion down to
slide<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.670> scale<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.000> mean<00:02:02.209> once<00:02:02.330> you<00:02:02.420> do<00:02:02.539> but

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750
