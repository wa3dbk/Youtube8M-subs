look in the mirror and learn how to not

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.679 
look in the mirror and learn how to not
break<00:00:14.620> up<00:00:14.920> I<00:00:15.219> think<00:00:16.439> definitely<00:00:17.439> true<00:00:17.919> but<00:00:18.689> we

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.359 
break up I think definitely true but we
did<00:00:19.930> we<00:00:20.140> would<00:00:20.320> break<00:00:20.470> all<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.770> time<00:00:20.950> you<00:00:21.279> know
