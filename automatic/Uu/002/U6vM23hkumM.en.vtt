 I read this for yes I did the dish 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.160
 joining the French technique of a dish 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.430
 very old french called maize 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.829
 creamy today and with the indigenous dessert 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.960
 then write down the ingredients you 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.600
 Will you need to make sweet potatoes? 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.600
 a green can of corn or canned 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.750
 then two daughters of grated corn at 200 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.960
 ml fresh cream 50 grams of 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.650
 butter a pinch of salt and a can of 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.890
 condensed milk if you put the milk 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.890
 condensed 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.659
 the cream of fresh milk if you want 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:21.159
 you can use it on too but if you go 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.950
 use the cream 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.780
 leave him cold because he is cool 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.140
 much better deal much more creaminess 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:35.380
 and do not loose so much fat and green corn 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.240
 if you are going to use the old can medium is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.490
 interesting that you saw him there so that 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.439
 he does not like the preserves if 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.350
 you can not use it 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.310
 the corn beaten and his liquid also 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 It looks delicious 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.560
 and to finish the butter and then you 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.689
 will hit the blender by 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.220
 approximately one minute the more 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.220
 You hit more creamy it will stay 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.320

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.410
 brought to a buttered shape 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.959
 a thick layer because the butter does 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.269
 with which the corn not only of so much water she 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.120
 does not let the platter retain as much liquid 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.680
