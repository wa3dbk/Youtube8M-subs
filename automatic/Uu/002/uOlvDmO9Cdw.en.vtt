00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.610
 in this video i want to tell you something 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.140
 about cleaning a camera 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.460
 objectively 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
 I am often asked on which 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.710
 the best way to do that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.230
 there are of course several 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.680
 ways you can do that you have 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 of course 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.120
 and then you look woman has everyone think 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.589
 I 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.350
 that is of course possibly a disadvantage 

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.670
 of a lens cloth is that yes 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.219
 if you have used a lounge corner 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 stop quickly in the pocket or unload in the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 camera bag and what actually happens 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.739
 is that a lot of dust in which agents search 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.819
 your heart 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.219
 so the next time you do it 

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:51.899
 use lens cloth if yes 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.420
 If you are unlucky you will only become objective 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.649
 fell instead of cleaner so that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.510
 actually bit after rio of one 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.510
 lens cloth you need to wash regularly 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.889
 or you must replace a regular one with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.440
 are actually a better alternative 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.390
 for the lens cloth and that is namely the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.790
 lens you may have never been like that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 see and lens pen go and explain what 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.580
 it is precise and how you should do it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.320
 use 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.200
 The lens pen actually consists of two parts 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 on the one hand you have a brush me 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.760
 you can extend 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.130
 with this scroll bar so then you have 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.670
 tassel on one side that lets you loose 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.560
 can remove a substance and it 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.240
 great thing about this is if you don't use it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.080
 you can simply slide in 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.270
 can city yes dust had a heap and 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the brush is therefore much smaller 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.860
 then other side is a cap that off 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.680
 and can get under the cap you find 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.600
 a velvet tip and with this velvet 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.270
 You can actually tip the stubborn one 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 dirt from the lens of the glass 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.080
 pickup, fetch 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.330
 what you do then is you with those velvet 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.340
 you can simply tip over the lens glass 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.520
 go and 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.580
 as you will notice that glass is 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.260
 will be completely clean again here 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.270
 leaves no stripes or anything similar 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.069
 behind it comes none at all 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.999
 liquid that is to match 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.979
 not necessary at all 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:12.590
 with this velvet tip you have the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.769
 the ability to 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 yes clean the glass of the lens well 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.190
 to make 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.629
 visual tip is also flexible 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.069
 So that means you also have one 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.660
 can put a bit of pressure if it's real 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.150
 is needed 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.890
 the head of tee is slowly moving towards me 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.650
 it's a very good and easy one 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.180
 way to weather the lens grass 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.250
 completely clean 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.590
 when you're done , place it on your and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.970
 of course on again and then also here 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.260
 no dirt so go on an open so 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.150
 you use the lens don't even you 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.840
 actually well protected there can 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.720
 not so fast 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.390
 add dust and you need it now 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.310
 to be used very quickly 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.200
 it fits a small accessory 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.780
 actually any well or pocket 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.769
 just a little longer in every camera bag 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.690
 a finger 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.660
 so easy to carry and actually 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.819
 a yes indispensable accessory for everyone 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.500
 serious photographer 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.910
 So I recommend to you a lens to go 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.030
 instead of a loincloth 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.290
 you it also ensures that the lens 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.000
 becomes much cleaner 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.379
 and it is also much easier and 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.359
 faster 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.180
 so a lens is definitely recommended 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.350
 to clean his room and he is 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.720
 and if you don't have a lens yet 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.060
 maybe you wonder what the costs are 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.260
 lens and I'm for less than 10 euros 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.079
 you already have a lens pen 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.340

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:31.910

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.180
 and that also becomes free 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.540
 Shipped within the Netherlands 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.930
 so yes definitely recommended for this lens 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.669
 I buy and to use his 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.750

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:46.750
 years of use
