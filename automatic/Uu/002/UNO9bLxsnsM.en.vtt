00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hi everyone, guys, welcome to this 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.130
 first episode of the road to glory start 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.080
 immediately saying that I wanted to eliminate 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.360
 broken organs as serious because 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.870
 basically I thought it was an evening 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.590
 quite simple since I passed 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.560
 the credits then complete the teams was 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.480
 very easy for which I wanted a 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.619
 can put to the test and try to do 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.099
 a sort of climb like that of sic 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.809
 in this series I will play 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.850
 using players precisely that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.760
 I will manage to win between auctions or checks 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.059
 immediately the credits I will win the games 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.070
 and therefore it will be much more difficult 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.320
 obviously during this series there 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.780
 will be many tips from me and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.640
 curiosity maybe in the world of otherwise 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.309
 since in any case I consider myself enough 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.379
 expert of this of this mode for 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.420
 which I can help you all to play 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.980
 this game 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.559
 the first game I play against 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.000
 a gold team in which practically not 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.729
 there are chances of winning myself 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 having a bronze team I can't 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.229
 do nothing in fact the opposing party 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.869
 immediately strong and or never give up 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.210
 I advise you not to do it I can do 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.159
 a goal with turi and then he finds goals 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.780
 lucky enough also because then me 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.840
 I had a pretty poor porter 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.140
 being bronze, however, first advice 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.939
 what I see of the agreement is the agreement I believe 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.750
 most important part of yours 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.750
 team 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.799
 because if you have little understanding the team 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.799
 won't react much to anything i 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.380
 steps will not be efficient at 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.770
 maximum player movements not 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.270
 they will be very good 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.299
 so the more intense you have the more you have 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.649
 chance to win the games then 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.890
 the first game as you saw ho 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.860
 lost 3 to 4 after a great comeback that 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.000
 I was about to consolidate in any case 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.550
 and do or give to do 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 in any case the opponent however 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.490
 he played bnl from my moments in the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.480
 sense that while I made a goal of three 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.970
 in four senses bit of fear and played 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.800
 only with the melina style step 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.110
 of defense and this makes you angry 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.090
 I highly advise you to do it because 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.450
 pissed off to irritate 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
 really your opponent 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.170
 however, the first victory also arrives 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.880
 meeting a team of half gold e 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.810
 half bronze 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.060
 then with about accumulated credits 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.040
 950 I make the first two purchases the first 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.570
 and dossena to the external right exterior 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.100
 left visa closed form 4 4 2 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.370
 Italian from Naples that everyone wants 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.860
 have the other know instead 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.230
 purchase is an attacker and and from ciro 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.640
 Mobile ciri property really is not for 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.580
 being a player is not rare 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.700
 very good quite agile has a good 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.700
 shot 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:09.820
 here as you will see the players change that 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.320
 I bought and put them in the team 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.140
 I wanted to take both Italians 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.290
 they no longer understood it and did the 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.600
 green line between them 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.700
 in any case also the line line 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.310
 yellow is still great because it allows 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.120
 to always have the same understanding but 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.980
 with practically with players like 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.750
 see here I decide to change some 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.060
 player of my rose because being 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.630
 tired having a low form I have to get them 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.290
 rest 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.060
 what I recommend and precisely of 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.090
 have so many benches to make from 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.870
 change with your holders for 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.790
 precisely to make them rest and fail 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.180
 regain the form for the game 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.180
 next one 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.520
 if I'm not mistaken the players on the bench 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.280
 they earn 10 outside 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.270
 and third match in a game 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.370
 very strong opponent had a team 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.670
 bronze or English with players 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.890
 really strong as sinclair and someone 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.300
 I ca n't remember anything else now 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.220
 however to take the lead with 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.060
 late with a goal from distance and then 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.280
 with a splendid goal of ciro immobile 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.280
 that consolidates precisely its strength and the 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.380
 game ends here on a 2 to 0 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.510
 very nice game I win 500 credits 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.800
