didn't really see much about it so I

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880 
didn't really see much about it so I
just<00:01:29.729> kept<00:01:30.210> doing<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.600> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.409> mean<00:01:31.710> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then at some point and I was holding it

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
then at some point and I was holding it
I<00:01:33.960> opened<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:35.220> like<00:01:35.400> okay<00:01:35.729> it's

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880

ready to go it says start so there's no
big<00:01:39.570> rocket<00:01:40.020> science<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.439> hit<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> start

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
big rocket science I hit the start

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.249 
big rocket science I hit the start
button<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.909> moving<00:01:42.360> along<00:01:42.450> moving<00:01:42.630> along

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
button it's moving along moving along

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.230 
button it's moving along moving along
moving<00:01:43.290> along<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.040> were<00:01:44.100> along<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.670> think

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
moving along and we were along I think

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.920 
moving along and we were along I think
guess<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.869> hits<00:01:46.020> about<00:01:46.170> 60%<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:48.540> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
guess what it hits about 60% and it just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.240 
guess what it hits about 60% and it just
the<00:01:49.890> thing<00:01:50.430> pops<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.149> says<00:01:51.360> this<00:01:51.950> your<00:01:52.950> DD

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
the thing pops up and says this your DD

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.789 
the thing pops up and says this your DD
JSX<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:54.000> not<00:01:54.509> connected<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> was

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
JSX is not connected it just like it was

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.560

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.449 
I'm highly disappointed here because I
now<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.209> brick<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.780> tried<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.709> turn<00:03:50.130> off<00:03:50.310> the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
now have a brick I tried I turn off the

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.400 
now have a brick I tried I turn off the
power<00:03:51.260> right<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:53.730> guess<00:03:53.970> what<00:03:54.329> man<00:03:54.570> turn

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
power right but guess what man turn

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.610 
power right but guess what man turn
about<00:03:55.680> gone<00:03:55.980> it's<00:03:56.250> doing<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.359> because<00:03:57.630> it

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
about gone it's doing this because it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.310 
about gone it's doing this because it
literally<00:03:59.340> got<00:03:59.700> half<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.209> firmware<00:04:00.480> update<00:04:00.720> it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
literally got half a firmware update it

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.569 
literally got half a firmware update it
has<00:04:01.650> no<00:04:01.920> firmware<00:04:02.459> it's<00:04:03.920> it's<00:04:04.920> stupider<00:04:05.549> than

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
has no firmware it's it's stupider than

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.340 
has no firmware it's it's stupider than
stupid<00:04:06.150> now<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.480> mean<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.810> always<00:04:07.079> thought<00:04:07.200> with

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
stupid now I mean I always thought with

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.170 
stupid now I mean I always thought with
MIDI<00:04:07.500> controls<00:04:07.890> being<00:04:08.160> dumb<00:04:08.340> devices<00:04:08.850> they<00:04:09.060> do

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
MIDI controls being dumb devices they do

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.210 
MIDI controls being dumb devices they do
nothing<00:04:09.570> without<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.989> software<00:04:10.170> well<00:04:11.070> this

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
nothing without the software well this

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.250 
nothing without the software well this
is<00:04:11.370> a<00:04:11.459> retarded<00:04:12.000> one<00:04:12.209> now<00:04:12.359> because<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:12.930> can<00:04:13.140> do

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
is a retarded one now because it can do

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.940 
is a retarded one now because it can do
nothing<00:04:14.120> it's<00:04:15.120> just<00:04:15.269> shot<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:16.289> only<00:04:16.650> way<00:04:16.739> this

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
nothing it's just shot the only way this

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.349 
nothing it's just shot the only way this
is<00:04:17.130> probably<00:04:17.400> going<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.640> get<00:04:17.760> resolved<00:04:18.239> I

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
is probably going to get resolved I

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.630 
is probably going to get resolved I
imagine<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.109> I'm<00:04:19.560> going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.829> send<00:04:20.160> it<00:04:20.280> in<00:04:20.400> which

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
imagine is I'm going to send it in which

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.949 
imagine is I'm going to send it in which
I<00:04:20.760> would<00:04:20.910> have<00:04:21.000> had<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.299> anyways<00:04:21.659> because<00:04:21.870> this

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
I would have had to anyways because this

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.409 
I would have had to anyways because this
will<00:04:22.229> clearly<00:04:22.800> had<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> problem<00:04:23.310> not<00:04:24.180> I<00:04:24.330> don't

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
will clearly had a problem not I don't

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.350 
will clearly had a problem not I don't
think<00:04:24.599> with<00:04:24.870> software<00:04:25.289> well<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.880> weird

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
think with software well it's weird

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.850 
think with software well it's weird
because<00:04:27.599> like<00:04:27.719> I<00:04:27.780> said<00:04:27.990> when<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.169> hold<00:04:28.439> held

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
because like I said when I hold held

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.219 
because like I said when I hold held
shift<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.520> touch<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.969> wheel<00:04:30.090> he<00:04:30.719> scrub

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:31.229 
shift and touch the wheel he scrub

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.600 
shift and touch the wheel he scrub
through<00:04:31.349> the<00:04:31.469> track<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.430> touch

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
through the track so the touch

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.480 
through the track so the touch
capacitive<00:04:33.270> part<00:04:33.509> worked<00:04:33.780> it<00:04:34.050> would<00:04:34.199> just<00:04:34.490> go

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
capacitive part worked it would just go

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.360 
capacitive part worked it would just go
into<00:04:35.789> this<00:04:36.150> slip<00:04:37.110> viral<00:04:37.500> mode<00:04:37.680> and<00:04:38.099> that's

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
into this slip viral mode and that's

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.129 
into this slip viral mode and that's
another<00:04:38.669> thing<00:04:38.759> that<00:04:38.849> pisses<00:04:39.150> me<00:04:39.449> off<00:04:39.509> I<00:04:39.750> pay

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
another thing that pisses me off I pay

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:42.830 
another thing that pisses me off I pay
the<00:04:40.289> same<00:04:40.530> kind<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.860> money<00:04:41.039> so<00:04:41.479> you<00:04:42.479> give<00:04:42.719> me

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
the same kind of money so you give me

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.719 
the same kind of money so you give me
extra<00:04:43.229> buttons<00:04:43.500> for<00:04:43.680> flip<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.159> you<00:04:44.219> robbed<00:04:44.550> me

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
extra buttons for flip so you robbed me

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.179 
extra buttons for flip so you robbed me
of<00:04:44.819> a<00:04:44.939> button<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.780> slip<00:04:46.259> button<00:04:46.620> in<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.949> vinyl

my<00:05:06.719> system<00:05:07.050> profiler<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.830> doesn't<00:05:08.400> even<00:05:08.639> see

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
my system profiler it doesn't even see

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.390
