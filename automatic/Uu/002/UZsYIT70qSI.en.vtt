00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.740 
run this against happens to be cover one
coverage<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> can<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.600> screen

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
coverage as you can see on your screen

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.229 
coverage as you can see on your screen
there<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:59.070> linebacker<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.940> actually

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there and the linebacker is actually

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.580 
there and the linebacker is actually
going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> blitz<00:01:00.690> now<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.109> keep<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> in

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
going to blitz now just keep this in

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
going to blitz now just keep this in
mind<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.129> was<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.550> man<00:01:02.730> undercover<00:01:03.090> to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
mind if this was to man undercover to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.630 
mind if this was to man undercover to
man<00:01:03.870> coverage<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.949> still<00:01:05.250> would<00:01:05.369> work

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
man coverage this still would work

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
man coverage this still would work
because<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.149> I<00:01:06.210> 74<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.930> works<00:01:07.110> against<00:01:07.380> any

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
because as I 74 this works against any

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
because as I 74 this works against any
type<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:07.979> bump<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.399> run<00:01:08.490> man<00:01:08.700> coverage<00:01:09.149> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
type of bump and run man coverage so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210 
type of bump and run man coverage so
just<00:01:09.479> keep<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.660> in<00:01:09.840> mind<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:10.979> want<00:01:11.190> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
just keep that in mind so what I want to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
just keep that in mind so what I want to
do<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.580> go<00:01:11.820> ahead<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.000> make<00:01:12.149> one<00:01:12.509> hot<00:01:12.780> rod

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
there now the reason that we do that is

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
there now the reason that we do that is
to<00:01:25.530> take<00:01:25.830> his<00:01:26.099> man<00:01:26.369> away<00:01:26.940> from<00:01:26.970> anywhere<00:01:27.630> that

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.680 
there on the outside the B receiver out
there<00:02:02.459> he<00:02:02.700> runs<00:02:02.849> a<00:02:02.910> go<00:02:03.060> route<00:02:03.239> so<00:02:03.450> they're<00:02:03.569> not

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
there he runs a go route so they're not

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.119 
there he runs a go route so they're not
needing<00:02:03.959> to<00:02:04.050> be<00:02:04.140> any<00:02:04.289> into<00:02:04.440> place<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:04.920> just

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:05.129 
needing to be any into place so just

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:06.710 
needing to be any into place so just
keep<00:02:05.220> that<00:02:05.280> in<00:02:05.429> mind<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.270> what<00:02:06.420> we're<00:02:06.539> going<00:02:06.629> to

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
keep that in mind so what we're going to

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.410 
keep that in mind so what we're going to
do<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.580> go<00:02:08.580> ahead<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.819> run<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.030> play<00:02:09.239> and

release<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.329> then<00:02:55.390> he<00:02:55.480> breaks<00:02:55.629> over<00:02:55.989> towards

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
release and then he breaks over towards

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.830 
release and then he breaks over towards
the<00:02:56.349> inside<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.939> rewind<00:02:58.239> just<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.629> little

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
the inside if you rewind just a little

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.000 
the inside if you rewind just a little
bit<00:02:58.959> you'll<00:02:59.379> see<00:02:59.439> one<00:02:59.680> of<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> cool<00:02:59.980> things

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
bit you'll see one of the cool things

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.920 
bit you'll see one of the cool things
about<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.430> play<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:00.939> that<00:03:00.970> he<00:03:01.150> actually<00:03:01.299> kind

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
about this play is that he actually kind

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.229 
about this play is that he actually kind
of<00:03:02.049> cut<00:03:02.260> between<00:03:02.829> those<00:03:03.069> two<00:03:03.219> receivers<00:03:03.639> get<00:03:04.209> a

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
of cut between those two receivers get a

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.759 
of cut between those two receivers get a
little<00:03:04.420> bit<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.540> pic<00:03:05.049> action<00:03:05.439> going<00:03:05.680> on

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
little bit of pic action going on

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.860 
little bit of pic action going on
between<00:03:05.980> those<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.639> receivers<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.269> then

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
between those and the receivers and then

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.449 
between those and the receivers and then
that<00:03:08.019> allows<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.530> receiving<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.159> get<00:03:09.310> even

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
that allows that receiving to get even

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:10.830 
that allows that receiving to get even
more<00:03:09.700> open<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.090> may<00:03:10.209> not<00:03:10.389> always<00:03:10.540> happen

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
more open that may not always happen

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:11.909 
more open that may not always happen
something<00:03:11.349> like<00:03:11.439> what<00:03:11.470> you're<00:03:11.680> seeing<00:03:11.799> there

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
something like what you're seeing there

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.759 
something like what you're seeing there
but<00:03:12.819> generally<00:03:13.629> you<00:03:13.720> should<00:03:13.750> still<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.560> same

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
but generally you should still that same

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.080 
but generally you should still that same
result<00:03:15.159> where<00:03:15.310> he<00:03:15.370> gets<00:03:15.519> at<00:03:15.700> least<00:03:15.730> open

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
result where he gets at least open

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.159 
result where he gets at least open
enough<00:03:16.359> where<00:03:16.450> you<00:03:16.480> can<00:03:16.540> make<00:03:16.689> that<00:03:16.750> catch<00:03:17.079> and

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
enough where you can make that catch and

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.589 
enough where you can make that catch and
have<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.500> up<00:03:18.069> to<00:03:18.129> filled<00:03:18.489> and<00:03:18.700> pick<00:03:19.299> up<00:03:19.450> some
