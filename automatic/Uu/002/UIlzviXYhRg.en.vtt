00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.320
 hi girls I hope you go 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
 well I find you today in 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.609
 a new video is for you 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.880
 present my favorite varnishes 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:21.910
 that I will put this autumn winter 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.400
 so you will quickly realize 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.839
 that there is a lot of kiko and 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.359
 only two other brands 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.339
 so here it is really my favorites 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.640
 the kiko and then I almost have that 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.850
 so here we go we will not start 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.800
 only two who are not kiko so 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.480
 the first is a nokia 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.420
 so I hesitated a lot before 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.329
 put in the trap are really 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
 so rotten rotten you will tell me 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.160
 but why do you put it in your 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.190
 favorites 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.030
 so I ask explains it's the color 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.039
 that I love and in fact the objects do not 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.309
 hold nothing at all I am obliged 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:03.340
 to get it done the next day because 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.470
 it does not hold anything so it's the one 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.110
 So it's a brown it's not the one 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:17.679
 that I wear 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:19.539
 this is the suzy cowboys love yesterday with 

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.179
 my good English accent so here it is 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.560
 a brown there is no glitter there 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:25.599
 nothing at all it's really a 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.220
 brown and I think it's a 

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.360
 color that goes very very well for 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.979
 autumn and winter 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 so here is an epci I had 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:42.610
 in a box I think that is a 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.130
 how to say a slate gray blue so 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 he is like this I hope you revered 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.540
 although there is not too much light and 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.090
 this one is the school of art broc 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:57.760
 so here we have it in one if I 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.620
 not deceive it's a glossybox I'm 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.340
 cheat I believe in my words short we got 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.100
 in a box 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.700
 no matter which one is next then 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:13.140
 everything else is kick or so I 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 will you do in shades of red 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.959
 red rose so I have a rose that is a 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.180
 pink fuchsia that I love who is with 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.000
 blue glitter so here we see it 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.930
 but blue reflections forgiveness here it is 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 this is the number 2 153 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.820
 so here are the kikoo they are really 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.459
 beautiful 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.720
 I adore them so I will not go 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.130
 say who hold days and days 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.410
 since there I have to do it 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.090
 every other day because I work 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.150
 So the position actually my hand polish 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.790
 very quickly so I am obliged to 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.950
 redo every two days here are my 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.700
 but on the other hand that's when I work 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.410
 it does not last from 4 to 5 days 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 maximum so I think it really 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.360
 not bad compared to the peak that such a 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.519
 day here you do the dishes 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.750
 and it's screwed up with the eyelids so 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.660
 I put this one then I 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.540
 could not tell you if the purple ones 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:15.580
 pink and there are purple gold highlights 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.650
 red here are the reflections are just 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
 crazy I do not know if we'll see the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.959
 was swelling and here I am, I love it 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.040
 so that's the 245 here then I'm 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.590
 sorry for my polish 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.230
 you have not seen close but here I have 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.549
 did last night and I worked this morning and 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.570
 I will do them this weekend so I 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.260
 turn on friday I will do them this 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.700
 weekend then so that one 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.890
 it's a red bordeaux it's 286 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.920
 this is this one I go squat and 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.379
 steve r I am thoroughly in the bordeaux 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.819
 this winter I have the shoes I have the 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.319
 loads at all but I like the 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.510
 burgundy i 'm not going burgundy pants 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.700
 so here and then a red since 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.959
 you have to have a red 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.859
 so this is this one is the 240 red 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.989
 here is one 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:16.620
 it is mandatory to arms of a friend 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:19.019
 red then I put four polishes that 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.800
 are in shades of brown top then 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.440
 a brown is the one I wear 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.500
 yes it's the one I'm wearing here that 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.419
 is a chocolate brown which is the 226 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.960
 this is then 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:40.229
 so that's it follow in fact you 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.820
 go see that so without the three and 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.669
 it's not at all the same color 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.840
 so here it is after you have the 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:52.680
 219 the 221 the 220 and 2221 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:57.750
 so these are moles then you have 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:01.590
 a mole that goes well rape is a little 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.139
 so this one is the 321 on the 320 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.639
 sorry I adore them I saw I squatted 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.800
 last year I squatted this 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.440
 year I really love this one 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.919
 it's the 319 so it's like a toc 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.770
 but clearer than the other and he goes he 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:18.750
 leans more towards the Belgian one and 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:22.590
 this one like a rate of corn that can 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.000
 plunges us more who goes more to maron 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.419
 rather because who dives is not 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.099
 the pool so here it is 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.099
 the 321 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:38.110
 then I put two glasses then 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.320
 attention did not open flash 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.270
 they are green then we have a green 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.740
 light khaki and a dark khaki green 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.880
 here I have a lot of trouble with 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:52.210
 colors but now it's easier 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:55.270
 so the dark khaki is the 347 and the 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.030
 persimmon next is the 346 that's it too 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:00.160
 I love letter its colors even if 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.450
 this one I find it a little too clear 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.320
 but here I am still 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.890
 and this one is it is beautiful I 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.930
 would even say it's a fir green 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:12.670
 yeah it looks like a green fir tree you green 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.950
 persimmon I do not know what you see but 

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:18.160
 this is me I have a lot of trouble to 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.470
 describe the colors of the words next 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:23.830
 so I put a blue I like guy 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.390
 blue winter but not blue flash like 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.130
 was it you know a sky blue or a 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.440
 something like that not really a dark blue 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.080
 so I put this one because it's a 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.590
 favorite and I took the gold 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:41.350
 dark blue complexion with glitter 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:46.510
 light blue that's it and this is the number 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:52.480
 2 199 and to finish these 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:56.260
 it's a bluish gray a bit like those 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.710
 this is the 381 so that's what made me 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.860
 actually buy 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.480
 there is not a long time and I surkiffe 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.220
 it really is a favorite 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:05.260
 I love it on the nails of the hands 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.120
 not too long because after too much 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.090
 long it's ugly but here I am 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.430
 do not go I palayson super long but I 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:15.520
 find it really beautiful so that's it 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.900
 I put you all the references in 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.900

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.430
