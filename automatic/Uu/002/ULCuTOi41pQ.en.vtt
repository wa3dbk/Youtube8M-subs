00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
going to be connecting the old ps3 to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.440 
going to be connecting the old ps3 to
the<00:00:14.510> new<00:00:14.900> ps3<00:00:15.349> and<00:00:15.939> it's<00:00:16.939> already<00:00:17.270> connected

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
the new ps3 and it's already connected

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.589 
the new ps3 and it's already connected
everything<00:00:18.009> internet<00:00:19.009> cables<00:00:19.369> back<00:00:19.490> there<00:00:19.820> my

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
everything internet cables back there my

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.260 
everything internet cables back there my
old<00:00:20.779> ps3<00:00:21.470> is<00:00:21.619> back<00:00:21.860> here<00:00:22.160> we<00:00:22.310> connected<00:00:22.730> it<00:00:22.820> all

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
old ps3 is back here we connected it all

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.479 
old ps3 is back here we connected it all
make<00:00:23.750> sure<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.200> both<00:00:24.590> of<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.890> ps3's<00:00:25.130> are

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:25.489 
make sure the both of the ps3's are

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:29.109 
make sure the both of the ps3's are
turned<00:00:25.910> off<00:00:26.119> while<00:00:26.540> you<00:00:26.720> do<00:00:26.840> that<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.919> uh<00:00:28.119> so

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
turned off while you do that and uh so

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.510 
turned off while you do that and uh so
now<00:00:29.300> what<00:00:29.570> we're<00:00:29.689> going<00:00:29.810> to<00:00:29.840> do<00:00:30.020> is<00:00:30.520> we're

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
now what we're going to do is we're

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.210 
now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:31.790> power<00:00:32.119> them<00:00:32.570> both<00:00:32.989> at<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:34.040> same

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
going to power them both at the same

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:41.250 
going to power them both at the same
time<00:00:34.840> so<00:00:35.840> it's<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:36.800> two<00:00:37.070> three<00:00:37.100> go

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.419 

alright<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.620> was<00:00:42.649> my<00:00:42.769> first<00:00:42.980> time<00:00:43.100> turning

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:43.429 
alright that was my first time turning

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:46.090 
alright that was my first time turning
on<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.579> new<00:00:43.699> ps3<00:00:44.149> so<00:00:44.559> that<00:00:45.559> wasn't<00:00:45.829> even<00:00:45.980> sure

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
on the new ps3 so that wasn't even sure

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.299 
on the new ps3 so that wasn't even sure
where<00:00:46.399> the<00:00:46.489> button<00:00:46.730> was<00:00:46.850> alright<00:00:47.780> so<00:00:48.250> now<00:00:49.250> we

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
where the button was alright so now we

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.790 
where the button was alright so now we
should<00:00:49.519> be<00:00:50.269> getting<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.839> message<00:00:51.199> on<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
should be getting a message on the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.250 
should be getting a message on the
screen<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.550> if<00:00:52.850> we<00:00:53.179> want<00:00:53.359> to<00:00:53.480> transfer

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
screen that if we want to transfer

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.399 
screen that if we want to transfer
so<00:00:55.070> hopefully<00:00:55.309> that<00:00:55.699> pops<00:00:56.030> up<00:00:56.300> if<00:00:56.929> it<00:00:57.050> doesn't

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
so hopefully that pops up if it doesn't

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:01.619 
so hopefully that pops up if it doesn't
then<00:00:57.640> we're<00:00:58.640> slow<00:00:58.789> find<00:00:59.089> out<00:00:59.269> what<00:00:59.809> happens

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.240 

this<00:01:09.899> is<00:01:10.079> wait<00:01:10.289> for<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> second<00:01:11.090> should<00:01:12.090> pop<00:01:12.359> up

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
this is wait for a second should pop up

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.870 
this is wait for a second should pop up
soon<00:01:14.329> hopefully<00:01:15.740> I'll<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:17.009> better<00:01:17.189> transfer

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
soon hopefully I'll be a better transfer

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:32.859 
soon hopefully I'll be a better transfer

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
will need an Ethernet cable which I have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.139 
will need an Ethernet cable which I have
cable<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.679> ps3<00:01:48.979> systems<00:01:49.429> turn<00:01:49.579> off<00:01:49.819> make<00:01:50.119> a

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
cable to ps3 systems turn off make a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.819 
cable to ps3 systems turn off make a
direct<00:01:50.539> connection<00:01:50.780> between<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.170> ps3<00:01:51.649> system

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
direct connection between the ps3 system

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.219 
direct connection between the ps3 system
during<00:01:52.310> your<00:01:53.240> system<00:01:53.569> using<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.869> Ethernet

during your system using the Ethernet

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.959 
during your system using the Ethernet
cable<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.709> then<00:01:54.890> turn<00:01:55.159> on<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:55.520> system's

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
cable and then turn on the system's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:04.120 
cable and then turn on the system's
again<00:01:57.609> do<00:01:59.350> that<00:02:00.729> transfer<00:02:02.890> transfer<00:02:03.890> data

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
again do that transfer transfer data

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.990 
again do that transfer transfer data
from<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:05.090> system<00:02:05.630> to<00:02:06.229> the<00:02:06.259> other<00:02:07.329> ps3<00:02:08.329> system

from this system to the other ps3 system

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.160 
from this system to the other ps3 system
so<00:02:11.000> that's<00:02:11.269> what<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.510> want<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.780> click<00:02:12.019> you

the other person roots of this system so
what<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.680> need<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> do<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.430> after<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.150> hit<00:03:02.269> that

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
what I need to do is after you hit that

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.940 
what I need to do is after you hit that
you<00:03:02.720> go<00:03:02.900> back<00:03:03.169> to<00:03:03.440> the<00:03:03.590> new<00:03:04.069> ps3<00:03:04.669> screen<00:03:05.859> so<00:03:06.859> let

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
you go back to the new ps3 screen so let

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.509 
you go back to the new ps3 screen so let
me<00:03:07.040> go<00:03:07.190> back<00:03:07.220> there<00:03:08.230> there's<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:09.410> old<00:03:09.590> ps3<00:03:10.280> or

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
me go back there there's the old ps3 or

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:16.270 
me go back there there's the old ps3 or
the<00:03:10.790> new<00:03:10.910> PS<00:03:11.120> everyone<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:15.220> go<00:03:16.220> to

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the new PS everyone and then you go to

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.729 
the new PS everyone and then you go to
data<00:03:16.519> transfer<00:03:20.079> transfer<00:03:21.079> data<00:03:21.260> from<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
data transfer transfer data from the

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.850 
data transfer transfer data from the
other<00:03:21.919> ps3<00:03:22.400> system<00:03:22.579> to<00:03:22.970> this<00:03:23.180> system

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.500 

so<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> hit<00:03:26.880> number<00:03:27.180> two<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.600> time<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:30.360> then

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so I hit number two this time and then

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.070 
so I hit number two this time and then
you<00:03:30.600> hit<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:34.250> it<00:03:35.250> should<00:03:35.610> start

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
you hit that and then it should start

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.430 
you hit that and then it should start
transferring<00:03:37.080> all<00:03:37.650> the<00:03:37.890> data<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:43.230> probably

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
transferring all the data and I probably

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.170 
transferring all the data and I probably
have<00:03:43.710> like<00:03:44.270> 60<00:03:45.270> ish<00:03:45.420> gigs<00:03:45.870> on<00:03:46.200> it<00:03:46.380> so<00:03:46.880> it<00:03:47.880> should

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
have like 60 ish gigs on it so it should

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.980 
have like 60 ish gigs on it so it should
take<00:03:48.450> about<00:03:48.890> two<00:03:49.940> hours<00:03:50.940> or<00:03:51.300> an<00:03:51.690> hour<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.930> a

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
take about two hours or an hour and a

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.220 
take about two hours or an hour and a
half<00:03:52.170> maybe<00:03:54.020> so<00:03:55.020> let's<00:03:55.230> just<00:03:55.740> wait<00:03:57.110> see<00:03:58.110> what

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
half maybe so let's just wait see what

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:12.750 
half maybe so let's just wait see what
happens<00:03:58.590> here

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.180 

okay<00:04:13.760> so<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:14.450> had<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:16.570> add<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.930> format<00:04:18.739> the<00:04:18.920> thing

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
okay so I had to add to format the thing

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.280 
okay so I had to add to format the thing
that<00:04:19.580> took<00:04:19.790> me<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.390> took<00:04:20.450> already<00:04:21.019> like<00:04:21.170> an

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
that took me it took already like an

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.810 
that took me it took already like an
hour<00:04:21.470> that's<00:04:21.950> before<00:04:22.250> I<00:04:22.280> figured<00:04:22.610> everything

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
hour that's before I figured everything

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.510 
hour that's before I figured everything
out<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.750> have<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:23.990> format<00:04:24.350> the<00:04:24.500> new<00:04:24.740> ps3<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
out so I have to format the new ps3 and

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.950 
out so I have to format the new ps3 and
everything<00:04:25.820> and<00:04:25.940> after<00:04:26.030> I've<00:04:26.270> done<00:04:26.450> that<00:04:26.510> it

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
everything and after I've done that it

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.860 
everything and after I've done that it
finally<00:04:27.200> takes<00:04:27.590> me<00:04:27.800> to<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.690> transfer<00:04:29.690> data

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
finally takes me to the transfer data

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.650 
finally takes me to the transfer data
utility<00:04:30.260> so<00:04:31.190> right<00:04:31.940> now<00:04:32.060> it's<00:04:32.270> just<00:04:32.420> counting

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
utility so right now it's just counting

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.290 
utility so right now it's just counting
and<00:04:33.380> it's<00:04:34.070> going<00:04:34.190> to<00:04:34.250> transfer<00:04:34.850> the

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
and it's going to transfer the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:45.010 
and it's going to transfer the
information<00:04:36.160> from<00:04:37.160> that<00:04:37.850> and<00:04:39.370> to<00:04:40.370> that<00:04:44.020> yeah

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
information from that and to that yeah

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.770 
information from that and to that yeah
so<00:04:45.500> uh<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:46.130> probably<00:04:46.790> had<00:04:46.970> like<00:04:47.120> 60<00:04:47.600> something

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
so uh I probably had like 60 something

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.270 
so uh I probably had like 60 something
geeks<00:04:48.140> on<00:04:48.320> here<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.800> uh<00:04:50.740> let's<00:04:51.740> see<00:04:51.920> it's<00:04:52.100> like
