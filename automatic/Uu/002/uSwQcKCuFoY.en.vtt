00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
nothing nuts but it does look a bit

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.650 
nothing nuts but it does look a bit
different<00:02:29.350> than<00:02:29.859> the<00:02:30.040> normal<00:02:30.310> skin<00:02:30.660> that's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
different than the normal skin that's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.000 
different than the normal skin that's
his<00:02:31.840> heel<00:02:32.079> right<00:02:32.230> there<00:02:32.410> you'll<00:02:32.560> notice<00:02:32.829> he's

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
his heel right there you'll notice he's

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.060 
his heel right there you'll notice he's
using<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.459> pad<00:02:33.930> check<00:02:34.930> that<00:02:35.079> out<00:02:35.109> when<00:02:35.350> we<00:02:35.500> use

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
using the pad check that out when we use

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.670 
using the pad check that out when we use
the<00:02:36.100> seats<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.269> mount<00:02:37.510> he<00:02:38.260> always<00:02:38.410> looks

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the seats of the mount he always looks

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.620 
the seats of the mount he always looks
at<00:02:38.799> his<00:02:38.920> book<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.850> case<00:02:40.060> his<00:02:40.299> book<00:02:40.510> is

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
at his book and in this case his book is

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.479 
at his book and in this case his book is
that<00:02:40.660> pad<00:02:41.079> that<00:02:41.260> he's<00:02:41.410> got<00:02:41.590> there<00:02:41.859> so<00:02:42.370> that's

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
that pad that he's got there so that's

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.360 
that pad that he's got there so that's
pretty<00:02:42.700> cool<00:02:43.079> in<00:02:44.079> terms<00:02:44.320> of<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:45.100> know<00:02:45.130> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
pretty cool in terms of the you know the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.949 
pretty cool in terms of the you know the
hero<00:02:45.549> animations<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.329> guess<00:02:46.510> there's<00:02:46.720> not

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
hero animations I guess there's not

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.810 
hero animations I guess there's not
really<00:02:47.170> much<00:02:47.350> different<00:02:47.410> with<00:02:47.890> champion

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
really much different with champion

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.170 
really much different with champion
skins<00:02:49.150> in<00:02:49.269> this<00:02:49.390> game<00:02:49.570> but<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:51.030> think<00:02:52.030> that's

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
skins in this game but I think that's

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.220 
skins in this game but I think that's
pretty<00:02:52.299> much<00:02:52.450> everything<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.959> if<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:53.109> guys
