00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.600
 now there is also the claim in tn 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.620
 achieve that Bolivia has an outlet to the sea 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.840
 in the next stage it will end but it is not an obstacle in Peru says that 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.199
 it will not be an obstacle 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.499
 how would that exit from bolivia to the sea 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.409
 it's a game 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.050
 that is bolivia with chile 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.130
 bad alerts the information of our listeners 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.239
 They have even lived etc 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.239
 1 800 only 79 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:30.609
 the peru will reach 300 kilometers below what arrives now 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.050
 or 200 kilometers 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.490
 and bolivia out to sea below those 200 kilometers and had a fringe 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.390
 at least 200 kilometers 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.890
 Coast 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.650
 a conflict a 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.560
 moyano 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.290
 to enter into those issues 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.370
 I know why Polybius ran out of Marelli and Peru 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.240
 ended up losing 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.700
 a large part of that 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 It is the limit and maritime limit 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.900
 then the problem was 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900
 if one day this is fixed because Bolivia was locked 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.020
 in veterans is a topic rather in the symbolic because 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.980
 if it is fixed with chile and they put a port 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.040
 ii sign without paying taxes or anything is as if they had a port 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 and the same with Peru 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.640
 who generously said a few years ago already here has a sea life that 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 they establish their 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.220
 their factories and their 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 its docks and use this as if it were yours 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.530
 the problem is that at that time it was established in several years 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.090
 if ever chile is the evening with bolivia 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.340
 and gave him an exit for one or one loser 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.280
 of what was once Peruvian territory 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.610
 Peru had the right to say yes or no 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.560
 and we have always said 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.330
 we will say yes yes 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.790
 but nothing that we are not getting to hinder me I would love that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.120
 Bolivia lost its exit to the sea because 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.740
 this is a right that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.319
 the reality that he lost and is a right that has to recover that reality not 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.399
 that attack up to 300 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.309
 in the medium term weigh 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.609
 in the medium term with more rationality I do not think that immediately 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.509
 I do not think it was left 

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:20.409
 obviously this tells the Chilean population 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:25.659
 this 140 years ago the Chilean lord has to give him is 10 kilometers from 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.999
 wide by 1 by 100 kilometers long 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:32.139
 in ccoo a la vega as rallies manifestation 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.069
 there is always some candidate who wants to come up with that argument 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.739
 that's why it's just take it very seriously with tweezers 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.329
 but if they want to do it 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.519
 see what else I would like to eliminate the last problem 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.719
 of the bird there 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.209
 percent and between us the brother countries also press 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.810
 and I am sure that the next Peruvian president and the following ones 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.779
 They will say the same 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:00.419
 we will not be an obstacle to the welfare of the people and something that we will not be 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:01.499
 we 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.230
 and that is not currently Peruvian 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.549
 because we are going to hinder already 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.670
 admonished I touch the issue of internal politics but 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.680
 open participation is required if I want to ask 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.480
 that feels the garcÃ­a I think that it is going to maintain the line because in the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.410
 elections 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.860
 third is as president precisely 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.630
 of the Republic of Peru still in hand to hand with a candidate who 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.709
 the hierarchy to power and is that this tendency to countries that has 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.609
 criticized 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.769
 it is believed that now after these three cubic meter has been had and the 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.029
 consolidate your destinations 

00:03:34.029 --> 00:03:37.139
 has commented in this interview the Peruvians are going to follow the same line 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.669
 there is a possibility that meat 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:43.369
 well not now but I also want to see how are the countries that followed 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.739
 another trend 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.400
 the truth is that simply say that inflation have how much they grew so much 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.509
 in poverty and, of course, its democracy 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.899
 there are countries that arm themselves fighting with the press that the channels go 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.759
 obviously when someone says I'm going to regulate 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.759
 national life through the state 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.259
 has to end up regulating communication too 

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:09.259
 min and ended up closing according to the ts dictatorship 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.209
 sometimes interest 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.379
 first but they are not very aware of that and they know what 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.410
 what I say the democratic model of growth out win 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.139
 and he has also refused to put the hatch 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.560
 pedroia based on that occasion this year is low intellectual stature in 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.659
 his speeches 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.840
 in favor of someone insulting the other 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.930
 in this case 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 what is the message more than the president in front of that 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:41.590
 We were state day at the close will be taken out of the Peruvians 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.460
 I do not think that cyrus much birds 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.050
 will not insist on that subject 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.140
 Live your life 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.620
 how do we have a state relationship 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.240
 maybe not as close as we have a method with colombia 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.289
 leave tolosa towers 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:59.340
 I will not leave 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.330
 I am explaining myself to speak about venezuela or to insult no no it is not my topic 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.770
 it's not about looking at what the neighbor is but about doing it better than a trial 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.729
 since draw your conclusion from the spectators is another problem 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.819
 I do not think that hugo 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.189
 20 16 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.979
 enter this topic 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.509
 additionally to me it seems to me that according to the trends that exist in the 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.509
 surveys where we are still ten months 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.259
 the vast majority of Peruvians say or the way is this 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.249
 they lived several surnames 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.409
 but the vast majority 70 and 80% of the road st 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.409
 and that in the second round of health 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.689
 sure defeat of who says not the way Moscow 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.689
 or in the time of Mao Tse-tung that has not happened 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:50.419
 that already happened 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:53.319
 you have to wake up 

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:56.240
 on purpose to that ccoo 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.589
 at that time the situation of the dissidents 

00:05:58.589 --> 00:06:02.489
 after those praises about 10 to 14 every five homes of the intervention 

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:03.979
 also from Spain they managed 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.220
 to get out of jail although they will be imprisoned for more than seven years 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.800
 many for thinking differently 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.270
 and countries in the region such as Chile also highlighted that in Spain 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.710
 they are also welcoming 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.300
 you believe that now the highlighted sanction 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.729
 bribe in the obvious 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.819
 if you profile one was neat 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.349
 that every hunting season on the island 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:26.710
 the work that we also see fidel Castro still disgust us siedo and total 

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:28.830
 until 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.860
 I do not think that has changed 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.919
 I am the head of state 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.759
 my country has diplomatic relations 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.409
 there was not a metro way they opined 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.350
 Within a year, it is planned to become only Alan Garcia 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.749
 that promise 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.779
 compromise your photos 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:50.460
 said that this fact is to allow 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.800
 and so 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.569
 I can tell you what you thought 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:57.330
 I can tell you something 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.779
 I want all the peoples of the earth to be 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:03.409
 as I want it to be my country 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:05.259
 democracy 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:09.419
 total freedom of freedom of expression free political parties and elections 

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:13.270
 free without intervention and that the people are the ones who decide things 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.069
 that's what I want but all the peoples of the earth 

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.070
 Recently the proposal of Peru Alan Garcia has been very kind 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.600
 thank you for all this time with AIDS will reprogram very well man of 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.669
 our viewers thank you very much 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.150

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.360
 always the same 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.319
 of course 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.059
 the week of sheets or through web tools let's do 

00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:42.209
 mutual commitment of predators demand rose more than the average of 

00:07:42.209 --> 00:07:43.249
 state 

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:47.180
 finally the thing is clear to access the migratory stations of birds and 

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:48.629
 dead birds 

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:53.619
