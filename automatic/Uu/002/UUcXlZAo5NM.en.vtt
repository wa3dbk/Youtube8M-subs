00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.550 
to pick off my teammates as their
spawning<00:03:40.329> so<00:03:41.329> I<00:03:41.389> did<00:03:41.569> the<00:03:41.659> exact<00:03:42.019> opposite<00:03:42.500> and

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
spawning so I did the exact opposite and

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.020 
spawning so I did the exact opposite and
go<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:42.829> the<00:03:42.949> other<00:03:42.979> side<00:03:43.280> of<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.430> map<00:03:43.639> and<00:03:43.819> try

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
go to the other side of the map and try

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.369 
go to the other side of the map and try
and<00:03:44.090> pick<00:03:44.239> off<00:03:44.389> her<00:03:44.540> teammates<00:03:44.989> as<00:03:45.199> their

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
and pick off her teammates as their

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.500 
and pick off her teammates as their
smoldering<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:46.940> guess<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.209> have<00:03:47.299> pretty

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
smoldering so I guess we have pretty

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.569 
smoldering so I guess we have pretty
similar<00:03:47.900> play<00:03:48.139> styles<00:03:48.620> because<00:03:48.829> except<00:03:49.400> she's

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
similar play styles because except she's

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.699 
similar play styles because except she's
beasts<00:03:49.940> with<00:03:50.150> chocolates<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:50.930> stuff<00:03:51.169> and<00:03:51.470> she
