00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.800
 very easy to prepare 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.890
 and it is a cake with water or without 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.500

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.559

 the ingredients are in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:52.600
 for about 35 40 minutes and this 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.219
 result will be a very cake 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.219
 soft and crumbly 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.570
 Costanzo instead I decided to prepare 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.370
 however, the cold pasta because summer 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.040
 it's hot so I don't feel like eating 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.170
 hot pasta and here you see my mother 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.630
 which makes the typical orecchiette obviously 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.940
 of the poliia therefore the fallen not ne 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.649
 we buy them at home then 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.840
 while he prepares the old ladies 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.000
 I instead prepare the dressing of 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.259

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.039
 shrimp that I boiled in water 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.580
 hot 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.619
 then chopped parsley a spoon 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.560
 heaped with lemon juice 2 tbsp 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.580
 filled with olive oil , especially a 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.319
 macerate about half an hour in time 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.670
 my mother finishes preparing the 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:41.670
 orecchiette and those photos 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.330

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:51.850
 after which I add to the cold pasta a little 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:55.119
 of chopped tomatoes and 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.509
 fresh rocket and finally the shrimp 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.890
 macerated in oil and lemon and I swear that 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.890
 It's a show 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.549
 it is not the decision to prepare the mousse 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:23.739
 the vowel chocolate and a mousse that 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.689
 is depopulated on the internet and is 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.849
 really easy to prepare 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.189
 you have to melt in a double boiler 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.840
 dark chocolate 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.769
 then put everything in the blender 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.549
 then the lawyer a whole lawyer a 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:44.560
 also 2 tablespoon of brown sugar 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:47.650
 a spoonful of bitter cocoa 2 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.810
 spoons of milk what you prefer 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.209
 you can also not put sideways between 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.980
 water and finally chocolate 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.730
 all chocolate 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.069
 put in a glass maybe 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.230
 decorate it were chocolate juice 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.079
 or with cereals 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:09.129
 if you put it cool for half an hour 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:13.599
 an hour or so and then eat that 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:17.730
 really great and the nice thing is that 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.730

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.390
 I decided to prepare stuffed zucchini 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.340
 there is no raw ham 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.130
 I will abolish two potatoes and the two courgettes 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.130

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.470
 then put the potatoes in a roccino 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.720
 mozzarella and ham and then 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.470
 really in the form of sugar for about 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.580
 half an hour and our zucchini 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.580

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.040
