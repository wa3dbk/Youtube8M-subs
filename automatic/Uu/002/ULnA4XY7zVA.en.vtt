00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.020
 hundred 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.519
 hello to all this statement mitterrand the secret and that comes back 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.620
 today to end up for the commented gameplay 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.589
 on the convoy map 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.609
 I'm at the call of the five quick parts 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.800
 get started I have some ads or do 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.550
 in 2009 it's a very good news i get my new computer monday 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 I make a small video to be able to explain the characteristics 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.660
 so it's not really going to boost the speed of the oyster that's really 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.550
 at the moment 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.130
 not just by romance writer all the time always extremely slow and 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.870
 the others who is boring 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.039
 2 2 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.260
 she would like to put an ad among the subscribers 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.600
 I notice a little all those who are given 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.180
 videos for example that are not so sure then I saw like that 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.130
 I noticed that you were strong of assets ie 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.489
 an uncertain they click on a subscriber of mediapart that had the videos 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.630
 or so there was never guests we never think about the chain 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.290
 firstly all these people there it is true the video she is 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.660
 unsubscribe because when his good is a little without a contract it's as if 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.340
 you make a contract 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.700
 a subscription for a newspaper I could not do third day the newspaper 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.680
 for example that would be really top 10 that the doctor said that the weight 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.190
 so for all the people who are cheaper I would like either 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.670
 fight you participate in the chain saffron by the way to fiji 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.969
 a little bit much to this storm 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.330
 Argentina is the most bloated a few months ago 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.290
 so here it is the safest we'll say it like that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.890
 finally in the essonne it's tight tinker really 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.370
 try to meet your subscription or so subscribe 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.370
 wasquehal 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.070
 it is true that it is not very pleasant for the commentator to have 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.070
 subscribers but who does not watch these videos 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.079
 it's a bit hard explained 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.090
 it's pretty much stable 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.309
 a logic gold other things start pc to say 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:12.959
 so that m like that will you 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.039
 me it will pay 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.180
 in addition to the goal 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.869
 I must not forget that 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:23.119
 I'm going to throw a little principle not practical it's like the videos I'm going 

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.170
 to do crazy things every month he will have regained 1 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.319
 in fact if you want 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.230
 it's going to be every video 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.650
 puremagnetik the enigma and the bass at home that could take to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.129
 the riddle first in the comments 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.189
 many not attributed to France - only about myself who does my little 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.709
 ranking and at the end of August the person who will have the most points 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.379
 with lens and arras a price 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.189
 I do not know yet what will have to be said elsewhere to their 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:52.519
 competitors also I think 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.379
 others 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
 so good so good button m 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.689
 that's about all 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:01.989
 for ads 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.870
 yes and no again one last time and I know I do a lot today 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.619
 the mayor 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:06.849
 it's like that 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.629
 for anyone who would like to send me clear ranges that I 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.749
 could be commented 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:14.479
 I did not hear what he presented because of the problems 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.300
 entity 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.320
 but be aware that from Monday bar saw less a message on youtube me 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.409
 saying that 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.329
 could exploit a new gameplay and then I would make it fun 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.200
 because I could really release more videos especially more 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:28.109
 regularly 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.760
 because before all the other companies to finally come out 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:36.389
 bongo will not be so fast a big star with it will always be necessary 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:37.220
 the turn of 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.260
 for that I expect optical fiber in my village but it is not for 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.749
 right away so the afr with 

00:03:43.749 --> 00:03:47.269
 and I'll keep you informed anyway so little you'll be first 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.299
 to know 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.790
 So now it's a little bit by the banks 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.569
 the art market confidence a few weeks p 5 karti fast 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.689
 why fast ginisty already missing m simply not I find that it's 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.369
 really devastating that is to say that you shoot at the score as said 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:05.139
 clean hammouche mag 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.339
 too much in the mouth renault auxerre 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.559
 Thursday of shit 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:11.579
 it takes everything in the mouth 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.289
 the current rebound I think I'll stop small cuts like that 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.709
 because it really does not make me go hate you here 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.879
 second second prize of the day 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:26.439
 so the mp5 because messi member companies a disaster the elders get 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.409
 take all of a qualcomm that make the score but it's pleasant me I love 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.550
 do it serve 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.259
 I have the impression that their chips eyes 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.819
 forgive me the expression for those who love I do not like to say things 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:38.009
 like fire 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.839
 why fraud the health asip I'm going to do a little bit where I have you 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:43.940
 nothing to do with securing the area 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.010
 because the advice to scare the liverpool players if he wanted 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.010
 secure a point first secure the area 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.689
 it may have magical priorities 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.029
 dante a month ago 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.029
 the schedules look at the score just in passing 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:01.009
 we are processing 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.900
 funeral free access 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.910
 I prefer film 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.370
 his death is stuck in their equipment has squeezed the game I launched 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.030
 my console by the end of the live so much fun 8 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.719
 so anyway but hey that's ghani 141 19 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.580
 but what did you like this 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.659
 the mango here it is that it was provided since the beginning of this man that 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.889
 but it happens days without when you come across really enemies 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.069
 rotten straw arte offers you can make my party and I like that 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:34.419
 even if she knows that after the challenger 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.620
 the partners 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.960
 to small as proof that I had forgotten 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.949
 we are going to dislodge him from others 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.010
 and well yes yes apparently I had to stay in this part 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.759
 to know that the gameplay has been or is playing rope 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.669
 in october me still play the water points that stabilizes there is a 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.689
 week about a week

 dong dong dong so have real reality for alain perrin did not talk to me 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:05.789
 anti-aerial latourelle I can already say that the previous videos 

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:10.099
 you know what all normally it's my favorite little secret in this dish 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:12.789
 as i love it i fell in love with the infernal tower 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.719
 simply because he's signed all the stuff behind the wheel m 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:17.949
 HÃ©nique 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.410
 wikileaks reveals from everywhere in less than a year in refining fort on board 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.740
 So here is 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.110
 by the way find no tracking waters on modern warfare 2 it really does 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.460
 long time I did not do 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.339

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:35.819
 the video m 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:36.729
 that is all 

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.770
 in passing I thank the cockroaches flap 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.360
