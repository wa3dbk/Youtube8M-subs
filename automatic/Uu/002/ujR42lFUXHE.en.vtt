it's some different mold back when I was
about<00:02:01.980> 5<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.930> different<00:02:05.170> draft<00:02:05.590> modes

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
about 5 they have different draft modes

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.040 
about 5 they have different draft modes

a translucent do blue brick so this

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.349 
a translucent do blue brick so this
one's<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.169> is<00:04:14.319> very<00:04:14.919> cool<00:04:15.250> this<00:04:15.819> is<00:04:16.060> actually

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
one's that is very cool this is actually

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:19.229 
one's that is very cool this is actually
one<00:04:16.479> of<00:04:16.510> my<00:04:16.630> favorite<00:04:17.079> DUPLO<00:04:17.560> pieces<00:04:18.010> ever<00:04:18.250> so

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
one of my favorite DUPLO pieces ever so

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.100 
one of my favorite DUPLO pieces ever so
I<00:04:19.739> do<00:04:20.739> think<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.430> this<00:04:21.609> is<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:22.150> better<00:04:22.630> value

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
I do think that this is a better value

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.990 
I do think that this is a better value
than<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.770> last<00:04:23.949> two<00:04:24.159> plus<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.639> reviewed

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
than the last two plus that we reviewed

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.180 
than the last two plus that we reviewed
which<00:04:25.210> I'm<00:04:25.690> sorry<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.320> forget<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.860> set

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
which I'm sorry I do forget the set

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.000 
which I'm sorry I do forget the set
number<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.880> was<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:29.050> can<00:04:29.199> go<00:04:29.320> check<00:04:29.590> actually

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
number it was you can go check actually

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.690 
number it was you can go check actually
it<00:04:30.070> was<00:04:30.220> a<00:04:30.360> another<00:04:31.360> zoo<00:04:31.750> set<00:04:32.050> but<00:04:32.979> I<00:04:33.310> do<00:04:33.430> think

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
it was a another zoo set but I do think

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.580 
it was a another zoo set but I do think
this<00:04:33.849> is<00:04:33.909> a<00:04:34.030> better<00:04:34.210> value<00:04:34.419> it's<00:04:34.810> $5<00:04:35.380> cheaper

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
this is a better value it's $5 cheaper

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.840 
this is a better value it's $5 cheaper
1499

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
1499

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.510 
1499
so<00:04:37.450> I<00:04:37.930> think<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.380> can<00:04:38.530> get<00:04:38.740> better<00:04:38.950> value<00:04:39.190> with

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
so I think you can get better value with

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.970 
so I think you can get better value with
this<00:04:39.670> then<00:04:39.940> actually<00:04:40.300> most<00:04:40.570> DUPLO<00:04:41.050> sets<00:04:41.080> you

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
this then actually most DUPLO sets you

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.980 
this then actually most DUPLO sets you
know<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.400> would<00:04:42.850> count<00:04:43.060> these<00:04:43.270> is<00:04:43.540> actually<00:04:43.690> a

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
know I would count these is actually a

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.680 
know I would count these is actually a
figure<00:04:44.320> each<00:04:44.640> in<00:04:45.640> reality<00:04:46.270> they're<00:04:46.510> about

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
figure each in reality they're about

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.130 
figure each in reality they're about
their<00:04:47.200> worth<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:48.270> they're<00:04:49.270> just<00:04:49.690> as<00:04:49.870> good<00:04:50.020> as

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
their worth that they're just as good as

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.290 
their worth that they're just as good as
a<00:04:50.170> figure<00:04:50.560> in<00:04:50.680> my<00:04:50.830> opinion<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.850> in<00:04:52.060> reality

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
a figure in my opinion so in reality

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.260 
a figure in my opinion so in reality
this<00:04:52.600> is<00:04:52.660> like<00:04:52.990> coming<00:04:53.500> with<00:04:53.650> five<00:04:54.310> figures<00:04:54.940> or

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
this is like coming with five figures or

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.450 
this is like coming with five figures or
four<00:04:55.750> animals<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.260> one<00:04:56.380> figure<00:04:56.770> whichever<00:04:57.370> way

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
four animals in one figure whichever way

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.310 
four animals in one figure whichever way
you<00:04:57.490> won't<00:04:57.700> look<00:04:57.820> at<00:04:57.940> it<00:04:58.030> says<00:04:58.510> very<00:04:58.840> nice<00:04:59.050> and

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
you won't look at it says very nice and

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.580 
you won't look at it says very nice and
again<00:05:00.040> 19<00:05:00.550> pieces<00:05:00.880> that's<00:05:01.720> very<00:05:02.290> good

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590
