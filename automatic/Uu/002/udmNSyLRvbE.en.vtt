00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.590 
pretty good pool right here so we get to
legend<00:01:30.470> rookies<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:32.220> pack<00:01:32.460> opening<00:01:32.970> or

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
legend rookies in one pack opening or

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.749 
legend rookies in one pack opening or
two<00:01:33.780> packs<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.380> yeah<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.430> pretty<00:01:35.579> good

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
two packs and yeah that's a pretty good

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.640 
two packs and yeah that's a pretty good
pool<00:01:36.000> hopefully<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.229> another<00:01:37.500> one

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
pool hopefully we can get another one

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.929 
pool hopefully we can get another one
that<00:01:37.860> would<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.159> crazy<00:01:38.549> if<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.729> pull

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
that would be pretty crazy if we pull

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.480 
that would be pretty crazy if we pull
the<00:01:39.030> Calvin<00:01:39.360> Johnson<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.869> our<00:01:39.990> next<00:01:40.229> pack

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
the Calvin Johnson in our next pack

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.380 
the Calvin Johnson in our next pack
honestly<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.909> would<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.090> like<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
honestly I think that would be like the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.160 
honestly I think that would be like the
best<00:01:42.540> um<00:01:43.040> legend<00:01:44.040> pack<00:01:44.220> opening<00:01:44.700> ever<00:01:45.170> but

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
best um legend pack opening ever but

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.810 
best um legend pack opening ever but
let's<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.500> who<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> get<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.610> last
