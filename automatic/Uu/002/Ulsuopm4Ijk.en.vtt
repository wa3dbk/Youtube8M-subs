00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.570
 the outer corner of the eye tip do 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.570
 long departing side 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.079

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.600
 just like that you can make arrows on 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.000
 everyday 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.460
 and if we need to turn more fashionable 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.899
 suitable for dinner or for 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.360
 evening event 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:41.590

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.330
 the top line should be rounded 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.160
 oriented will serve as the border between 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.160
 mobile and fixed eyelids 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 be sure to let the arrows dry 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:15.270
 before opening your eyes then lightly 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 emphasize the lower eyelid to give 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.440
