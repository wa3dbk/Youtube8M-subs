00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
get this weapon melee is viable again

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.900 
get this weapon melee is viable again
because<00:00:18.029> melee<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.449> cavi<00:00:18.690> underdog<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.830> 1.3<00:00:20.730> if

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
because melee is cavi underdog in 1.3 if

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
because the muleteer weapons for melee

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.939 
because the muleteer weapons for melee
are<00:00:26.220> not<00:00:26.519> geared<00:00:26.960> insanely<00:00:27.960> favorable
