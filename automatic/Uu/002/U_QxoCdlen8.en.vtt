00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
glue gun because it works better than

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.350 
glue gun because it works better than
the<00:00:40.680> tape<00:00:40.860> but<00:00:41.370> it'll<00:00:41.640> smell<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.910> lot<00:00:42.090> better

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
than the e6000 glue next you will need a

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.110 
than the e6000 glue next you will need a
pair<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.350> shoes<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> don't<00:00:47.219> quite<00:00:47.640> fit<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
right the shoes are already easy to walk

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
right the shoes are already easy to walk
in<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.899> sometimes<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.530> doesn't<00:00:52.860> quite<00:00:53.070> agree

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
in but sometimes it doesn't quite agree

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.180 
in but sometimes it doesn't quite agree
with<00:00:53.550> linoleum

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.779 
you happen to have one more pair of sole
pads<00:00:58.260> left<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.280> use<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.640> adhesive

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
pads left so I can use the adhesive

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.020 
pads left so I can use the adhesive
backing<00:01:00.420> as<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.260> pattern<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.820> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
backing as a pattern if you don't have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.759 
backing as a pattern if you don't have
one<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> these<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:03.960> cut<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.439> oval

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
one of these you can just cut an oval

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.670 
one of these you can just cut an oval
shape<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.280> measures<00:01:05.670> around<00:01:05.970> 2<00:01:06.240> inches<00:01:06.420> by<00:01:07.290> 3

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
shape that measures around 2 inches by 3

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
shape that measures around 2 inches by 3
inches<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:08.549> cut<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> shape<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
inches and then cut it to shape the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
inches and then cut it to shape the
bottom<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.840> shoe<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.100> heel<00:01:11.310> liners

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

inch<00:01:13.829> by<00:01:14.250> four<00:01:15.240> inches<00:01:15.679> to<00:01:16.679> begin<00:01:17.039> just<00:01:17.579> take

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
inch by four inches to begin just take

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.760 
inch by four inches to begin just take
your<00:01:17.909> paper<00:01:18.060> pattern<00:01:18.630> place<00:01:19.109> it<00:01:19.320> on<00:01:19.500> top<00:01:19.710> of

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
your paper pattern place it on top of

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.859 
your paper pattern place it on top of
your<00:01:20.070> shelf<00:01:20.310> lighter<00:01:20.579> and<00:01:20.909> start<00:01:21.630> cutting

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
your shelf lighter and start cutting

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.039 
your shelf lighter and start cutting
around<00:01:22.109> it<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.149> suggest<00:01:24.149> using<00:01:24.329> a<00:01:24.569> better<00:01:24.780> pair

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
around it I suggest using a better pair

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
around it I suggest using a better pair
of<00:01:25.140> scissors<00:01:25.469> because<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.340> kind<00:01:26.579> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
of scissors because this one kind of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.760 
of scissors because this one kind of
sucked<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.149> it<00:01:27.390> took<00:01:27.569> me<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> while<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.530> all

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
sucked and it took me a while to go all

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.730 
sucked and it took me a while to go all
the<00:01:29.069> way<00:01:29.159> around<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the way around it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
the way around it
tada<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.789> Sol<00:01:33.179> pad<00:01:33.420> there<00:01:33.959> are

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
tada you now have a Sol pad there are

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
tada you now have a Sol pad there are
two<00:01:34.229> sides<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:35.009> things<00:01:35.280> there's<00:01:35.969> a

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
two sides to these things there's a

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
two sides to these things there's a
bumpy<00:01:36.509> side<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.799> smooth<00:01:38.100> side<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.670> want

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
bumpy side and the smooth side you want

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.029 
bumpy side and the smooth side you want
to<00:01:38.909> make<00:01:38.969> sure<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.630> apply<00:01:39.899> your<00:01:40.079> glue<00:01:40.319> onto<00:01:40.709> the

and not burn yourself

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.649 
and not burn yourself
since<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> pads<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.789> little<00:01:57.119> holes<00:01:57.299> in<00:01:57.479> them

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
since the pads have little holes in them

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.869 
since the pads have little holes in them
the<00:01:57.959> glue<00:01:58.200> could<00:01:58.439> seep<00:01:58.649> through<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.729> could

00:01:59.869 --> 00:01:59.879 
the glue could seep through and it could

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:02.539 
the glue could seep through and it could
be<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> disaster<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> use<00:02:01.500> something<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.310> kind

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

done for the heel liners you do the
exact<00:02:11.910> same<00:02:12.150> thing<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:12.660> take<00:02:13.319> your<00:02:13.470> shelf

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680

liner<00:02:14.030> place<00:02:15.030> your<00:02:15.239> pattern<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.690> top<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.200> then

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
liner place your pattern on top and then

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.879 
liner place your pattern on top and then
cut<00:02:17.340> around<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:18.109> the<00:02:19.109> shelf<00:02:19.380> liner<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.799> a

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:19.889 
cut around it the shelf liner is a

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.620 
cut around it the shelf liner is a
little<00:02:20.069> bit<00:02:20.160> thin<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.730> I<00:02:20.760> had<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> cut<00:02:21.299> four

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
little bit thin so I had to cut four

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.229 
little bit thin so I had to cut four
strips<00:02:21.660> so<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.560> can<00:02:22.859> double<00:02:23.220> up<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.609> make<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
strips so I can double up and make it a

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.759 
strips so I can double up and make it a
little<00:02:24.329> bit<00:02:24.510> thicker<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:25.109> can<00:02:25.260> cut<00:02:25.470> as<00:02:25.590> much

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
little bit thicker you can cut as much

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.199 
little bit thicker you can cut as much
as<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.430> all<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:26.639> have<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.819> do<00:02:27.000> is

around that way you don't burn your
fingers<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:44.819> then<00:02:45.780> just<00:02:46.260> apply<00:02:46.410> glue<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.280> the

smooth<00:02:48.599> side<00:02:48.959> of<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.799> liner<00:02:50.209> and<00:02:51.230> then<00:02:52.230> very

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
smooth side of the liner and then very

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.159 
smooth side of the liner and then very
very<00:02:53.099> carefully<00:02:53.730> apply<00:02:54.269> it<00:02:54.329> to<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.690> heel<00:02:54.930> of

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
very carefully apply it to the heel of

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.660 
very carefully apply it to the heel of
your<00:02:55.290> shoes

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.930 

I<00:03:00.319> had<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> lot<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> extra<00:03:01.890> liners<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.580> decided

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
I had a lot of extra liners so I decided

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
I had a lot of extra liners so I decided
to<00:03:03.120> make<00:03:03.240> some<00:03:03.420> soul<00:03:03.660> pads<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.370> get

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
to make some soul pads you can just get

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.729 
to make some soul pads you can just get
one<00:03:06.180> from<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.630> other<00:03:06.810> shoe<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.290> put<00:03:07.500> it<00:03:07.590> in

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
one from your other shoe and put it in

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.550 
one from your other shoe and put it in
you<00:03:08.489> don't<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.239> glue<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.930> all<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.470> way

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
you don't have to glue this all the way

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.170 
you don't have to glue this all the way
in<00:03:10.770> because<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.580> would<00:03:11.700> have<00:03:11.760> been<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:11.910> lot<00:03:12.150> more

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
in because it would have been a lot more

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.720 
in because it would have been a lot more
difficult<00:03:12.360> so<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.470> did<00:03:13.620> was<00:03:13.890> fit<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
difficult so all I did was fit it in and

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.540 
difficult so all I did was fit it in and
then<00:03:15.360> apply<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:16.080> little<00:03:16.410> bit<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.590> glue<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.310> to

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
then apply a little bit of glue just to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.840 
then apply a little bit of glue just to
the<00:03:17.700> very<00:03:18.060> tip<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:18.780> pad<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.590> then<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.610> use

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
the very tip of the pad and then I use

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.990 
the very tip of the pad and then I use
the<00:03:21.030> scissors<00:03:21.270> to<00:03:21.420> push<00:03:22.110> it<00:03:22.260> down<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:23.760> way<00:03:23.910> it

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
the scissors to push it down that way it

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.550 
the scissors to push it down that way it
stays<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.420> place<00:03:24.630> when<00:03:24.870> you're<00:03:24.989> walking<00:03:25.380> if

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
stays in place when you're walking if

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.250 
stays in place when you're walking if
you<00:03:26.550> have<00:03:26.760> chunky<00:03:27.239> heels<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:28.050> has<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
you have chunky heels that has a

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.040 
you have chunky heels that has a
slippery<00:03:28.860> bottom<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.269> do<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.690> exact

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
slippery bottom you can do the exact

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.500 
slippery bottom you can do the exact
same<00:03:31.080> thing<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:32.010> cut<00:03:32.190> some<00:03:32.400> pads<00:03:32.670> that

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
same thing just cut some pads that

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.380 
same thing just cut some pads that
matches<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.140> bottom<00:03:35.300> like<00:03:36.300> these<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:37.340> then

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
matches the bottom like these and then
