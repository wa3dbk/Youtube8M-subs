this<00:00:57.440> series<00:00:57.680> we're<00:00:58.219> running<00:00:58.550> on<00:00:58.699> one<00:00:59.000> hundred

00:00:59.259 --> 00:00:59.269 
this series we're running on one hundred

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.630 
this series we're running on one hundred
percent<00:00:59.300> used<00:00:59.960> cooking<00:01:00.230> oil<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.920> it's

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
percent used cooking oil and it's

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.099 
percent used cooking oil and it's
basically<00:01:01.789> waste<00:01:02.089> frying<00:01:02.480> oil<00:01:02.780> that's<00:01:02.989> been

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
basically waste frying oil that's been

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.049 
basically waste frying oil that's been
filtered<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.829> remove<00:01:03.860> water<00:01:04.850> and

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
filtered to remove water and

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.149 
filtered to remove water and
particulates<00:01:05.600> we<00:01:05.990> have<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.140> retrofit<00:01:06.710> system

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
particulates we have a retrofit system

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.570 
particulates we have a retrofit system
on<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.399> car<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.299> allows<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.259> to<00:01:09.440> run<00:01:10.130> on<00:01:10.280> dual

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
on the car that allows it to run on dual

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.730 
on the car that allows it to run on dual
fuel<00:01:10.880> either<00:01:11.270> diesel<00:01:11.690> fuel<00:01:11.869> or<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.350> vegetable

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
fuel either diesel fuel or the vegetable

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.460 
fuel either diesel fuel or the vegetable
oil<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.039> racing<00:01:13.820> on<00:01:13.970> on<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:14.810> crude<00:01:14.990> vegetable

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
oil and racing on on the crude vegetable

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.230 
oil and racing on on the crude vegetable
today<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.159> when<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.340> start<00:01:16.549> up<00:01:16.759> you<00:01:16.909> start<00:01:17.090> up

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
today so when you start up you start up

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.480 
today so when you start up you start up
on<00:01:17.330> diesel<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.899> switch<00:01:18.080> over<00:01:18.350> yeah<00:01:19.310> it's

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
on diesel and switch over yeah it's

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.520 
on diesel and switch over yeah it's
basically<00:01:19.819> a<00:01:19.909> heated<00:01:20.270> fuel<00:01:20.479> system<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.470> you

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
basically a heated fuel system so you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.469 
basically a heated fuel system so you
start<00:01:22.069> up<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.250> engine<00:01:22.280> on<00:01:22.580> diesel<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:23.090> warm<00:01:23.330> it

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
start up the engine on diesel to warm it

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.200 
start up the engine on diesel to warm it
up<00:01:23.979> when<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.069> coolant<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.729> engine<00:01:26.000> warms

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
up when the coolant and the engine warms

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.180 
up when the coolant and the engine warms
up<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.539> circulates<00:01:27.020> through<00:01:27.259> heat<00:01:27.649> exchangers

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
up it circulates through heat exchangers

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.850 
up it circulates through heat exchangers
that<00:01:28.550> melt<00:01:29.030> down<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.300> oil<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:30.560> make<00:01:30.649> it<00:01:30.800> a

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
that melt down the oil to make it a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.919 
that melt down the oil to make it a
similar<00:01:31.190> consistency<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:31.909> diesel<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.539> then

00:01:32.919 --> 00:01:32.929 
similar consistency to diesel and then

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.600 
similar consistency to diesel and then
it<00:01:33.080> switches<00:01:33.289> over<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:33.679> it<00:01:33.740> runs<00:01:33.920> right<00:01:34.429> on

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
it switches over and it runs right on

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:49.280 
it switches over and it runs right on
the<00:01:34.759> heated<00:01:35.270> vegetable

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.560 

the<00:01:50.010> oil<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> car<00:01:50.700> came<00:01:51.090> from<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.360> fryer

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the oil on the car came from the fryer

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.650 
the oil on the car came from the fryer
someplace<00:01:52.130> we<00:01:53.130> actually<00:01:53.310> have<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> company<00:01:54.090> in

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
someplace we actually have a company in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.620 
someplace we actually have a company in
Pennsylvania<00:01:55.580> called<00:01:56.580> smarter<00:01:57.030> fuel<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.480> we

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
Pennsylvania called smarter fuel that we

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.110 
Pennsylvania called smarter fuel that we
buy<00:01:58.050> our<00:01:58.080> fuel<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.400> bulk<00:01:59.730> and<00:01:59.970> they

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
buy our fuel from in bulk and they

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.600 
buy our fuel from in bulk and they
collected<00:02:00.630> from<00:02:01.370> thousands<00:02:02.370> of<00:02:02.400> restaurants

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:25.360 
two fuels so there's no noticeable power
difference<00:04:22.430> between<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.389> two<00:04:23.509> fuels<00:04:24.370> and

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
difference between the two fuels and

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.939 
difference between the two fuels and
generally<00:04:26.300> once<00:04:26.509> we<00:04:26.599> get<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.810> warmed<00:04:27.020> up<00:04:27.169> we

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
generally once we get it warmed up we

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.439 
generally once we get it warmed up we
switch<00:04:28.159> it<00:04:28.280> right<00:04:28.400> over<00:04:28.550> to<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.880> vegetable

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
switch it right over to the vegetable

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.140 
switch it right over to the vegetable
oil<00:04:29.630> and<00:04:29.840> and<00:04:30.199> run<00:04:30.979> that<00:04:31.190> for<00:04:31.370> all<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.520> actual

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
oil and and run that for all the actual

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:41.580 
oil and and run that for all the actual
racing

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.939 

so<00:04:42.590> this<00:04:42.830> is<00:04:42.860> where<00:04:44.320> since<00:04:45.320> this<00:04:45.410> is<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.560> racing

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
so this is where since this is a racing

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.770 
so this is where since this is a racing
vehicle<00:04:46.400> we're<00:04:46.820> required<00:04:47.150> to<00:04:47.210> have<00:04:47.419> all<00:04:47.750> of

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
vehicle we're required to have all of

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.820 
vehicle we're required to have all of
our<00:04:48.340> fueling<00:04:49.340> equipment<00:04:49.789> in<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.810> fire<00:04:51.050> proof

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
our fueling equipment in this fire proof

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.939 
our fueling equipment in this fire proof
box<00:04:52.100> back<00:04:52.430> here<00:04:52.880> which<00:04:53.720> is<00:04:53.900> pretty<00:04:54.320> dirty<00:04:54.620> from

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
box back here which is pretty dirty from

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.810 
box back here which is pretty dirty from
our<00:04:55.130> rallying<00:04:56.770> but<00:04:57.770> you<00:04:57.889> can<00:04:57.979> see<00:04:58.490> here<00:04:58.699> is

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
our rallying but you can see here is

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.540 
our rallying but you can see here is
this<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.300> dual<00:05:00.169> fuel<00:05:00.470> system<00:05:00.949> so<00:05:01.100> we<00:05:01.250> have<00:05:01.430> on

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
this the dual fuel system so we have on

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.540 
this the dual fuel system so we have on
this<00:05:01.699> side<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:03.050> diesel<00:05:03.259> fuel<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.919> on<00:05:04.400> this

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
this side the diesel fuel and on this

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.730 
this side the diesel fuel and on this
side<00:05:04.759> the<00:05:05.240> vegetable<00:05:05.720> oil<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.229> then<00:05:06.470> we<00:05:06.590> have

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
side the vegetable oil and then we have

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.010 
side the vegetable oil and then we have
two<00:05:06.949> different<00:05:07.130> fuel<00:05:07.460> filters<00:05:07.910> one<00:05:08.180> for<00:05:08.930> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
two different fuel filters one for the

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.860 
two different fuel filters one for the
standard<00:05:09.320> conventional<00:05:10.039> diesel<00:05:10.220> fuel<00:05:10.610> and<00:05:10.880> i

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
standard conventional diesel fuel and i

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.960 
standard conventional diesel fuel and i
heated<00:05:12.110> one<00:05:12.349> down<00:05:12.560> there<00:05:12.860> the<00:05:13.490> t2<00:05:13.789> by<00:05:13.910> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
heated one down there the t2 by the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.510 
heated one down there the t2 by the
engine<00:05:14.479> core<00:05:14.720> to<00:05:15.080> the<00:05:15.110> vegetable<00:05:15.620> oil<00:05:15.710> don't

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
engine core to the vegetable oil don't

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.810 
engine core to the vegetable oil don't
need<00:05:16.639> that<00:05:16.789> today<00:05:16.970> though<00:05:17.680> well<00:05:18.680> we<00:05:19.520> need<00:05:19.699> to

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
need that today though well we need to

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.180 
need that today though well we need to
get<00:05:19.940> the<00:05:20.150> oil<00:05:20.389> well<00:05:20.900> up<00:05:21.080> over<00:05:21.289> 100<00:05:21.590> degrees<00:05:21.889> to

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
get the oil well up over 100 degrees to

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.279 
get the oil well up over 100 degrees to
really<00:05:22.550> get<00:05:22.699> the<00:05:22.940> viscosity<00:05:23.810> where<00:05:23.930> we<00:05:24.080> want

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
really get the viscosity where we want

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.100 
really get the viscosity where we want
it<00:05:24.440> but<00:05:24.979> certainly<00:05:25.340> with<00:05:25.580> the<00:05:26.150> heat<00:05:26.900> coming

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
it but certainly with the heat coming

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.200 
it but certainly with the heat coming
off<00:05:27.259> the<00:05:27.470> pavement<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:28.039> helps<00:05:28.520> warm<00:05:28.699> things<00:05:28.940> up

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
off the pavement it helps warm things up

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.180 
off the pavement it helps warm things up
so<00:05:29.930> this<00:05:30.080> is<00:05:30.110> where<00:05:30.320> the<00:05:30.410> vegetable<00:05:30.830> oil<00:05:30.919> goes

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
so this is where the vegetable oil goes

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:36.670 
so this is where the vegetable oil goes
in<00:05:32.380> and<00:05:34.960> you<00:05:35.960> know<00:05:36.050> we<00:05:36.199> filled<00:05:36.440> up<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.590> tank

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
in and you know we filled up the tank

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.330 
in and you know we filled up the tank
yesterday<00:05:37.160> and<00:05:38.919> even<00:05:39.919> though<00:05:39.979> we're<00:05:40.130> going

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
yesterday and even though we're going

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.620 
yesterday and even though we're going
really<00:05:40.490> fast<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:40.970> burning<00:05:41.240> through<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.419> lot<00:05:41.599> of

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
really fast and burning through a lot of

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.200 
really fast and burning through a lot of
fuel<00:05:41.930> /<00:05:42.199> /<00:05:43.099> miles<00:05:43.340> we're<00:05:43.639> not<00:05:43.760> running<00:05:43.940> a<00:05:44.090> lot

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
fuel / / miles we're not running a lot

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:53.040 
fuel / / miles we're not running a lot
of<00:05:44.300> miles<00:05:44.510> so<00:05:44.900> fuels<00:05:45.770> holding<00:05:46.400> up<00:05:46.490> pretty<00:05:46.610> well

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:06.959 

you

00:06:06.959 --> 00:06:06.969 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:09.029 

you
