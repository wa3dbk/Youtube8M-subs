this case a belt clip and the case
itself<00:00:32.920> let's<00:00:33.920> look<00:00:34.129> at<00:00:34.249> the<00:00:34.339> case<00:00:34.579> first<00:00:34.999> the

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
itself let's look at the case first the

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.169 
itself let's look at the case first the
case<00:00:35.809> does<00:00:36.199> have<00:00:36.469> a<00:00:36.499> clear<00:00:37.190> plastic<00:00:37.550> front

is<00:00:43.249> not<00:00:43.399> a<00:00:43.460> touchscreen<00:00:44.149> but<00:00:44.359> it's<00:00:44.690> still

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
is not a touchscreen but it's still

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.020 
is not a touchscreen but it's still
gonna<00:00:45.109> get<00:00:45.289> scuffed<00:00:45.649> up<00:00:45.979> when<00:00:46.429> you<00:00:46.550> have<00:00:46.760> it<00:00:46.909> on

your belt and you're rubbing up against

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.489 
your belt and you're rubbing up against
trees<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.489> other<00:00:49.729> things<00:00:50.170> we<00:00:51.170> have<00:00:51.469> a

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
trees and other things we have a

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.979 
trees and other things we have a
joystick<00:00:52.370> hole<00:00:52.670> right<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:53.179> so<00:00:53.539> you<00:00:53.839> could

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
joystick hole right here so you could

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.049 
joystick hole right here so you could
still<00:00:54.289> use<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.859> joystick<00:00:55.129> found<00:00:55.699> above<00:00:56.030> the

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
still use the joystick found above the

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.139 
still use the joystick found above the
screen<00:00:56.859> when<00:00:57.859> we<00:00:58.010> look<00:00:58.219> at<00:00:58.339> the<00:00:58.489> bottom<00:00:58.909> of<00:00:59.030> the

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
screen when we look at the bottom of the

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.110 
screen when we look at the bottom of the
case<00:00:59.449> there's<00:01:00.019> a<00:01:00.530> lanyard<00:01:01.309> hole<00:01:01.519> right<00:01:02.059> here

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
case there's a lanyard hole right here

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.500 
case there's a lanyard hole right here
right<00:01:02.690> below<00:01:03.019> where<00:01:03.260> it<00:01:03.289> says<00:01:03.379> Garmin<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.510> on

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
right below where it says Garmin and on

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.950 
right below where it says Garmin and on
the<00:01:05.750> back<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:07.219> actually<00:01:07.520> open<00:01:08.119> we<00:01:08.840> could

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
the back it's actually open we could

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.389 
the back it's actually open we could
stick<00:01:09.170> our<00:01:09.320> finger<00:01:09.619> right<00:01:09.829> in<00:01:10.039> there<00:01:10.250> and

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
stick our finger right in there and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:11.950 
stick our finger right in there and
that's<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:10.759> we<00:01:10.880> could<00:01:11.060> use<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.600> Garmin

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
that's so we could use the Garmin

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.380 
that's so we could use the Garmin
backbone<00:01:12.469> mount<00:01:12.799> such<00:01:13.189> as<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.670> belt<00:01:14.060> clip

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
backbone mount such as the belt clip

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.760 
backbone mount such as the belt clip
that<00:01:14.810> comes<00:01:15.079> with<00:01:15.500> it<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:19.340> top<00:01:19.640> opens<00:01:20.060> up<00:01:20.770> with

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
that comes with it the top opens up with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.010 
that comes with it the top opens up with
some<00:01:22.009> velcro<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:22.789> the<00:01:22.969> unit<00:01:23.270> simply<00:01:23.539> slides

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
some velcro and the unit simply slides

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.660 
some velcro and the unit simply slides
in<00:01:24.380> bottom<00:01:25.250> first<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.680> then<00:01:27.680> closes<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.460> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
in bottom first and then closes at the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.709 
in bottom first and then closes at the
top<00:01:29.229> with<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.259> velcro<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:31.210> may<00:01:32.210> need<00:01:32.420> to

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
top with the velcro you may need to

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.529 
top with the velcro you may need to
wiggle<00:01:32.929> the<00:01:33.140> case<00:01:33.350> around<00:01:33.829> to<00:01:34.640> line<00:01:34.880> up<00:01:35.119> the<00:01:35.329> to

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
wiggle the case around to line up the to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.480 
wiggle the case around to line up the to
screen<00:01:35.899> so<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.259> could<00:01:36.439> see<00:01:36.770> everything<00:01:37.189> on

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
screen so you could see everything on

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.440 
screen so you could see everything on
the<00:01:37.670> e-track<00:01:38.030> screen<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.990> belt<00:01:42.229> clip<00:01:42.859> is

the e-track screen and the belt clip is

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.380 
the e-track screen and the belt clip is
kind<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.479> like<00:01:44.630> an<00:01:44.749> alligator's<00:01:45.439> mouth<00:01:46.390> it

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
kind of like an alligator's mouth it

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.389 
kind of like an alligator's mouth it
opens<00:01:47.719> up<00:01:47.840> like<00:01:47.869> that<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.350> got<00:01:48.499> this<00:01:48.829> tooth

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
opens up like that it's got this tooth

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.450 
opens up like that it's got this tooth
right<00:01:49.759> here<00:01:49.789> or<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.359> tab<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.380> what<00:01:52.219> that's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
right here or this tab and what that's

and<00:01:58.759> can't<00:01:59.539> come<00:01:59.780> off<00:01:59.840> so<00:02:00.439> if<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.710> rub<00:02:00.920> up

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
and can't come off so if you rub up

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.319 
and can't come off so if you rub up
against<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.460> tree<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:01.700> don't<00:02:01.759> have<00:02:01.999> to<00:02:02.119> worry

about losing your unit and it goes on to
the<00:02:05.869> backbone<00:02:06.710> which<00:02:07.039> is<00:02:07.189> exposed<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:08.090> the

the backbone which is exposed in the
back<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.660> case<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.649> will<00:02:09.860> make<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> snapping
