and Hathor here and we were put we're
not<00:00:07.680> messing<00:00:07.830> around<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.370> cars<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.639> little

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
not messing around with cars a little

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.430 
not messing around with cars a little
bit<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.330> are<00:00:09.360> attempting<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.870> make<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
bit and we are attempting to make I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.200 
bit and we are attempting to make I
guess<00:00:11.040> I<00:00:11.250> would<00:00:11.490> say<00:00:11.750> Formula<00:00:12.750> One<00:00:12.929> style<00:00:13.170> cars

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.210 
guess I would say Formula One style cars

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.880 
guess I would say Formula One style cars
front<00:00:15.210> wheel<00:00:15.330> steering<00:00:15.859> rear-wheel<00:00:16.859> drive

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
front wheel steering rear-wheel drive
just<00:00:17.369> like<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.580> Formula<00:00:17.970> One<00:00:18.029> car<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.660> don't

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
just like a Formula One car they don't

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.050 
just like a Formula One car they don't
have<00:00:19.020> nearly<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.859> much<00:00:20.070> horsepower<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:21.029> I

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
have nearly as much horsepower so I

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.609 
have nearly as much horsepower so I
guess<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.359> could<00:00:21.600> kind<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.020> call<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> Formula

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
guess you could kind of call it Formula

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.900 
guess you could kind of call it Formula
Formula<00:00:23.519> three<00:00:24.830> they<00:00:25.830> have<00:00:26.070> enough<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> read

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
Formula three they have enough to read

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.050 
Formula three they have enough to read
yeah<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.439> Formula<00:00:28.980> three<00:00:29.220> two<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.849> one

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
yeah but it's Formula three two and one

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569 
yeah but it's Formula three two and one
is<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:31.380> higher<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.560> number<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> slower<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is the higher the number the slower the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
is the higher the number the slower the
cars<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:34.520> anyway<00:00:35.550> there's<00:00:35.850> also<00:00:36.000> Formula<00:00:36.570> Ford

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
cars go anyway there's also Formula Ford

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.479 
cars go anyway there's also Formula Ford
believe<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.800> or<00:00:37.920> not<00:00:39.469> anyway<00:00:40.469> guess<00:00:41.100> what<00:00:41.250> cars

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
believe it or not anyway guess what cars

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.889 
believe it or not anyway guess what cars
raced<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.059> know<00:00:43.129> they<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.510> fins<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
raced there know they have fins on the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.040 
raced there know they have fins on the
front<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.770> yeah<00:00:47.219> yeah<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.510> reason<00:00:48.809> why<00:00:48.899> they

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
front that yeah yeah the reason why they

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.810 
front that yeah yeah the reason why they
call<00:00:49.200> us<00:00:49.230> we<00:00:49.440> call<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> Formula<00:00:50.039> One's<00:00:50.250> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
call us we call the Formula One's is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.189 
call us we call the Formula One's is
because<00:00:51.149> Formula<00:00:51.449> One's<00:00:51.570> rely<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.870> mass

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
because Formula One's rely on mass

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
because Formula One's rely on mass
amounts<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.649> downforce<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.460> like<00:00:54.000> air<00:00:54.180> foils

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
amounts of downforce like like air foils

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.939 
amounts of downforce like like air foils
and<00:00:54.660> stuff<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> keep<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.590> ground<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and stuff to keep them on the ground and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.160 
and stuff to keep them on the ground and
give<00:00:56.129> them<00:00:56.250> traction<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.629> emulated

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
give them traction which we emulated

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.750 
give them traction which we emulated
with<00:00:58.320> our<00:00:58.440> big<00:00:58.739> fins<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.699> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
with our big fins that you see on the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.130 
with our big fins that you see on the
frontal<00:01:00.090> poles<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.329> got<00:01:00.480> wear<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.840> front

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
frontal poles we got wear on the front

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.860 
frontal poles we got wear on the front
to<00:01:01.500> keep<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.890> front<00:01:02.460> tires<00:01:02.670> turning<00:01:03.210> like

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to keep the front tires turning like

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.530 
to keep the front tires turning like
ability<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> turn<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.360> on

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
ability to turn and then we got one on

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.230 
ability to turn and then we got one on
the<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.770> we<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.010> power<00:01:08.580> traction

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
the back so that we have power traction

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.539 
the back so that we have power traction
then<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.020> got<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.290> two<00:01:10.560> up<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:10.950> down<00:01:11.130> fins

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
then we got these two up and down fins

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.940 
then we got these two up and down fins
on<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> back<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.380> stopped<00:01:13.710> our

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
on the back that actually stopped our

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.999 
on the back that actually stopped our
back<00:01:14.220> from<00:01:14.549> skidding<00:01:14.970> out<00:01:15.299> it'll<00:01:15.930> it'll<00:01:16.530> keep

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
back from skidding out it'll it'll keep

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.820 
back from skidding out it'll it'll keep
the<00:01:17.250> back<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.119> straight<00:01:18.180> line

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
the back going in a straight line

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.899 
the back going in a straight line
extremely<00:01:19.830> useful<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.340> rear-wheel<00:01:20.880> drive

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
extremely useful for rear-wheel drive

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
extremely useful for rear-wheel drive
cars<00:01:21.450> it's<00:01:21.869> really<00:01:22.140> hard<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> get<00:01:22.619> rear-wheel

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
cars it's really hard to get rear-wheel

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.450

suspension<00:01:49.590> how<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.700> works<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.329> is<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
suspension how this works is there is a

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.319 
suspension how this works is there is a
rope<00:01:52.110> coming<00:01:53.070> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.670> center<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> tire

over to toe edge of this triangle and
then<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.829> an<00:01:58.979> axis<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:01.259> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
then there is an axis here and then this

then there is an axis here and then this
prop<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.950> welded<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.909> body<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.750> you<00:02:04.649> can

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
prop is welded to the body and you can

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
prop is welded to the body and you can
you<00:02:05.189> can<00:02:05.340> see<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.840> won't<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.079> able<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.229> see

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
you can see the you won't be able to see

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.809 
you can see the you won't be able to see
it<00:02:07.469> when<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:07.680> driving<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.550> see<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it when I'm driving but you can see the

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.949 
it when I'm driving but you can see the
action<00:02:09.209> from<00:02:09.450> top<00:02:10.220> say<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> pivoting<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.810> I

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
action from top say it pivoting I can I

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.610 
action from top say it pivoting I can I
can

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559 
can
break<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> action<00:02:14.099> if<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.549> push<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.180> down<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.360> lot

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
break the action if I push it down a lot

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.420 
break the action if I push it down a lot
you<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.260> see<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.530> pivoting<00:02:16.920> having<00:02:17.310> it

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you can see that pivoting having it

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460 
you can see that pivoting having it
happening<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:18.510> that's<00:02:18.629> my<00:02:18.780> suspension

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
happening there and that's my suspension

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.430 
happening there and that's my suspension
it's<00:02:19.920> very<00:02:20.159> stiff<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.690> was<00:02:21.840> looking<00:02:22.170> for

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
it's very stiff what I was looking for

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.070 
it's very stiff what I was looking for
yes<00:02:23.159> tiffith<00:02:23.580> my<00:02:23.849> suspension<00:02:24.599> is<00:02:24.780> also

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
yes tiffith my suspension is also

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.720 
yes tiffith my suspension is also
extremely<00:02:25.440> stiffer<00:02:25.860> hydraulics<00:02:26.370> bench<00:02:26.489> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
extremely stiffer hydraulics bench and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.979 
extremely stiffer hydraulics bench and
you'll<00:02:26.879> notice<00:02:27.090> there's<00:02:27.239> two<00:02:27.299> hydraulics<00:02:27.870> in

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
you'll notice there's two hydraulics in

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.440 
you'll notice there's two hydraulics in
a<00:02:28.049> triangle<00:02:28.950> formation<00:02:29.069> with<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.360> high

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
a triangle formation with really high

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.210 
a triangle formation with really high
constant<00:02:30.989> giving<00:02:31.260> them<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.409> very<00:02:31.799> very<00:02:31.920> high

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
constant giving them a very very high

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.770 
constant giving them a very very high
stiffness<00:02:33.019> all<00:02:34.019> right<00:02:35.209> not<00:02:36.209> much<00:02:36.239> to<00:02:36.540> tell

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
stiffness all right not much to tell

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.600 
stiffness all right not much to tell
about<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.230> got<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:37.590> turn<00:02:37.799> prop<00:02:38.069> here<00:02:38.340> we're

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
about this got my turn prop here we're

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.649 
about this got my turn prop here we're
actually<00:02:38.760> using<00:02:39.060> fuel<00:02:39.799> I<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.370> speed<00:02:42.360> and

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
actually using fuel I have a speed and

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.110 
actually using fuel I have a speed and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
left is my fav indicator I have nothing

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.050 
left is my fav indicator I have nothing
as<00:02:49.400> fancy<00:02:49.580> as<00:02:49.850> Tony<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:50.840> have<00:02:50.959> speed

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.820 

we're<00:02:55.720> gonna<00:02:55.840> take<00:02:56.080> these<00:02:56.170> out<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.440> this<00:02:56.530> track

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
we're gonna take these out to this track

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.890 
we're gonna take these out to this track
here<00:02:57.220> this<00:02:57.760> track<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.090> basically<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.630> entire

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
here this track is basically the entire

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.510 
here this track is basically the entire
reason<00:02:59.050> we<00:02:59.230> built<00:02:59.410> these<00:02:59.500> cars<00:02:59.709> we<00:03:00.069> we<00:03:00.400> were

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
reason we built these cars we we were

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.270 
reason we built these cars we we were
building<00:03:00.880> his<00:03:01.209> lead<00:03:02.110> suspension<00:03:02.620> thing<00:03:02.830> my

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
building his lead suspension thing my

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250 
building his lead suspension thing my
tricycle<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.209> we<00:03:04.810> were<00:03:04.870> looking<00:03:04.959> at<00:03:05.170> this

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
tricycle and we were looking at this

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.600 
tricycle and we were looking at this
track<00:03:05.500> going<00:03:05.680> man<00:03:06.010> I<00:03:06.040> wish<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:06.340> had<00:03:06.430> something

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
track going man I wish we had something

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.250 
track going man I wish we had something
that<00:03:06.700> didn't<00:03:07.030> completely<00:03:07.300> destroy<00:03:07.450> itself<00:03:08.050> we

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
that didn't completely destroy itself we

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.840 
that didn't completely destroy itself we
were<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.560> these<00:03:08.709> corners<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.520> right<00:03:09.670> side

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
were on these corners on the right side

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.830 
were on these corners on the right side
of<00:03:09.970> me<00:03:10.060> yeah<00:03:14.940> like<00:03:15.940> it's<00:03:16.090> easier<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.480> me<00:03:16.660> to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
of me yeah like it's easier for me to

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:30.740 
of me yeah like it's easier for me to
line<00:03:17.080> up<00:03:17.230> with<00:03:17.380> you

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.370 

all<00:03:31.290> right<00:03:31.590> so<00:03:32.010> we're<00:03:32.610> doing<00:03:32.700> this<00:03:32.880> race<00:03:33.380> this

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
all right so we're doing this race this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.510 
all right so we're doing this race this
is<00:03:34.440> kind<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> entire<00:03:35.010> purpose<00:03:35.220> we<00:03:35.370> build

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
is kind of the entire purpose we build

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.580 
is kind of the entire purpose we build
these<00:03:35.580> cars<00:03:35.820> for<00:03:36.000> is<00:03:36.210> this<00:03:36.330> track<00:03:36.630> I<00:03:36.930> said<00:03:37.500> that

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
these cars for is this track I said that

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.990 
these cars for is this track I said that
already<00:03:37.710> but

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
already but

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.790 
already but
we<00:03:39.540> were<00:03:39.900> like<00:03:40.080> let's<00:03:40.320> make<00:03:40.440> cars<00:03:40.710> that

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
we were like let's make cars that

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.170 
we were like let's make cars that
actually<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.310> take<00:03:41.400> these<00:03:41.550> turns<00:03:41.820> without

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
actually can take these turns without

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.410 
actually can take these turns without
burning<00:03:43.170> out<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.410> running<00:03:43.710> into<00:03:43.800> the<00:03:43.980> wall

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
burning out of running into the wall

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.850 
burning out of running into the wall
so<00:03:45.750> these<00:03:45.870> two<00:03:46.050> cars<00:03:46.260> are<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.440> results<00:03:46.800> that

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
so these two cars are the results that

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.280 
so these two cars are the results that
might<00:03:47.790> still<00:03:48.090> almost<00:03:48.300> brighter<00:03:48.870> rim<00:03:49.020> to<00:03:49.170> the

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
might still almost brighter rim to the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.360 
might still almost brighter rim to the
wall

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
wall

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.000 
wall
but<00:03:51.030> you'll<00:03:51.720> see<00:03:51.900> from<00:03:52.049> this<00:03:52.319> race<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.560> my

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
but you'll see from this race that my

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.130 
but you'll see from this race that my
car<00:03:53.340> can<00:03:53.610> actually<00:03:53.670> take<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.090> corner<00:03:54.510> that<00:03:54.989> much

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
car can actually take a corner that much

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.830 
car can actually take a corner that much
higher<00:03:55.379> speed<00:03:55.709> Tony's<00:03:56.129> car<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.840> whereas

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
higher speed Tony's car can whereas

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.650 
higher speed Tony's car can whereas
Tony's<00:03:58.170> car<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.709> hardtop

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.480 

and<00:04:01.780> it's<00:04:01.990> a<00:04:02.110> lot<00:04:02.260> more<00:04:02.410> stable<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:02.950> strain<00:04:03.310> on

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
and it's a lot more stable and strain on

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.940 
and it's a lot more stable and strain on
these<00:04:03.720> these<00:04:04.720> things<00:04:04.990> like<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.530> kind<00:04:05.800> of<00:04:05.830> have

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
these these things like I kind of have

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.470 
these these things like I kind of have
to<00:04:05.980> compensate
