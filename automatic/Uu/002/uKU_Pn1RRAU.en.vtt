feeling<00:03:49.500> like<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.799> know<00:03:49.980> that<00:03:50.220> you<00:03:50.519> have<00:03:50.760> a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
feeling like to know that you have a

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.300 
feeling like to know that you have a
greater<00:03:51.390> chance<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.870> dying<00:03:52.140> at<00:03:52.829> that<00:03:53.069> moment

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
greater chance of dying at that moment

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.179 
greater chance of dying at that moment
than<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.879> probably<00:03:54.000> ever<00:03:54.209> have<00:03:54.980> not<00:03:55.980> really

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
than you probably ever have not really

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:57.619 
than you probably ever have not really
everything<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.609> calculated<00:03:57.120> risk<00:03:57.150> I<00:03:57.480> mean

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
everything is a calculated risk I mean

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.809 
everything is a calculated risk I mean
you<00:03:58.170> know<00:03:58.260> every<00:03:58.709> time<00:03:58.890> you<00:03:59.069> walk<00:03:59.519> across<00:03:59.609> the

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
you know every time you walk across the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.309 
you know every time you walk across the
street<00:03:59.970> that's<00:04:00.239> I<00:04:00.480> mean<00:04:00.599> obviously<00:04:01.170> there's

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
street that's I mean obviously there's

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.960 
street that's I mean obviously there's
there<00:04:01.739> some<00:04:01.890> risks<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.189> are<00:04:02.250> bigger<00:04:02.879> than

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
there some risks that are bigger than

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.460 
there some risks that are bigger than
others<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.299> that's<00:04:03.930> not<00:04:04.019> something<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.319> want

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
others and that's not something I want

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.009 
others and that's not something I want
