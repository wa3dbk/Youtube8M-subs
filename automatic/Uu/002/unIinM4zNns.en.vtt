00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.180
 Hi, I'm Angela from the Mitsubishi . 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.640
 to show how a very 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.730
 curious in crochet the high point of 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.800
 relief ahead as you see has a 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.630
 very bombastic name but the only thing that 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.390
 you have to remember from this point is that 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.100
 brings relief to your projects this 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.590
 what you see below is the symbol 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.390
 with what is usually represented and so 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.570
 how I'm going to show you now is how 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.260
 knit to show you how this 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:45.080
 I knitted sixteen chains and 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.930
 thirteen high points having this base already 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.839
 we can start knitting this point I'm going to 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.659
 weave this second round with one of 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:57.080
 another color so you can see how 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.940
 is the point well we weave 3 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:05.430
 chains at the beginning of the lap 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.430
 and let's make a normal high point 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.540
 then let's make the point of 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.120
 relief in front we throw a thread 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.100
 this point of the previous round what 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.250
 we surround from left to right by 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.120
 We put a thread behind it and take it out 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.960
 continuation 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.360
 we take another thread and we take out fingers 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.540
 in 2 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.030
 we make another high point I will go 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.930
 alternating the two points so that you see 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.930
 how are they? 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.140
 and we knit a high point again 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:52.070
 relief ahead we have a strand 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:57.690
 we passed the needle behind the point 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.150
 we take a strand and we take out two in 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.910
 two 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.580
 this high point is called highlighted by 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.590
 ahead because just the relief that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.149
 makes it stay ahead of the work is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.939
 say on the right side 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.200
 let's continue weaving another point 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.200
 normal high 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.680
 and now 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.680
 another high point 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:29.700
 we take a thread passed the needle 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.450
 behind the point from right to left 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.710
 we take a strand 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.370
 and we take fingers 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.370
 in 2 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.980
 we follow another high point 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.850
 and another high point of relief ahead 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.940
 we take a thread we pass the needle by 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.590
 behind the point of the previous round 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.510
 we cast a thread 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.510
 and we take fingers 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.970
 and to finish 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:14.520
 we knit another high point 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.910
 and one last high point highlighted by 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.710
 behind we throw the thread we pass the needle 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.160
 behind the point of the turn 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.090
 previous we cast a thread and now 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.319
 we take two points fingers 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.930
 two 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:33.690
 and already to finish the return we weave 2 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.200
 extra high points 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.200
 one 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.050
 and we would have finished the first 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.420
 return 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.570
 here you can see how is a sample 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.450
 woven alternating high point with knit 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:58.110
 High relief ahead turns 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.480
 grays are woven with high points and 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.480
 instead the loops woven with the 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 white wool alternate high points and 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.610
 high points of relief in these two 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.620
 twists woven in high point you see that 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.570
 the design is very flat instead 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.030
 when we enter the high point of 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.410
 relief ahead is left with a 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.840
 very original texture 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.310
 we hope this video has served you 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.770
 of help if you want to continue learning 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.480
 crochet with the visual mission to visit 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.830
 our YouTube channel up to the 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.830
 next health of missionaries
