map<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.410> fact<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.940> this<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.809> massive<00:00:49.440> arch

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
map the fact that this is a massive arch

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.160 
map the fact that this is a massive arch
and<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.489> has<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> cave<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> runs<00:00:51.539> all<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.899> way

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
and it has a cave that runs all the way

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.420 
and it has a cave that runs all the way
through<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:53.390> it's<00:00:54.390> that's<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.590> cool<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.280> me

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
it's a massive archway with so many

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
it's a massive archway with so many

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
minerals put underneath it you can see

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240 
minerals put underneath it you can see
all<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> coal<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.049> stuff<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.619> also

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
swamp biome you can see by the the dirt

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.360 
swamp biome you can see by the the dirt
here<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.480> then<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.019> goes<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.170> normal<00:02:30.769> just

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
here and then it goes to normal just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.220 
here and then it goes to normal just
over<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.700> hill<00:02:31.909> and<00:02:32.060> then<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.930> goes<00:02:33.049> back

over this hill and then it goes back

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.780 
over this hill and then it goes back

down and another feature of this is
something<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:37.970> was<00:02:38.810> added<00:02:39.079> in<00:02:39.230> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
glowstone here cuz it's a little bit

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.119 
glowstone here cuz it's a little bit
more<00:03:22.519> bright<00:03:22.849> and<00:03:22.879> easy<00:03:23.510> to<00:03:23.720> place<00:03:24.129> basically

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
more bright and easy to place basically

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.309 
more bright and easy to place basically
as<00:03:26.060> you<00:03:26.239> can<00:03:26.269> see<00:03:26.599> there<00:03:26.810> are<00:03:26.930> quite<00:03:26.959> a<00:03:27.230> few

as you can see there are quite a few

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.349 
as you can see there are quite a few
minerals<00:03:27.709> I'll<00:03:28.069> try<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> find<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.879> some<00:03:28.970> of

minerals I'll try to find you some of

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.780 
minerals I'll try to find you some of
the<00:03:29.449> more<00:03:29.629> valuable<00:03:29.840> minerals<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:31.430> probably

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
the more valuable minerals you probably

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.670 
the more valuable minerals you probably
remembered<00:03:32.329> where<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.569> came<00:03:32.930> into<00:03:33.169> this<00:03:33.379> cave

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
remembered where I came into this cave

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.400 
remembered where I came into this cave
there<00:03:34.549> but<00:03:34.760> there<00:03:34.910> are<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.180> many<00:03:35.209> there's<00:03:36.199> also

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
there but there are so many there's also

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.500 
there but there are so many there's also
a<00:03:36.560> few<00:03:36.919> underground<00:03:37.579> dungeons<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.299> you<00:03:38.389> know

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
a few underground dungeons if you know

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.890 
a few underground dungeons if you know
what<00:03:38.599> I<00:03:38.690> mean<00:03:38.900> I<00:03:39.250> two<00:03:40.250> chests<00:03:40.639> each<00:03:40.790> with<00:03:41.120> a<00:03:41.150> mob

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
what I mean I two chests each with a mob

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.729 
what I mean I two chests each with a mob
spawner<00:03:42.290> perfect<00:03:42.859> for<00:03:43.040> XP<00:03:43.489> farms<00:03:44.109> I<00:03:45.109> guess<00:03:45.560> for

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
spawner perfect for XP farms I guess for

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.030 
spawner perfect for XP farms I guess for
your<00:03:45.829> survival<00:03:46.250> map<00:03:46.400> also<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.829> guess<00:03:48.829> that's

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
your survival map also I guess that's

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.349 
your survival map also I guess that's
where<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.190> came<00:03:49.280> I<00:03:50.060> I<00:03:50.780> have<00:03:51.260> not<00:03:51.470> actually<00:03:51.739> found

where I came I I have not actually found

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.369 
where I came I I have not actually found
a<00:03:53.359> diamond<00:03:54.169> house<00:03:54.530> there's<00:03:55.870> actually<00:03:56.870> you<00:03:57.169> can

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
a diamond house there's actually you can

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.050 
a diamond house there's actually you can
if<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.680> check<00:03:57.859> out<00:03:57.889> my<00:03:58.010> survival<00:03:58.579> series<00:03:58.699> you

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
any other map also yeah you could just

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.959 
any other map also yeah you could just
see<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:20.810> these<00:04:21.019> mad<00:04:21.520> caverns<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.669> stuff<00:04:22.880> in

see all these mad caverns and stuff in
the<00:04:23.060> mountain<00:04:23.360> a<00:04:23.419> lot<00:04:23.570> of<00:04:23.690> pigs<00:04:23.930> actually

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
the mountain a lot of pigs actually

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.210 
the mountain a lot of pigs actually
/<00:04:24.800> in<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.100> swamp<00:04:25.820> biomes<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.889> yeah<00:04:27.889> basically

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
/ in the swamp biomes and yeah basically

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.749 
/ in the swamp biomes and yeah basically
goes<00:04:28.699> into<00:04:28.729> a<00:04:29.210> snow<00:04:29.870> forest<00:04:30.350> biome<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.009> a

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
goes into a snow forest biome and a

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.990 
goes into a snow forest biome and a
jungle<00:04:32.180> biome<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.600> that's<00:04:32.720> about<00:04:32.870> as<00:04:33.110> I<00:04:34.000> give

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
jungle biome and that's about as I give

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.170 
jungle biome and that's about as I give
us<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.270> biomes<00:04:35.570> get<00:04:36.639> you've<00:04:37.639> got<00:04:37.820> some<00:04:38.000> water

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
us the biomes get you've got some water

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.670 
us the biomes get you've got some water
here<00:04:38.509> which<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.810> actually<00:04:38.960> really<00:04:39.229> convenient

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
here which is actually really convenient

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.469 
here which is actually really convenient
for<00:04:39.889> starting<00:04:40.370> off<00:04:40.430> you<00:04:40.580> get<00:04:40.669> squids<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.330> that

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:41.479 
for starting off you get squids so that

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:43.710 
for starting off you get squids so that
you<00:04:41.539> can<00:04:41.720> create<00:04:41.930> books<00:04:42.259> just<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:43.250> basic

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
you can create books just the basic

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.969 
you can create books just the basic
necessities<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.990> starting<00:04:45.710> off<00:04:45.830> your

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
necessities of starting off your

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.969 
necessities of starting off your
survival<00:04:46.400> map<00:04:46.520> and<00:04:47.139> then<00:04:48.139> you've<00:04:48.380> got<00:04:48.650> your

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
survival map and then you've got your

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.230 
survival map and then you've got your
desert<00:04:49.490> biome<00:04:49.850> now<00:04:50.330> there<00:04:51.169> should<00:04:51.470> be<00:04:51.680> a

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
desert biome now there should be a

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.020 
desert biome now there should be a
jungle<00:04:53.240> top<00:04:53.660> jungle<00:04:54.350> this<00:04:54.800> is<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.979> desert<00:04:55.220> there

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
jungle top jungle this is a desert there

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.600 
jungle top jungle this is a desert there
should<00:04:56.270> be<00:04:56.389> a<00:04:56.419> desert<00:04:56.810> temple<00:04:57.610> somewhere

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
should be a desert temple somewhere

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.700 
should be a desert temple somewhere
around<00:04:59.120> here<00:05:01.630> which<00:05:02.630> had<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:02.930> mini<00:05:03.199> map<00:05:03.440> on

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
around here which had that mini map on

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.499 
around here which had that mini map on
makes<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.400> lot<00:05:04.550> easier<00:05:04.880> to<00:05:04.970> find<00:05:05.120> that<00:05:05.300> I

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
makes it a lot easier to find that I

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:07.120 
makes it a lot easier to find that I
found<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.110> desert<00:05:06.440> temple<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.830> might<00:05:06.979> just

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
found the desert temple you might just

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.930 
found the desert temple you might just
have<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.280> find<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.639> by<00:05:08.330> yourself<00:05:08.750> I<00:05:09.639> know<00:05:10.639> it's

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
have to find it by yourself I know it's

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.010 
have to find it by yourself I know it's
so<00:05:11.120> unconvenient

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
so unconvenient

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.839 
so unconvenient
but<00:05:12.229> basically<00:05:13.070> yeah<00:05:13.310> there's<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.610> desert

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
but basically yeah there's a desert

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.629 
but basically yeah there's a desert
temple<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.479> this<00:05:14.720> area<00:05:15.490> somewhere<00:05:16.490> around

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:16.639 
temple in this area somewhere around

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.060 
temple in this area somewhere around
there<00:05:16.910> there<00:05:17.780> should<00:05:18.050> yeah<00:05:18.380> so<00:05:18.590> basically<00:05:18.919> it

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
there there should yeah so basically it

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.890 
there there should yeah so basically it
goes<00:05:19.190> to<00:05:19.370> snow<00:05:19.550> biome<00:05:19.759> so<00:05:20.240> this<00:05:20.389> is<00:05:20.509> basically

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
goes to snow biome so this is basically

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.260 
goes to snow biome so this is basically
just<00:05:20.990> one<00:05:21.229> massive<00:05:21.830> map<00:05:22.070> it's<00:05:22.610> a<00:05:22.729> really<00:05:23.090> good

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
just one massive map it's a really good

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.580 
just one massive map it's a really good
biome<00:05:23.539> if<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:23.810> wanted<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.169> start<00:05:24.380> in<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
biome if you wanted to start in the

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.110 
biome if you wanted to start in the
mountains<00:05:24.949> with<00:05:25.430> that<00:05:25.580> huge<00:05:25.970> archway<00:05:26.509> here

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
mountains with that huge archway here

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.350 
mountains with that huge archway here
I'll<00:05:29.120> even<00:05:30.310> kill<00:05:31.310> myself<00:05:31.669> here<00:05:31.849> to<00:05:32.060> show<00:05:32.300> you
