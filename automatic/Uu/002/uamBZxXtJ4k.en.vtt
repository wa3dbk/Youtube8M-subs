 in which 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.630
 one of the main points not because that is precisely that people

 the success of this curious web is evident 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.529
 but also economically, I do not believe that this is not something that you 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.539
 go to life as I say 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.639
 percent

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.749
 percent at the community level believes that what really impacts us 

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.270

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.279

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.539
 stretch generates more jobs and finally boost it 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.780
