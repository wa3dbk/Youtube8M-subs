00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:10.290
 presentation of the new dum dum model 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.509
 south gala is the dum dum name comes from 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.780
 name of the right mercury bullets 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.310
 to specify for someone I am 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.600
 extremely damaging therefore by way of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.000
 of the side effects of this 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.800
 model can be mentioned precisely 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.099
 to the name given along the rifle in question 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.590
 is a 65 a 65 a test will be carried out 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.380
 very special as a special one 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.860
 what has the fact that 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.989
 I will try to make perfect center 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 a distance equal to about 10 times the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.980
 nominal length of the gun which is not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 bad of course now we're going to see 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.020
 if so the test will take place 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.969
 obviously with a metric rope a 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.969
 adjust as always 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.920
 on a center drawn on a tablet 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 from swimming with thickness 3 rod from seven and 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.800
 half triple elastic from 17 and a half 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.909
 keeping in mind that anyway 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.970
 further enhance the cam 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.340
 used will be an intrepid that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.180
 despite my abuse he travels 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.740
 always like a train in an excellent way 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.500
 this rifle will have four passes of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:41.009
 sagola but I point out that this does not 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 it is nothing more than an installation almost 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.750
 maxx power because it further ad 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.910
 increase the power again but which ones 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 the features this rifle is 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.930
 beyond the fact that I will try to 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.180
 get a ballistics of this level 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.149
 ten times the nominal length is not 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.210
 bad but the speech of this shotgun 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:04.450
 which is a 65 respect and that practically 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.179
 it is extremely adaptable because why 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.500
 obviously with a setting like this not 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:12.010
 is that you go to shoot bass in the 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.459
 foam the rifle is usable even 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.920
 with a 6 25 aster it is a single-cylinder from 16 o 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.540
 less like the 17 or as double 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.900
 elastic then the password of 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.650
 this rifle and modularity therefore have 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.420
 with a short at the end for a person 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.530
 that on average fishes in the top ten 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.170
 meters 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.470
 a nice summary that will allow us 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.769
 to carry out fishing from any 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:45.370
 condition therefore short range or even 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:47.980
 in the long run I will do another test 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.780
 which is generally beyond those which 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.310
 they can be my or someone's rifles 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.440
 in other words for what I will do 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.200
 I will make two shots 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.930
 the first ok straight on the target not 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.900
 as soon as it enters the water for the second 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.090
 shotgun or the gun on the bottom 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.109
 load and I will let you rest load for 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.540
 an hour 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:10.780
 obviously together with my collaborators 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.700
 present here as today and after that time 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.049
 perform another shot to see 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.450
 how much the tires lose 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.299
 this is a general rule 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.850
 so you too can get an idea not 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:25.769
 I know that it is a self-construction 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:29.049
 which can always be good then 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:32.950
 I remember that this drawing is registered 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:36.220
 therefore for the marauders we can 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.579
 now enter the water and see what 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.579
 It happens 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.900
 the test seems to me quite well 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:53.110
 succeeded above all with a first 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.500
 shot such a center at that 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.120
 distance with the rod that points to it 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.380
 stops at height and floats 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.930
 number 7 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:06.280
 let's say it's a good shot for how long 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.960
 regards the second shot I can 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.690
 ensure that I pulled the same 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.910
 so the fact that you went 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.670
 a thread q below is therefore all in 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.180
 effects a bit of power has been lost 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.830
 after an hour of tire retirement 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.190
 then used a thread under and on 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.190
 right 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:28.270
 however the target was pierced 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.880
 let's say the same way then how 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.460
 practically identical penetration 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:37.690
 always the same distance of 6 meters e 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.290
 half and then to make a nice summary 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:45.490
 let's say the project as far as i am 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.680
 regards has succeeded in the sense that the 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:49.810
 power is nothing without control because 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.700
 giving power is easy to manage 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.320
 direct it right there to that 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.220
 distance I say no more 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.050
 I can only say that for example 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.120
 surely I do not fish for it 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.919
 use in this configuration but here 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.810
 I just had to show that power is 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:05.890
 nothing without control 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.970
 but as far as I'm concerned, for example 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:11.860
 use with astra 7 is exclusively 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.740
 this rubber and the rubber on the pulley 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:17.919
 this for example I do not use this is 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:20.889
 then a 20 meter configuration 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.759
 thank you for seeing 

00:07:20.889 --> 00:07:27.150
 this test why not let us a 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:27.150
 little thought
