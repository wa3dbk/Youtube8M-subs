you<00:00:23.109> might<00:00:23.259> be<00:00:23.380> fooled<00:00:23.619> into<00:00:23.769> thinking<00:00:23.859> they

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
you might be fooled into thinking they

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.099 
you might be fooled into thinking they
are<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.429> real<00:00:24.670> thing<00:00:24.699> however<00:00:25.570> a<00:00:25.750> little<00:00:25.900> bit

closer<00:00:26.349> and<00:00:26.619> you<00:00:26.740> can<00:00:26.769> see<00:00:26.919> that<00:00:27.250> there<00:00:27.369> really

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
closer and you can see that there really

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.200 
closer and you can see that there really
are<00:00:27.789> pretty<00:00:28.119> unlikely<00:00:28.570> to<00:00:28.990> be<00:00:29.140> Chanel<00:00:29.589> rings

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210

which<00:00:50.680> would<00:00:50.859> give<00:00:50.980> an<00:00:51.010> indication<00:00:51.309> as<00:00:51.670> to

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
which would give an indication as to

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.599 
which would give an indication as to
whether<00:00:51.910> these<00:00:52.059> are<00:00:52.199> gold<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:53.559> indeed<00:00:54.070> Chanel

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
whether these are gold and indeed Chanel

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.520 
whether these are gold and indeed Chanel
earrings<00:00:54.910> so<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.629> reason<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:55.989> designer

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
earrings so the reason that designer

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.560 
earrings so the reason that designer
jewelry<00:00:57.010> like<00:00:57.160> Chanel<00:00:57.489> cost<00:00:57.820> so<00:00:58.149> much<00:00:58.329> is

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
jewelry like Chanel cost so much is

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.060 
jewelry like Chanel cost so much is
because<00:00:58.719> of<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.050> attention<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.469> detail<00:00:59.890> on

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
because of the attention to detail on

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.619 
because of the attention to detail on
the<00:01:00.160> products<00:01:00.519> with<00:01:00.730> which<00:01:00.910> it<00:01:01.090> means<00:01:01.329> very

precious stones it's pretty clear that's

not what this is made of as I see their

and<00:01:14.229> I'm<00:01:14.619> pretty<00:01:14.950> sure<00:01:15.340> that<00:01:15.880> rather<00:01:16.030> than

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
and I'm pretty sure that rather than

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.170 
and I'm pretty sure that rather than
golden<00:01:16.600> diamonds<00:01:16.840> these<00:01:17.290> are<00:01:17.439> Mifflin<00:01:17.860> glass

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
golden diamonds these are Mifflin glass

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.719 
golden diamonds these are Mifflin glass
these<00:01:19.180> earrings<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.780> have<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.170> CC<00:01:20.500> Chanel<00:01:21.460> logo

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
these earrings do have to CC Chanel logo

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.429 
these earrings do have to CC Chanel logo
on<00:01:22.030> them<00:01:22.210> and<00:01:22.450> so<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.659> could<00:01:22.960> be<00:01:23.110> fooled<00:01:23.320> into

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
on them and so you could be fooled into

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.410 
on them and so you could be fooled into
thinking<00:01:23.530> this<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> genuine<00:01:24.579> Chanel<00:01:24.970> design

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
thinking this is a genuine Chanel design

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.179 
thinking this is a genuine Chanel design
if<00:01:25.659> nothing<00:01:25.990> else<00:01:26.140> but<00:01:26.860> it's<00:01:26.979> worth<00:01:27.159> checking

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
if nothing else but it's worth checking

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.300 
if nothing else but it's worth checking
because<00:01:28.060> often<00:01:29.020> these<00:01:29.439> are<00:01:29.649> simply<00:01:29.920> hearings

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
because often these are simply hearings

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.590 
because often these are simply hearings
that<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.579> been<00:01:30.729> put<00:01:30.880> together<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.390> then<00:01:31.479> the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
that have been put together and then the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.149 
that have been put together and then the
logo<00:01:31.780> has<00:01:32.020> been<00:01:32.229> stuck<00:01:32.439> on<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.770> rather<00:01:32.920> than

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
logo has been stuck on it rather than

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.429 
logo has been stuck on it rather than
being<00:01:33.369> a<00:01:33.490> coffee<00:01:33.899> anything<00:01:34.899> that<00:01:35.049> Chanel<00:01:35.290> has

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
being a coffee anything that Chanel has

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.710 
being a coffee anything that Chanel has
actually<00:01:35.829> done<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.189> so<00:01:36.310> before<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:37.240> pry<00:01:37.509> your

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
actually done and so before you pry your

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.359 
actually done and so before you pry your
jewelry<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.320> worth<00:01:38.500> doing<00:01:38.710> quite<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.009> bit<00:01:39.130> of

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
jewelry is worth doing quite a bit of

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.710 
jewelry is worth doing quite a bit of
research<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.850> make<00:01:40.090> sure<00:01:40.149> that<00:01:40.450> what<00:01:40.600> you're
