 you will be more veteran in me on my channel 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.030
 you will know that last year open in 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.879
 summer also another server then here 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.269
 I bring you my new server that I can 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.240
 say he's pretty careful currado 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:24.580
 it's a long time configuring it and good 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.919
 I hope you like it here you can read 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.659
 the norms good the typical for the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:34.539
 walls there are pvp spam guards 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:37.750
 jobs that would be jobs and good 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.539
 here what about the plots and all that as 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.739
 you see there are bots that you can not hit them and 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:48.160
 they talk to you they are going to hit us 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.829
 he just kill mods and inside the walls 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 there is no 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.520
 well here is the secretary and all that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.710
 everyone says their little 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.850
 These are protecting the area 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.509
 As you can see, these are already plots 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.850
 what does this mean in this field? 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.610
 year passed had to be going from one in 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.610
 one giving giving the permits to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.399
 your land so with this the only 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.070
 what you have to do is give it over if 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.920
 you have the money will take the money and 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.259
 you can rent it for a day what 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.000
 means this that to day all that 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.509
 you have built it is going to be deleted but 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.130
 Of course if you have decÃ­s I will not go to 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.440
 come in seven days so you can 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 to do is give it many times what you buy 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.970
 for seven days and for seven days 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.409
 is going to continue this well I have done it because 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.569
 Many times someone enters the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.009
 server and the next day it does not return 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.100
 to enter and I have to be erasing the 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.679
 house and all that, so there's not a 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.450
 good idea and good I hope you do not 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.450
 bother and you like it 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.990
 here is a world 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.330
 behind all this there is forest and everything 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.210
 that here you can install things like that but 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.430
 there are also more worlds there are three worlds and 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.000
 good as you see is full full 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.910
 of bots and a novelty of this server 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.700
 is that I have yes sir look what it says 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.800
 there are hunger games' what kind of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.630
 Hunger games ' well look now 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.760
 let's go see 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.940
 the kind of hunger games as you see 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.830
 we are here in a playground and for 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.630
 now I have only put two maps but as 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.080
 you see puts waiting right now there is zero 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.990
 people clearly if you give him 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.300
 you enter the stage arena on the east 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.370
 and you can not move until it starts 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.830
 the game that at least has to 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.480
 have 5 people and good a country where 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.420
 the trunks and well I guess you already know 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.870
 how are the hunger games 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.190
 and we're going to go out and you can also 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.260
 make of viewer putting that axis 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.220
 spectateur or only the 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.800
 beats like or serve then very easy we go 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.490
 to go to the second world 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:10.360
 how are you going to be familiar if 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:14.770
 sir is my old server with the game 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.430
 or from my old server last year 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.159
 it's the same map 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.959
 good some updated thing the 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.400
 erased all the plots good all 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.319
 houses 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.239
 we have changed some good thing 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.989
 let's go to the supermarket that is where 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:33.780
 where everything is really good and 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.209
 you know that portals take you to 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.040
 different worlds or different 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.730
 parts for example here you go to part of 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.860
 attractions 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.310
 and as you can see, you can move a lot 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.599
 faster as you can see there are bots for all 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.170
 parties although we have to continue 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:52.840
 putting value to serve nothing else there 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.900
 that you get $ 50,000 and you give 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.019
 here and as soon as you have them you can serve 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.870
 everything is already fixed and as you have 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.360
 seen there are bots and what happens is that those 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.940
 bots can act as bodyguards 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.430
 they can follow behind and protect you if 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.209
 someone harms you and here you can buy 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.910
 one for 30 thousand dollars and clear only 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.850
 can have the bits we also have the 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:21.489
 good supermarket is made with the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.900
 showcase as you can see everything is here 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.120
 flying our crazy and pick 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.729
 and good as you can see it is very cool to the 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.960
 I really like how this store is 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:36.440
 Type of store 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:38.910
 and well there are also there are different wards 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.229
 here they expose all that there is also 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:47.160

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:50.670

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.840

 from zero if you keep quiet and nothing happens 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.950

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.650
 world yes 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.330
 Y 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.550
 if you go like this, you can pass them all 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.600
 this is that the first level is not that 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.539
 very complicated 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:43.110
 you come here and power and they give you 60 dollars 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:45.539
 and you will come back to the east and so with everyone as 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.250
