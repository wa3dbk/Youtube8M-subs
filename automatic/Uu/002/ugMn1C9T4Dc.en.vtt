00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.699
 seventeenth year and up to 17 the same 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.830
 all fled to europe in london 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.660
 notice what's interesting 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.519

 whites ran those who fought for 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.260
 recovery of a strong united Russia is not 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.850
 no where was the greatest most important 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.269
 center where the largest diaspora was 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.949
 Germany 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:53.309
 the paradox of the history of Russia fought out 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.590
 Germany but these officers all of them 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.570
 who didn't want to come from Germany already 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.460
 then as part of even civil war 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.690
 some kind of relationship they came to 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.699
 Germany 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.230
 2 were diasporas in France and 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.720
 britain would be better in a complicated visa 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.090
 they did not give only revolutionaries 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 take the most notorious but 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.240

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.850
 SS legionaries where in London left 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.890
 that is, they are all who are against Russia, they 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:32.400
 pulled out and all who are for Russia because 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.160
 that the white guards they collaborated with 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.590
 Nazis their part but most of them 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.240
 from this collaboration ran like hell 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.090

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.920
 World War II issued Cossacks 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.780

 no soviet subjects ie no 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.980
 there was no reason for the British 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.660
 got rid well firstly to show 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.599
 that they fulfill the arrangements before 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.610
 the Soviet Union will ask Stalin guys 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.769
