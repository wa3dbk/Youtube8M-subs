using a flat screwdriver you would

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.069 
using a flat screwdriver you would
insert<00:01:44.689> it<00:01:44.869> into<00:01:45.079> the<00:01:45.770> u-shaped<00:01:46.640> cam<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:47.990> you

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
insert it into the u-shaped cam and you

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.350 
insert it into the u-shaped cam and you
would<00:01:48.229> turn<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.740> cam<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> quarter<00:01:49.700> turn<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.329> a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
would turn that cam a quarter turn to a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.700 
would turn that cam a quarter turn to a
c-shape<00:01:51.460> this<00:01:52.460> allows<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.360> slide<00:01:53.750> it<00:01:54.020> to

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
c-shape this allows you to slide it to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.920 
c-shape this allows you to slide it to
whatever<00:01:54.920> position<00:01:55.520> you<00:01:55.820> want<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.509> want<00:01:56.780> to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
slide that down that it's to the same

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.580 
slide that down that it's to the same
height<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.369> opposite<00:02:01.939> side<00:02:02.210> shoe<00:02:02.689> and

again turning that cam from a c-shape to
a<00:02:06.740> u-shape<00:02:07.310> would<00:02:08.299> apply<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.720> brake<00:02:09.140> on<00:02:09.379> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470
