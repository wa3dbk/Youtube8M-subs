00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello live joint project 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.170
 The best viewing cities and TV channel 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.940
 teeth it is useful in this project we 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.610
 tell all that is useful to know 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.910
 to your teeth remain healthy well 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
 that you are ready we begin 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.350
 Today we are visiting the dentist 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.830
 a surgeon with ten years of experience 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.410
 Vasil 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 Julia is very hello the first question can 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.480
 say immediately from the door what is 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.119
 maxillary sinus surgery 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.510
 why do i need and why without this 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.550
 operations can not install implants 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.070
 approximately 60 70 percent of the time 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 their work doctors meet with 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 the problem of installing dental implants 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.390
 at the top of the jaw it is connected 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.730
 mainly with two reasons first 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.879
 this is the anatomical structure of the upper 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.270
 jaws and the second is bone loss 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.280
 due to anatomical tooth extraction 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.199
 feature of the upper jaw is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.020
 the presence of a large cavity of the maxillary 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 the sinuses are inside covered with thin 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.390
 mucous membrane and filled with air 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.790
 in one person it is big and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.540
 airy other small with thick 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 by walls 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.930
 when one sinuses are located low along 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.460
 relation to the oral cavity in this 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.159
 bone case 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.460
 becomes insufficient to install 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.130
 dental implant here in such cases and 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 an operation to raise the bottom 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.009
 maxillary sinus which allows 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 increase bone tissue and set 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:38.040
 dental implant is important to understand that the surgeon 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.869
 does not violate the integrity of the maxillary 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 sinuses and only reduces its volume due to 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.890
 offsets 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.440
 mucous membrane above the original 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.600
 level 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.780
 probably such a difficult operation lasts 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.360
 long time and how much she 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.120
 painful in modern conditions it 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 manipulation is carried out absolutely 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.790
 painless and time consuming 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.410
 about 40 minutes yuli 8 tell me when 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.660
 it will be possible to establish the very plan and 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.940
 how much time must pass before 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.210
 installing the implant itself after 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.810
 installation operations are possible 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.820
 implants on the day of surgery but if available 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.010
 certain indicators and naturally 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.970
 only a doctor can decide 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.250
 combining 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.620
 operations to raise the bottom of the maxillary 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.110
 sinus and installation to mental 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.090
 implant but in most cases 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.340
 dental implants 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.670
 performed 3-6 months after 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.380
 performing this procedure 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.150
 Well, the logical question that 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.920
 surely excites many patients 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.760
 whether you need to pass a special 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.710
 examination before the procedure 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.200
 prerequisite when planning 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.570
 such operations is complete 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.090
 examination of the patient with 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.430
 three-dimensional computed tomography is not 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.100
 so simply reliable allows with high 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.810
 measure bone volume accurately 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.500
 zone of intended operation 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.550
 virtually implant teeth 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.160
 develop orthopedic structures 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.090
 which later will be based on 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.090
 dental implant 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.690
 in it came to an end the regular plot about 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.380
 fantastic possibilities of modern 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.050
 dentistry
