00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello in this video I'm going to you 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.899
 present the printer pixma mgr 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.290
 twenty-three 50 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.990
 it's a multifunction printer it's 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.210
 one of the cheapest on the market so that 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.289
 Perfect for students 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.180
 she takes the cartridges down that you 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.590
 can see on the screen now so he 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.310
 there are normal cartridges and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.080
 xl cartridges that are a lot more 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.470
 great and offers three times more 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.790
 of impressions that Norman cartridges 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.790
 so here's for the box 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 this is the printer so wanted to see the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.590
 it's pretty simple actually there is a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.579
 ignition button a stop button a 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.969
 button to photocopy in black and a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.309
 button to photocopy in colors so 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.070
 there you can see the the scanner with 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.180
 a roadmap last night 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 you can see that the loading in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:11.490
 paper is done at the back and the exit 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.979
 is done at the front there you can see 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.210
 a small hatch 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.640
 and if we turn on the printer 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:26.520
 normally we will be able to see the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.750
 cartridges so here you have them 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.750
 past there are two cartridges 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:44.790
 that's a black and a color and that's 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:48.930
 to close it anyway I'm going to launch 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.580
 a small print test to evaluate 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.310
 the speed of the printer 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.210
 so be aware that even printer 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.620
 and one can print and it turns on 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.070
 Alone so there I just turn it off 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:14.520
 I press the button here is the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:19.740
 principal is good so there is no 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:22.100
 the impression here you see she 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.100
 lights 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.900
 and that the pressure will launch 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.860
 at 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 and that's it so that's all it's a 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.400
 simple printer but it works 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.640
 well noted the usb type b cable towards 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 type to is not included in in the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.600
 box as for all printers 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.430
 but often we do not know it so 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.660
 here is to be expected also to buy 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:08.820
 a usb of this type there with the focus ict 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:13.620
 name can not be worth annual type b 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.620
 here it is soon
