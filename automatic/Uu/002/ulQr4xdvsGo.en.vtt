00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.770
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.140
 unboxing in this case a little different 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.140
 and it is a portfolio 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.110
 and this brand I do not know if you know her 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:26.770
 time that I know a lot about her but 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.860
 I think Japanese and there is quite 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.470
 popular t-shirts with prices 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.260
 quite elevated to a bit exclusive 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.180
 let's say on the shirts and everything leads to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.470
 this kind of 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.380
 of monkey that 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.860
 It reminds me a lot of the planet of 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.960
 the apes 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:54.130
 and well they gave me this portfolio and the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 packaging once it's pretty 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.570
 original 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.060
 simply a transparent bag type 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.010
 sandwich 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.700
 and good of the stickers here is where 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.700
 the price came 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.890
 a little explanations as is 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.400
 written in Japanese 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 of what the product is because also 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.570
 in English 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.980
 Google 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.980
 and let's go 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.149
 I have not taken it out of plastic 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 here is the very cool thing 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.350
 and this is the portfolio is practically 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.220
 a Japanese brand the whole team ni 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.170
 yoshida company by text that already stops 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.350
 I am that I knew how good I had 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.850
 seen in japan 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.650
 and I had not seen anywhere else 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.700
 then I figured it was a killer whale 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.450
 japanese 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.590
 and less a portfolio of cracks a little 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.140
 big 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.330
 the truth 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 because you do not have to have the bones 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.390
 good or believe that equal is so so 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.840
 well here we have again 11 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.890

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.150
 made in japan porter tokyo 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.150

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.050
 formally for example cards or 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.209
 be like meats and that maybe what 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.780
 you can teach like that without having to take out 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.790

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.990
 below the part 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:53.100
 where the cards of my fingers are put 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.100
 because it is below then it is not for 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.100
 tickets 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:05.370

 here 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.130
 well almost can not read it nowhere 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.130
 company limited 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.050
 another air label 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.050
 of the brand with him 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.420
 no no 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.409
 Y 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.700
 and that with Velcro almost to a cell phone 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.390

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.540
 very well done 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.670
 maybe being well protected not 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.129
 only with these brackets but 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.870
 in addition with velcro also that can 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.210
 carry something important or something to be 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.880
 delicate has in addition a 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.550
 as a protection does a little with 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.500
 filling and I perfectly think that mobile 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.910
 small can be put here 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.910

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.260
 money card 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 and the part of here then maybe 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.970
 also for coins 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.760
 or what you want to know that to handle 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.730
 quite put the stuffing of things is 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.280
 can propose a mogollón that perhaps 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.889
 for the proposed trouser bag 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.249
 It can be quite 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.960
 master too big us or maybe 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:48.669
 be made to wear a windbreaker or 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.669
 take it in a small bag 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.810
 and all this full of coins bills 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.810
 meat 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.010
 an important size good for this 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.200
 success

 this is the unboxing of this portfolio of 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:08.430

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 little known outside japan 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.270
