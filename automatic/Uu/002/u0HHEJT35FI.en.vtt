00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
on some exams in school probably because

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.810 
on some exams in school probably because
of<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.609> game<00:00:24.230> he<00:00:25.230> didn't<00:00:25.500> have<00:00:25.650> power<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.640> do

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820
