can draw but as I block in a painting my
goal<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:24.619> where<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> want

maybe<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.849> this<00:00:27.029> stage<00:00:27.420> two<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.320> about<00:00:29.000> 40

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
maybe in this stage two in about 40

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.170 
maybe in this stage two in about 40
minutes<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> paintings<00:00:32.250> not<00:00:32.460> working

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
minutes and if the paintings not working

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.690 
minutes and if the paintings not working
then<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:33.870> thought<00:00:34.170> oh<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.829> see<00:00:35.070> very

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
then I thought oh so you can see very

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.090 
then I thought oh so you can see very
general<00:00:36.329> shapes<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.410> I'm<00:00:37.530> trying<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.950> go

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
general shapes just and I'm trying to go

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.450 
general shapes just and I'm trying to go
light<00:00:38.870> medium<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> little<00:00:40.710> bit<00:00:40.829> darker<00:00:41.070> and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
light medium to a little bit darker and

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
light medium to a little bit darker and
then<00:00:41.850> glazing<00:00:42.300> color<00:00:42.600> over<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.200> create

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
then glazing color over just to create

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.340 
then glazing color over just to create
depth<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.160> set<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.940> stage<00:00:45.270> these<00:00:45.989> paintings

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
depth and set my stage these paintings

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.680 
depth and set my stage these paintings
here<00:00:46.710> usually<00:00:46.920> take<00:00:47.340> about<00:00:47.420> two<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> half

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
here usually take about two and a half

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.590 
here usually take about two and a half
hours<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.350> three<00:00:49.860> hours<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.460> try<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> get<00:00:51.390> there

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
hours to three hours I try to get there

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.470 
hours to three hours I try to get there
quickly<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.920> sketched<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> little

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
quickly I have sketched out a little

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.279 
quickly I have sketched out a little
idea<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:56.129> today's<00:00:56.600> demo<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.840> to

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
idea here for today's demo I'm going to

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.450 
idea here for today's demo I'm going to
be<00:00:58.440> using<00:00:59.129> mostly<00:00:59.820> presets<00:01:00.719> in<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.530> painter<00:01:02.250> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
be using mostly presets in in painter I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.670 
be using mostly presets in in painter I
teach<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:03.239> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.600> things<00:01:03.809> about<00:01:03.930> painter<00:01:04.530> and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
teach a lot of things about painter and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.440 
teach a lot of things about painter and
then<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.860> tell<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.369> students<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:06.000> start<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
then I tell the students then start to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.870 
then I tell the students then start to
limit<00:01:06.750> yourself<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.590> workflow<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.729> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
limit yourself to your workflow you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.030 
limit yourself to your workflow you can
see<00:01:09.060> here's<00:01:09.659> my<00:01:09.720> custom<00:01:10.290> palette<00:01:10.500> over<00:01:10.860> here

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
see here's my custom palette over here

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.820 
see here's my custom palette over here
these<00:01:11.220> are<00:01:11.280> my<00:01:11.460> favorite<00:01:11.729> brushes<00:01:12.619> this<00:01:13.619> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
these are my favorite brushes this is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.070 
these are my favorite brushes this is
the<00:01:14.070> greatest<00:01:14.580> known<00:01:14.970> tool<00:01:15.330> in<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> universe

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the greatest known tool in the universe

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
the greatest known tool in the universe
in<00:01:16.380> my<00:01:16.530> opinion<00:01:16.920> because<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
in my opinion because that's what I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.690 
in my opinion because that's what I
really<00:01:18.720> block<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.890> paintings<00:01:20.400> with

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
really block in a lot of paintings with

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.870 
really block in a lot of paintings with
so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.630> see<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:22.290> vantage<00:01:23.009> point<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.640> low

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
so you can see my vantage point is low

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.330 
so you can see my vantage point is low
so<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.299> eye<00:01:24.450> level<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.259> going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.740> right<00:01:26.130> in

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
so my eye level is going to be right in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.510 
so my eye level is going to be right in
here<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.450> format<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.340> bit

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
here the format for this is a little bit

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.149 
here the format for this is a little bit
more<00:01:29.670> cinematic<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> ratio<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.650> two<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
more cinematic so the ratio is a two to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.880 
more cinematic so the ratio is a two to
one<00:01:32.189> ratio<00:01:32.689> so<00:01:33.689> we'll<00:01:33.840> start<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.320> digital

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
one ratio so we'll start with digital

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.940 
one ratio so we'll start with digital
water<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> go<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.350> about<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.409> grace

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
water I'm going to go to about a grace

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.280 
water I'm going to go to about a grace
scale<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.820> three<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.360> half<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.960> in<00:01:40.079> there

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
scale of three and a half right in there

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.560 
scale of three and a half right in there
and<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.790> cover<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.390> entire

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and I'm just going to cover the entire

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.590 
and I'm just going to cover the entire
canvas<00:01:44.570> with<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:46.909> gray<00:01:47.909> scale<00:01:48.479> all<00:01:48.930> right

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
canvas with this gray scale all right

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.450 
canvas with this gray scale all right
just<00:01:51.600> to<00:01:51.869> get<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> tone<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.829> there<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
just to get a tone in there and then I

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
just to get a tone in there and then I
just<00:01:53.729> subtly<00:01:54.210> start<00:01:54.600> to<00:01:54.750> go<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> little<00:01:55.200> bit

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
just subtly start to go a little bit

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.749 
just subtly start to go a little bit
darker<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:57.630> might<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.140> yeah<00:01:58.920> that's<00:01:59.310> alright

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
darker it might be yeah that's alright

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.630 
darker it might be yeah that's alright
so<00:02:00.119> I'm<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.719> start<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.170> cover<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.890> lot<00:02:02.610> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
so I'm going to start to cover a lot of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.289 
so I'm going to start to cover a lot of
this<00:02:02.969> stuff<00:02:03.030> back<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> into<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
this stuff back in here and into the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.589 
this stuff back in here and into the
foreground<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.280> some<00:02:08.280> foliage<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
foreground and some foliage that kind of

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.130 
foreground and some foliage that kind of
works<00:02:09.869> back<00:02:10.200> so<00:02:10.410> I've<00:02:10.530> got<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> lot<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:12.140> kind

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
