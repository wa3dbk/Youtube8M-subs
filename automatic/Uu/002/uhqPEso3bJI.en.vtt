for free with my reward points for
making<00:02:13.000> purchases<00:02:13.689> and<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.829> thought<00:02:15.129> that<00:02:15.870> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
making purchases and I thought that the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.619 
making purchases and I thought that the
part<00:02:18.280> right<00:02:18.489> here<00:02:18.519> at<00:02:18.760> of<00:02:18.849> jewels<00:02:19.120> I<00:02:19.450> thought

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
part right here at of jewels I thought

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.780 
part right here at of jewels I thought
this<00:02:19.780> was<00:02:19.930> going<00:02:20.109> to<00:02:20.170> be<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.319> gold<00:02:20.650> color<00:02:20.920> but<00:02:21.609> it

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
this was going to be a gold color but it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.509 
this was going to be a gold color but it
actually<00:02:21.969> is<00:02:22.659> kind<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.260> like<00:02:23.379> a<00:02:23.439> rose<00:02:23.829> gold<00:02:24.250> and

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
actually is kind of like a rose gold and

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.360 
actually is kind of like a rose gold and
that<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.720> what<00:02:25.989> actually<00:02:26.709> deterred<00:02:27.099> me<00:02:27.129> from

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
that is what actually deterred me from

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.569 
that is what actually deterred me from
ordering<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.269> a<00:02:28.359> pink<00:02:28.659> I<00:02:28.900> wanted<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:30.010> shoe

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
ordering it in a pink I wanted the shoe

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:32.940 
ordering it in a pink I wanted the shoe
to<00:02:30.879> be<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.180> gold<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.019> there<00:02:32.680> was<00:02:32.829> a<00:02:32.859> chance

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
to be in gold so if there was a chance

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.099 
to be in gold so if there was a chance
that<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> pink<00:02:33.670> one<00:02:33.849> wasn't<00:02:34.269> going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.629> be<00:02:34.810> an

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
that the pink one wasn't going to be an

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.729 
that the pink one wasn't going to be an
act<00:02:35.859> in<00:02:36.069> gold<00:02:36.549> then<00:02:37.299> I<00:02:37.659> didn't<00:02:38.230> want<00:02:38.379> to<00:02:38.469> order

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
act in gold then I didn't want to order

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.369 
act in gold then I didn't want to order
it<00:02:38.889> so<00:02:39.459> this<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.389> pretty<00:02:40.599> much<00:02:40.719> a<00:02:40.840> minimalistic

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
it so this is pretty much a minimalistic

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.319 
it so this is pretty much a minimalistic
hill<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.280> then<00:02:42.400> it's<00:02:42.549> got<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.879> really<00:02:43.060> cute

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
hill and then it's got this really cute

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.199 
hill and then it's got this really cute
accent<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.950> zips<00:02:45.189> up<00:02:45.430> in<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.670> back<00:02:45.909> it's

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
accent and it zips up in the back it's

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.059 
accent and it zips up in the back it's
really<00:02:46.569> comfortable<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.290> easy<00:02:47.409> to<00:02:47.829> walk<00:02:48.040> in

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
really comfortable it's easy to walk in

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.599 
really comfortable it's easy to walk in
when<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.879> walk<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:50.650> pretty<00:02:51.069> much<00:02:51.310> all

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
when you walk that's pretty much all

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.339 
when you walk that's pretty much all
you're<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> hear<00:02:52.419> so<00:02:52.959> it's<00:02:53.319> probably

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
you're going to hear so it's probably

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:54.780 
you're going to hear so it's probably
going<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.709> make<00:02:53.859> people<00:02:54.010> kind<00:02:54.340> of<00:02:54.459> look<00:02:54.519> your

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
way to see what that noise is but

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.020 
way to see what that noise is but

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
size I didn't have any problems with how

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.050 
size I didn't have any problems with how
it<00:03:55.599> fits<00:03:55.840> actually<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.889> take<00:03:57.220> that<00:03:57.280> back<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.879> is

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
it fits actually I take that back it is

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.119 
it fits actually I take that back it is
a<00:03:58.090> little<00:03:58.359> big<00:03:58.750> because<00:03:59.560> of<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.769> design<00:03:59.919> of

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
a little big because of the design of

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.460 
a little big because of the design of
the<00:04:00.370> shoe<00:04:00.609> shoes<00:04:01.269> like<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.689> typically<00:04:02.139> run

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
the shoe shoes like this typically run

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.640 
the shoe shoes like this typically run
big<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:03.010> me<00:04:03.310> but<00:04:03.569> because<00:04:04.569> of<00:04:04.840> the<00:04:05.079> way<00:04:05.169> the<00:04:05.319> top

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
big on me but because of the way the top

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.610 
big on me but because of the way the top
part<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.549> hill<00:04:06.759> is<00:04:06.970> made<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.599> my<00:04:08.199> foot<00:04:08.500> is

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
part of the hill is made it my foot is

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.270 
part of the hill is made it my foot is
secure<00:04:09.009> so<00:04:09.549> I<00:04:09.579> don't<00:04:09.819> have<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.000> worry<00:04:10.239> about

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
secure so I don't have to worry about

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.449 
secure so I don't have to worry about
