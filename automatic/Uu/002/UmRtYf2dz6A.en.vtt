00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.920
 this is my third paravan now 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.380
 remodels the I pick up today 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.520
 So I have two chrysler before 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:24.169
 drove and that is now the first 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.460
 lancia voyager that's the principle of that 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:31.070
 were made the same as the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.390
 Sheets 32 it's the bottom group 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.600
 completely taken out 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.190
 from the front axle until just before the 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.190
 Rear axle is lowered by 20 cm 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.359
 So you want to be in a wheelchair 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.579
 can drive in and still took 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.140
 had a good seat and so to speak 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.030
 same level as when 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.570
 Original seated in it I would drive with 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.929
 The wheelchair behind the steering wheel moves over 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.949
 a blog you can see at her below 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:02.539
 The wheelchair fixes it one 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.930
 screw that wore at this time 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:09.439
 engages with it first is the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.080
 Wheelchair as such has fixed afterwards 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.960
 it is 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.930
 remodeling or big change criterion and 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.920
 also a nice innovation relatively new 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 a back support behind the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.280
 Wheelchair drives and then over 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.830
 in addition, as with the roller coaster two 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.990
 iron over the shoulder wrap around 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.680
 a very stable and safe stop too 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 guarantee 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.080
 In principle, the conversion is like this 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.090
 he definitely designed me 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.990
 only capable of being alone everywhere 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.460
 to enter alone outside 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.860
 Personally , I always like it 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.479
 if someone is with me if outside 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.250
 the conversion something happens but 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.560
 basically you can with the vehicle 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.869
 change everywhere alone then drive 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.850
 needs no further help to one 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.960
 and get out 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.300
 that means so much freedom for me 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.340
 like flat pedestrians also has the car 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.340
 So I'm missing nothing
