those<00:01:34.009> things<00:01:34.189> have<00:01:34.369> impurities<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.119> them<00:01:35.270> and

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
those things have impurities in them and

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.380 
those things have impurities in them and
those<00:01:36.140> impurities<00:01:36.950> will<00:01:37.789> stick<00:01:38.149> to<00:01:38.299> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
those impurities will stick to the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.590 
those impurities will stick to the
platter<00:01:39.969> then<00:01:40.969> you'll<00:01:41.270> have<00:01:41.359> the<00:01:41.479> same

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
platter then you'll have the same

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.940 
platter then you'll have the same
problem<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.929> currently<00:01:42.200> have<00:01:42.350> which<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.770> that

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
problem you currently have which is that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.660 
problem you currently have which is that
you<00:01:43.039> have<00:01:43.569> marking<00:01:44.569> on<00:01:44.960> the<00:01:45.140> platter<00:01:45.350> just

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
you have marking on the platter just

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.429 
you have marking on the platter just
keep<00:01:46.670> buffing<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.149> out<00:01:47.329> till<00:01:47.719> it<00:01:48.079> looks<00:01:48.289> like

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
keep buffing it out till it looks like

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.789 
keep buffing it out till it looks like
it's<00:01:48.590> gone<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:50.539> can<00:01:50.659> see<00:01:50.840> here<00:01:51.109> that<00:01:51.469> when<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
it's gone you can see here that when I

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.440 
it's gone you can see here that when I
move<00:01:52.069> it<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:52.310> can't<00:01:52.579> tell<00:01:52.819> where<00:01:53.240> it<00:01:53.389> was

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
move it you can't tell where it was

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.899 
move it you can't tell where it was
anymore<00:01:54.020> and<00:01:54.950> I've<00:01:55.280> gotten<00:01:55.579> rid<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.759> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
anymore and I've gotten rid of the

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.419 
anymore and I've gotten rid of the
fingerprints<00:01:56.479> none<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.530> will<00:01:58.009> destroy

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
fingerprints none of that will destroy

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.789 
fingerprints none of that will destroy
the<00:01:58.639> data<00:01:58.880> if<00:01:59.689> we<00:01:59.869> were<00:01:59.929> to<00:02:00.049> scratch<00:02:00.319> it<00:02:00.560> so

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the data if we were to scratch it so

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.010 
the data if we were to scratch it so
make<00:02:01.009> sure<00:02:01.039> that<00:02:01.249> you<00:02:01.579> that<00:02:02.479> you're<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.840> like

also some ink cleaners that might be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.570 
also some ink cleaners that might be
alcohol<00:02:12.050> heavy<00:02:12.319> cleaners<00:02:13.070> and<00:02:13.250> not<00:02:13.340> just

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
alcohol heavy cleaners and not just

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.310 
alcohol heavy cleaners and not just

straight alcohol might have corrosive
agents<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:15.830> them<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.430> they<00:02:16.580> could<00:02:16.760> eat<00:02:16.940> away<00:02:17.060> at

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
agents in them so they could eat away at

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.100 
agents in them so they could eat away at
the<00:02:17.420> data

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
the data

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.880 
the data
definitely<00:02:18.740> either<00:02:19.010> use<00:02:20.680> alcohol<00:02:21.680> or

something that is non-corrosive that

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.520 
something that is non-corrosive that
dries<00:02:25.010> quickly<00:02:25.340> like<00:02:25.610> alcohol<00:02:26.320> so<00:02:27.320> now<00:02:27.470> we

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
dries quickly like alcohol so now we

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.280 
dries quickly like alcohol so now we
