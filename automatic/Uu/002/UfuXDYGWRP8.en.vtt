notebooks they have them in desktops you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.870 
notebooks they have them in desktops you
know<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.530> if<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.950> want<00:01:48.190> you<00:01:48.310> can<00:01:48.490> get<00:01:48.640> two<00:01:48.850> of

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
know and if you want you can get two of

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.000 
know and if you want you can get two of
those<00:01:49.150> in<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:49.360> notebook<00:01:49.690> internally<00:01:50.470> not

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
those in this notebook internally not

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.250 
those in this notebook internally not
just<00:01:51.280> one<00:01:51.550> but<00:01:51.729> two<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.360> then<00:01:52.870> that<00:01:53.020> allow

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
just one but two and then that allow

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.170 
just one but two and then that allow
that<00:01:53.530> allows<00:01:53.830> you<00:01:54.010> to<00:01:54.159> enable<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.640> sli

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
that allows you to enable the sli

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.050 
that allows you to enable the sli
feature<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.840> what<00:01:56.200> sli<00:01:56.650> gives<00:01:56.950> you<00:01:57.100> is<00:01:57.250> it

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
feature and what sli gives you is it

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.170 
feature and what sli gives you is it
helps<00:01:59.050> you<00:01:59.170> imagine<00:02:00.070> two<00:02:00.280> video<00:02:00.640> cards<00:02:00.880> right

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
helps you imagine two video cards right

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.880 
helps you imagine two video cards right
next<00:02:01.479> to<00:02:01.570> each<00:02:01.600> other<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.080> then<00:02:02.650> what<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.799> can

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
next to each other and then what you can

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.310 
next to each other and then what you can
do<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.370> you<00:02:03.549> can<00:02:03.580> render<00:02:04.390> a<00:02:04.420> lot<00:02:04.659> faster<00:02:05.140> so

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
do is you can render a lot faster so

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.230 
do is you can render a lot faster so
it's<00:02:05.470> two<00:02:05.710> video<00:02:06.430> cards<00:02:06.670> working<00:02:07.120> together

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it's two video cards working together

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's two video cards working together
instead<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.900> just<00:02:08.080> one<00:02:08.350> so<00:02:08.950> it's<00:02:09.070> almost<00:02:09.220> like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
instead of just one so it's almost like

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.770 
instead of just one so it's almost like
you<00:02:09.519> have<00:02:09.670> one<00:02:09.910> pushing<00:02:10.269> the<00:02:10.330> other<00:02:10.479> one<00:02:10.660> up

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
you have one pushing the other one up

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.140 
you have one pushing the other one up
