00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.770
 By the way, where did all the good teachers come from? 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.960
 Do you use 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.339
 It was decided to 11 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:10.719
 Once 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.719
 I declined to comment on the bottom of the bridge 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:19.359
 I have no choice but to do 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.710
 4 times of 1 point lead 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.800
 This time 1.2 million yen 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:25.929
 Yusu Town Council 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.039
 Came to be 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.749
 First of all 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.250
 I lost 2-1 today 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.319
 I 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:36.980
 Also in the hall of worship 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.710
 Too much for the locals 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.790
 Still 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.860
 Great failure 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 It is used as fertilizer in the field 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 Defensive 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.340
 This movie was 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.200
 Already distributed 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.300
 It is customary to be divided 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.530
 It is getting interesting 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.540
 It is in the shape of Shinomiya 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 again 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.540
 I felt it was being operated 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.280
 The next mayor 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 People who are aiming for a kamaboko 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.039
 I am proud 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.080
 Somehow locally 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.830
 I think it can not be made more deliciously 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.830
 It seems that the BOJ's finances have been repeated 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.730
 And one and a half hours 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.580
 Not 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.580
 I am stuck with the business hours of my eldest daughter 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.609
 Starch saccharification made with Hokkaido potatoes 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.040
 Mix 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.040
 I came up with something 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.180
 So good 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.180
 The present ecb was born 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.019
 Less than 2000 yen at a stretch 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.149
 Also to General MacArthur 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:14.449
 It is a Christmas present 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:16.599
 I have a book 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.429
 It feels like it has become famous 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.729
 Joen also 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.589
 There was such a history in 2000
