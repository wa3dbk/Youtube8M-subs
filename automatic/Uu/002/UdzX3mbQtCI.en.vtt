Android<00:01:24.030> phones<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> trick<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.530> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
Android phones so the trick is and the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.520 
Android phones so the trick is and the
upper<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.060> micro<00:01:27.509> SD<00:01:27.869> card<00:01:28.110> would

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
upper bit off of the micro SD card would

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.010 
upper bit off of the micro SD card would
be<00:01:28.650> facing<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> phone<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.630> once

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
be facing the back of the phone so once

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
be facing the back of the phone so once
you<00:01:31.290> place<00:01:31.890> this<00:01:32.070> towards<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.400> back<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you place this towards the back of the

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.370 
you place this towards the back of the
phone<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.659> go<00:01:33.780> there's<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> spring

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
phone there you go there's a spring

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.260

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
seal this up and we're going to now go

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.289 
seal this up and we're going to now go
back<00:01:49.380> into<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.890> phone<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> we're<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.240> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
back into the phone and we're going to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.310 
back into the phone and we're going to
have<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> look<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.840> if<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.110> phone<00:01:52.290> has

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
have a look and see if the phone has

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.060 
have a look and see if the phone has
picked<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.159> micro<00:01:53.399> SD<00:01:53.610> card<00:01:53.820> slot<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:55.070> we

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
picked up the micro SD card slot so we

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.760 
picked up the micro SD card slot so we
go<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.310> there<00:01:56.369> let's<00:01:57.360> go<00:01:57.540> into<00:01:57.719> settings<00:01:58.140> and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
go in there let's go into settings and

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.219 
go in there let's go into settings and
it<00:01:59.189> says<00:01:59.430> preparing<00:01:59.939> SD<00:02:00.299> card<00:02:00.509> on<00:02:00.570> top<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.170> it

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
it says preparing SD card on top so it

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.469 
it says preparing SD card on top so it
takes<00:02:01.469> just<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.979> while<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> phone<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.270> read

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
takes just a while for the phone to read

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.899 
takes just a while for the phone to read
at<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:04.020> SD<00:02:04.229> card<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:05.130> sure<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.579> picks<00:02:05.790> it

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
at the SD card and make sure it picks it

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.260 
at the SD card and make sure it picks it
up

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
up

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.150 
up
let<00:02:06.930> me<00:02:07.020> decrease<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> brightness<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.009> bit

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
let me decrease the brightness a bit

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.650 
let me decrease the brightness a bit
because<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because I think you

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.090 
because I think you
it's<00:02:09.870> not<00:02:10.050> much<00:02:10.260> clear<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.650> the<00:02:10.740> video<00:02:10.950> there

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
it's not much clear on the video there

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.550 
it's not much clear on the video there
we<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:12.660> brightness<00:02:12.990> actually<00:02:13.260> makes<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
we go the brightness actually makes the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.920 
we go the brightness actually makes the
lens<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.330> bit<00:02:15.450> difficult<00:02:15.780> for<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
lens to do it's a bit difficult for the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.950 
lens to do it's a bit difficult for the
lens<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:17.190> focus<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.670> high<00:02:18.120> brightness<00:02:18.420> okay

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
lens to to focus in high brightness okay

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.410 
lens to to focus in high brightness okay
so<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.290> go<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.590> settings<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.940> we<00:02:21.090> go<00:02:21.240> on

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
so we go in settings and then we go on

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
so we go in settings and then we go on
storage<00:02:21.960> and<00:02:22.200> from<00:02:22.890> there<00:02:23.070> we<00:02:23.220> go<00:02:23.370> right<00:02:23.550> at

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
storage and from there we go right at

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
storage and from there we go right at
