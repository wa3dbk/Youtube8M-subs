00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:16.109
 then there is a saying that says that not 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.260
 gets fat between christmas and new year but from 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.490
 new year this to say what 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 that are not those two lunches and two 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.260
 dinners during the holidays that can 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.269
 to be precisely Easter Christmas 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.940
 they do gain weight but are the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.760
 our daily eating habits e 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.219
 during the year it is clear that it is normal 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 eat a little more during 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.820
 festivities mainly because they are there 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 of the particular dishes that for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.010
 tradition are consumed there are gods 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.250
 their particular foods therefore the most that 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.899
 give advice on how to dispose of the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.360
 funny that I'd like to give him a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.610
 advice on how to behave and no 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 during the holidays for sure 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.949
 it's always important to check 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.140
 the portions a bit then 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.500
 let us try the dishes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.210
 without overdoing with portions a 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.250
 very simple advice is what 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.970
 maybe try not to eat the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.970
 bread surely the festive lunches have 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.549
 more carbohydrates than the usual ones 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.320
 because there is sweet because surely 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.380
 there are the first ones so then 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.850
 the CEO to set aside the bread and to 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.890
 do not consume it also consume with 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.720
 moderation 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 alcohol is definitely trying to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.490
 check the quantities and portions 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 of desserts definitely this there 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.310
 will not overdo it because doing 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.830
 a binge because eat as if 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.520
 in short, it was the last day of the 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.150
 our life 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.850
 a very simple advice for 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.470
 to try to dispose of is definitely to do 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.570
 a little more movement we have more time 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.310
 and party maybe we don't work every 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.979
 we can walk a little more to do 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 a walk in the mountains with ours 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 dear etcetera and definitely try to 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.810
 make a day so clear of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.790
 dispute recovery that could 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.950
 provide for elimination or reduction 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.810
 of carbohydrates like sweet bread dough 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.360
 laugh and increase those that are instead 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.030
 no vegetable carbohydrates for vegetables and 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.580
 vegetables especially if tails salads 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.250
 vegetables vegetables fruit drink a lot 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:39.130
 precisely because the excessive consumption of 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.900
 for example to say of sweet arcole can 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.900
 be disposed of by drinking more water 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.730
 making some draining laughter or 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.350
 why not also of the centrifuged of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.489
 fruits and vegetables 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.810
 so here's mainly we work on 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.390
 even on holidays 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 how to say cultivate awareness 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 check the portions the quantities 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.920
 enjoying ourselves however also doing gods 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.459
 of henchmen being able to civilize parties and then 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.560
 let's start with our food 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.560
 fair balanced everyday
