this<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.600> awesome<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:56.780> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
this is so awesome is because of this it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.860 
this is so awesome is because of this it
basically<00:00:58.410> tastes<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.460> hybrid<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.300> sprite

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
basically tastes like a hybrid of sprite

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.680 
basically tastes like a hybrid of sprite
and<00:01:01.280> surge<00:01:02.280> from<00:01:02.640> back<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.059> day<00:01:03.270> it's

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and surge from back in the day it's

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.390 
and surge from back in the day it's
almost<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> diet<00:01:04.409> surge<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.920> my<00:01:05.040> opinion

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
almost like a diet surge in my opinion

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.130 
almost like a diet surge in my opinion
because<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.180> lighter<00:01:06.600> version

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
because it's just a much lighter version

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.170 
because it's just a much lighter version
of<00:01:07.200> surge<00:01:07.439> doesn't<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.310> boom<00:01:08.580> but

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
of surge doesn't have that big boom but

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
of surge doesn't have that big boom but
it's<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.360> relaxing<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> every<00:01:10.320> once<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
it's very relaxing and every once in a

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
it's very relaxing and every once in a
while<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> said

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
