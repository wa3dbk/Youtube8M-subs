00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.430
 puts with bills I called them 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.170

 horn forward forward parallelism 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.839
 it's not what it is then it's 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.879
 rejection of the circus 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.350
 that's what people do not know is that 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.940
 the circus is the circus it's good 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.320
 that means 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 we have passed from the lion to 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.500
 the registration of a truck on the chip 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.240
 of an hour to the chip of an info after 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.740
 the tax at the axle tax that we are 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 as a source of annoyances the circus ya 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.760
 no better if I became what I 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.670
 have become I have the army so I have 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.350
 found at the circus a little bit what 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.330
 I learned from the army when I did 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.100
 my military service in Algeria and I 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.230
 consider it my civil legion 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 what interests me the most 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.950
 it is indisputably the side where 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.460
 had seen material men and everything 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.680
 what follows 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.420
 the show of course one since 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.370
 it still makes people vibrate but 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:02:01.740
 it's more my daughter than they occupy and 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:02:10.019
 my son then it would have happened in the morning 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.519
 departure on tuesday 17 okay thanks my 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.300
 role is to tour the circus 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.540
 that is to say choose the cities and 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.209
 decide where circus pinder circus 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.050
 pinder will therefore occur in France the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.640
 circus has been running for over 30 years and 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.590
 and with a number of cities that 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.650
 are the same every year we have 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.180
 cities the friends we can say who we 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.320
 welcomes every year with a lot of 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.940
 pleasure where everything is going very well 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.250
 however, there are a number of 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.740
 cities that are not acquired and that we 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.260
 shares with other circuses and 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.740
 right now there are a number 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.180
 of circus tents that have imported 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.340
 brought in recent years a 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.230
 anarchy in the job unfortunately 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.900
 so who's blurring the cards a bit and 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.360
 which makes the logic that there was at 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:02.330
 over the years no longer exists and from 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.680
 it becomes very complicated but I 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.120
 am the commercial director so the 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.380
 pinder circus jeans and workloads 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.630
 at the circus headquarters pinder jean richard 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.130
 or coulanges to sucy-en-brie so 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.990
 it's me who takes care of contacting all 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.210
 the works councils of 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.920
 paris-ile-de-france so for the 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.260
 invited to organize their Christmas tree 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.910
 on surprising that we are on paris 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.470
 on the lawn of reuilly so like 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.330
 this year from January 8 to November 8 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.330
 forgiveness until January 12, 2014 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.709
 I am attached press is responsible for 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.480
 communication so I take care of 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.610
 look for partners when we're in 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.290
 tour on paris and then also 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.120
 talk about us in the press in general 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.920
 well we try to always keep the 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.420
 contact is more important always 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.280
 because for example for 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.020
 interviews with Frederic Edelstein he 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.090
 must always be able to contact him 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.590
 when needed and I am 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.940
 daily to find out where is this 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.120
 that they are and also the difficulties 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.870
 to then tell the partners if 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.100
 never a problem we managed up 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.350
 present a little over 10 million 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.700
 turnover per year and 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.959
 with the crisis we are a little down 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.180
 I'm going to tell you to run a 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.480
 big circus that now it's getting 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.020
 impossible between regulation for 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.180
 the beasts 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.500
 regulations for security that 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.959
 is legitimate but we have always had 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.430
 this is the regulation we will have 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.620
 more and more sure so and so 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.620
 things we have no help from the state 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.330
 the state helps the circuses without animals 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.370
 but to say that with animals no I have to 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.650
 about a check every month that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.060
 it's social security because of 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.860
 foreigners because I was able to realize 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:34.409
 we have almost 80% of 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.550
 from aliens as like as staff 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:37.409
 because the French play yoyo 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.830
 can do it I'm orienting myself 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.090
 gently for the amusement park where 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.680
 there will be some animals because there is 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.539
 many animals that roam 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.530
 can not have 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:50.009
 I am thinking especially of hippopotamuses 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.599
 to rhinoceros giraffes and well the 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.490
 people will come to see real circus with 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.500
 a lot of wild animals to bread der 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.530
