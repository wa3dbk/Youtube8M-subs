00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
so the plasma is something like that so

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.510 
so the plasma is something like that so
that<00:01:55.939> everything<00:01:56.749> gets<00:01:56.869> lost<00:01:57.229> even<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.310> guys

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520

so one last time if you like try to do
this<00:02:07.999> like<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.450> then<00:02:09.440> they<00:02:09.649> flashbang<00:02:10.250> like

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
this like that then they flashbang like

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.059 
this like that then they flashbang like
hits<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.120> wall<00:02:11.330> over<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:12.380> exploding

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
hits the wall over there and exploding

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.890 
hits the wall over there and exploding
here<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:13.880> not<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.660> getting

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
here so they're not going to getting

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.540 
here so they're not going to getting
flaws<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.950> just<00:02:16.310> like<00:02:16.550> flaccid<00:02:17.180> over<00:02:17.870> there

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
flaws so just like flaccid over there

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.670 
flaws so just like flaccid over there
just<00:02:19.550> slice<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:19.940> like<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.660> last<00:02:20.810> point<00:02:21.350> of<00:02:21.620> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
just slice it like the last point of the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.120 
just slice it like the last point of the
line

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
line

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.870
