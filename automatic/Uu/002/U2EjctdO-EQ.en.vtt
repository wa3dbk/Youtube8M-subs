00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
these six new Star Wars Disney Cars I'm

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.000 
these six new Star Wars Disney Cars I'm
assuming<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:48.989> made<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.379> second<00:00:49.860> batch

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
assuming they made the second batch

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
assuming they made the second batch
because<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.670> saw<00:00:50.879> billions<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.690> billions

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
because they saw billions and billions

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
because they saw billions and billions
of<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.559> batch<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.829> cars<00:00:53.250> which<00:00:53.520> are

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
of the first batch of cars which are

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
of the first batch of cars which are
these<00:00:53.789> cars<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.750> front<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> case<00:00:55.350> is

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
these cars in the front of the case is

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.729 
these cars in the front of the case is
right<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.719> this<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.960> car<00:00:58.260> features

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
right here this first car features

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.650 
right here this first car features
Ramone<00:00:59.190> as<00:00:59.460> han<00:00:59.879> Solo

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
Ramone as han Solo

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.209 
Ramone as han Solo
which<00:01:00.989> doesn't<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:01.920> sense

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
which doesn't really make much sense

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.579 
which doesn't really make much sense
because<00:01:02.489> Ramone<00:01:03.059> paints<00:01:03.480> cars<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> living

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
because Ramone paints cars for a living

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.070 
because Ramone paints cars for a living
whereas<00:01:05.070> Han<00:01:05.280> Solo<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> pilot<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.840> but

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
whereas Han Solo is a pilot and but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.870 
whereas Han Solo is a pilot and but
everybody<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.560> Star<00:01:07.830> Wars<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> pilot<00:01:08.520> right

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
everybody in Star Wars is a pilot right

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.570 
everybody in Star Wars is a pilot right
I<00:01:09.240> mean<00:01:09.720> they<00:01:09.930> even<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.229> c-3po<00:01:10.920> piloting

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
I mean they even have c-3po piloting

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.609 
I mean they even have c-3po piloting
some<00:01:11.760> ships<00:01:12.030> here<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.420> there<00:01:12.600> well<00:01:13.380> either

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
some ships here and there well either

Luke<00:03:36.100> Skywalker<00:03:36.390> so<00:03:37.390> they<00:03:37.540> should<00:03:37.690> have

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
Luke Skywalker so they should have

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.440 
Luke Skywalker so they should have
chosen<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.260> car<00:03:38.590> who<00:03:39.130> would<00:03:39.250> antagonize<00:03:39.610> ramon

however<00:03:42.459> Ramon<00:03:42.820> seems<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.209> a<00:03:43.240> pretty

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
however Ramon seems like a pretty

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.380 
however Ramon seems like a pretty
laid-back<00:03:43.959> car<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:45.190> maybe<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> only<00:03:45.850> person

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
laid-back car so maybe the only person

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:47.930 
laid-back car so maybe the only person
that<00:03:46.420> can<00:03:46.660> antagonize<00:03:47.020> him<00:03:47.470> would<00:03:47.650> be<00:03:47.680> like

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that can antagonize him would be like

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.449 
that can antagonize him would be like
Flo<00:03:48.959> because<00:03:49.959> maybe<00:03:50.170> Ramon<00:03:50.980> didn't<00:03:51.250> do<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
Flo because maybe Ramon didn't do the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.020 
Flo because maybe Ramon didn't do the
