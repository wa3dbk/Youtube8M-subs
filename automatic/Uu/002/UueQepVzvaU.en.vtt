00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.099
 this shows with the pc 118 he stroked 8 1 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.169
 compact excavators current stroked eight 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.270
 series the device offers according to manufacturer 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.539
 high driving comfort and high productivity 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.250
 for the user on rome 24 tv has become 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.460
 viewed the compact excavator near 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.739
 offers from 0.9 tons to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.850
 12 inches in the compact class almost 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.969
 completely everything 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.500
 We now have it here on the Nordbau 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.719
 highlight par excellence that is the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 measurement innovation namely the pc 118 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 this is the successor of the pc 98 which has 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 now solved him to norbert and this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.630
 Machine is mainly in compact 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.140
 municipal road and civil engineering 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.770
 officially used 118 weighs just short 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.060
 twelve tons has 98 ps and is one 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.010
 powerful machine due to its 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.750
 renewed or refined load 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.340
 Sensing hydraulic machine becomes one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
 pretending boom-or even half as 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.299
 here also to be seen at a fair 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.200
 monoblock boom offered the pc and 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.909
 has a brand new motorcycles 43 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 This is a special stage 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.420
 Low emission and powerful engine 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430
 the one very small 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 fuel consumption surcharge komatsu has 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.460
 look at these excavators on it 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.740
 concentrated as compact and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.780
 save space to build in just 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.390
 to work cramped areas 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.760
 that means that the counterweight was very high 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.619
 compactly held with small dimensions 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.580
 the over the chain at the side 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.960
 stick out and stand out everywhere 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.299
 one has just installed a sliding door 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.950
 Do not open the doors with it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.990
 to be damaged when panning 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 work the cabin as such 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.920
 something bigger has become a little bit more 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.500
 space and you have like from the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.939
 you know the great dredger series 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.990
 Operation module also in this excavator 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.189
 to flow into 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.100
 that means you have a very big one 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.320
 Display with many information booths 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.210
 which the bike can read off and with 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.880
 many storage areas for the driver for 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.560
 his office has for his ticket komatsu 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.170
 A lot of trouble with this excavator 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.119
 give all possible all important 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.009
 to get test stands under a cover 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.290
 that means the driver can do without the 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.090
 machine can climb out having to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.370
 he from the ground all important 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.680
 Check test stands and check 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.659
 all 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.340
 I 'm under for circumstances 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.269
 a separate central lid 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.069
 disappeared 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:26.480
 We offer either steel chains as 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.650
 also so-called red plaques 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.109
 the difference is that to the states 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.750
 the red chains are a catalyst 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.629
 so it's covered with rubber 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.549
 drivers so easily on asphalt and 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.760
 Composite pavement can drive without this 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.760
 to confirm
