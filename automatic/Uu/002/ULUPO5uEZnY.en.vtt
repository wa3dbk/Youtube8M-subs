don't have loads of it just have a block

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:03.740 
don't have loads of it just have a block
okay<00:03:59.060> so<00:03:59.120> less<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.720> tiny<00:04:00.530> bit

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.300 

we're<00:04:04.750> honest<00:04:05.050> or<00:04:05.200> another<00:04:05.440> danger<00:04:05.860> all<00:04:06.010> here

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
we're honest or another danger all here

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.250 
we're honest or another danger all here
really<00:04:07.890> refined<00:04:09.030> carbohydrates<00:04:10.030> so<00:04:10.660> packed

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
really refined carbohydrates so packed

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.470 
really refined carbohydrates so packed
full<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.500> sugar<00:04:11.610> best<00:04:12.610> way<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.790> sort<00:04:13.180> of<00:04:13.300> mark

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
full of sugar best way to sort of mark

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
full of sugar best way to sort of mark
them<00:04:13.630> out<00:04:13.750> is<00:04:13.870> they're<00:04:13.990> probably<00:04:14.140> going<00:04:14.380> to<00:04:14.440> be

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
them out is they're probably going to be

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.550 
them out is they're probably going to be
white<00:04:14.740> okay<00:04:15.370> so<00:04:15.850> a<00:04:15.880> simple<00:04:16.600> alternative<00:04:17.110> is

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
white okay so a simple alternative is

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.170 
white okay so a simple alternative is
just<00:04:17.590> go<00:04:17.920> from<00:04:18.070> white<00:04:18.280> rice<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.820> brown<00:04:18.910> rice

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
just go from white rice to brown rice

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.390 
just go from white rice to brown rice
all<00:04:19.630> right<00:04:19.750> but<00:04:20.260> actually<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.830> be<00:04:20.950> honest<00:04:21.220> I

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
all right but actually to be honest I

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.670 
all right but actually to be honest I
would<00:04:21.520> stick<00:04:22.030> straight<00:04:22.960> off<00:04:23.170> that<00:04:23.200> and<00:04:23.590> I

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
would stick straight off that and I

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.140 
would stick straight off that and I
would<00:04:23.770> just<00:04:23.920> cut<00:04:24.550> out<00:04:24.670> the<00:04:24.730> rice<00:04:24.970> and

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
would just cut out the rice and

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.640 
would just cut out the rice and
personally<00:04:25.510> what<00:04:25.600> I<00:04:25.660> would<00:04:25.900> do<00:04:25.990> instead<00:04:26.140> is

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
personally what I would do instead is

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.800 
personally what I would do instead is
grab<00:04:27.490> this<00:04:27.700> so<00:04:28.210> I've<00:04:29.080> gone<00:04:29.320> rounds<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:31.540> we've

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
fan of it okay because it is really a

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.749 
fan of it okay because it is really a
lot<00:06:23.259> of<00:06:23.289> sugars<00:06:23.680> especially<00:06:23.860> in<00:06:24.310> white<00:06:24.490> bread
