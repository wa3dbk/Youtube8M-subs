the experiences that I had and the

the experiences that I had and the

and I would contend that it correlates
directly<00:03:36.000> with<00:03:36.690> life<00:03:37.049> so<00:03:37.590> when<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:37.950> die<00:03:38.280> it

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
directly with life so when you die it
