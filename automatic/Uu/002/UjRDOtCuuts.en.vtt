positioning the knife in the clamp is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
positioning the knife in the clamp is
called<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.430> depth<00:00:38.640> key<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.510> little

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
called the depth key it's this little

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.860 
called the depth key it's this little
key<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.050> this<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.100> plugs<00:00:41.370> into<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
key like this and it plugs into the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.590 
key like this and it plugs into the
clamp<00:00:43.140> on<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.620> left<00:00:43.829> side<00:00:44.100> you'll<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
clamp on the left side you'll see if you

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.279 
clamp on the left side you'll see if you
zoom<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.260> bit<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:48.110> you'll<00:00:49.110> see

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
zoom in a little bit here you'll see

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
zoom in a little bit here you'll see
that<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.530> are<00:00:49.620> four<00:00:49.860> holes<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.899> that<00:00:51.899> gives

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that there are four holes and that gives

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.110 
that there are four holes and that gives
us<00:00:52.260> two<00:00:52.500> positions<00:00:52.949> basically<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.489> top<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.030> a

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
us two positions basically a top and a

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
us two positions basically a top and a
bottom<00:00:54.239> position<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.949> for<00:00:56.309> knives<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> are

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
bottom position and for knives that are

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.209 
bottom position and for knives that are
from<00:00:57.660> spine<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.140> edge<00:00:58.289> minute<00:00:58.739> or<00:00:58.829> less<00:00:58.980> than

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
from spine to edge minute or less than

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.279 
from spine to edge minute or less than
an<00:00:59.309> inch<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> use<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.969> top<00:01:00.149> holes<00:01:00.420> if<00:01:01.050> they're

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
an inch I use the top holes if they're

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
an inch I use the top holes if they're
wider<00:01:01.500> than<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.190> use<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> bottom

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
wider than that then I use the bottom

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.969 
wider than that then I use the bottom
set<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.390> holes<00:01:03.570> so<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.409> our<00:01:04.500> depth<00:01:04.739> key

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
set of holes so this is our depth key

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.120 
set of holes so this is our depth key
our<00:01:05.790> other<00:01:06.030> tool<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.960> our<00:01:07.860> alignment

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
our other tool here is our alignment

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.750 
our other tool here is our alignment
guide<00:01:08.689> and<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.979> designed<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.460> work<00:01:11.580> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
guide and that is designed to work in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.510 
guide and that is designed to work in
conjunction<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> depth<00:01:12.840> key<00:01:13.369> just<00:01:14.369> by

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
conjunction with the depth key just by

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.520 
conjunction with the depth key just by
plugging<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.360> depth<00:01:15.869> key<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> two

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
plugging in the depth key to the two

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.810 
plugging in the depth key to the two
holes<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.920> back<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.250> alignment<00:01:17.670> guide

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
holes in the back of the alignment guide

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.660 
snug it up with the top screw I'll pull
this<00:01:41.250> out<00:01:42.560> now<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> lot<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.040> people<00:01:44.280> ask<00:01:44.460> about

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
this out now a lot of people ask about

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.819 
this out now a lot of people ask about
angle<00:01:45.329> changing<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.930> why<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.140> might<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
angle changing and why you might get a

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.080 
angle changing and why you might get a
wider<00:01:47.159> bevel<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.909> tip<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> knife<00:01:48.689> and

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
wider bevel on the tip of a knife and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.580 
wider bevel on the tip of a knife and
there's<00:01:50.450> two<00:01:50.630> things<00:01:50.869> really<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.320> are<00:01:51.409> going

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
there's two things really that are going

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.350 
there's two things really that are going
on<00:01:51.770> with<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.399> first<00:01:52.640> thing<00:01:52.850> is<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.030> on<00:01:53.329> a

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
on with it the first thing is that on a

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.590 
on with it the first thing is that on a
curved<00:01:53.689> blade<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:55.430> stone<00:01:55.700> as<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:55.970> comes<00:01:56.420> along

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
curved blade the stone as it comes along

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.020 
curved blade the stone as it comes along
the<00:01:57.020> blade<00:01:57.649> of<00:01:57.799> the<00:01:57.860> knife<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.250> constantly

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the blade of the knife is constantly

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.160 
the blade of the knife is constantly
rotating<00:01:59.750> on<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.110> rod<00:02:00.380> in<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:01.100> curvature

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
rotating on this rod in the curvature

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.870 
rotating on this rod in the curvature
giving<00:02:03.170> it<00:02:03.259> a<00:02:03.350> new<00:02:03.530> plane<00:02:03.799> of<00:02:03.950> contact<00:02:04.430> which

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
giving it a new plane of contact which

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.859 
giving it a new plane of contact which
means<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.329> angle<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:05.750> slightly

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
means that the angle is slightly

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:06.669 
means that the angle is slightly
different

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
different

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.440 
different
if<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.520> knife<00:02:07.670> has<00:02:07.850> pushed<00:02:08.060> all<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.300> way<00:02:08.360> to

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
if the knife has pushed all the way to

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.140 
if the knife has pushed all the way to
the<00:02:08.630> front<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.200> means<00:02:09.470> that<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.220> angle<00:02:10.640> out<00:02:10.880> at

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
the front it means that the angle out at

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.370 
the front it means that the angle out at
the<00:02:11.269> front<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.630> going<00:02:11.750> to<00:02:11.810> be<00:02:11.900> more<00:02:12.050> acute

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
the front is going to be more acute

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.890 
the front is going to be more acute
which<00:02:12.950> will<00:02:13.130> give<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.400> wider<00:02:13.610> bevel<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
which will give you a wider bevel if the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.420 
which will give you a wider bevel if the
tip<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.319> knife<00:02:15.470> is<00:02:15.680> pushed<00:02:15.950> further<00:02:16.130> back

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
tip of the knife is pushed further back

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.759 
tip of the knife is pushed further back
and<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.819> curve<00:02:17.060> is<00:02:17.360> closer<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> clamp

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
and the curve is closer to the clamp

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.680 
and the curve is closer to the clamp
you'll<00:02:19.459> get<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:19.670> more<00:02:19.940> acute<00:02:20.239> you'll<00:02:20.510> get<00:02:20.660> a

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
you'll get a more acute you'll get a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.500 
you'll get a more acute you'll get a
more<00:02:20.900> Tuesday<00:02:21.410> by<00:02:21.650> me<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.150> have<00:02:23.150> a<00:02:23.180> smaller

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
more Tuesday by me and have a smaller

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.740 
more Tuesday by me and have a smaller
bevel<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:25.160> theory<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.510> knife

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
bevel so in theory of that if the knife

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.770 
bevel so in theory of that if the knife
were<00:02:26.930> actually<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.319> straight<00:02:27.620> blade<00:02:27.860> like<00:02:28.100> this

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
were actually a straight blade like this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.449 
were actually a straight blade like this
extending<00:02:29.780> out<00:02:29.900> even<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.319> you<00:02:30.650> know<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.980> mile

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
extending out even to you know a mile

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.090 
extending out even to you know a mile
the<00:02:32.180> angle<00:02:32.510> change<00:02:32.750> there<00:02:33.590> wouldn't<00:02:33.830> be<00:02:33.860> any

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
the angle change there wouldn't be any

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.680 
the angle change there wouldn't be any
angle<00:02:34.250> change<00:02:34.670> but<00:02:35.269> because<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.630> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
angle change but because of the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.110 
angle change but because of the
curvature<00:02:35.959> and<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.950> stones<00:02:37.220> rotating<00:02:37.880> on<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
curvature and the stones rotating on the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870 
curvature and the stones rotating on the
rod<00:02:38.830> due<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> curvature<00:02:40.250> you<00:02:40.580> get<00:02:40.730> that

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
rod due to the curvature you get that

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.570 
rod due to the curvature you get that
slight<00:02:41.090> angle<00:02:41.420> change<00:02:41.690> so<00:02:42.349> this<00:02:43.040> technique<00:02:43.400> is

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
slight angle change so this technique is

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.309 
slight angle change so this technique is
just<00:02:43.790> going<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.000> show<00:02:44.120> us<00:02:44.269> how<00:02:44.780> do<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.959> find<00:02:45.170> our

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
just going to show us how do we find our

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.470 
just going to show us how do we find our
position<00:02:45.860> that's<00:02:46.160> optimum<00:02:46.700> for<00:02:46.880> our<00:02:46.970> knife<00:02:47.209> so

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
position that's optimum for our knife so

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.820 
position that's optimum for our knife so
that<00:02:47.510> we<00:02:47.720> end<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.930> with<00:02:47.989> an<00:02:48.230> even<00:02:48.380> better

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
that we end up with an even better

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.420 
that we end up with an even better
all<00:02:49.040> the<00:02:49.250> way<00:02:49.310> long<00:02:51.040> okay<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.160> first<00:02:52.310> thing

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
all the way long okay the first thing

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.160 
all the way long okay the first thing
we'll<00:02:52.670> do<00:02:52.819> is<00:02:52.849> just<00:02:53.299> color<00:02:53.480> in<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.750> bevel<00:02:54.049> with

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
we'll do is just color in the bevel with

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.110 
we'll do is just color in the bevel with
the<00:02:54.320> sharpie<00:02:54.709> marker<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.730> just<00:02:55.910> come

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
the sharpie marker and I just come

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.870 
the sharpie marker and I just come
straight<00:02:56.600> down<00:02:56.630> on<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.109> edge<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:58.519> around<00:02:58.820> the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
straight down on the edge and around the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.090 
straight down on the edge and around the
marker<00:02:59.209> along<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.720> that<00:03:00.109> does<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.380> pretty<00:03:00.829> nice

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
marker along and that does a pretty nice

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.370 
marker along and that does a pretty nice
job<00:03:01.400> of<00:03:01.609> just<00:03:01.850> cutting<00:03:02.090> the<00:03:02.359> bevel<00:03:02.690> itself<00:03:03.070> and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
job of just cutting the bevel itself and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.500 
job of just cutting the bevel itself and
then<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.650> take<00:03:06.799> the<00:03:06.920> stone<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:08.150> run<00:03:08.390> it

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
then I just take the stone and I run it

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.720 
then I just take the stone and I run it
along<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> length<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:09.109> the<00:03:09.170> blade<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:10.489> see

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
along the length of the blade to see

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.670 
along the length of the blade to see
where<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.030> tracking<00:03:11.569> if<00:03:12.140> we<00:03:12.290> can<00:03:12.440> zoom

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
where it's tracking if we can zoom

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.520 
where it's tracking if we can zoom
always<00:03:13.280> in<00:03:13.459> to<00:03:13.579> nice<00:03:13.819> and<00:03:14.000> tight<00:03:14.319> so<00:03:15.319> what<00:03:15.500> I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
always in to nice and tight so what I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.370 
always in to nice and tight so what I
want<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.829> look<00:03:15.980> at<00:03:16.160> here<00:03:16.430> is<00:03:16.780> I'm<00:03:17.780> observing

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
want to look at here is I'm observing

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.410 
want to look at here is I'm observing
how<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.590> marker<00:03:19.010> is<00:03:19.100> gone<00:03:19.340> up<00:03:19.880> at<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.209> edge

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
how the marker is gone up at the edge

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.160 
how the marker is gone up at the edge
back<00:03:20.810> towards<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.260> back<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.650> knife<00:03:22.030> but

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
back towards the back of the knife but

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.870 
back towards the back of the knife but
it's<00:03:24.170> still<00:03:24.440> all<00:03:24.859> along<00:03:25.100> the<00:03:25.250> edge<00:03:25.400> down<00:03:25.670> here

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
it's still all along the edge down here

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.789 
it's still all along the edge down here
in<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.030> curvature<00:03:26.299> and<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:26.959> only<00:03:27.260> removed

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
in the curvature and it's only removed

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.190 
in the curvature and it's only removed
on<00:03:28.100> the<00:03:28.160> shoulder<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.819> blade<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.780> what

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
on the shoulder of the blade and what

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.720 
on the shoulder of the blade and what
that<00:03:30.380> tells<00:03:30.560> me<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.250> knife<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.430> too

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
that tells me is that the knife is too

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.550 
that tells me is that the knife is too
far<00:03:31.970> forward<00:03:32.299> and<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:33.019> would<00:03:33.170> end<00:03:33.319> up<00:03:33.410> with<00:03:33.530> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
far forward and I would end up with a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.370 
far forward and I would end up with a
really<00:03:33.769> wide<00:03:33.980> bevel<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:35.060> position<00:03:35.569> so

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
really wide bevel in this position so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.860 
really wide bevel in this position so
what<00:03:36.530> I<00:03:36.560> would<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.430> just<00:03:38.329> put<00:03:38.569> the<00:03:38.690> depth

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
what I would do then just put the depth

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.210 
what I would do then just put the depth
key<00:03:39.049> back<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:40.810> loosen<00:03:41.810> up<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.079> sharpener<00:03:42.560> and

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
key back in loosen up the sharpener and

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.990 
key back in loosen up the sharpener and
move<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.910> knife<00:03:44.090> back<00:03:44.389> and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
move the knife back and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.390 
move the knife back and
just<00:03:46.840> look<00:03:46.960> for<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.110> optimum<00:03:47.650> position<00:03:48.100> in

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
just look for that optimum position in

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.070 
just look for that optimum position in
this<00:03:48.670> case<00:03:48.940> I<00:03:49.090> happen<00:03:49.210> to<00:03:49.360> know<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.750> because<00:03:50.020> I

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
this case I happen to know it because I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.170 
this case I happen to know it because I
experiment<00:03:50.590> a<00:03:50.680> little<00:03:50.800> bit<00:03:50.950> before<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.940> start

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
experiment a little bit before the start

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.520 
experiment a little bit before the start
of<00:03:52.210> the<00:03:52.300> video<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.720> see<00:03:52.780> what<00:03:53.140> was<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.380> right

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
of the video to see what was the right

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.120 
of the video to see what was the right
position<00:03:53.980> so<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.670> put<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.120> alignment<00:03:55.600> guide<00:03:55.750> on

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
position so I put the alignment guide on

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.550 
position so I put the alignment guide on
stick<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.250> knife<00:03:57.400> back<00:03:57.580> in<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.850> clamp<00:03:58.150> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
stick the knife back in the clamp and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.280 
stick the knife back in the clamp and
align<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.740> to<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:01.210> tick<00:04:01.420> mark<00:04:01.630> just<00:04:01.840> past<00:04:02.050> a

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
align it to the tick mark just past a

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.460 
align it to the tick mark just past a
which<00:04:02.650> I<00:04:02.770> call<00:04:03.010> 8.5<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.330> go<00:04:04.810> ahead<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:04.990> snug<00:04:05.260> up

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
which I call 8.5 I go ahead and snug up

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.800 
which I call 8.5 I go ahead and snug up
the<00:04:06.430> clamp<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.970> then<00:04:07.090> crank<00:04:07.390> it<00:04:07.510> down<00:04:07.540> on<00:04:07.750> the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
the clamp and then crank it down on the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.480 
the clamp and then crank it down on the
bottom<00:04:09.390> pull<00:04:10.390> the<00:04:10.510> tools<00:04:10.780> out<00:04:11.190> I'll<00:04:12.190> show<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
bottom pull the tools out I'll show you

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.140 
bottom pull the tools out I'll show you
how<00:04:12.959> now<00:04:13.959> when<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> color<00:04:14.470> in<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.709> bevel<00:04:15.150> the

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
how now when I color in the bevel the

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.170 
how now when I color in the bevel the
stone<00:04:16.420> will<00:04:16.630> take<00:04:16.870> the<00:04:17.230> marker<00:04:18.180> equidistant

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
stone will take the marker equidistant

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.340 
stone will take the marker equidistant
from<00:04:19.209> the<00:04:19.419> edge<00:04:19.600> all<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.870> way<00:04:20.049> down<00:04:20.200> the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
from the edge all the way down the

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:30.959 
from the edge all the way down the
length

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:30.969 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:32.639 

you<00:04:31.539> can<00:04:31.689> see<00:04:31.839> that<00:04:31.959> it's<00:04:32.079> taking<00:04:32.349> all<00:04:32.469> the

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:32.649 
you can see that it's taking all the

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:34.619 
you can see that it's taking all the
marker<00:04:32.979> off<00:04:33.129> all<00:04:33.759> the<00:04:33.999> way<00:04:34.089> from<00:04:34.239> the<00:04:34.360> shoulder

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
marker off all the way from the shoulder

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.659 
marker off all the way from the shoulder
to<00:04:34.749> the<00:04:34.779> edge<00:04:35.019> so<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.129> gives<00:04:36.309> me<00:04:36.429> a<00:04:36.489> lot<00:04:36.610> of

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
to the edge so that gives me a lot of

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.669 
to the edge so that gives me a lot of
confidence<00:04:37.029> that<00:04:37.419> I'm<00:04:38.049> going<00:04:38.229> to<00:04:38.289> end<00:04:38.409> up<00:04:38.529> with

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:38.679 
confidence that I'm going to end up with

00:04:38.679 --> 00:04:40.409 
confidence that I'm going to end up with
a<00:04:38.739> nice<00:04:38.949> even<00:04:39.189> bevel<00:04:39.669> down<00:04:39.999> the<00:04:40.119> length<00:04:40.269> of<00:04:40.360> the

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
a nice even bevel down the length of the

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.469 
a nice even bevel down the length of the
blade<00:04:40.629> I<00:04:40.929> take<00:04:41.499> that<00:04:41.709> setting<00:04:42.159> 8.5<00:04:42.909> and<00:04:43.239> I

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
blade I take that setting 8.5 and I

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.299 
blade I take that setting 8.5 and I
record<00:04:43.929> it<00:04:44.079> along<00:04:44.409> with<00:04:44.559> the<00:04:44.679> depth<00:04:44.919> setting

00:04:45.299 --> 00:04:45.309 
record it along with the depth setting

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.399 
record it along with the depth setting
which<00:04:45.549> is<00:04:45.579> the<00:04:45.819> top<00:04:45.999> set<00:04:46.239> of<00:04:46.329> holes<00:04:46.509> and<00:04:47.289> my

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
which is the top set of holes and my

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.439 
which is the top set of holes and my
angles<00:04:47.769> which<00:04:47.889> are<00:04:48.009> 20<00:04:48.279> degrees<00:04:48.369> and<00:04:48.939> that

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
angles which are 20 degrees and that

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:50.879 
angles which are 20 degrees and that
tells<00:04:49.719> me<00:04:49.779> that<00:04:49.869> next<00:04:50.199> time<00:04:50.319> I<00:04:50.439> sharpen<00:04:50.769> this

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
tells me that next time I sharpen this

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.189 
tells me that next time I sharpen this
knife<00:04:50.949> all<00:04:51.879> I<00:04:51.939> have<00:04:52.089> to<00:04:52.209> do<00:04:52.329> is<00:04:52.449> put<00:04:52.839> it<00:04:52.929> back<00:04:53.049> in

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
knife all I have to do is put it back in

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.449 
knife all I have to do is put it back in
the<00:04:53.259> clamp<00:04:53.499> top<00:04:54.009> holes<00:04:54.309> 20<00:04:54.819> degrees<00:04:56.099> 8.5<00:04:57.099> and

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:57.459 
the clamp top holes 20 degrees 8.5 and

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:59.429 
the clamp top holes 20 degrees 8.5 and
my<00:04:57.969> touch<00:04:58.179> up<00:04:58.360> will<00:04:58.479> be<00:04:58.599> just<00:04:58.869> a<00:04:58.959> breeze<00:04:59.229> I'll

00:04:59.429 --> 00:04:59.439 
my touch up will be just a breeze I'll

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:01.309 
my touch up will be just a breeze I'll
be<00:04:59.559> starting<00:04:59.919> right<00:05:00.159> where<00:05:00.309> I<00:05:00.339> left<00:05:00.399> off<00:05:00.729> again

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
be starting right where I left off again

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:05.129 
be starting right where I left off again
so<00:05:02.819> from<00:05:03.819> here<00:05:03.999> it's<00:05:04.209> pretty<00:05:04.389> simple<00:05:04.809> just

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
so from here it's pretty simple just

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:10.739 
so from here it's pretty simple just
grab<00:05:05.379> my<00:05:05.559> 400<00:05:06.009> grit<00:05:06.159> stones<00:05:09.269> and<00:05:10.269> just<00:05:10.569> work

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:10.749 
grab my 400 grit stones and just work

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:13.100 
grab my 400 grit stones and just work
back<00:05:10.959> and<00:05:11.199> forth<00:05:11.379> from<00:05:11.799> side<00:05:12.069> to<00:05:12.129> side<00:05:12.459> like

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
back and forth from side to side like

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:19.109 
back and forth from side to side like
this<00:05:14.879> and<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:17.229> can<00:05:17.499> see<00:05:17.649> right<00:05:17.860> away<00:05:17.979> that<00:05:18.119> the

00:05:19.109 --> 00:05:19.119 
this and I can see right away that the

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:20.579 
this and I can see right away that the
marker<00:05:19.509> has<00:05:19.569> gone<00:05:19.779> all<00:05:20.019> the<00:05:20.110> way<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.229> the<00:05:20.409> edge

00:05:20.579 --> 00:05:20.589 
marker has gone all the way to the edge

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:23.729 
marker has gone all the way to the edge
and<00:05:20.919> so<00:05:21.879> my<00:05:21.999> next<00:05:22.269> step<00:05:22.419> is<00:05:22.449> to<00:05:22.779> say<00:05:22.959> well<00:05:23.169> the

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:23.739 
and so my next step is to say well the

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.009 
and so my next step is to say well the
markers<00:05:24.039> donnelly<00:05:24.519> to<00:05:24.579> edge<00:05:24.879> I'm<00:05:25.269> pretty<00:05:25.869> sure

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:26.019 
markers donnelly to edge I'm pretty sure

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:27.449 
markers donnelly to edge I'm pretty sure
I've<00:05:26.110> created<00:05:26.379> my<00:05:26.619> bevels<00:05:27.009> the<00:05:27.099> way<00:05:27.219> I<00:05:27.249> need

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:27.459 
I've created my bevels the way I need

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.759 
I've created my bevels the way I need
them<00:05:27.610> so<00:05:28.119> I'm<00:05:28.419> going<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.659> just<00:05:28.929> check<00:05:29.469> for<00:05:29.679> the

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:29.769 
them so I'm going to just check for the

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:32.179 
them so I'm going to just check for the
presence<00:05:30.489> of<00:05:30.579> a<00:05:30.669> burr<00:05:30.879> to<00:05:31.479> make<00:05:31.629> sure<00:05:31.809> that

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
presence of a burr to make sure that

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:34.499 
presence of a burr to make sure that
Aeons<00:05:33.189> is<00:05:33.369> visually<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:33.819> really<00:05:34.089> have<00:05:34.269> reached

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
Aeons is visually I really have reached

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:36.629 
Aeons is visually I really have reached
the<00:05:34.629> edge<00:05:34.809> so<00:05:35.409> I'll<00:05:35.499> pick<00:05:35.919> on<00:05:36.039> one<00:05:36.219> side<00:05:36.429> for

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
the edge so I'll pick on one side for

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.850 
the edge so I'll pick on one side for
just<00:05:36.699> a<00:05:36.909> minute<00:05:37.209> and<00:05:38.110> do<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.379> series<00:05:38.800> of

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
just a minute and do a series of

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.460 
just a minute and do a series of
scrubbing<00:05:39.339> strokes<00:05:39.729> like<00:05:39.909> this

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.830 

and<00:05:44.980> then<00:05:45.160> I'll<00:05:45.280> check<00:05:45.550> to<00:05:45.880> see<00:05:46.120> on<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.570> side

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
and then I'll check to see on the side

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.690 
and then I'll check to see on the side
opposite<00:05:47.380> of<00:05:47.440> what<00:05:47.560> I've<00:05:47.650> been<00:05:47.740> sharpening<00:05:47.980> if

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
opposite of what I've been sharpening if

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.550 
opposite of what I've been sharpening if
there's<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.060> burr<00:05:49.240> form<00:05:49.510> yet<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:50.200> what<00:05:50.290> I<00:05:50.320> do<00:05:50.410> is

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
there's a burr form yet and what I do is

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.380 
there's a burr form yet and what I do is
I<00:05:50.620> just<00:05:50.650> run<00:05:50.920> my<00:05:50.950> fingernail<00:05:51.580> up<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.180> length

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
I just run my fingernail up the length

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.140 
I just run my fingernail up the length
of<00:05:52.570> the<00:05:52.630> blade<00:05:52.750> like<00:05:53.350> this<00:05:53.850> until<00:05:54.850> I<00:05:54.880> hit<00:05:55.000> the

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
of the blade like this until I hit the

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.660 
of the blade like this until I hit the
edge<00:05:55.360> and<00:05:55.600> see<00:05:55.660> if<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:55.960> snags<00:05:56.410> and<00:05:57.310> it's

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:57.670 
edge and see if it snags and it's

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:02.070 
edge and see if it snags and it's
snagging<00:05:58.150> all<00:05:58.360> along<00:05:59.110> here<00:06:00.480> very<00:06:01.480> nicely<00:06:01.750> so

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
snagging all along here very nicely so

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.770 
snagging all along here very nicely so
that<00:06:02.260> tells<00:06:02.500> me<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.920> I've<00:06:03.610> got<00:06:03.850> the<00:06:04.600> two

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
that tells me that I've got the two

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.600 
that tells me that I've got the two
bevels<00:06:05.140> ground<00:06:05.380> and<00:06:05.680> I<00:06:05.740> know<00:06:05.800> that<00:06:06.040> this<00:06:06.250> bevel

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
bevels ground and I know that this bevel

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.430 
bevels ground and I know that this bevel
reaches<00:06:07.240> the<00:06:07.330> edge<00:06:07.510> and<00:06:07.720> has<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> little<00:06:08.140> curled

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
reaches the edge and has a little curled

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.770 
reaches the edge and has a little curled
metal<00:06:08.770> hanging<00:06:09.070> over<00:06:09.340> so<00:06:10.000> I<00:06:10.030> verify<00:06:10.450> the<00:06:10.510> same

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
metal hanging over so I verify the same

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.020 
metal hanging over so I verify the same
thing<00:06:10.990> on<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.200> opposite<00:06:11.560> side<00:06:11.830> do<00:06:12.760> a<00:06:12.790> few

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
thing on the opposite side do a few

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:21.010 
thing on the opposite side do a few
strokes<00:06:13.270> back<00:06:13.570> and<00:06:13.810> forth<00:06:13.990> like<00:06:14.080> this

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.530 

and<00:06:21.260> then<00:06:21.680> check<00:06:21.920> the<00:06:22.460> opposite<00:06:23.090> side<00:06:23.270> for<00:06:23.510> a

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
and then check the opposite side for a

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.990 
and then check the opposite side for a
burr<00:06:23.720> and<00:06:24.050> it's<00:06:24.500> it's<00:06:25.070> very<00:06:25.160> obvious<00:06:25.820> very

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
burr and it's it's very obvious very

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.380 
burr and it's it's very obvious very
pronounced<00:06:26.450> purr

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
pronounced purr

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.210 
pronounced purr
okay<00:06:29.390> so<00:06:29.450> now<00:06:29.660> I<00:06:29.690> know<00:06:29.870> that<00:06:30.020> both<00:06:30.710> my<00:06:30.860> bevels

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
okay so now I know that both my bevels

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.400 
okay so now I know that both my bevels
meet<00:06:31.520> and<00:06:31.970> all<00:06:32.480> I<00:06:32.510> have<00:06:32.660> to<00:06:32.780> do<00:06:32.870> is<00:06:32.960> polish<00:06:33.200> the

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
meet and all I have to do is polish the

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.830 
meet and all I have to do is polish the
edge<00:06:33.670> so<00:06:34.670> I'll<00:06:34.760> do<00:06:34.880> a<00:06:34.940> few<00:06:35.150> more<00:06:35.300> strokes<00:06:35.540> with

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
edge so I'll do a few more strokes with

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.090 
edge so I'll do a few more strokes with
my<00:06:35.990> 400<00:06:36.440> grit<00:06:36.530> stones<00:06:38.470> this<00:06:39.470> point<00:06:39.770> I<00:06:39.800> go<00:06:39.950> back

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
my 400 grit stones this point I go back

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.100 
my 400 grit stones this point I go back
to<00:06:40.220> the<00:06:40.310> alternating<00:06:40.760> strokes<00:06:41.060> left<00:06:41.930> and

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:42.110 
to the alternating strokes left and

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:47.790 
to the alternating strokes left and
right<00:06:42.260> back<00:06:42.590> and<00:06:42.740> forth

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.710 

and<00:06:48.800> that<00:06:49.130> should<00:06:49.310> do<00:06:49.460> it<00:06:49.490> look<00:06:50.330> at<00:06:50.450> the<00:06:50.570> edge

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
and that should do it look at the edge

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.510 
and that should do it look at the edge
looks<00:06:51.080> very<00:06:51.320> beautiful<00:06:51.500> nice<00:06:52.190> scratch

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 
looks very beautiful nice scratch

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.030 
looks very beautiful nice scratch
pattern<00:06:52.760> flip<00:06:53.660> the<00:06:53.780> stones<00:06:54.020> over<00:06:54.230> to<00:06:54.470> the<00:06:54.590> 600

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:55.040 
pattern flip the stones over to the 600

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:11.510 
pattern flip the stones over to the 600
grit<00:06:55.070> side<00:06:55.430> and<00:06:56.240> just<00:06:56.540> finish<00:06:56.780> polishing

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.570 

okay<00:07:12.520> and<00:07:13.389> that<00:07:13.539> should<00:07:13.750> be<00:07:13.930> really<00:07:14.370> nice<00:07:15.370> and

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
okay and that should be really nice and

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.480 
okay and that should be really nice and
sharp<00:07:15.789> now<00:07:16.860> so<00:07:17.860> I'll<00:07:17.949> pop<00:07:18.130> it<00:07:18.280> out<00:07:18.340> of<00:07:18.400> the

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:18.490 
sharp now so I'll pop it out of the

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:32.469 
sharp now so I'll pop it out of the
clamp<00:07:18.729> and<00:07:18.940> we'll<00:07:19.090> have<00:07:19.210> a<00:07:19.240> look

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 

00:07:32.479 --> 00:07:36.439 

okay<00:07:33.479> so<00:07:33.810> this<00:07:34.020> is<00:07:34.169> 600<00:07:34.710> grit<00:07:35.270> I'm<00:07:36.270> going<00:07:36.389> to

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:36.449 
okay so this is 600 grit I'm going to

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:37.670 
okay so this is 600 grit I'm going to
just<00:07:36.600> slash<00:07:36.780> it<00:07:36.960> right<00:07:37.139> through<00:07:37.319> it<00:07:37.440> really

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
just slash it right through it really

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.029 
just slash it right through it really
nicely<00:07:38.360> something<00:07:39.360> to<00:07:39.419> note<00:07:39.630> is<00:07:39.870> that<00:07:39.900> my<00:07:40.349> 600

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 
nicely something to note is that my 600

00:07:41.039 --> 00:07:43.040 
nicely something to note is that my 600
grit<00:07:41.130> stones<00:07:41.490> have<00:07:42.270> been<00:07:42.300> in<00:07:42.509> used<00:07:42.690> for<00:07:42.870> a<00:07:42.900> long

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.050 
grit stones have been in used for a long

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.589 
grit stones have been in used for a long
time<00:07:43.319> I've<00:07:43.800> probably<00:07:44.550> sharpened<00:07:44.940> over<00:07:45.090> 1200

00:07:45.589 --> 00:07:45.599 
time I've probably sharpened over 1200

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:47.480 
time I've probably sharpened over 1200
knives<00:07:45.750> of<00:07:45.990> them<00:07:46.139> I'm<00:07:46.650> getting<00:07:47.069> ready<00:07:47.340> to<00:07:47.400> take

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:47.490 
knives of them I'm getting ready to take

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 
likely and the more I use them the more

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.680 
likely and the more I use them the more
I<00:07:52.710> like<00:07:52.919> them<00:07:53.130> when<00:07:53.849> the<00:07:54.060> stones<00:07:54.330> are<00:07:54.479> brand

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:54.690

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:56.480 
I like them when the stones are brand
new<00:07:54.810> out<00:07:54.930> of<00:07:54.960> the<00:07:55.080> box<00:07:55.139> they're<00:07:55.860> rougher<00:07:56.310> and

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:56.490

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.500 
they won't put quite as much of a polish

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.409 
they won't put quite as much of a polish
on<00:07:58.650> here<00:07:58.889> so<00:07:59.490> you<00:07:59.520> won't<00:07:59.849> be<00:07:59.940> getting<00:08:00.060> an<00:08:00.270> edge
