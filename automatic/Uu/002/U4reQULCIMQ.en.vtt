going<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.860> image<00:01:20.430> zero<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
going on here is that image zero and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270 
going on here is that image zero and
there's<00:01:21.780> basically<00:01:22.110> our<00:01:22.290> initial<00:01:22.680> sprite<00:01:23.009> and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
there's basically our initial sprite and

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.539 
there's basically our initial sprite and
this<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> 16<00:01:24.330> by<00:01:24.420> 32<00:01:24.810> sprite<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:26.400> just

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this is a 16 by 32 sprite and it's just

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
this is a 16 by 32 sprite and it's just
facing<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.939> direction<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.780> mean<00:01:28.740> there's

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
facing one direction so I mean there's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.560 
facing one direction so I mean there's
not<00:01:28.979> really<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.220> whole<00:01:29.400> bunch<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> do<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:30.329> but

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
not really a whole bunch to do here but

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.130 
not really a whole bunch to do here but
I<00:01:30.780> guess<00:01:31.020> one<00:01:31.259> thing<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.890> mention<00:01:32.689> is<00:01:33.689> if<00:01:34.049> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
I guess one thing to mention is if you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.719 
I guess one thing to mention is if you
want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.770> various<00:01:35.100> movements<00:01:35.369> and

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
want to have like various movements and

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.620 
want to have like various movements and
stuff<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.060> say<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.390> running

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
stuff like say you have a running

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
stuff like say you have a running
animation<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.560> could<00:01:37.740> have<00:01:37.829> various<00:01:38.220> frames

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
animation you could have various frames

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.330 
animation you could have various frames
here<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.970> stuff<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.810> sprite<00:01:40.340> but

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
here and stuff in this one sprite but

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.830 
here and stuff in this one sprite but
what<00:01:41.520> you'd<00:01:41.670> need<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.270> just<00:01:42.420> go<00:01:42.570> inside

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
what you'd need to do is just go inside

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.149 
what you'd need to do is just go inside
of<00:01:42.869> here<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.290> configure<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.799> your

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
of here and configure that in your

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.830 
of here and configure that in your
movements<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.970> we'll<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.689> in

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
movements and we'll get into that in

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.679 
movements and we'll get into that in
just<00:01:46.020> a<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.329> important

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
just a bit here but a really important

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
just a bit here but a really important
thing<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.170> well<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.710> you'll<00:01:50.009> notice<00:01:50.310> my

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
thing to do as well is you'll notice my

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.490 
thing to do as well is you'll notice my
origin<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> way<00:01:51.780> over<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.470> my

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
origin is all the way over here on my

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.429 
origin is all the way over here on my
player<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.149> specifically<00:01:54.149> 9<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.630> 17<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
player and specifically 9 by 17 and the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
player and specifically 9 by 17 and the
reason<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.670> need<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> set<00:01:57.180> once

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
reason for that is we need a set once

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.760 
reason for that is we need a set once
you've<00:01:57.719> created<00:01:57.869> your<00:01:58.020> character<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.619> need

you've created your character you need

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.730 
you've created your character you need
to<00:01:58.860> set<00:01:59.070> your<00:01:59.250> origin<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.329> where<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.500> arm

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
to set your origin to where the arm

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.200 
to set your origin to where the arm
we're<00:02:02.040> basically<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:02.549> his<00:02:02.700> arm<00:02:02.909> slash

the only thing you need to be aware of
is<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.489> origin<00:02:39.000> yet<00:02:39.150> again<00:02:39.420> I<00:02:39.450> know<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
is the origin yet again I know the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.530 
is the origin yet again I know the
origin<00:02:40.640> wherever<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:41.760> said<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.090> origin

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
origin wherever you said this origin

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.479 
origin wherever you said this origin
will<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.290> where<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:43.950> arm<00:02:44.129> is<00:02:44.250> going<00:02:44.370> to

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
will be where this arm is going to

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.970 
will be where this arm is going to
connect<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:46.170> player<00:02:46.410> wherever<00:02:46.709> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
connect to the player wherever the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.430 
connect to the player wherever the
player's<00:02:47.190> origin<00:02:47.640> is<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.299> let's<00:02:48.959> go<00:02:49.049> ahead<00:02:49.170> and

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
player's origin is so let's go ahead and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.449 
player's origin is so let's go ahead and
set<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.830> back<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.099> one<00:02:50.730> by<00:02:51.330> three<00:02:52.370> there<00:02:53.370> we

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
set that back to one by three there we

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:53.780 
set that back to one by three there we
go

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
go

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.670 
go
so<00:02:54.060> since<00:02:54.329> it's<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:54.660> way<00:02:54.720> over<00:02:54.930> here<00:02:55.200> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
so since it's all the way over here it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.410 
so since it's all the way over here it's
going<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.950> connect<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.370> this<00:02:56.610> little<00:02:57.030> point

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
going to connect it this little point

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.229 
going to connect it this little point
right<00:02:57.569> here<00:02:57.750> onto<00:02:57.989> my<00:02:58.560> players<00:02:58.799> origin<00:02:59.280> so

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
right here onto my players origin so

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
right here onto my players origin so
that's<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.750> something<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.079> be<00:03:01.170> aware<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.410> and

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
that's just something to be aware of and

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.130 
that's just something to be aware of and
now<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.549> experience<00:03:02.910> core<00:03:03.209> bullet<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.989> is

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
now the experience core bullet this is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.860 
now the experience core bullet this is
just<00:03:04.290> a<00:03:04.319> simple<00:03:04.590> 4<00:03:04.860> by<00:03:05.040> 4<00:03:05.310> block<00:03:05.599> red<00:03:06.599> block<00:03:06.840> I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
just a simple 4 by 4 block red block I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.470 
just a simple 4 by 4 block red block I
guess<00:03:07.170> I'll<00:03:07.680> go<00:03:07.860> and<00:03:08.069> add<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.239> course

and do whatever you want to with these
with<00:03:12.120> these<00:03:12.239> bullets<00:03:12.630> here<00:03:12.810> doesn't<00:03:13.140> matter

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
with these bullets here doesn't matter

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.229 
with these bullets here doesn't matter
and<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> origin<00:03:13.980> doesn't<00:03:14.640> need<00:03:14.819> to<00:03:14.910> be<00:03:15.000> set

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
and the origin doesn't need to be set

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.479 
and the origin doesn't need to be set
thank<00:03:15.540> goodness<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.560> no<00:03:16.890> need<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.160> worry<00:03:17.310> about

now one thing you do want to do is

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.309 
now one thing you do want to do is
obviously<00:03:22.889> set<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.579> player<00:03:23.760> sprite<00:03:24.150> here<00:03:24.420> but

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
obviously set the player sprite here but

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.140 
obviously set the player sprite here but
in<00:03:25.560> this<00:03:25.709> step<00:03:25.920> event<00:03:26.069> I<00:03:26.430> mean<00:03:26.700> though<00:03:26.819> there's

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
in this step event I mean though there's

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.449 
in this step event I mean though there's
a<00:03:27.269> code<00:03:27.720> block<00:03:28.049> and<00:03:28.350> he's<00:03:28.440> stopped<00:03:28.709> saying<00:03:28.920> all

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
a code block and he's stopped saying all

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.319 
a code block and he's stopped saying all
the<00:03:29.579> time<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.200> basically<00:03:31.730> what<00:03:32.730> we<00:03:32.880> have<00:03:33.090> this

simple<00:04:15.900> movement<00:04:16.229> because<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.739> a

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
simple movement because this is a

simple movement because this is a
tutorial<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.370> didn't<00:04:17.549> want<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.760> get<00:04:17.849> too

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
tutorial I didn't want to get too

tutorial I didn't want to get too
advanced<00:04:18.269> same<00:04:19.019> thing<00:04:19.200> in<00:04:19.289> here<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:19.680> it's

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
advanced same thing in here but it's

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.460 
advanced same thing in here but it's
just<00:04:19.950> plus<00:04:20.400> equals<00:04:20.760> 3<00:04:21.000> so<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.140> going<00:04:22.289> to<00:04:22.409> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
just plus equals 3 so it's going to the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.040 
just plus equals 3 so it's going to the
right<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.849> that's<00:04:24.210> all<00:04:24.300> we<00:04:24.390> wanted<00:04:24.599> you<00:04:24.780> for

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.210 
our player pretty simple right now we're
go<00:04:27.300> ahead<00:04:27.479> and<00:04:27.660> go<00:04:27.720> into<00:04:27.870> our<00:04:28.050> obj<00:04:28.740> underscore

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
go ahead and go into our obj underscore

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.370 
go ahead and go into our obj underscore
player<00:04:29.460> underscore<00:04:29.820> armed<00:04:30.030> object<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.840> in

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
player underscore armed object and in

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.040 
player underscore armed object and in
here<00:04:32.130> in<00:04:32.639> this<00:04:32.789> step<00:04:32.940> event<00:04:33.090> we<00:04:33.300> have<00:04:33.419> two<00:04:33.690> code

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
here in this step event we have two code

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.960 
here in this step event we have two code
blocks<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.770> these<00:04:35.460> are<00:04:35.610> pretty<00:04:35.789> much<00:04:35.910> just

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
blocks and these are pretty much just

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.900 
blocks and these are pretty much just
setting<00:04:36.509> up<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.960> whole<00:04:37.949> movement<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:38.820> the

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
setting up the whole movement for the

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.150 
setting up the whole movement for the
arm<00:04:39.090> itself<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.289> directional<00:04:40.860> stuff

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
arm itself and the directional stuff

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.680 
arm itself and the directional stuff
like<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.520> so<00:04:41.759> you<00:04:41.820> don't<00:04:42.030> really<00:04:42.270> want<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.570> go

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
like that so you don't really want to go

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.060 
like that so you don't really want to go
in<00:04:42.780> here<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.020> mess<00:04:43.289> with<00:04:43.440> anything<00:04:43.860> per<00:04:44.039> se

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
in here and mess with anything per se

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.129 
in here and mess with anything per se
you<00:04:44.910> just<00:04:45.060> want<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.270> leave<00:04:45.419> it<00:04:45.570> how<00:04:45.780> it<00:04:45.810> is<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
you just want to leave it how it is and

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.080 
you just want to leave it how it is and
I<00:04:46.530> do<00:04:46.590> really<00:04:46.800> want<00:04:46.919> a<00:04:47.070> really<00:04:47.699> quick<00:04:47.820> one<00:04:47.940> and

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
I do really want a really quick one and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.379 
I do really want a really quick one and
say<00:04:48.210> I<00:04:48.389> did<00:04:48.900> get<00:04:49.020> some<00:04:49.229> of<00:04:49.320> this<00:04:49.410> code<00:04:49.680> offline

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
say I did get some of this code offline

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.129 
say I did get some of this code offline
because<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.419> was<00:04:51.600> having<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> little<00:04:52.020> problem

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
because I was having a little problem

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:53.960 
because I was having a little problem
with<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.440> direction<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:53.130> don't<00:04:53.310> know<00:04:53.550> if<00:04:53.699> I<00:04:53.789> was

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
with the direction I don't know if I was

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.150 
with the direction I don't know if I was
just<00:04:54.479> typing<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:54.990> out<00:04:55.080> wrong<00:04:55.320> or<00:04:55.470> whatever<00:04:55.620> but

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
just typing it out wrong or whatever but

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.499 
just typing it out wrong or whatever but
as<00:04:56.250> soon<00:04:56.400> as<00:04:56.460> I<00:04:56.550> just<00:04:56.580> pasted<00:04:57.150> what<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.389> was

as soon as I just pasted what I was

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.140 
as soon as I just pasted what I was
trying<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.960> get<00:04:58.139> down<00:04:58.259> and<00:04:58.560> work<00:04:59.039> so<00:04:59.370> I<00:04:59.610> mean

check out those if you like to but

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.680 
check out those if you like to but
unless<00:05:05.520> that's<00:05:05.699> all<00:05:05.940> that's<00:05:06.120> going<00:05:06.300> on<00:05:06.449> there

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
unless that's all that's going on there

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.600 
unless that's all that's going on there
so<00:05:06.810> another<00:05:06.990> thing<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.229> mess<00:05:07.560> with<00:05:07.740> what<00:05:08.550> you

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
so another thing to mess with what you

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.610 
so another thing to mess with what you
want<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.789> do<00:05:08.880> next<00:05:09.060> is<00:05:09.270> go<00:05:09.449> at<00:05:09.690> event<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.259> a

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
want to do next is go at event and a

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.129 
want to do next is go at event and a
mouse<00:05:10.889> and<00:05:10.919> grenoble<00:05:11.820> Mouse<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.360> global<00:05:12.960> left

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
mouse and grenoble Mouse and global left

mouse and grenoble Mouse and global left
button<00:05:13.470> or<00:05:13.889> excuse<00:05:14.400> me<00:05:14.520> left<00:05:14.820> pressed<00:05:16.280> and

button or excuse me left pressed and

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.279 
button or excuse me left pressed and
what<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.610> is<00:05:17.759> doing<00:05:17.970> is<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.990> difference

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
what this is doing is the difference

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.050 
what this is doing is the difference
between<00:05:19.320> gullible<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.430> left<00:05:20.639> press<00:05:20.849> and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
between gullible and left press and

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.580 
between gullible and left press and
regular<00:05:21.389> left<00:05:21.630> pressed<00:05:21.870> if<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.169> guys<00:05:22.320> are<00:05:22.560> a

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
regular left pressed if you guys are a

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.980 
regular left pressed if you guys are a
little<00:05:22.830> unfamiliar<00:05:23.370> as<00:05:23.550> global<00:05:24.419> is<00:05:24.660> like

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
little unfamiliar as global is like

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.800 
little unfamiliar as global is like
wherever<00:05:25.229> you<00:05:25.710> press<00:05:26.009> the<00:05:26.759> left<00:05:27.000> mouse<00:05:27.419> button

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:27.810 
wherever you press the left mouse button

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.589 
wherever you press the left mouse button
in<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.560> room<00:05:28.770> as<00:05:29.039> opposed<00:05:29.910> to<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.419> left

in the room as opposed to the left

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.089 
in the room as opposed to the left
button<00:05:30.840> would<00:05:31.050> be<00:05:31.229> just<00:05:31.530> like<00:05:31.650> clicking<00:05:32.010> on

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
button would be just like clicking on

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.770 
button would be just like clicking on
the<00:05:32.190> object<00:05:32.490> itself<00:05:32.580> so<00:05:32.940> wherever<00:05:33.449> you

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
the object itself so wherever you

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.529 
the object itself so wherever you
pressed<00:05:34.050> in<00:05:34.139> the<00:05:34.229> room<00:05:34.520> instance<00:05:35.520> create<00:05:35.820> X<00:05:36.060> Y

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
pressed in the room instance create X Y

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.659 
pressed in the room instance create X Y
obj<00:05:37.380> underscore<00:05:37.860> bola<00:05:38.070> so<00:05:38.250> this<00:05:38.400> is<00:05:38.460> going<00:05:38.550> to

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
obj underscore bola so this is going to

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.070 
obj underscore bola so this is going to
create<00:05:38.849> this<00:05:39.000> bullet<00:05:39.419> object<00:05:39.780> which<00:05:39.900> we'll

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
create this bullet object which we'll

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.409 
create this bullet object which we'll
get<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.229> in<00:05:40.349> just<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.830> bit<00:05:40.979> here<00:05:41.190> and<00:05:41.430> wherever

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
get to in just a bit here and wherever

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.420 
get to in just a bit here and wherever
you<00:05:42.720> click<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.470> mouse<00:05:43.590> that's<00:05:43.889> a<00:05:43.979> direction

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
you click the mouse that's a direction

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.610 
you click the mouse that's a direction
it's<00:05:44.729> it's<00:05:44.970> gonna<00:05:45.150> go<00:05:45.389> which<00:05:45.570> we'll<00:05:45.750> see<00:05:45.960> how

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
it's it's gonna go which we'll see how

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.779 
it's it's gonna go which we'll see how
that<00:05:46.680> works<00:05:46.949> in<00:05:47.070> just<00:05:47.099> a<00:05:47.280> sec<00:05:47.400> but<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:47.699> now

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
that works in just a sec but for now

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:50.180 
that works in just a sec but for now
we're<00:05:47.940> just<00:05:48.090> creating<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.539> bullet<00:05:48.919> and<00:05:49.919> in

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
we're just creating the bullet and in

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.740 
we're just creating the bullet and in
the<00:05:50.280> draw<00:05:50.550> we<00:05:50.760> have<00:05:50.849> another<00:05:51.000> code<00:05:51.210> block<00:05:51.419> and

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
the draw we have another code block and

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.469 
the draw we have another code block and
this<00:05:52.260> is<00:05:52.409> just<00:05:52.620> setting<00:05:52.830> up<00:05:53.099> the<00:05:53.479> basically

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
this is just setting up the basically

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:57.469 
this is just setting up the basically
the<00:05:54.630> sprite<00:05:55.139> for<00:05:55.530> our<00:05:56.070> player<00:05:56.520> slash<00:05:56.820> arm<00:05:57.120> and

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
the sprite for our player slash arm and

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.899 
the sprite for our player slash arm and
I<00:05:58.349> mean<00:05:58.860> nothing<00:05:58.979> again<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.669> don't<00:05:59.820> really

health as it's moving you just go into

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.140 
health as it's moving you just go into
here<00:06:25.979> into<00:06:26.070> this<00:06:26.220> 10<00:06:26.490> and<00:06:26.729> change<00:06:27.000> it<00:06:27.120> to

okay and one thing you might notice is
unlike<00:06:37.860> mine<00:06:38.130> here<00:06:38.520> my<00:06:38.669> player<00:06:39.120> in<00:06:39.270> arm<00:06:39.570> yours

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:40.289 
unlike mine here my player in arm yours

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:41.180 
unlike mine here my player in arm yours
will<00:06:40.409> be

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
will be

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.860 
will be
so<00:06:41.520> what<00:06:41.729> you<00:06:41.819> want<00:06:41.940> to<00:06:41.970> do<00:06:42.210> is<00:06:42.479> oh<00:06:42.690> really

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
so what you want to do is oh really

so what you want to do is oh really
quickly<00:06:43.199> one<00:06:43.319> thing<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.500> wanna<00:06:43.650> mention<00:06:43.680> too<00:06:43.949> is

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:44.220 
quickly one thing I wanna mention too is

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.920 
quickly one thing I wanna mention too is
the<00:06:44.610> depth<00:06:44.819> right<00:06:45.000> here<00:06:45.210> is<00:06:45.330> set<00:06:45.509> to<00:06:45.599> negative

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
the depth right here is set to negative

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.619 
the depth right here is set to negative
one<00:06:46.110> and<00:06:46.379> the<00:06:46.560> reason<00:06:46.770> for<00:06:46.889> that<00:06:46.949> is<00:06:47.629> the

00:06:48.619 --> 00:06:48.629 
one and the reason for that is the

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:50.749 
one and the reason for that is the
player<00:06:48.870> right<00:06:49.530> here<00:06:49.800> will<00:06:49.919> be<00:06:49.949> separate<00:06:50.430> and

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
player right here will be separate and

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.909 
player right here will be separate and
the<00:06:51.270> arm<00:06:51.479> because<00:06:51.930> it's<00:06:52.110> set<00:06:52.259> to<00:06:52.289> a<00:06:52.440> depth<00:06:52.800> of

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
the arm because it's set to a depth of

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.820 
the arm because it's set to a depth of
negative<00:06:53.310> one<00:06:53.490> will<00:06:54.330> automatically<00:06:55.080> just<00:06:55.560> go

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:55.830 
negative one will automatically just go

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.580 
negative one will automatically just go
like<00:06:56.729> above<00:06:57.300> the<00:06:57.479> player<00:06:57.690> so<00:06:58.050> that's<00:06:58.409> why

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
like above the player so that's why

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.409 
like above the player so that's why
that's<00:06:58.710> it<00:06:58.919> there<00:06:59.129> and<00:06:59.280> that<00:06:59.759> basically<00:07:00.270> you

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 
that's it there and that basically you

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:02.510 
that's it there and that basically you
want<00:07:00.569> to<00:07:00.659> as<00:07:00.750> I<00:07:00.900> just<00:07:01.139> showed<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:01.919> want<00:07:02.190> to<00:07:02.310> put
