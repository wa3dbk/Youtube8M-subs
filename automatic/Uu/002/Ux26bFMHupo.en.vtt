not<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.410> square-jawed<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.610> kind<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.790> thing

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
not so square-jawed that kind of thing

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.460 
not so square-jawed that kind of thing
and<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.450> version<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:27.780> we<00:02:27.870> came<00:02:28.050> up<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:28.290> we

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
and the version that we came up with we

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.809 
and the version that we came up with we
call<00:02:28.650> fists<00:02:28.980> on<00:02:29.099> hips<00:02:29.340> where<00:02:29.519> it's<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.790> of

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
call fists on hips where it's kind of

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.089 
call fists on hips where it's kind of
that<00:02:29.940> heroic<00:02:30.239> sort<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.660> he's<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.680> Captain

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
that heroic sort of he's the Captain

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.820 
that heroic sort of he's the Captain
America<00:02:32.130> but<00:02:33.060> not<00:02:33.300> so<00:02:33.660> stiff<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.680> he's<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
America but not so stiff that he's a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.920 
America but not so stiff that he's a
stick<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.220> mud<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.610> can't<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.880> fun<00:02:36.090> and

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
stick in the mud and can't have fun and

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.320 
stick in the mud and can't have fun and
that's<00:02:37.110> where<00:02:37.230> we<00:02:37.319> kind<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.560> finesse<00:02:37.769> it

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
that's where we kind of finesse it

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.390 
that's where we kind of finesse it
how<00:02:39.330> much<00:02:39.510> improv<00:02:40.049> is<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.220> it

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
how much improv is there or is it

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.630 
how much improv is there or is it
strictly<00:02:42.110> all<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.470> scripts<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.160> know<00:02:44.489> what

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
strictly all the scripts you know what

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.100 
strictly all the scripts you know what
it's<00:02:45.000> sometimes<00:02:45.569> with<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.810> original

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
it's sometimes with the original

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.059 
it's sometimes with the original
animation<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:46.560> don't<00:02:46.709> get<00:02:46.799> too<00:02:46.980> many

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
animation you don't get too many

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.530 
animation you don't get too many
opportunities<00:02:47.370> gonna<00:02:47.819> ad-lib<00:02:48.120> but<00:02:48.239> every<00:02:48.420> now

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
opportunities gonna ad-lib but every now

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
opportunities gonna ad-lib but every now
and<00:02:48.630> then<00:02:48.690> we<00:02:48.810> come<00:02:48.959> up<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.140> something<00:02:49.470> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
and then we come up with something and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.680 
and then we come up with something and
it's<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.370> good<00:02:50.549> but<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.600> know

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
it's and it's good but it's you know

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.780 
it's and it's good but it's you know
with<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> kids<00:02:52.980> show<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.459> kind<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.640> thing

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
with a kids show that kind of thing

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.100 
with a kids show that kind of thing
there's<00:02:54.030> there's<00:02:54.239> only<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.600> many<00:02:54.660> places<00:02:54.959> you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
there's there's only so many places you

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.720 
there's there's only so many places you
can<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.860> sometimes<00:02:56.069> it's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> little<00:02:56.459> too

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
can go and sometimes it's a little too

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.720 
can go and sometimes it's a little too
fast<00:02:57.060> or<00:02:57.390> you<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:58.739> we<00:02:58.830> don't<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.130> ton

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
fast or you know so we don't have a ton

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.039 
fast or you know so we don't have a ton
of<00:02:59.760> leeway<00:03:00.090> with<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.390> but<00:03:00.510> we<00:03:00.569> definitely<00:03:00.720> take

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
of leeway with it but we definitely take

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.839 
of leeway with it but we definitely take
some<00:03:01.200> liberties<00:03:01.290> here<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:01.769> there<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.099> and

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
some liberties here and there and and

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.670 
some liberties here and there and and
thankfully<00:03:03.330> that's<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.660> dynamic<00:03:03.930> of<00:03:04.230> working

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
thankfully that's the dynamic of working

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
us and get us to settle down and I would

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.590 
us and get us to settle down and I would
imagine<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.769> chemistry<00:03:20.609> helps<00:03:21.150> when<00:03:21.420> you're

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
imagine that chemistry helps when you're

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.479 
imagine that chemistry helps when you're
all<00:03:21.750> in<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.049> booth<00:03:22.230> because<00:03:22.680> it's<00:03:22.980> like<00:03:23.160> if<00:03:23.370> he

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
all in the booth because it's like if he

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.610 
all in the booth because it's like if he
hated<00:03:23.700> each<00:03:23.940> other<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.480> would<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:24.930> it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
hated each other then it would be it

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.949 
hated each other then it would be it
would<00:03:25.709> ruin<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.299> absolutely<00:03:27.299> it's<00:03:27.720> it

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
would ruin the absolutely it's it

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.599 
would ruin the absolutely it's it
creates<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.590> sort<00:03:28.769> of<00:03:28.829> weird<00:03:29.010> and<00:03:29.220> tangible

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
creates a sort of weird and tangible

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.890 
creates a sort of weird and tangible
energy<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:30.060> I<00:03:30.090> think<00:03:30.329> just<00:03:30.480> kind<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.720> comes

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
energy that I think just kind of comes

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.690 
energy that I think just kind of comes
through<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.739> it's<00:03:31.980> hard<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.280> say<00:03:32.430> whether<00:03:32.640> or

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
through and it's hard to say whether or

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.069 
through and it's hard to say whether or
not<00:03:32.790> it<00:03:33.030> really<00:03:33.090> makes<00:03:33.450> all<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.690> difference

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
not it really makes all that difference

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.780 
not it really makes all that difference
that<00:03:34.470> all<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.739> much<00:03:34.829> of<00:03:34.859> a<00:03:35.010> difference<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.519> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
that all that much of a difference but I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.910 
that all that much of a difference but I
certainly<00:03:36.480> think<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.900> does<00:03:37.049> because<00:03:37.620> we're

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
certainly think it does because we're

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.559 
certainly think it does because we're
there<00:03:38.190> getting<00:03:38.549> to<00:03:38.640> kind<00:03:38.760> of<00:03:38.850> feed<00:03:39.120> off<00:03:39.269> of<00:03:39.299> one

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
there getting to kind of feed off of one

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.960 
there getting to kind of feed off of one
another<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.170> thank<00:03:41.160> do<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.400> with<00:03:41.609> marbles
