00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.680
 public interest 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.470
 less than Tuesday morning 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.719
 Monday morning but those who came 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.910
 many more players saw up 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.679
 the field are 9 in total 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.330
 and they were busy with an Easter 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.180
 and stair exercise 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.160
 the keepers as always she had with no 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.199
 quiet were under fire 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.199
 by the goalkeeper trainers and their colleagues 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.099
 from nordin amrabat 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.420
 the training takes less than an hour 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.790
 attacker is still struggling with one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.170
 groin injury stopped earlier and was therefore possible 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.170
 taking a picture with his fans 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 the keepers in the meantime also had a chance 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 the finish 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.050
 not easy because he puts it there 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 goals down and so run into it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.070
 like ballora here on the other 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.539
 side 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.969
 jeroen sweet that it is hard to endure 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:06.750
 but soon Cassio Ramos too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:09.720
 and of course bas roorda itself and as we 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.560
 talking about keepers out there 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.600
 car stepped url yoda soul from gomez 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.180

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.500
 but I think I do pretty well this year 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.440
 most ethical champion 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.810
 said the eternal optimist Gomez who for 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.450
 everyone 's hand his hand 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.610
 herdgang and in eindhoven 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.490
 and of course everyone wants to know about him 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 what it's like to play with him and me 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.410
 how he likes life in england 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.950
 with families all well this mine 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.950
 wife and children 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.160
 sikke I think I can rest for it 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.100
 in front of 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.000
 so very important for my family and 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 you must now drive on the left 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.510
 this is my so we have a big problem there 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:49.150
 that we north i am better 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:53.319
 the drive well and think 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.319
 north in two moment it is very beautiful 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.209
 glow the car goes in england 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.370
 so not completely finished by knife 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.269
 and also sporting yet are not 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.640
 always with me 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.480
 because so perth stand for last in the 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.159
 premier league 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.260
 but that is no reason for gomez 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:09.970
 to panic because also during his first 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.780
 months had got it in london 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 difficult 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:19.689
 I think a little more difficult than 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.780
 that my started my start here 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:25.000
 therefore 5 through five years ago me 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.319
 begin my 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:34.659
 not tasty but start with who 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:38.799
 they lead him almost every match 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.849
 until a new start in the henry genes 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.939
 and 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:48.489
 this is hard for for for for 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:52.239
 third the first this is the competitions 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.790
