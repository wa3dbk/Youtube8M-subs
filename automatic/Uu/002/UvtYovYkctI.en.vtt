00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
first because a lot of people like to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.170 
first because a lot of people like to
take<00:00:52.739> their<00:00:52.920> time<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> side<00:00:53.640> quests<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
things like that so a lot of people

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.130 
things like that so a lot of people
might<00:00:55.860> not<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.219> at<00:00:56.399> alabaster<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.449> I've<00:00:57.870> set<00:00:58.109> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
might not be at alabaster so I've set it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
might not be at alabaster so I've set it
up<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:58.440> region<00:00:58.969> that's<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> first<00:01:00.300> thing<00:01:00.539> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
up by region that's the first thing so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.160 
up by region that's the first thing so
you<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.960> worry<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.489> I<00:01:02.930> try<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:03.989> be
