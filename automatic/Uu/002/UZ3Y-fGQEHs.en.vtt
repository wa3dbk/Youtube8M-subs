00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
packaging idea and then each one of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.569 
packaging idea and then each one of
these<00:00:47.850> four<00:00:48.690> compartments<00:00:49.350> slides<00:00:50.160> out<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
these four compartments slides out to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.200 
these four compartments slides out to
the<00:00:50.670> side<00:00:51.680> you<00:00:52.680> open<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.010> up<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:54.059> have<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the side you open that up and you have a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.930 
the side you open that up and you have a
bunch<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.690> screws<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.949> are<00:00:57.379> pre

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
bunch of screws that are pre

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.310 
bunch of screws that are pre
compartmentalize<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.260> any

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
compartmentalize so you don't have any

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.860 
compartmentalize so you don't have any
different<00:01:02.309> types<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> screws<00:01:02.969> mixed<00:01:03.510> together

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
different types of screws mixed together

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
different types of screws mixed together
so<00:01:04.350> they're<00:01:04.500> all<00:01:04.650> pretty<00:01:05.309> separated<00:01:05.939> for<00:01:06.150> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
so they're all pretty separated for you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and you can get these in a number of

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.160 
and you can get these in a number of
different<00:01:09.799> sizes<00:01:11.030> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.060> get<00:01:12.270> them<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.720> a

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
different sizes you can get them with a
