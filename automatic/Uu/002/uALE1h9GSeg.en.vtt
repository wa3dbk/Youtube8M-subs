00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
thousand kilometers in one go that's
just<00:01:43.079> ludicrous<00:01:43.710> lot<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.460> no<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.700> I

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
just ludicrous lot there's no way I

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.319 
just ludicrous lot there's no way I
would<00:01:45.030> have<00:01:45.060> been<00:01:45.210> able<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.450> do<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> yeah
