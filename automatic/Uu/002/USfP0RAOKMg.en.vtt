 We respond within more than all of 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.140
 a few months because first we will not know 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.229

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.600
 as always improvements I leave and I 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.299

 to install and we're going to open it get to 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.650

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.189
 well better 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:34.530
 his presentation the truth that 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:38.100
 very simple iphone 6 47 inch 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.100
 let's open it 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.900
 and I have 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:55.220
 and here comes the bag that we just 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.430
 16 to grow but here comes the brand with 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 next to the logo 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.410
 j 73 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:15.230
 you see the totally flexible 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.200
 rough on the inside in other cases like 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.200
 sheet 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.280
 in this area of ​​the housing let's see 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.280
 yes in this place 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:30.319
 The mine is luxurious as always 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.930
 we say advisable 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.930
 clean both the sleeve 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.599
 as I overtook you recognize we will clean 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 we go 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190
 so that it looks nice 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.970
 let's see if not only quality but 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.130
 as well 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 if they come with factory imperfections 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:10.300
 also in this house we will place 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.300
 up and down 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.050
 easy placement by age 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 Easy placement you can see what covers 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.880
 both the bottom and the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.580
 above leaves the jack the charger as the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:35.010
 sodium and headphones or speakers 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.600
 rather let them air forgiveness but 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.600
 here the volume is not open 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.550
 mountains as is logical also follows in 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.370
 the air 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:51.670
 the next 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.850
 I will also be the truth that first 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.070
 It gives a more sense than accepting 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.720
 I do not like the brand here but 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.610
 good 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:09.080
 his profile is super thin now we will do 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:13.230
 some close-ups but it 's so fine 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:17.669
 and do not get to excel the cambra 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.989
 as you see the sky does not make 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:24.580
 dance of the cameras 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:29.710
 first impression of this jeter housing 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.620
 is very good sincerely for 795 in 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:36.970
 Amazon I repeat is a very good invention 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.120
 it's super thin does not the iphone for 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.270
 nothing at all for more thick 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.420
 it does not change practically anything 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.760
 be everything if it is 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.670
 if the truth that is prevented from being 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.450
 slip prevents it from slipping because 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:05:00.410
 it seems like more but not chalk first 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.510
 impression accepted what I say I go with 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.540
 some close-ups I do not say goodbye anymore 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.540
 you 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.289
 Housing writing 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.080
 and I was pleasantly surprised 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:44.870
 pleasantly surprised 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.730
 I did not know the one to save 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.250
 61 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.380
 day 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.050
 We also wanted to bring affordable houses 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:59.010
 we want to continue extracting more content 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.360
 about affordable products because they are 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.360
 very interesting products 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:09.180
 find us with something like this already 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.960
 I say that it is well subject it seems that no 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.960
 it has a lot of slack 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.350
 the famous little step that they must 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:21.000
 leave the covers 

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:23.810
 yes yes 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.540
 And I think that 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.810
 too just the truth I do not know if 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:37.260
 it would save the screen 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:40.620
 but if we're really going to clean 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.750
 because I do not know if it's because I'm sweating 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:46.660
 I'm sweating a lot but it's true 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.390
 that stays pretty I will search but 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.160
 good 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.550
 we are going to have to clean 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.220
 our area 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.920
 Y 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.930
 and it is already 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.930
 I repeat that first impressions 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:09.720
 we will continue with it costs the 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.720
 demonstrated and good question 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.349
 a few weeks more than all a few months 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.990
 to be able to see them and they are brought the 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:20.599
 housing not who will be removed from the iphone 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.509
 we do everything with her first because 

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:25.940
 I like it seems comfortable and second 

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:28.910
 because for that we are to do the 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.270
