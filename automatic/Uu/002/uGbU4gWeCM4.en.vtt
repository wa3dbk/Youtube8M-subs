before you go in and apply shadow it's

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.000 
before you go in and apply shadow it's
giving<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> nice<00:02:22.840> flat<00:02:23.290> base<00:02:23.500> it's<00:02:23.799> just

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
and the appearance and texture will

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.170 
and the appearance and texture will
completely<00:04:00.710> change<00:04:00.830> with<00:04:01.670> different<00:04:01.970> primers

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180
