00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
along series with the primitive tools

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.850 
along series with the primitive tools
was<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.750> answer<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:10.050> question<00:00:10.380> how<00:00:10.559> I'd<00:00:10.679> go

about<00:00:11.389> Tanana<00:00:12.389> hide<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.809> simple<00:00:13.110> as<00:00:13.200> possible

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
about Tanana hide as simple as possible

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.450 
about Tanana hide as simple as possible
with<00:00:13.769> limited<00:00:14.670> tools<00:00:15.949> and<00:00:16.949> I'm<00:00:17.039> all<00:00:17.220> for

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
with limited tools and I'm all for

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.099 
with limited tools and I'm all for
simple<00:00:17.880> but<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> thought<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:18.990> really

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
simple but I thought it was really

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.359 
simple but I thought it was really
important<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.470> show<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> normally<00:00:19.980> do

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
important to show you how I normally do

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.060 
important to show you how I normally do
it<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> wood<00:00:20.789> ash<00:00:20.939> because<00:00:21.800> that<00:00:22.800> really

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
it with the wood ash because that really

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.450 
it with the wood ash because that really
helps<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.740> heights<00:00:25.980> come<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.310> nice

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
helps you out the heights come out nice

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.670 
helps you out the heights come out nice
and<00:00:26.640> soft<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.119> with<00:00:27.869> less<00:00:28.080> work<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.560> that's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
and soft with with less work and that's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.330 
and soft with with less work and that's
what<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:28.920> after<00:00:29.990> and<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.650> honesty<00:00:32.309> I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
what I'm after and in all honesty I

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.959 
what I'm after and in all honesty I
could<00:00:32.579> probably<00:00:34.489> if<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.579> had<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.760> wooden

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
could probably if I had a wooden

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.970 
could probably if I had a wooden
container<00:00:36.360> burn<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> wooden<00:00:37.230> ball<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.770> could

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
container burn out a wooden ball I could

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.410 
container burn out a wooden ball I could
definitely<00:00:38.309> copy<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.969> whole<00:00:39.149> approach<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
definitely copy that whole approach and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.610 
definitely copy that whole approach and
something<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.480> wanted<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> do<00:00:42.960> was<00:00:43.140> dig<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> hole

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
something I wanted to do was dig a hole

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.270 
something I wanted to do was dig a hole
in<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> ground<00:00:44.480> line<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> rawhide

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
in the ground line it with a rawhide

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.740 
in the ground line it with a rawhide
then<00:00:47.280> fill<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.059> use<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.570> hold

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
then fill that up and use that to hold

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.970 
then fill that up and use that to hold
the<00:00:48.809> water<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.320> gonna<00:00:49.410> dunk<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.800> hide

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the water and I was gonna dunk my hide

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.639 
the water and I was gonna dunk my hide
in<00:00:50.100> there<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.989> might<00:00:51.989> have<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.260> wait<00:00:52.410> till<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
in there I might have to wait till it's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.990 
in there I might have to wait till it's
warm<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:53.399> if<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.699> did<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
warm to do that because if I did that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
warm to do that because if I did that
right<00:00:54.120> now<00:00:54.410> my<00:00:55.410> hide<00:00:55.590> would<00:00:55.739> just<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> frozen

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
right now my hide would just be a frozen

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.860 
right now my hide would just be a frozen
brick<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> ice<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.120> wouldn't<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.420> absorbing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
brick of ice and I wouldn't be absorbing

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.819 
brick of ice and I wouldn't be absorbing
anything<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.280> point<00:01:00.410> I'm<00:01:01.410> better<00:01:01.649> off

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
anything so at this point I'm better off

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.910 
anything so at this point I'm better off
taking<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.250> hide<00:01:03.260> I'm<00:01:04.260> gonna<00:01:04.439> go<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
taking this hide I'm gonna go down to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.370 
taking this hide I'm gonna go down to
the<00:01:05.010> creek<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.549> gonna<00:01:05.869> submerge<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380
