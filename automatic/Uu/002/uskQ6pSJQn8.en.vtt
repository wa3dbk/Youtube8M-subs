of battlefield 4 after I had unlocked
active<00:00:19.770> protection<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.310> used<00:00:20.490> nothing<00:00:20.760> else<00:00:21.090> on

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
active protection I used nothing else on

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.480 
active protection I used nothing else on
my<00:00:21.480> vehicles<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.289> pretty<00:00:22.529> easy<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> use<00:00:22.980> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.769 
anticipate damage or start taking damage
and<00:00:25.740> tada<00:00:26.130> you<00:00:26.490> stop<00:00:26.849> taking<00:00:27.090> projectile

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and tada you stop taking projectile

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
and tada you stop taking projectile
damage<00:00:28.170> for<00:00:28.349> roughly<00:00:28.710> 5<00:00:28.920> seconds<00:00:29.429> now<00:00:29.820> there

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
damage for roughly 5 seconds now there

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.580 
damage for roughly 5 seconds now there
are<00:00:30.060> some<00:00:30.210> bugs<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.599> active<00:00:30.960> protection<00:00:31.410> but

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
are some bugs in active protection but

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.440 
are some bugs in active protection but
that's<00:00:31.769> generally<00:00:32.309> how<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.460> works<00:00:32.640> well<00:00:33.420> with

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that's generally how it works well with

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.299 
that's generally how it works well with
smokescreen<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.230> unlocked<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:34.800> maybe<00:00:35.190> try

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
smokescreen I unlocked it and maybe try

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.250 
smokescreen I unlocked it and maybe try
to<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> few<00:00:36.090> rounds<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.600> promptly<00:00:37.050> moved

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
to for a few rounds and promptly moved

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.290 
to for a few rounds and promptly moved
on<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.739> active<00:00:38.070> protection<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.820> never<00:00:39.030> seemed

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
on to active protection it never seemed

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.760 
on to active protection it never seemed
to<00:00:39.420> provide<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.719> tangible<00:00:40.140> benefit<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.739> I

to provide a tangible benefit that I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.590 
to provide a tangible benefit that I

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
could see and it just didn't sound all

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.450 
could see and it just didn't sound all
that<00:00:42.780> appealing<00:00:43.050> until<00:00:43.649> an<00:00:43.770> episode<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.160> over

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
your shoulder a few weeks ago I really

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.900 
your shoulder a few weeks ago I really
hadn't<00:00:46.469> seriously<00:00:46.920> considered<00:00:47.370> smokescreen

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
hadn't seriously considered smokescreen

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
hadn't seriously considered smokescreen
an<00:00:48.120> option<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.719> was<00:00:49.170> shocked<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.649> top

an option I was shocked that a top

an option I was shocked that a top
tanker<00:00:50.250> was<00:00:50.399> even<00:00:50.700> using<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.329> think<00:00:51.570> it's

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
tanker was even using it I think it's

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.330 
tanker was even using it I think it's
partly<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.079> smokes<00:00:52.530> benefits<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.160> not

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.859 
specific experiences with smokescreen
and<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> learned<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> result<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.720> using

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
and what I learned as a result of using

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.840 
and what I learned as a result of using
it<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> first<00:01:31.829> equipped<00:01:32.130> smokescreen<00:01:32.640> I

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it when I first equipped smokescreen I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.609 
it when I first equipped smokescreen I
nearly<00:01:33.180> abandoned<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> immediately<00:01:34.229> it's

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
nearly abandoned it immediately it's

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
nearly abandoned it immediately it's
definitely<00:01:35.250> not<00:01:35.400> active<00:01:35.759> protection<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.360> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
definitely not active protection and it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.030 
definitely not active protection and it
will<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.750> save<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.200> from<00:01:37.350> circumstances

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
will not save you from circumstances

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.440 
will not save you from circumstances
where<00:01:38.189> active<00:01:38.520> protection<00:01:38.670> might<00:01:39.150> otherwise

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
where active protection might otherwise

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
where active protection might otherwise
I<00:01:39.869> ended<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.259> dying<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.890> frequently

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I ended up dying pretty frequently

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.920 
I ended up dying pretty frequently
because<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> needed<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.240> understand<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
because I needed to understand the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
because I needed to understand the
smokescreen<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.799> about<00:01:44.070> damage

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
smokescreen is more about damage

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.190 
smokescreen is more about damage
reduction<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:45.119> avoidance<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:45.960> damage

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
reduction and avoidance than damage

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.289 
reduction and avoidance than damage
prevention<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> started<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.149> much

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
prevention so I started using in a much

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.730 
prevention so I started using in a much
more<00:01:48.450> active<00:01:48.630> manner<00:01:48.930> rather<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:49.560> waiting

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
more active manner rather than waiting

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.649 
more active manner rather than waiting
for<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:50.009> fight<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> begin<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.820> popped<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> smoke

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
for a fight to begin I popped the smoke

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
for a fight to begin I popped the smoke
if<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.930> knew<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.500> sneaking<00:01:52.740> up<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.130> an

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.770 
if I knew I was sneaking up on an
armored<00:01:53.549> target<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.149> smoke<00:01:54.390> screen<00:01:54.630> has

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
armored target because smoke screen has

a<00:01:54.810> recharge<00:01:55.290> time<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.680> only<00:01:55.799> 12<00:01:56.189> seconds

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
a recharge time of only 12 seconds

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.520 
a recharge time of only 12 seconds
that'd<00:01:56.969> be<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.329> up<00:01:57.570> by<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.750> time<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.200> engaged

that'd be back up by the time I engaged

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.139 
that'd be back up by the time I engaged
my<00:01:58.710> target<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.579> key<00:01:59.790> distinction

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
my target and this is a key distinction

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.429 
my target and this is a key distinction
between<00:02:00.390> active<00:02:00.869> protection<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
between active protection and

between active protection and
smokescreen<00:02:01.979> smokescreen<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.210> 6

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
smokescreen smokescreen is up for 6

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940 
smokescreen smokescreen is up for 6
seconds<00:02:03.810> which<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:03.990> nearly<00:02:04.320> half<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.829> its

recharge time of 12 seconds active
protection<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.710> up<00:02:07.860> for<00:02:08.069> five<00:02:08.220> seconds<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
protection is up for five seconds and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.029 
protection is up for five seconds and

then has to recharge for a full 25
seconds<00:02:11.520> before<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.300> active

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
seconds before it can be active

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.480 
seconds before it can be active
again<00:02:13.170> so<00:02:13.560> smokescreen<00:02:14.010> can<00:02:14.220> be<00:02:14.340> almost

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
again so smokescreen can be almost

to tanks and smokescreen this is because

reduce this damage so you take full

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.540 
reduce this damage so you take full

canister shell it's an absolutely

just completely shred infantry I was

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.070 
just completely shred infantry I was
really<00:04:08.880> negative<00:04:09.330> on<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.540> canister<00:04:09.810> shell

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
really negative on the canister shell

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.229 
really negative on the canister shell
before<00:04:10.290> because<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.160> the<00:04:11.280> long<00:04:11.520> reload<00:04:11.940> time

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.180 
before because of the long reload time
but<00:04:12.510> with<00:04:12.660> an<00:04:12.810> autoloader<00:04:13.170> it's<00:04:13.650> a<00:04:13.830> whole<00:04:14.010> new

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
but with an autoloader it's a whole new

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.660 
but with an autoloader it's a whole new
game

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
game

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.430

but<00:04:14.820> I'll<00:04:14.910> do<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.060> video<00:04:15.239> all<00:04:15.600> about<00:04:15.630> canister

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
but I'll do a video all about canister

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.110 
but I'll do a video all about canister
shell<00:04:16.620> another<00:04:16.980> day<00:04:17.250> so<00:04:17.609> let's<00:04:17.790> look<00:04:17.880> at<00:04:18.000> some
