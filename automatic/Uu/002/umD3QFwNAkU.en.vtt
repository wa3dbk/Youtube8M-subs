00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.610 

right<00:00:17.520> I'm<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.150> firstly<00:00:18.630> label<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> API

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:19.620 
right I'm going to firstly label the API

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.060 
right I'm going to firstly label the API
strip<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.360> just<00:00:21.630> label<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.290> with<00:00:22.710> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
strip and so you just label it with the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.910 
strip and so you just label it with the
organism<00:00:23.670> that's<00:00:24.510> unknown<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.740> right

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
organism that's unknown in that right

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.370 
organism that's unknown in that right
hand<00:00:26.130> corner<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.790> then<00:00:27.510> what<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:27.930> need<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.200> do

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
hand corner and then what we need to do

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.110 
hand corner and then what we need to do
is<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:28.830> take<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:29.430> lid<00:00:29.580> off<00:00:29.780> and<00:00:31.640> in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.700> base

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
is then take the lid off and in the base

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.119 
is then take the lid off and in the base
of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:36.290> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.470> see<00:00:37.650> all<00:00:37.890> these

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
of the well you can see all these

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.240 
of the well you can see all these
corrugated<00:00:39.059> areas<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.680> what<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
corrugated areas and what I'm going to

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:48.099 
corrugated areas and what I'm going to
do<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:41.940> fill<00:00:42.600> those<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.140> water

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.250 

if<00:00:48.589> there's<00:00:48.829> any<00:00:48.980> excess<00:00:49.460> water

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 

in<00:00:52.770> order<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.040> find<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.610> you've<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:53.820> any

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
in order to find out if you've got any

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.790 
in order to find out if you've got any
excess<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.540> move<00:00:54.720> it<00:00:54.840> all<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.649> down

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
excess if you move it all up and down

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.250 
excess if you move it all up and down
until<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.460> feel<00:00:56.700> most<00:00:56.970> of<00:00:57.180> those<00:00:57.329> wells<00:00:57.630> and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
until you feel most of those wells and

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.069 
until you feel most of those wells and
if<00:00:58.500> there's<00:00:58.680> any<00:00:58.829> excess<00:00:59.329> just<00:01:00.329> get<00:01:00.510> rid<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.720> it

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.100 

in<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.680> pot<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.400> then<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:05.570> provides<00:01:05.930> a

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
in a pot and then that provides a

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.609 
in a pot and then that provides a
humidified<00:01:06.740> chamber<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:08.720> your<00:01:08.869> API<00:01:09.170> strip

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
humidified chamber for your API strip

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.490 
humidified chamber for your API strip
and<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.190> just<00:01:10.430> sits<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.290> there<00:01:12.290> like<00:01:12.470> that

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
and that just sits in there like that

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.580 
and that just sits in there like that
and<00:01:13.690> then<00:01:14.690> I'm<00:01:14.900> just<00:01:14.930> going<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.260> put<00:01:15.380> it<00:01:15.470> at<00:01:15.560> a

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
and then I'm just going to put it at a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.730 
and then I'm just going to put it at a
slight<00:01:15.890> angle<00:01:17.229> and<00:01:18.229> what<00:01:18.350> we're<00:01:18.440> going<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.590> do

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
slight angle and what we're going to do

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.090 
slight angle and what we're going to do
next<00:01:19.010> is<00:01:19.400> take<00:01:20.060> one<00:01:20.780> colony<00:01:21.200> from<00:01:22.130> here<00:01:22.690> and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
next is take one colony from here and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.260 
next is take one colony from here and
I'm<00:01:25.100> probably<00:01:25.340> going<00:01:25.729> to<00:01:25.850> take<00:01:27.729> this<00:01:28.729> colony

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
I'm probably going to take this colony

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.850 
I'm probably going to take this colony
there<00:01:31.450> inoculate<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.479> into<00:01:33.020> five<00:01:33.409> mils<00:01:33.710> of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
there inoculate it into five mils of

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.940 
there inoculate it into five mils of
sterile<00:01:34.190> distilled<00:01:34.550> water<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.619> then<00:01:36.619> use

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
sterile distilled water and then use

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.850 
sterile distilled water and then use
that<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.520> then<00:01:38.330> fill<00:01:38.840> these<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.830> way

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
that to then fill these all the way

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.469 
that to then fill these all the way
across<00:01:40.160> okay<00:01:40.759> so<00:01:40.820> I'm<00:01:40.970> going<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:41.149> move<00:01:41.300> the

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
across okay so I'm going to move the

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.010 
across okay so I'm going to move the
bundles<00:01:41.780> enflame<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.350> its<00:01:42.470> hottest<00:01:42.860> flame

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
bundles enflame to its hottest flame

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.450 
bundles enflame to its hottest flame
because<00:01:45.020> what<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.200> want<00:01:45.500> to<00:01:45.619> do<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.860> now<00:01:46.009> flame

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
because what I want to do is now flame

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.800 
because what I want to do is now flame
this<00:01:46.729> straight<00:01:47.390> wire<00:01:47.649> until<00:01:48.649> it's<00:01:48.800> red-hot<00:01:49.810> to

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
this straight wire until it's red-hot to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.779 
this straight wire until it's red-hot to
sterilize<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.530> get<00:01:51.710> rid<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.920> any<00:01:52.039> bacteria<00:01:52.130> on

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
sterilize it get rid of any bacteria on

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.060 
sterilize it get rid of any bacteria on
there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.050 

give<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.820> few<00:01:58.000> seconds<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.510> cool<00:01:58.780> down<00:01:59.080> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
give it a few seconds to cool down and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.060 
give it a few seconds to cool down and
then<00:02:01.060> pick

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
then pick

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.480 
then pick
that's<00:02:03.670> colony<00:02:04.180> they're<00:02:05.040> into<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.190> sterile

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
that's colony they're into the sterile

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.840 
that's colony they're into the sterile
distilled<00:02:07.030> water<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:09.100> but<00:02:09.250> quite<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.490> bit<00:02:09.729> on

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
distilled water so but quite a bit on

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.590 
distilled water so but quite a bit on
the<00:02:10.030> end<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.390> that<00:02:10.540> straight<00:02:11.410> wire<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.970> then

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
the end of that straight wire and then

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.170 
the end of that straight wire and then
I'm<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.960> inoculate<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.790> distilled

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
I'm going to inoculate the distilled

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.930 
I'm going to inoculate the distilled
water<00:02:17.040> so<00:02:18.040> what<00:02:18.130> you<00:02:18.280> need<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.460> do<00:02:18.670> is<00:02:18.790> then

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
water so what you need to do is then

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.670 
water so what you need to do is then
bring<00:02:19.270> your<00:02:19.390> straight<00:02:19.690> wire<00:02:19.870> inside<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
bring your straight wire inside the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.010 
bring your straight wire inside the
inside<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.250> universal<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.090> then

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
inside of the universal and then

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.720 
inside of the universal and then
emulsify<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.650> little<00:02:23.980> bit<00:02:24.100> in<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> distilled

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
emulsify a little bit in the distilled

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.610 
emulsify a little bit in the distilled
water<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.330> then<00:02:25.540> on<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> inside<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.590> that

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
water and then on the inside of that

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.180 
water and then on the inside of that
glass<00:02:27.040> container<00:02:27.550> okay<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:28.800> then<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.950> take

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
glass container okay and then you take

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.880 
glass container okay and then you take
it<00:02:30.340> out<00:02:30.840> pop<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.990> lid<00:02:32.110> back<00:02:32.260> on<00:02:32.320> and<00:02:32.650> flame

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
it out pop the lid back on and flame

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.240 
it out pop the lid back on and flame
your<00:02:33.100> straight<00:02:33.370> wire<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:34.800> then<00:02:35.800> give<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.220> a

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
your straight wire and then give that a

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.310 
your straight wire and then give that a
nice<00:02:36.490> shake<00:02:36.850> so<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.270> nicely<00:02:37.540> mixed<00:02:37.900> in<00:02:38.170> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
nice shake so it's nicely mixed in the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.380 
nice shake so it's nicely mixed in the
bacteria<00:02:38.830> in<00:02:38.890> there<00:02:39.010> distilled<00:02:39.340> water<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
bacteria in there distilled water and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.300 
bacteria in there distilled water and
then<00:02:41.020> I'll<00:02:41.140> stop<00:02:41.440> there<00:02:41.650> before<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.040> show<00:02:42.280> you

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
then I'll stop there before I show you

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:54.500 
then I'll stop there before I show you
the<00:02:42.490> next<00:02:42.610> piece

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.449 

so<00:02:55.050> I'm<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.349> filling<00:02:55.769> up<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.870> microtubules

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
so I'm just filling up the microtubules

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.140 
so I'm just filling up the microtubules
with<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> bacterial<00:03:00.090> suspension

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.930 

only<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.260> level<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.430> way<00:03:05.580> across

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
only up to that level all the way across

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:15.140 
only up to that level all the way across
to<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.959> very<00:03:07.140> last<00:03:07.349> one

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.670 

I'm<00:03:15.569> just<00:03:15.750> going<00:03:15.870> to<00:03:15.900> stop<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> ex<00:03:16.349> of<00:03:16.470> run<00:03:16.650> out

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
I'm just going to stop the ex of run out

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.400 
I'm just going to stop the ex of run out
of<00:03:16.830> suspension<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.420> then<00:03:18.569> go<00:03:18.750> back<00:03:18.959> and<00:03:18.989> get

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
of suspension so then go back and get

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.800 
of suspension so then go back and get
some<00:03:19.470> more<00:03:19.709> suspension<00:03:20.129> into<00:03:20.660> your<00:03:21.660> pets

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.470 

and<00:03:27.319> then<00:03:27.530> fill<00:03:27.800> in<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.250> rest<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
and then fill in the rest of the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.890 
and then fill in the rest of the
couple's<00:03:30.250> starting<00:03:31.250> with<00:03:31.400> indole<00:03:32.000> always

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
couple's starting with indole always

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.860 
couple's starting with indole always
doing<00:03:33.170> it<00:03:33.260> in<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.590> left-hand<00:03:34.130> corner<00:03:34.870> which

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
doing it in that left-hand corner which

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.420 
doing it in that left-hand corner which
minimizes<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.680> air<00:03:36.800> bubbles<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.280> you'll

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
minimizes the air bubbles that you'll

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:53.120 
minimizes the air bubbles that you'll
get

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.220 

up<00:03:53.640> until<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.060> very<00:03:54.180> last<00:03:54.270> one<00:03:54.660> arabinose<00:03:55.140> and

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
up until the very last one arabinose and

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.820 
up until the very last one arabinose and
then<00:03:55.980> I'm<00:03:56.100> going<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.400> stop<00:03:56.670> there

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.440 

so<00:04:00.400> I'm<00:04:00.490> just<00:04:00.640> gonna<00:04:00.730> pick<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.060> up<00:04:01.210> and<00:04:01.390> just

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
so I'm just gonna pick it up and just

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.880 
so I'm just gonna pick it up and just
have<00:04:01.750> a<00:04:01.780> look<00:04:02.020> and<00:04:02.140> see<00:04:02.350> if<00:04:02.440> there<00:04:02.560> any<00:04:02.680> air

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
have a look and see if there any air

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.360 
have a look and see if there any air
bubbles<00:04:04.230> which<00:04:05.230> there<00:04:05.470> aren't<00:04:05.800> so<00:04:06.220> that's

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
bubbles which there aren't so that's

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.340 
bubbles which there aren't so that's
okay<00:04:06.790> so<00:04:07.510> I'm<00:04:07.570> going<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.780> put<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.020> back<00:04:08.170> down

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
okay so I'm going to put it back down

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:17.080 
okay so I'm going to put it back down
flat<00:04:08.710> on<00:04:08.740> the<00:04:08.980> bench

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.740 

so<00:04:17.690> if<00:04:17.840> topping<00:04:18.320> up<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> citrate<00:04:19.070> cut<00:04:19.340> pill

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
so if topping up the citrate cut pill

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.060 
so if topping up the citrate cut pill
with<00:04:20.750> some<00:04:20.900> more<00:04:21.019> back<00:04:21.169> to<00:04:21.320> your<00:04:21.470> suspension

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
with some more back to your suspension

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.760 
with some more back to your suspension
chopping<00:04:23.030> up<00:04:23.150> your<00:04:23.330> VP

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
chopping up your VP

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.100 
chopping up your VP
with<00:04:26.370> some<00:04:26.940> more<00:04:27.060> bacterial<00:04:27.509> suspension<00:04:27.990> and

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
with some more bacterial suspension and

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.040 
with some more bacterial suspension and
topping<00:04:28.470> up<00:04:28.590> your<00:04:28.620> gelatin<00:04:29.660> with<00:04:30.660> some<00:04:30.900> more

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
topping up your gelatin with some more

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.380 
topping up your gelatin with some more
bacterial<00:04:31.860> suspension

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.820 

then<00:04:36.020> we're<00:04:36.140> going<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:36.380> use<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.560> liquid

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
then we're going to use a liquid

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.380 
then we're going to use a liquid
paraffin

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.180 

to<00:04:40.960> top<00:04:41.500> up<00:04:41.680> some<00:04:42.160> of<00:04:42.280> the<00:04:42.370> couples

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.120 

so

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.560 

and<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.730> ones<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:48.940> we're<00:04:49.090> going<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.240> top<00:04:49.420> up

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
and the ones that we're going to top up

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.860 
and the ones that we're going to top up
with<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.810> ones<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.170> are<00:04:50.260> underlined<00:04:50.770> so<00:04:51.870> ld8

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
with the ones that are underlined so ld8

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.700 
with the ones that are underlined so ld8

Oh DC
h2s

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.720 

and<00:05:06.479> urea

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.690 

and<00:05:10.360> what<00:05:10.480> we're<00:05:10.630> doing<00:05:10.660> is<00:05:10.990> we're<00:05:11.170> simulating

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
and what we're doing is we're simulating

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.760 
and what we're doing is we're simulating
anaerobic<00:05:12.700> conditions<00:05:13.300> by<00:05:14.140> chopping<00:05:14.530> up<00:05:14.620> with

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
anaerobic conditions by chopping up with

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.690 
anaerobic conditions by chopping up with
paraffin<00:05:15.190> oil<00:05:16.590> so<00:05:17.590> pop<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.860> lid<00:05:18.070> back<00:05:18.250> on<00:05:18.280> so

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
paraffin oil so pop the lid back on so

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.670 
paraffin oil so pop the lid back on so
you<00:05:18.760> don't<00:05:18.970> contaminate<00:05:19.540> with<00:05:19.990> any<00:05:20.140> bacteria

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
you don't contaminate with any bacteria

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.020 
you don't contaminate with any bacteria
that<00:05:20.830> are<00:05:20.890> over<00:05:21.220> available<00:05:21.850> in<00:05:21.940> the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
that are over available in the

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.570 
that are over available in the
environment<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.950> then<00:05:23.950> we're<00:05:24.220> going<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.550> a

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
environment and then we're going to do a

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.150 
environment and then we're going to do a
purity<00:05:25.060> plate<00:05:25.530> with<00:05:26.530> our<00:05:26.650> bacterial

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
purity plate with our bacterial

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.220 
purity plate with our bacterial
suspension<00:05:27.760> just<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.630> make<00:05:28.780> sure<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.080> what

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
suspension just to make sure that what

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.580 
suspension just to make sure that what
we've<00:05:29.350> put<00:05:29.530> in<00:05:29.710> there<00:05:29.920> is<00:05:30.040> pure<00:05:30.390> so<00:05:31.410> we're<00:05:32.410> just

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
we've put in there is pure so we're just

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.220 
we've put in there is pure so we're just
going<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.770> take<00:05:32.950> one<00:05:33.400> drop<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:34.090> just<00:05:34.720> drop<00:05:35.050> it

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
going to take one drop and just drop it

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.300 
going to take one drop and just drop it
on<00:05:36.130> there<00:05:36.730> and<00:05:36.970> that<00:05:37.090> will<00:05:37.180> be<00:05:37.300> sufficient

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
on there and that will be sufficient

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.710 
on there and that will be sufficient
then<00:05:39.310> using<00:05:39.850> your<00:05:39.960> bacteriological<00:05:40.960> loop<00:05:41.530> and

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
then using your bacteriological loop and

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.110 
then using your bacteriological loop and
the<00:05:43.720> hottest<00:05:43.960> part<00:05:44.350> of<00:05:44.470> the<00:05:44.530> flame<00:05:45.120> is

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
the hottest part of the flame is

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.770 
the hottest part of the flame is
sterilizing<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:46.990> again<00:05:47.670> and<00:05:48.670> then<00:05:49.630> we're

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
sterilizing it again and then we're

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.480 
sterilizing it again and then we're
going<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.990> streak<00:05:50.350> out<00:05:50.560> that<00:05:50.800> drop<00:05:51.160> that<00:05:51.340> we've

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
going to streak out that drop that we've

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.060 
going to streak out that drop that we've
put<00:05:51.640> on<00:05:51.760> the<00:05:51.850> agar<00:05:52.210> plate<00:05:52.480> all<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.680> way<00:05:53.800> across

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
put on the agar plate all the way across

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.910 
put on the agar plate all the way across
so<00:05:54.520> that<00:05:54.880> eventually<00:05:55.300> next<00:05:55.780> time<00:05:55.990> we<00:05:56.620> can<00:05:56.770> see

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
so that eventually next time we can see

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.500 
so that eventually next time we can see
nice<00:05:57.130> single<00:05:57.490> bacterial<00:05:58.240> colonies<00:05:59.700> so<00:06:00.700> going

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
nice single bacterial colonies so going

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.970 
nice single bacterial colonies so going
back<00:06:01.780> to<00:06:01.930> that<00:06:02.080> originally<00:06:02.650> where<00:06:02.830> we

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
back to that originally where we

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.080 
back to that originally where we
inoculated<00:06:03.970> it<00:06:05.280> I'll<00:06:06.280> spread<00:06:06.580> it<00:06:06.640> out

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
inoculated it I'll spread it out

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.120 
inoculated it I'll spread it out
then<00:06:08.690> I've<00:06:08.810> got<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:09.169> heat<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:10.070> loop<00:06:10.250> each<00:06:10.520> time

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
then I've got to heat the loop each time

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.700 
then I've got to heat the loop each time
move<00:06:13.130> your<00:06:13.310> plate<00:06:13.550> around<00:06:13.760> and<00:06:14.380> take<00:06:15.380> some

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
move your plate around and take some

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.020 
move your plate around and take some
from<00:06:15.889> there<00:06:16.160> across<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:17.090> the<00:06:17.180> next<00:06:17.449> area<00:06:19.030> flame

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
from there across to the next area flame

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:25.469 
from there across to the next area flame
the<00:06:20.270> loop

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:25.479 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:27.089 

taking<00:06:26.229> a<00:06:26.289> little<00:06:26.409> bit<00:06:26.620> more<00:06:26.680> from<00:06:26.979> that

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:27.099 
taking a little bit more from that

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:30.720 
taking a little bit more from that
sector<00:06:27.400> to<00:06:27.879> the<00:06:27.969> next<00:06:28.240> area

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.100 

and<00:06:31.180> we're<00:06:31.300> going<00:06:31.420> to<00:06:31.480> do<00:06:31.630> that<00:06:31.810> two<00:06:32.080> more

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
and we're going to do that two more

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.540 
and we're going to do that two more
times

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
times

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:36.909 
times
so<00:06:35.150> that<00:06:35.330> eventually<00:06:35.900> right<00:06:36.259> at<00:06:36.440> the<00:06:36.500> very<00:06:36.680> end

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919 
so that eventually right at the very end

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:38.650 
so that eventually right at the very end
we're<00:06:37.400> going<00:06:37.490> to<00:06:37.580> have<00:06:37.699> nice<00:06:37.879> pure<00:06:38.180> colonies

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
we're going to have nice pure colonies

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.540 
we're going to have nice pure colonies
we<00:06:38.810> can<00:06:38.990> then<00:06:39.169> do<00:06:39.379> further<00:06:39.680> work<00:06:39.860> on<00:06:40.280> if<00:06:40.400> we

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:40.550 
we can then do further work on if we

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.700 
we can then do further work on if we
need<00:06:40.729> to<00:06:40.759> so<00:06:43.509> this<00:06:44.509> will<00:06:44.690> be<00:06:44.780> the<00:06:44.900> last<00:06:45.080> one<00:06:45.470> and

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
need to so this will be the last one and

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.950 
need to so this will be the last one and
what<00:06:46.669> you<00:06:46.789> need<00:06:46.940> to<00:06:47.030> do<00:06:47.180> with<00:06:47.330> the<00:06:47.389> last<00:06:47.599> one<00:06:47.840> is

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
what you need to do with the last one is

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.860 
what you need to do with the last one is
do<00:06:48.110> a<00:06:48.139> squiggle<00:06:49.090> okay<00:06:50.090> so<00:06:50.150> we<00:06:50.389> can<00:06:50.539> see<00:06:50.720> those

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
do a squiggle okay so we can see those

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:55.830 
do a squiggle okay so we can see those
nice<00:06:51.139> single<00:06:51.550> colonies<00:06:52.550> next<00:06:52.879> time

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:55.840 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.110 

and<00:06:55.930> then<00:06:56.530> flaming<00:06:56.860> a<00:06:57.070> bacteriological<00:06:57.639> loop

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
and then flaming a bacteriological loop

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.110 
and then flaming a bacteriological loop
when<00:06:58.270> you're<00:06:58.419> finished

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
when you're finished

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.210 
when you're finished
pop<00:07:01.120> the<00:07:01.300> lid<00:07:01.330> back<00:07:01.630> on<00:07:01.660> and<00:07:02.080> it's<00:07:02.740> going<00:07:02.919> to<00:07:03.010> be

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
pop the lid back on and it's going to be

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.520 
pop the lid back on and it's going to be
incubated<00:07:03.910> the<00:07:04.000> plate<00:07:04.290> with<00:07:05.290> the<00:07:05.530> API<00:07:06.010> strip
