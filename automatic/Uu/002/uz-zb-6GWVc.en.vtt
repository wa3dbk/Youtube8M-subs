00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.860
 greetings dear friends I want 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.440
 here is such a small 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.850
 Podcast means in it we will discuss 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.060
 few pressing topics mean well 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.849
 for sure you probably already saw that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.710
 channel now recently instead of 2 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.450
 video per day is just one video 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.370
 per day it's even here they go out with 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:39.450
 intermittent yes yes there is not every day 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.649
 let's get them there 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.930
 just two reasons means the first reason 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.210
 as some know about it somehow 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.170
 spoke there either in my group 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.559
 in contact with 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.899
 Tallinn Stream but I am learning that is 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 besides the fact that I work I am looking for in absentia 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.340
 I am learning and now we have the last course goes 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.229
 and in short im us somewhere in the second 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.790
 half of June will go to the diploma 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.960
 Now here we actually passed the state 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 exams and now now we have 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 That is, the last but one stage is 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.030
 before diploma protection this is your own 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 option 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.240
 all collected written information 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.750
 now we must take shape 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.479
 here on the sheets and the total amount of the diploma 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.430
 I have already passed a hundred pages 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.079
 that is, you understand it is very big 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.869
 a layer of information now we will 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.180
 count is preparing to learn there just 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.450
 invoice drawings and fucking here this strain 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.320
 to hell, I think you have understood what I 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.320
 drooping that is 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.979
 I know here and so every day rivet 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 vidos and at the same time preparing for 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 diploma protection yes there again 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.420
 study all this information 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.200
 incredibly difficult really guys then 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.330
 there are those who defended the diploma there is techno 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.210
 relay in the university I think they will understand me 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.570
 that is why most likely 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.970
 as long as I don't defend my diploma 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.430
 most likely the video will continue 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.880
 go out with some interruptions 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.950
 but but but still I will try for now 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.120
 what back to the format at least 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.730
 two videos per day 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.300
 Well, you know, that is, go to 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.340
 the position there is very 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.560
 Diploma in short that we have here to not 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.780
 believe the principles we did in 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.850
 techie and this just don't know how to land 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.360
 and the sky here is much bigger than any 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:45.010
 the calculation formula was the shortest 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.760
 just no no first reason yes 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.250
 why 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.010
 own video go so far one 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.250
 once a day and intermittently second reason 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:57.700
 still the same thing is that now 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.730
 I'm working on one project for now 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.780
 I will not disclose the details of all that this 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:08.400
 for such a project but you will see it already in 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:11.530
 May month this will be a whole video loop 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.200
 dedicated to one subject here but again 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.269
 for the sake of intrigue, I have not yet 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.400
 I will say the name is actually 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:21.010
 here's a loop over this video which i 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.489
 now I am doing so it gives me great 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.470
 priority than release passing when 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:30.040
 I will release a video loop and you will understand why. 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:32.200
 don't ask now why are you 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.600
 do not give now come total war he 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.120
 Now it's here in this video series, we 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.160
 Now it is much more priority for 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.620
 I'm much more interesting you of course 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.070
 you can often judge me and because 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.640
 everything 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.970
 but when this cycle video comes out I think 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.530
 change your mind don't understand why 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.600
 I pored over my own 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.910
 the fact is that there are also very many 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.190
 will be mounting I just drags herach 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.980
 learn to do the installation completely 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.830
 mounting roller videos yes as I have 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.080
 said it will be a video wave cycle 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.300
 so since there is a lot of mounting 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.450
 just a hell of a time 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.570
 in order to sip all forehead there 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.209
 so when the loop video comes out you 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.720
 understand there by the name of the video again 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.930
 what it will be connected so please me 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.390
 to support 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.250
 again primarily by views and 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:28.300
 thumbs up, we certainly 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:32.680
 repost this video loop I 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.040
 tried wholeheartedly did us how much 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.320
 it could best possible simply 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.950
 In general, all the forces to elicit this 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.419
 vidos gave that's why when they 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.400
 will come out I hope for your support 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.210
 thatâ€™s basically what I wanted 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.000
 say as soon as once this 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.100
 loop video yes dad so far unnamed 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.950
 subject matter let it be a secret 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.669
 the more interesting it will be from this cycle 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.229
 The video will be released but it will soon be under 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.700
 then he can there I have time it will be 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.560
 more despite 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.900
 so that I will prepare for the diploma 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.450
 because here are these vidos for this 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:15.950
 the video loop they take away from me now 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.870
 in general, all free time 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.270
 and when I deal with them now 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.190
 section that already before stuck out free 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.470
 time to take at least 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:28.490
 more or less stable to do there for two 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.360
 video a day and just continue on 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.830
 Byzantium also we have 3 years old closer to 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.380
 the fly will begin 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.860
 witch kind of hq there will be cigarettes 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.020
 cut everything will be fine just me 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.360
 I want to say it for now that measure let's say 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:49.280
 so temporary measure temporary here and also 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.640
 I want to say that next week 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.790
