halo mark 5 combat Evolved helmet from
the<00:00:11.730> first<00:00:11.940> game<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.440> what<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.710> have

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the first game and this is what I have

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.000 
the first game and this is what I have
so<00:00:14.009> far<00:00:14.660> that's<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.780> piece<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.049> pepakura<00:00:16.560> paper

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
so far that's a piece of pepakura paper

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.830 
so far that's a piece of pepakura paper
and<00:00:17.279> if<00:00:17.340> you're<00:00:17.460> wondering<00:00:17.609> no<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.300> am<00:00:18.600> NOT

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
and if you're wondering no I am NOT

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.570 
and if you're wondering no I am NOT
doing<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.260> paper<00:00:19.470> craft<00:00:19.770> method<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.310> am<00:00:20.430> only

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
doing the paper craft method I am only

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580 
doing the paper craft method I am only
using<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.270> guide<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:22.230> I'm<00:00:22.380> gonna

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
using this as a guide because I'm gonna

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.859 
using this as a guide because I'm gonna
be<00:00:22.680> doing<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.310> foam<00:00:23.550> method<00:00:23.970> which<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> much

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
be doing the foam method which is much

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.310 
be doing the foam method which is much
easier<00:00:25.230> much<00:00:25.500> quicker<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.760> my<00:00:27.000> opinion

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
easier much quicker and in my opinion

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
easier much quicker and in my opinion
much<00:00:28.320> easier<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> already<00:00:29.580> said<00:00:29.730> that

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
much easier I already said that

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.610 
much easier I already said that
damn<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:32.669> I've<00:00:32.790> done<00:00:33.620> before

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
damn it so this is what I've done before

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.610 
damn it so this is what I've done before
this<00:00:34.860> practice<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.180> that<00:00:36.270> an<00:00:36.690> ODST<00:00:37.079> shoulder

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
this practice is that an ODST shoulder

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.619 
this practice is that an ODST shoulder
it's<00:00:38.160> not<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:38.610> because<00:00:38.760> i<00:00:38.940> free-handed

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
it's not as good because i free-handed

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.910 
it's not as good because i free-handed
it<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:39.899> i'd<00:00:39.989> say<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> works<00:00:40.440> pretty<00:00:40.770> well

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
it but i'd say it works pretty well

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
it but i'd say it works pretty well
that's<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:41.969> my<00:00:42.030> shoulder<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.690> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
that's on my shoulder just right and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.069 
that's on my shoulder just right and
then<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.250> rest<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.579> papers<00:00:45.079> I've

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
then this is the rest of the papers I've

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
then this is the rest of the papers I've
only<00:00:46.320> cut<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.950> piece<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:49.440> piece<00:00:49.710> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
only cut out one piece that piece and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.060 
only cut out one piece that piece and
I'd<00:00:50.850> say<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.210> pretty<00:00:51.449> damn<00:00:51.719> beautiful<00:00:52.070> I'm

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
I'd say it's pretty damn beautiful I'm

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.680 
I'd say it's pretty damn beautiful I'm
not<00:00:53.250> using<00:00:53.370> scissors<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:53.969> using<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> knife<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
not using scissors I'm using a knife I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
not using scissors I'm using a knife I
screwed<00:00:55.110> up<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.030> accidentally

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
screwed up here because I accidentally

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.430 
screwed up here because I accidentally
started<00:00:57.360> cutting<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> flaps<00:00:58.050> which<00:00:58.320> I

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
started cutting off the flaps which I

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.290 
started cutting off the flaps which I
don't<00:00:58.620> need<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.800> do<00:00:58.949> because<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> realized<00:01:00.090> that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
don't need to do because I realized that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.840 
don't need to do because I realized that
I'm<00:01:01.199> doing<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.530> foam<00:01:01.710> method<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.430> flaps<00:01:02.699> are

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
I'm doing the foam method the flaps are

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.130 
I'm doing the foam method the flaps are
only<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.180> gluing<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.480> pieces<00:01:03.600> together<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
only for gluing the pieces together and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.509 
only for gluing the pieces together and
I<00:01:04.350> will<00:01:04.500> not<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:04.799> doing<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.040> because<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I will not be doing that because that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.170 
I will not be doing that because that
takes<00:01:05.670> forever<00:01:06.619> it's<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.680> total<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.130> 14<00:01:08.909> pages

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
takes forever it's a total of 14 pages

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
takes forever it's a total of 14 pages
and<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> model<00:01:10.260> right<00:01:10.470> there<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.860> my

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
and this is the model right there on my

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.359 
and this is the model right there on my
screen<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:12.270> pretty<00:01:12.479> damn<00:01:12.630> cool<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.369> thought

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
screen it's pretty damn cool I thought

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.800 
screen it's pretty damn cool I thought
it'd<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.549> easy<00:01:14.790> because<00:01:15.210> since<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.570> from<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it'd be easy because since it's from the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
it'd be easy because since it's from the
first<00:01:15.960> game<00:01:16.259> there's<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> lot<00:01:16.770> less<00:01:16.979> polygons

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
first game there's a lot less polygons

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.999 
first game there's a lot less polygons
than<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.330> Halo<00:01:18.780> 3<00:01:18.990> or<00:01:19.110> halo<00:01:19.259> 4<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.860> it'd<00:01:19.979> be

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
than like Halo 3 or halo 4 so it'd be

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
than like Halo 3 or halo 4 so it'd be
less<00:01:20.280> pages<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.600> less<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.020> hassle<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
less pages and then less of a hassle and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.749 
less pages and then less of a hassle and
the<00:01:22.619> pieces<00:01:23.009> would<00:01:23.130> be<00:01:23.189> bigger

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
the pieces would be bigger

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.390 
the pieces would be bigger
I<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:24.659> big<00:01:24.900> pieces<00:01:25.170> because<00:01:25.799> those<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.220> easy

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
I like big pieces because those are easy

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.069 
I like big pieces because those are easy
to<00:01:26.490> cut<00:01:27.409> let's<00:01:28.409> jazz<00:01:28.560> big<00:01:28.770> pieces<00:01:29.189> like<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 
to cut let's jazz big pieces like that

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.200 
to cut let's jazz big pieces like that
big-ass<00:01:31.079> diamond<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.490> probably<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
big-ass diamond that was probably the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
big-ass diamond that was probably the
hardest<00:01:33.360> piece<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.020> mean<00:01:34.530> second<00:01:35.250> hardest

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
hardest piece I mean second hardest

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.609 
hardest piece I mean second hardest
piece<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.509> had<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> cut<00:01:37.290> at<00:01:37.409> an<00:01:37.500> angle

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
piece because I had to cut at an angle

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.210 
piece because I had to cut at an angle
and<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.040> sucks<00:01:39.229> now<00:01:40.229> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.710> guys<00:01:40.920> have<00:01:41.100> any
