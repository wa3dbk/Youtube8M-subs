relations on the drive and gave him the
14<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.349> you<00:00:28.349> know<00:00:28.439> they<00:00:28.590> did<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> nice<00:00:28.949> job

after<00:00:30.779> that<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.320> that's<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:32.040> thing<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.369> talk

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
after that and that's one thing we talk

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
after that and that's one thing we talk
about<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.820> hole<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.540> position<00:00:33.750> we've<00:00:34.530> got

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
about a hole in that position we've got

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.740 
about a hole in that position we've got
to<00:00:34.770> hold<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.100> field<00:00:35.340> go<00:00:35.489> but<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:36.570> would<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
to hold in the field go but it would be

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.330 
to hold in the field go but it would be
taking<00:00:37.170> taking<00:00:37.500> baby<00:00:37.710> steps<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.280> just

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
taking taking baby steps and just

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.970

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
establish where we are right now and I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.979 
establish where we are right now and I
think<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.370> tells<00:00:41.940> us<00:00:42.120> say<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.510> we're<00:00:42.780> at

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think this tells us say this is we're at

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
what kind of white boat you know some of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
what kind of white boat you know some of
that<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.220> go<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.880> free<00:01:39.060> down<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.390> look

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that we go to some free down and look

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.850 
that we go to some free down and look
and<00:01:39.659> try<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> mix<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.200> up<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.439> give<00:01:40.530> different

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
and try to mix it up and give different

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
and try to mix it up and give different
looks<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.280> know<00:01:41.340> once<00:01:41.700> they<00:01:42.000> put<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
looks I know once they put the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
looks I know once they put the
quarterback<00:01:43.409> scrambled<00:01:43.890> up<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.640> field<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
quarterback scrambled up the field and I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
quarterback scrambled up the field and I
think<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.439> half<00:01:47.180> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
think that was in the first half the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.389 
think that was in the first half the
second<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.899> had<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> cross<00:01:49.860> around<00:01:49.890> over

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
second one we had a cross around over

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.800 
second one we had a cross around over
over<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> middle<00:01:51.030> where<00:01:51.149> they<00:01:51.240> got<00:01:51.390> us<00:01:51.540> into<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
over the middle where they got us into a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.480 
over the middle where they got us into a
formation<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.649> hadn't<00:01:52.890> probably<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
formation that we hadn't probably I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
formation that we hadn't probably I
hadn't<00:01:53.820> worked<00:01:53.970> enough<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.810> we've<00:01:55.049> got<00:01:55.229> to

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hadn't worked enough that we've got to

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.510 
hadn't worked enough that we've got to
be<00:01:55.380> able<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.619> work<00:01:55.710> through<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.250> those

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
be able to work through that and those

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420 
be able to work through that and those
are<00:01:56.729> some<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> issues<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:58.290> see<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:59.340> a

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
is going to get to the to the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.690 
is going to get to the to the
quarterback<00:02:31.120> and<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.160> he<00:02:33.280> didn't<00:02:33.520> quite

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
quarterback and and and he didn't quite

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
touchdown we have a mistake but I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.580 
touchdown we have a mistake but I
probably<00:02:52.239> should<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:52.930> made<00:02:53.140> a<00:02:53.170> different

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
probably should have made a different

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.100 
probably should have made a different
call<00:02:53.800> at<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.190> time<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.970> we<00:02:55.720> talked<00:02:55.930> about

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
call at that time and we talked about

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.960
