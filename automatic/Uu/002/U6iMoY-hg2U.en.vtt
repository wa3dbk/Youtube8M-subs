to<00:07:14.990> go<00:07:15.710> vertical<00:07:16.310> and<00:07:16.610> do<00:07:16.820> a<00:07:16.850> half<00:07:17.090> chillin<00:07:17.720> in

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:17.870 
to go vertical and do a half chillin in

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.640 
to go vertical and do a half chillin in
the<00:07:18.050> c-130<00:07:18.560> hercules<00:07:19.520> and<00:07:20.260> you<00:07:21.260> should<00:07:21.470> know

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:21.650 
the c-130 hercules and you should know

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.220 
the c-130 hercules and you should know
how<00:07:21.890> to<00:07:22.060> manage<00:07:23.060> without<00:07:23.210> bouncing<00:07:24.080> the

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
how to manage without bouncing the

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:29.640 
how to manage without bouncing the
lockheed<00:07:24.650> c-130<00:07:25.130> hercules<00:07:25.730> right<00:07:25.940> now<00:07:27.880> okay

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
lockheed c-130 hercules right now okay

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:36.130 
lockheed c-130 hercules right now okay
so<00:07:30.650> this<00:07:31.160> is<00:07:31.490> ball<00:07:31.970> era<00:07:32.740> signing<00:07:33.740> off<00:07:33.890> I<00:07:35.140> really

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.140 
so this is ball era signing off I really

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.310 
so this is ball era signing off I really
hoped<00:07:36.410> you<00:07:36.740> had<00:07:36.770> a<00:07:37.010> good<00:07:37.280> flight
