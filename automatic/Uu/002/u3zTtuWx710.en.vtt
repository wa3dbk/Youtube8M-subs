different than than they are in England

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.610 
different than than they are in England
I<00:02:12.830> understood<00:02:13.830> from<00:02:14.760> when<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.360> started<00:02:15.990> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
I understood from when I started the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.530 
I understood from when I started the
training<00:02:16.860> sessions<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> had<00:02:18.330> some

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
training sessions that I had some

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.300 
training sessions that I had some
players<00:02:19.459> one

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
players one

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.410 
players one
people<00:02:21.819> Stephanus<00:02:22.270> used<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.020> play<00:02:23.170> at<00:02:23.290> Arsenal

people Stephanus used to play at Arsenal

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.970 
people Stephanus used to play at Arsenal
so<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> was<00:02:25.750> quite<00:02:25.930> conscious<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.950> fact

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
so I was quite conscious of the fact

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
so I was quite conscious of the fact
that<00:02:27.370> they<00:02:28.270> their<00:02:28.720> transition<00:02:29.349> from<00:02:29.560> player

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
that they their transition from player

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.510 
that they their transition from player
to<00:02:30.190> coach<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.300> was<00:02:32.140> quite<00:02:32.380> quick<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.400> is

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
to coach in was quite quick and that is

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.199 
to coach in was quite quick and that is
a<00:02:33.550> key<00:02:33.849> issue<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:35.080> world<00:02:35.860> football<00:02:35.980> that<00:02:36.489> does

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
a key issue in world football that does

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.180 
a key issue in world football that does

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.020 
lot of input that I took back with me as
well<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.099> misconception<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.760> think

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
well that is a misconception I think

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.110 
well that is a misconception I think
that<00:03:07.380> players<00:03:08.580> exceptional<00:03:09.580> players<00:03:09.790> cannot

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
that players exceptional players cannot

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.699 
that players exceptional players cannot
make<00:03:10.360> purchased<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:12.130> think<00:03:12.730> I<00:03:13.709> think

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
make purchased and I think I think

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.770 
make purchased and I think I think
there's<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.950> lot<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.130> players<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.849> that<00:03:16.599> have

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
there's a lot of players and that have

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.740 
there's a lot of players and that have
been<00:03:16.930> great<00:03:17.319> players<00:03:17.769> that<00:03:18.099> never<00:03:18.880> looked<00:03:19.540> at

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
been great players that never looked at

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.850 
been great players that never looked at
coaching<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:21.880> they<00:03:22.120> did<00:03:22.319> then<00:03:23.319> we<00:03:23.500> would<00:03:23.650> see<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
coaching if they did then we would see a

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.979 
coaching if they did then we would see a
lot<00:03:24.069> more<00:03:24.390> great<00:03:25.390> coaches<00:03:25.989> I<00:03:26.170> don't<00:03:27.010> I

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
lot more great coaches I don't I

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.250 
lot more great coaches I don't I
dispelled<00:03:28.989> that<00:03:29.140> theorem<00:03:29.709> because<00:03:31.260> most

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
dispelled that theorem because most

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.789 
dispelled that theorem because most
players<00:03:32.530> at<00:03:33.489> any<00:03:33.730> level<00:03:34.000> they<00:03:34.799> understand

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
players at any level they understand

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.430 
players at any level they understand
what<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.220> took<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.489> play<00:03:37.000> they<00:03:37.390> interacted<00:03:38.230> all

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
what it took to play they interacted all

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.120 
what it took to play they interacted all
their<00:03:38.650> career<00:03:39.040> with<00:03:39.310> players<00:03:40.239> so<00:03:41.049> for<00:03:41.650> me<00:03:41.829> a

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
their career with players so for me a

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.120 
their career with players so for me a
coach<00:03:42.579> who<00:03:43.390> was<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.630> former<00:03:43.870> player<00:03:44.290> will<00:03:45.100> be

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
coach who was a former player will be

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.059 
coach who was a former player will be
able<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.640> relate<00:03:46.200> to<00:03:47.200> what<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.530> players<00:03:47.769> went

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
able to relate to what the players went

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.840 
able to relate to what the players went
through<00:03:49.170> better<00:03:50.170> than<00:03:50.440> any<00:03:51.190> coach<00:03:51.549> that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
through better than any coach that

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.289 
through better than any coach that
hasn't<00:03:52.239> been<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.510> plan<00:03:52.889> if<00:03:53.889> they<00:03:54.430> match<00:03:54.970> this

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
hasn't been a plan if they match this

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.330 
hasn't been a plan if they match this
with<00:03:55.600> their<00:03:55.900> enthusiasm<00:03:56.500> passion<00:03:56.920> and
