clone troopers versions rotas battle
pack<00:00:25.460> because<00:00:26.390> i<00:00:26.690> saw<00:00:27.080> it<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.289> battle<00:00:27.650> pack

pack because i saw it that battle pack
and<00:00:28.039> i<00:00:28.070> thought<00:00:28.220> to<00:00:28.280> myself<00:00:28.400> this<00:00:28.850> Jordan<00:00:29.090> can

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
and i thought to myself this Jordan can

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.499 
and i thought to myself this Jordan can
be<00:00:29.510> a<00:00:29.690> lot<00:00:30.020> better<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:30.500> they<00:00:30.830> gave<00:00:31.130> you<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.550> ton

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
be a lot better and they gave you a ton

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.090 
be a lot better and they gave you a ton
in<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:32.960> but<00:00:33.079> I<00:00:33.140> think<00:00:33.260> they<00:00:33.379> gave<00:00:33.500> you<00:00:33.620> a<00:00:33.739> ton

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
in that but I think they gave you a ton

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.880 
in that but I think they gave you a ton
of<00:00:34.129> great<00:00:34.879> great<00:00:35.270> pieces<00:00:35.570> that<00:00:35.960> you<00:00:36.530> could<00:00:36.710> use

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
of great great pieces that you could use

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.580 
of great great pieces that you could use

features<00:00:55.160> to<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.520> droid<00:00:55.730> ago<00:00:55.969> mainly

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
features to this droid ago mainly

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.200 
features to this droid ago mainly
because<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.649> looks<00:00:57.950> really<00:00:58.309> good<00:00:58.520> in<00:00:58.790> machs

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
because it looks really good in machs

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.639 
because it looks really good in machs
and<00:00:59.540> this<00:00:59.750> is<00:00:59.870> what<00:00:59.989> i've<00:01:00.079> been<00:01:00.140> using<00:01:00.380> it<00:01:00.620> for

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
and this is what i've been using it for

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.990 
and this is what i've been using it for
in<00:01:01.120> is<00:01:02.120> for<00:01:02.450> mocks<00:01:02.690> and<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:04.489> there<00:01:04.640> are<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.790> few

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
in is for mocks and that there are a few

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.429 
in is for mocks and that there are a few
cons<00:01:05.299> though<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.689> that<00:01:05.840> you<00:01:05.899> can't<00:01:06.110> use<00:01:06.290> this

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
cons though is that you can't use this

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:07.870 
cons though is that you can't use this
georgia<00:01:06.770> cuff<00:01:06.890> for<00:01:07.009> animations<00:01:07.610> because<00:01:07.759> it

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
georgia cuff for animations because it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.760 
georgia cuff for animations because it
doesn't<00:01:08.090> roll<00:01:08.360> up<00:01:08.600> as<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.020> probably<00:01:09.350> tell

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
doesn't roll up as you can probably tell

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.980 
doesn't roll up as you can probably tell
by<00:01:09.829> look<00:01:10.159> at<00:01:10.249> the<00:01:10.369> structure<00:01:10.850> it<00:01:11.420> doesn't<00:01:11.810> roll

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
by look at the structure it doesn't roll

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.080 
by look at the structure it doesn't roll
up<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:13.069> other<00:01:13.159> cons<00:01:13.399> that<00:01:13.609> it's<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:13.789> little

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
up and the other cons that it's a little

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.199 
up and the other cons that it's a little
big<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.539> have<00:01:15.170> a<00:01:15.200> figure<00:01:15.709> right<00:01:16.009> here<00:01:16.039> I<00:01:16.579> happen

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
big I have a figure right here I happen

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.209 
big I have a figure right here I happen
to<00:01:17.270> have<00:01:17.389> it<00:01:17.569> to<00:01:17.719> show<00:01:17.749> you<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.350> size<00:01:19.189> comparison

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:19.219 
to have it to show you a size comparison

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:22.419 
to have it to show you a size comparison
but<00:01:20.149> you<00:01:20.299> see<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:21.649> troika's<00:01:22.039> are<00:01:22.159> not<00:01:22.279> that

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
but you see the troika's are not that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.090 
but you see the troika's are not that
big<00:01:22.639> but<00:01:22.969> i<00:01:23.749> don't<00:01:24.619> think<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.799> really<00:01:24.859> matters

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
big but i don't think it really matters

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.889 
big but i don't think it really matters
too<00:01:25.369> much<00:01:25.399> because<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.119> looks<00:01:26.359> very<00:01:26.539> good

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
too much because it looks very good

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.309 
too much because it looks very good
and<00:01:28.149> one<00:01:29.149> of<00:01:29.179> my<00:01:29.270> viewers<00:01:29.329> i<00:01:29.600> suggested<00:01:30.139> that<00:01:30.229> I

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
and one of my viewers i suggested that I

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.349 
and one of my viewers i suggested that I
make<00:01:30.469> a<00:01:30.499> video<00:01:30.770> show<00:01:31.009> in<00:01:31.130> this<00:01:31.219> short<00:01:31.369> ago<00:01:31.639> but

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
make a video show in this short ago but

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.649 
make a video show in this short ago but
basically<00:01:32.719> you<00:01:33.619> can<00:01:33.770> pretty<00:01:33.889> much<00:01:33.979> tell<00:01:34.630> how<00:01:35.630> I

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
basically you can pretty much tell how I

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.249 
basically you can pretty much tell how I
was<00:01:36.049> able<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:37.310> build<00:01:37.459> this<00:01:37.700> I<00:01:38.109> used<00:01:39.109> a

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
was able to to build this I used a

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.410 
was able to to build this I used a
similar<00:01:39.499> leg<00:01:40.399> structure<00:01:40.880> but<00:01:41.060> it's<00:01:41.209> a<00:01:41.270> little

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
similar leg structure but it's a little

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.269 
similar leg structure but it's a little
different<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:44.649> do<00:01:45.649> what<00:01:45.770> he<00:01:45.829> call<00:01:45.979> it

00:01:46.269 --> 00:01:46.279 
different to do what he call it

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:49.059 
different to do what he call it
I<00:01:46.810> don't<00:01:47.810> know<00:01:47.869> be<00:01:48.079> able<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.349> make<00:01:48.529> the<00:01:48.709> rest<00:01:48.950> of

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
I don't know be able to make the rest of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:54.249 
I don't know be able to make the rest of
it<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:52.389> you<00:01:53.389> can<00:01:53.509> pretty<00:01:53.659> much<00:01:53.749> see<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
it and you can pretty much see the

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.269 
it and you can pretty much see the
structure<00:01:54.679> behind<00:01:54.829> it

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
structure behind it

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.889 
structure behind it
you<00:01:55.549> can<00:01:55.759> even<00:01:55.849> angle<00:01:56.179> them<00:01:56.270> up<00:01:56.419> a<00:01:56.539> little<00:01:56.689> bit

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
you can even angle them up a little bit

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.199 
you can even angle them up a little bit
if<00:01:57.020> you<00:01:57.049> want<00:01:57.139> to<00:01:57.529> it's<00:01:58.189> a<00:01:58.279> stretch<00:01:58.639> what

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
if you want to it's a stretch what

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.419 
if you want to it's a stretch what
