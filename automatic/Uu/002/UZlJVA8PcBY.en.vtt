of the magic that makes this possible so
the<00:00:39.300> first<00:00:39.540> thing<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.870> want<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.110> do<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.620> take

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
the first thing you want to do is take

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.040 
the first thing you want to do is take
your<00:00:41.399> black<00:00:41.760> polish<00:00:42.360> give<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:42.989> shake

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
your black polish give it a good shake

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.810 
your black polish give it a good shake
and<00:00:43.620> drop<00:00:44.579> some<00:00:44.820> drops<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:46.230> water<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
and drop some drops into the water I

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.670 
and drop some drops into the water I
like<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.969> touch<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.719> water<00:00:48.930> as<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.379> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
like to touch the water as I do it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740 
like to touch the water as I do it
because<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.160> gives<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.610> different<00:00:50.750> spread

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.900 
out I'm going to put a few in different
areas<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.770> thicker<00:00:56.250> amounts<00:00:56.789> of

Polish in different areas now is where

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.599 
Polish in different areas now is where
the<00:01:00.690> magic<00:01:00.840> happens<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.160> typical

spray we're going to spray far away from
the<00:01:09.659> bowl<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.590> doesn't<00:01:10.860> interfere

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
the bowl so that it doesn't interfere
