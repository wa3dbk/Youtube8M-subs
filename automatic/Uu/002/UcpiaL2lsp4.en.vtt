is<00:00:49.320> set<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.770> same<00:00:50.219> world<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.730> dark<00:00:50.940> souls

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
is set in the same world as dark souls

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150 
is set in the same world as dark souls
but<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:51.570> no<00:00:51.719> direct<00:00:52.020> story<00:00:52.469> connection

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but there's no direct story connection

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
but there's no direct story connection
so<00:00:53.789> whatcha<00:00:54.210> boy<00:00:54.449> said<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.020> actually<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.770> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
so whatcha boy said is actually if the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.229 
so whatcha boy said is actually if the
first<00:00:56.250> game<00:00:56.460> was<00:00:56.579> set<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> North<00:00:57.180> Pole

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
first game was set in the North Pole

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.750 
first game was set in the North Pole
this<00:00:57.750> one<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> South<00:00:58.590> Pole<00:00:58.949> so

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this one would be in the South Pole so

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
this one would be in the South Pole so
you<00:00:59.820> can<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.629> very<00:01:00.690> little

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you can see that there's very little

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.009 
you can see that there's very little
actual<00:01:01.559> connection<00:01:02.280> geographically<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.480> you

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
actual connection geographically and you

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
actual connection geographically and you
know<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.290> might<00:01:04.409> still<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.220> same<00:01:05.250> gods

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
know there might still be the same gods

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.850 
know there might still be the same gods
or<00:01:06.540> maybe<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.930> find<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.320> any<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
or maybe we find out that any of the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.380 
or maybe we find out that any of the
gods<00:01:08.070> from<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> first<00:01:08.700> Dark<00:01:08.970> Souls<00:01:09.240> are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
gods from the first Dark Souls are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
gods from the first Dark Souls are
actually<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.960> local<00:01:10.650> entities<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> don't

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
actually just local entities that don't

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
actually just local entities that don't
act<00:01:11.909> across<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.630> entire<00:01:12.869> world<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.320> all

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
act across the entire world at all

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679 
act across the entire world at all
because<00:01:14.250> there<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.729> idea<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
because there was an idea that all of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.359 
because there was an idea that all of
that<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.229> sort<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.530> sham<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.250> they

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
that was just sort of a sham that they

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.240 
that was just sort of a sham that they
had<00:01:17.549> said<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> take<00:01:18.900> power<00:01:19.110> another<00:01:19.979> story

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
had said to take power another story

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.030 
had said to take power another story
detail<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.420> sparse<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.290> time<00:01:22.710> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
detail very very sparse is that time is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.520 
detail very very sparse is that time is
one<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> central<00:01:23.909> themes<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.900> kind<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
one of the central themes a kind of a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.359 
one of the central themes a kind of a
driving<00:01:26.180> idea<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.630> dark<00:01:27.960> souls<00:01:28.170> 2<00:01:28.350> which<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
driving idea for dark souls 2 which is a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.980 
driving idea for dark souls 2 which is a
bit<00:01:29.579> different<00:01:29.790> from<00:01:29.970> anything<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.810> we've

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
bit different from anything that we've

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.410 
bit different from anything that we've
seen<00:01:31.170> before<00:01:31.290> again<00:01:31.710> because<00:01:32.100> really<00:01:32.790> time

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
seen before again because really time

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.469 
seen before again because really time
hasn't<00:01:33.810> played<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.470> much<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.549> role<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
hasn't played that much of a role in the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
hasn't played that much of a role in the
other<00:01:36.600> games<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.200> know<00:01:37.290> there's<00:01:37.500> been<00:01:37.560> how

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
other games you know there's been how

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
far you are developing the story but

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.480 
far you are developing the story but
that's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.470> little<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:40.770> different<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.340> not

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
that's a little bit different it's not

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.090 
that's a little bit different it's not

like ocarina of time or certainly not

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
based on what they do so maybe we'll be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.660 
based on what they do so maybe we'll be
seeing<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.590> I'm<00:01:55.920> sure<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.640> a

seeing that I'm sure it would be a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.149 
seeing that I'm sure it would be a

simply<00:02:17.200> because<00:02:17.440> demons<00:02:18.069> souls<00:02:18.370> had<00:02:18.519> a<00:02:18.549> much

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
simply because demons souls had a much

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.220 
simply because demons souls had a much
richer<00:02:18.819> online<00:02:19.390> experience<00:02:19.810> than<00:02:19.959> dark<00:02:20.170> souls

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
in my my opinion and also it was all

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.699

Miyazaki<00:03:23.620> he<00:03:23.859> clarified<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.940> sort<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.239> idea

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
Miyazaki he clarified the sort of idea

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.789 
Miyazaki he clarified the sort of idea
that<00:03:25.720> they<00:03:25.810> were<00:03:25.870> getting<00:03:26.169> at<00:03:26.319> by<00:03:26.500> saying

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
that they were getting at by saying

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.890 
that they were getting at by saying
there's<00:03:27.370> certainly<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.849> core<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.450> needs<00:03:28.690> to

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
there's certainly a core that needs to

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.110 
there's certainly a core that needs to
be<00:03:29.049> protected<00:03:29.260> but<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:30.370> there's<00:03:30.639> a<00:03:30.760> lot

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
be protected but that there's a lot

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.879 
be protected but that there's a lot
around<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.630> cord<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.049> we<00:03:32.109> need<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.410> fix<00:03:32.650> or

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
around that cord that we need to fix or

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.979 
around that cord that we need to fix or
adjust<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.849> that's<00:03:34.269> something<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.630> think<00:03:34.690> even

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
adjust so that's something I think even

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.839 
adjust so that's something I think even
the<00:03:35.200> most<00:03:35.319> die-hard<00:03:35.530> fans<00:03:36.069> can<00:03:36.340> probably

the most die-hard fans can probably

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.479 
the most die-hard fans can probably

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
agree with if you've ever died to a dead

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.979 
agree with if you've ever died to a dead
angle<00:03:39.730> hit<00:03:40.120> where<00:03:40.299> you've<00:03:40.450> got<00:03:40.569> your<00:03:40.720> shield

angle hit where you've got your shield
pointed<00:03:41.319> right<00:03:41.470> at<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.769> person<00:03:42.160> but<00:03:42.519> because

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
pointed right at the person but because

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.940 
pointed right at the person but because
of<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.299> angle<00:03:43.630> that<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:44.079> were<00:03:44.139> facing<00:03:44.590> when

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
of the angle that they were facing when

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.470 
of the angle that they were facing when
they<00:03:45.099> saw<00:03:45.280> up<00:03:45.340> swung<00:03:45.639> their<00:03:45.819> sordid<00:03:46.209> hit<00:03:46.359> you

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
they saw up swung their sordid hit you

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.120 
they saw up swung their sordid hit you
through<00:03:46.870> your<00:03:47.049> shield<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.500> killed<00:03:47.739> you<00:03:47.919> or

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
through your shield and killed you or

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.539 
through your shield and killed you or
you<00:03:48.910> died<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.329> laggy<00:03:49.569> backstab<00:03:50.169> I<00:03:50.459> think<00:03:51.459> you

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
you died to a laggy backstab I think you

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.460 
you died to a laggy backstab I think you
can<00:03:51.700> probably<00:03:51.730> agree<00:03:52.329> that<00:03:52.630> there<00:03:52.780> are<00:03:52.930> some

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
can probably agree that there are some

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.409 
can probably agree that there are some
issues<00:03:53.919> that<00:03:54.250> need<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.549> be<00:03:54.639> resolved<00:03:54.819> around

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
issues that need to be resolved around

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.020 
issues that need to be resolved around
that<00:03:55.629> core<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:56.200> Dark<00:03:56.709> Souls<00:03:56.769> that<00:03:57.160> is<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.819> very

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
that core of Dark Souls that is so very

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.879 
that core of Dark Souls that is so very
magnificent<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:59.169> is<00:03:59.260> all<00:03:59.470> that<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.650> have<00:03:59.799> to

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it's still probably a long ways off but
