anything to it really the suspension and
everything<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:58.530> all<00:00:58.829> stop<00:00:59.219> down<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
everything this all stop down to the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.880 
everything this all stop down to the
shafts<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.829> everything<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.789> did<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.180> I

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
shafts and everything all I did is I

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.710 
shafts and everything all I did is I
adjusted<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.400> tension<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> Saxon<00:01:06.450> keep<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
adjusted the tension on a Saxon keep the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.020 
adjusted the tension on a Saxon keep the
car<00:01:06.930> off<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.200> ground

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030

this<00:01:09.030> car<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.540> wheel<00:01:09.720> drive<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.939> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
this car is all wheel drive so the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.700 
this car is all wheel drive so the
acceleration<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.049> easier<00:01:13.080> than<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
acceleration is a lot easier than the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.190 
acceleration is a lot easier than the
Rustler<00:01:15.020> under<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.610> aluminum<00:01:18.200> shock

between the gtp jooheon ah a ruffler
weight<00:02:26.780> which<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.500> still<00:02:27.739> like<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> lot<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.870> still

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
weight which I still like a lot I still

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.699 
weight which I still like a lot I still
work<00:02:30.049> on<00:02:30.230> him<00:02:30.670> here's<00:02:31.670> my<00:02:31.790> son<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:33.349> he<00:02:33.530> ran

over a hundred miles an hour with when
they<00:02:36.410> said<00:02:36.739> side-by-side<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.430> guys<00:02:37.670> see<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
they said side-by-side you guys see the

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.970 
they said side-by-side you guys see the
difference<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.420> size<00:02:41.860> huge<00:02:42.860> difference

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
difference in size huge difference

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.780 
difference in size huge difference
but<00:02:44.519> they<00:02:44.610> both<00:02:44.790> run<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.030> same<00:02:45.330> motor<00:02:49.790> same

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
but they both run the same motor same

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.770 
but they both run the same motor same
tires<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.569> everything

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.620 

and<00:03:00.320> here's<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:01.700> contraption<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.510> was

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
and here's a little contraption I was

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.760 
and here's a little contraption I was
reading<00:03:02.930> today<00:03:03.020> on<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.970> video<00:03:04.970> at<00:03:05.120> cam<00:03:05.300> and<00:03:05.990> a

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
reading today on a video at cam and a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.870 
reading today on a video at cam and a
rope<00:03:07.040> I<00:03:07.190> just<00:03:07.400> mounted<00:03:07.730> it<00:03:07.880> up<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.960> just<00:03:09.880> see

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
rope I just mounted it up here just see

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.600 
rope I just mounted it up here just see
how<00:03:10.940> big<00:03:11.180> it<00:03:11.300> is<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.190> surprise<00:03:13.190> it<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.490> a
