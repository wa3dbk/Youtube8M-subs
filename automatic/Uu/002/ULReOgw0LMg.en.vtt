 unplugging the flu 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 it may sound m but it is very 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.320
 dangerous to manipulate it if they have 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.669

 place your shape so here a lot 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 do beforehand a piece of paper that 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 exactly the size of the grid 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.820
 with the spacing that we need with this 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.370
 paper 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.960
