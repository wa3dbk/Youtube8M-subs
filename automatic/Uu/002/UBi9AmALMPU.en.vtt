00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:20.640 

I<00:00:17.789> wanted<00:00:18.789> to<00:00:18.909> do<00:00:19.060> a<00:00:19.089> very<00:00:19.599> brief<00:00:19.900> apartment

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
I wanted to do a very brief apartment

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.859 
I wanted to do a very brief apartment
tour<00:00:20.829> obviously<00:00:21.730> there<00:00:21.939> is<00:00:22.089> no<00:00:22.419> furniture

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
tour obviously there is no furniture

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.019 
tour obviously there is no furniture
here<00:00:23.109> because<00:00:23.439> I<00:00:23.470> literally<00:00:23.980> just<00:00:24.519> moved<00:00:24.849> in

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
here because I literally just moved in

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.120 
here because I literally just moved in
but<00:00:25.749> I<00:00:25.779> think<00:00:26.109> it<00:00:26.199> would<00:00:26.319> be<00:00:26.409> really<00:00:26.560> cool<00:00:26.859> to

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
but I think it would be really cool to

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.989 
but I think it would be really cool to
do<00:00:27.339> a<00:00:27.640> before<00:00:28.300> and<00:00:28.449> after<00:00:28.630> comparison<00:00:29.349> so<00:00:30.159> this

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
do a before and after comparison so this

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.350 
do a before and after comparison so this
is<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.899> brief<00:00:32.560> overview<00:00:33.190> of<00:00:33.430> my<00:00:33.910> empty

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
today and that makes me really jittery

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.220 
today and that makes me really jittery
so<00:00:42.940> I'm<00:00:43.030> gonna<00:00:43.240> try<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.450> hold<00:00:43.660> the<00:00:43.810> camera<00:00:43.990> as

so I'm gonna try to hold the camera as
steady<00:00:44.470> as<00:00:44.710> possible<00:00:44.970> so<00:00:45.970> this<00:00:46.360> is<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:46.720> view

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
steady as possible so this is the view

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.680 
steady as possible so this is the view
when<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.440> first<00:00:47.770> walk<00:00:48.130> in<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:49.510> first

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
thing I'm gonna say right off the bat is

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.370 
thing I'm gonna say right off the bat is
that<00:00:51.070> I<00:00:51.250> hate<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:52.240> lighting<00:00:52.630> in<00:00:52.750> here<00:00:52.780> so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
that I hate the lighting in here so

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.360 
that I hate the lighting in here so
that's<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.650> first<00:00:53.860> thing<00:00:53.980> I'm<00:00:54.100> going<00:00:54.130> to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:54.370 
that's the first thing I'm going to

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
that's the first thing I'm going to
change<00:00:54.700> but<00:00:55.390> this<00:00:55.720> is<00:00:56.110> the<00:00:56.560> living<00:00:56.800> room<00:00:56.950> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
change but this is the living room and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.440 
change but this is the living room and
this<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.230> dining<00:00:59.620> room<00:01:00.070> or<00:01:00.340> let's<00:01:01.030> be<00:01:01.210> real

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
this is the dining room or let's be real

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.810 
this is the dining room or let's be real
dining<00:01:01.840> area<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.470> don't<00:01:02.739> think<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.010> is<00:01:03.070> big

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
dining area I don't think this is big

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.660 
dining area I don't think this is big
enough<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.210> classify<00:01:04.659> as<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.899> legit<00:01:05.439> room<00:01:05.710> and

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
enough to classify as a legit room and

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.059 
enough to classify as a legit room and
then<00:01:06.850> if<00:01:06.969> you<00:01:07.090> look<00:01:07.299> this<00:01:07.539> way<00:01:07.679> you<00:01:08.679> can<00:01:08.859> see

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
then if you look this way you can see

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.429 
then if you look this way you can see
the<00:01:09.219> kitchen<00:01:09.729> actually<00:01:10.299> this<00:01:10.689> is<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.140> view<00:01:11.319> of

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
the kitchen actually this is the view of

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.050 
the kitchen actually this is the view of
the<00:01:11.560> living<00:01:11.829> room<00:01:12.069> from<00:01:12.219> the<00:01:12.310> dining<00:01:12.670> room<00:01:12.700> and

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
the living room from the dining room and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.809 
the living room from the dining room and
again<00:01:13.600> that<00:01:14.200> light<00:01:14.380> just<00:01:14.619> looks<00:01:14.829> so<00:01:15.249> weird

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
again that light just looks so weird

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.160 
again that light just looks so weird
but<00:01:16.659> this<00:01:17.020> is<00:01:17.319> the<00:01:17.469> kitchen<00:01:17.649> and<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:19.780> closet

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
but this is the kitchen and that closet

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.940 
but this is the kitchen and that closet
has<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.159> washer<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:21.909> dryer<00:01:22.149> so<00:01:22.840> nothing<00:01:23.619> too

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
has the washer and dryer so nothing too

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.899 
has the washer and dryer so nothing too
interesting<00:01:24.819> and<00:01:25.450> obviously<00:01:26.350> I<00:01:26.710> already<00:01:27.609> have

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909

need to go grocery shopping and so that
is<00:01:36.459> the<00:01:37.299> kitchen<00:01:37.719> so<00:01:38.649> now<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.009> are<00:01:39.459> turning

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179

into<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.920> bedroom<00:01:42.280> and<00:01:43.200> again<00:01:44.200> lighting<00:01:45.189> is

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
into the bedroom and again lighting is

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.870 
into the bedroom and again lighting is
not<00:01:45.639> really<00:01:45.969> that<00:01:46.090> great<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.670> like<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
not really that great but I like the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.389 
not really that great but I like the
amount<00:01:49.149> of<00:01:49.179> space<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.479> I<00:01:49.749> have<00:01:50.020> and<00:01:50.409> this<00:01:51.100> is

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
amount of space that I have and this is

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.769 
amount of space that I have and this is
the<00:01:52.149> window<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:54.729> nighttime<00:01:54.999> right<00:01:55.359> now<00:01:55.479> so

00:01:55.769 --> 00:01:55.779 
the window it's nighttime right now so

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:58.260 
the window it's nighttime right now so
that's<00:01:56.139> why<00:01:56.200> I'm<00:01:56.380> not<00:01:56.560> opening<00:01:57.459> windows<00:01:57.849> and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
that's why I'm not opening windows and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.899 
that's why I'm not opening windows and
right<00:01:58.899> here<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.409> what<00:01:59.799> is<00:01:59.920> supposed<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.429> be<00:02:00.520> a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
right here is what is supposed to be a

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.590 
right here is what is supposed to be a
walk-in<00:02:01.719> closet<00:02:02.049> where<00:02:02.679> I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
walk-in closet where I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.560

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
they can't walk in right now but I've

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
they can't walk in right now but I've
never<00:02:07.110> had<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> walk-in<00:02:07.619> closet<00:02:07.890> before<00:02:08.220> and
