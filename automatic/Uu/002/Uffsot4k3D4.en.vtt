banana and I know you're probably like

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.150 
banana and I know you're probably like
what<00:03:26.970> banana<00:03:27.540> but<00:03:28.260> when<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.560> freeze<00:03:28.830> it<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.530 
what banana but when you freeze it it
actually<00:03:29.580> kind<00:03:29.760> of<00:03:29.790> just<00:03:30.000> makes<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.270> creamy

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
actually kind of just makes it creamy

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.360 
actually kind of just makes it creamy
and<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:31.050> so<00:03:31.380> much<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:31.740> banana

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and not so much like a banana

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.910 
and not so much like a banana
you<00:03:32.850> also<00:03:33.060> need<00:03:33.330> some<00:03:33.390> almond<00:03:34.050> milk<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> used<00:03:34.740> a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
you also need some almond milk I used a

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.590 
you also need some almond milk I used a
quarter<00:03:35.160> cup<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.550> this

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.570 

and<00:03:39.680> lastly<00:03:40.680> you<00:03:40.920> will<00:03:40.980> need<00:03:41.040> some<00:03:41.370> iced

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
and lastly you will need some iced

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.460 
and lastly you will need some iced
coffee<00:03:41.940> or<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.480> coffee<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.140> chilled

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
coffee or just coffee that you chilled

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.130 
coffee or just coffee that you chilled
so<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:43.950> poured<00:03:44.550> in<00:03:44.640> a<00:03:44.790> cup<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.180> iced<00:03:45.360> coffee<00:03:45.720> with

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
so I poured in a cup of iced coffee with

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.110 
so I poured in a cup of iced coffee with
my<00:03:46.350> frozen<00:03:46.620> banana<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.310> almond<00:03:47.700> milk<00:03:47.730> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
my frozen banana and almond milk and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.810 
my frozen banana and almond milk and
then<00:03:48.540> I'm<00:03:48.630> just<00:03:48.660> blending<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:49.350> all<00:03:49.590> together

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
then I'm just blending this all together

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.190 
then I'm just blending this all together
as<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.180> leaves<00:03:51.480> turn<00:03:51.960> brown<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:54.200> that's

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
as the leaves turn brown and that's

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.990 
as the leaves turn brown and that's
really<00:03:55.530> all<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:55.920> do<00:03:56.160> is<00:03:56.370> just<00:03:56.550> blend<00:03:56.880> it

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
really all you do is just blend it

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.940 
really all you do is just blend it
together<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.570> you<00:03:57.780> have<00:03:57.960> this<00:03:58.110> creamy<00:03:58.560> iced

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
together and you have this creamy iced

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.150 
together and you have this creamy iced
coffee<00:03:59.370> drink<00:03:59.850> also<00:04:00.330> just<00:04:00.990> note<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.590> didn't

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
coffee drink also just note I didn't

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.700 
coffee drink also just note I didn't
make<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:02.700> up<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.300> would<00:04:04.020> probably<00:04:04.260> think<00:04:04.470> of

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
make this up I would probably think of

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.080 
make this up I would probably think of
banana<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.160> coffee<00:04:05.310> would<00:04:05.490> be<00:04:05.610> super<00:04:05.940> weird

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
banana and coffee would be super weird

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.880 
banana and coffee would be super weird
together<00:04:06.330> but<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.930> totally<00:04:07.350> forget<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.800> a

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
together but you totally forget it's a

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.250 
together but you totally forget it's a
banana<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:08.520> really<00:04:08.880> good<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.960> met
