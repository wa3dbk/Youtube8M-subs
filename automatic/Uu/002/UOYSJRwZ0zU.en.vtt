00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.050
 The goal is the cause of the sunspot's magnetic field 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:04.730
 Sun 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.369
 As the sun turns spinning and animals embrace magnetic force lines 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.609
 where these lines appear the surface that does not penetrate price 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.609
 sunspots 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.089
 and when the lines of force are again withdrawn throughout the circle 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.119
 he seems another phenomenon 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.810
 attracted by a horseshoe magnet scorching against large arcs 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.810
 Gases the magnetic stripes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.900
 the twin probes stains 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.920
 Double sunspots often indicate the exit and the reentry spunk 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 your power line up 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.840
 in our spectrum like this shows the effect of the magnetic field in no one 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.170
 sunspots 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.370
 Here, the inverse relationship indicates forms of intensity 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.560
 a thousand times stronger than that of the magnetic field of our planet earth 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.130
 Haber questions remain open 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.450
 What happens in sunspots and why are they cooler than the circle of light? 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.980
 by appearing 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.969
 the lines of force creating sunspots 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.740
 into the gases in its interior and slow 7 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 slower Gaza means lower temperatures 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.970
 and lower temperatures are shown in dark colors 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.750
 Magnit force is also the cause of the platform offering centers around 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.990
 Sunspots that radiate spread the iron filings in the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990
 Close to a magnet scattered 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.910
 these sunspots were done twice 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.830
 not in different 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.840
 not the invisible one 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 and now old in the red light of hydrogen 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.900
 Both pictures show huge ones that are around magnetic force lines around 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 Find 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.970
 each of these little brother in the yellow bubbles 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 is about the size of the Texas area 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:15.489
 below it goes down to the center of the sun 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.410
 to know from the surface 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.410
 It's almost a million kilometers 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.919
 At the center, the nuclear fusion takes place 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.919
 Hydrogen nuclei transform into Kiel IOM 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.629
 the fusion is caused by enormous heat and pressure 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.459
 the center of the sun works like a constantly active hydrogen bomb 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.490
 Hydrogen nuclei collide with such force 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.919
 that they merge and change 

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:53.349
 here the second 600 million tons of hydrogen turn into 596 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.650
 Million tons of helium the missing four million tons 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.650
 These energies transform energies 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:06.629
 As if swimming in a tough mush would take a single particle 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.599
 this energy up to a million years zigzagged by the density of the 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:16.349
 Company founder is outward to penetrate up to one million years around 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.809
 to arrive here in the kundus affair 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:22.059
 before I get up atmosphere of the sun 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.709
 while in the greed the rays are carried upwards to rise 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.989
 Temperatures of 6000 degrees in the lower KomoÃŸ ferry to almost one 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.189
 half a million degrees in the outer layer 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.349
 this dark spot 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:35.930
 shows a prominences 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.150
 a hydrogen production which is in the grandfathers clock 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.120
 These protocols became serious against the background of that light circle of the 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.120
 Sun surface seen 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:54.309
 the skis hit the quota brands right through the grandfathers 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.529
 to scale it next to the earth scale 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.959
 Foto Berentzen can run over millions of kilometers 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.209
 4 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.909
 r 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.889
 this is a particularly spectacular event in the 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:37.270
 high volume 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.060
 an option with energy from ten million hydrogen bombs 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:46.430
 Velen 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.870
 such outbreaks emit huge amounts of material 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.570
 at a speed of many millions of kilometers per hour 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.659
 Energy charged particles are pushed outward 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.659
 a cause for the solar wind 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.580
 the second cause are those explosions in the light 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:05.419
 the atmosphere 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.419
 take place in the halo of the sun 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.499
 Ben 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:11.770
 With 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.319
 their garden Springer solar wind sprayed a stream of electric 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:18.370
 charged particles in the direction of the planets 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.190
 they will reach the earth in about a day but they will be through ours 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.069
 you averted something fairer 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.700
 only at the magnet poles 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.700
 when the particles penetrate into the earth's atmosphere, where they remain in 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.169
 a spiraling movement 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.740
 they form two oval crowns 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.770
 which encircle the magnetic north and south poles 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.469
 while the particles react with our upper atmosphere 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.279
 develop spectacular light phenomenon 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:47.279
 the aurora has 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.400
 in the northern hemisphere we do not call them yet 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.350
 on the other hand, polar lights on the southern side
