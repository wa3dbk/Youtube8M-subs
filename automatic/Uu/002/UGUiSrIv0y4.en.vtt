00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.809
 tell about the hero 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.320
 the character itself has a long history but us 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.930
 interesting is a certain point of it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.450
 superhero career that time when he 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.210
 was a member of the new waters team 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.909
 this team brought out superheroes she 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.159
 completely new level they started to shoot 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.990
 reality TV in which they fought 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.930
 real supervillains 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.850
 small towns throughout they 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.399
 periodically durachek and even unreasonably 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.399
 risking various viewers and 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.659
 raise the show ratings so happened in 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.509
 this time miss temp 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.880
 new wars receive information that in 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.850
 this town next to one school is tasted 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.009
 not and atrocities with his team and then 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.740
 they decide to go on arrest 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.049
 with the film crew in place 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.969
 it becomes clear that nitro is where 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.219
 more dangerous opponent was thinking about 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:43.079
 speedball but still he decides not 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.329
 seek help from the avengers 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.459
 or someone else which leads to 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.560
 the most severe collisions at which 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:52.979
 nitro arrange a powerful explosion 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.860
 killing 6,112 most people 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.350
 of which 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.630
 these are the only survivors it turns out 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.820
 sleeps under what automatically makes it 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.310
 scapegoat because the whole country saw 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.970
 live because of what happened 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.760
 tragedy 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.670
 Robbie gets the stigma of an infanticide and 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.770
 most hated man america all 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.350
 it even at the act of undermining 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 mental state for half a year and even his 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.790
 abilities refuses to work 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.310
 right now to activate them 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.770
 he must be experiencing a train of blood doing 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 order for a new suit that contains 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.930
 Statement 612 inward spikes on 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.290
 one for each we omit varieties and 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.060
 taken by the trees tormented by the way exactly 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.739
 because of this tragedy begins 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.080
 global comic event 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.989
 marvel civil war which 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.060
 divides the heroes over the shafts and so 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.220
 martyr to atone 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.320
 join the team of villains who 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.510
 is serving the government in 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.180
 led by the Mormons about the old composition 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 commands martyr rings on others beyond 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.709
 people who refused to register 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.600
 and around this period begin 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.570
 events of the comic about which we are today 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.760
 we say that Robbie never did 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.690
 went on the mend he became even more 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.209
 closed 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.150
 his room is filled with newspaper clippings 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.180
 covering events at stanford as well 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.400
 all notebooks and walls inscribed with the numbers that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.030
 begin to disturb osbourne and tony 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.280
 stark 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.350
 to understand what these mean 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.269
 the sequences they are taking 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.920
 various attempts from helping 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.739
 professional psychologist 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.290
 before the interrogation but all to no avail 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.070
 bolden continues to repeat those numbers 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.510
 out loud and a writer wherever possible 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.130
 similar behavior leads 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.140
 osbourne and other team members 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.810
 Thunder to the conclusion that Holden 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.940
 completely crazy and it is this 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.460
 moment he escapes 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.650
 this direction and here are a couple of reports 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.490
 that robby downloaded the entire database 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.920
 hermetic bags 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.710
 and also has launch codes 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.040
 nuclear missiles well then we have 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.480
 mentally unstable person 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.580
 broken complex survivor 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 and wine and for many innocent victims 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.800
 one of the most knowledgeable 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.630
 secret organizations of the world and admission 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.230
 nuclear weapons of the country 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.350
 what does god for himself want ? 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.989
 mad what motives pursue the answer to 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:20.200
 this question and many others you will find out 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.600
 reading the roots from myself I want to say that 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.570
 I liked the story and the story 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.520
 sort of organs but the whole comic is beautiful 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.370
 drawn has an intriguing plot 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.920
 and the ending is generally beyond praise 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.260
 I liked the presence of such characters as 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.060
 tony stark and norman osborne very 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.530
 interesting to observe their attitude 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.470
 to each other and to the martyr 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.480
 by the way personally it seemed to me that the author really 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.120
 too suspiciously like an actor 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.370
 tommy whether johns why in this and what 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.030
 It is a suit for students with all these 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.910
 spiked 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.280
 Often this is emphasized 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.710
 during the activation of the martyr's ability 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.200
 o collection even somehow compared the costume with 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.600
 do an ancient instrument of torture iron 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.880
 Well today's edition went to 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.040
 end hopefully dating this character 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.140
 you will like no less than me 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.480
 I promise to introduce you to not 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:14.100
 less interesting intriguing stories 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.100
 but for now
