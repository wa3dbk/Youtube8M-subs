00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:13.219
 People 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.140
 overview card August so what in Internet browser view 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.289

 so can children's brothers one 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.429
 4 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.550
 Dr 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.660
 active 1 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.750
 sounds like the first entry 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.370
 Lobenstein us-version of animal feed 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.370
 I know 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.870
 and unpack that also the escape 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.400
 delete the assets 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.570
 a configuration of it is not necessary 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.640
 Round so staged stood easy to expect grits 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.000
 you could just let him run this time directly 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 "Then we could double-fill it 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
 but now we have to release that again 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.480
 as hard as it could be 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.240
 on the Fritz box 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 the IEC had added victorious-willow project awarding 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.390
 here cooks other applications 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.390
 it works 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.710
 and to get into this propaganda at all, but you have the PR 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.610
 Have enabled Expert View 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.740
 then click on "Advanced Settings" on both systems 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.860
 at the very bottom, expert opinion of the composer in the 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.340
 short program 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.190
 so it's a cheese depot I'm doing now from 80 to 80 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.960
 if you enter an address in the address bar 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.600
 the automatic and 80 uses that is html 4 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.220
 if phone 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 Thunder 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.370
 Here it is indeed on my PC to find out 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.900
 this city and from the provided the write 3 score 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.769
 only the interpack addresses the local addresses of a machine 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.069
 must stand here 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.089
 so and then at the court 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.509
 Day of the 1st 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:21.679
 too high 3 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.679
 SAP won 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.659
 and mean 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.049
 yes, there was also a direct try 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.049
 I give my world picture a test address 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.830
 next to the Achter Weg 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.659
 both CEO Jerry explains 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.509
 panther 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.559
 This card is funny right away 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.009
 they are not yet available at one time 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:51.109
 that must be the doctors 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.719
 to be changed 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.719
 I can console myself for that 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.379
 Picture beside 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.139
 then I get the greens here, they said 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.439
 Of course, I can give it all 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.769
 you write 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.519
 Hüttenberg 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.259
 foul 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.259
 Rendler 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.269
 Now Madrid is changing with my whole world and that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.009
 with objective without already seeing 

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:23.029
 the little survey 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:25.719
 get like that 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.279
 now only the small section was taken care of bar 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.769
 Celik lure 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 and push their friends on these reasons block 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:45.439
 4 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.179
 I myself 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.339
 Driven by BT Group 

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:52.729
 yes that is z 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:55.729
 all of this is decoded 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.819
 4 SID 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 1 her SID 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.589
 that must 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:08.309
 You can also if you never give up 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:09.889
 4 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.889
 we must 

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:17.930
 further costs yesterday morning the weather forecast that's it 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.469
 is 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.469
 have the right 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.090
 the presented 3d view this 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.949
 give it now 

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:37.159
 Lippstadt 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.210
 you see immediately 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.450
 May 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.550
 Martens who appeared behind cook believe Vodafone 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.560
 we see before 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.240
 the map refreshes every five seconds it could be in the 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.039
 Critic but the time pressure because 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 that is actually quite good 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.849
 with targeted expansion pick 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.710
 you can already see in very small on the map 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.730
 that that is displayed immediately Red the ETA you see nothing 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.740
 the European Tour 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.360
 is built 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.280
 and now I can loose from the web browser whether the way all the others 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.280
 can access this address give the one 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.379
 doctors could write indentures 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.809
 written that connected 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:40.249
 and how to go 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:44.110
 It's about time that the market wrote happy hours 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:47.439
 I continue to write here now 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.749
 you see on the stage 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.749
 Frank characters a speech bubble diagnosis 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.789
 By the way, percent is also very useful for admins 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.569
 then you can monitor who's up and what's up and what's up on the server 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:04.550
 says so 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.089
 it is very nice 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.199
 they promoted a bit of storage 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:10.280
 but Ammann the Conficker part 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.719
 there 

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.719
 a little lower makes ten or fifteen seconds for my sake 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.190
 Percent because you just have fun 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.400
 so does not have to update that on it a bit for her as well 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.699
 vouch it can save too much 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:29.759
 Of course I can call this cat Mohr if it is running but also 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.039
 Red now but rise 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.720
 Competition immediately the problem will not 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.949
 could take off 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:40.229
 if I update the slightly Matt 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:42.779
 he also does not find his 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:44.469
 are works of art 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:46.779
 so far a lot of fun
