00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
there's a couple reasons for that one is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.029 
there's a couple reasons for that one is
that<00:00:18.869> oftentimes<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.439> hear<00:00:19.590> people<00:00:19.710> talk

about how stressful deadlifts it dadless
are<00:00:22.410> on<00:00:22.500> your<00:00:22.590> body<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.779> usually<00:00:24.779> people<00:00:25.080> are

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
are on your body so usually people are

are on your body so usually people are
okay<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:26.010> squad<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.400> multiple<00:00:26.730> times<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
okay with the squad in multiple times a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.660 
okay with the squad in multiple times a
week<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.840> hear<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.439> opposition<00:00:28.670> in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
week or you hear a lot of opposition in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.189 
week or you hear a lot of opposition in
regards<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> deadlifting<00:00:30.570> multiple<00:00:30.900> times<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
regards to deadlifting multiple times a

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
regards to deadlifting multiple times a
week<00:00:31.610> just<00:00:32.610> because<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> exercise<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.600> too

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
week just because the exercise is too

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.190 
week just because the exercise is too
stressful<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.530> whatever<00:00:34.700> so<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.730> find<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.660> by

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
stressful or whatever so I find that by

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.740 
stressful or whatever so I find that by
wearing<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.559> straps<00:00:38.239> and<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.510> some<00:00:39.690> of

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
wearing the straps and you take some of

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.049 
wearing the straps and you take some of
the<00:00:39.809> stress<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> hands<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.700> least<00:00:41.850> to

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
the stress off the hands and at least to

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.660 
the stress off the hands and at least to
me<00:00:42.239> seems<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.809> make<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.110> exercise<00:00:43.670> less

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
me seems to make the exercise less

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
me seems to make the exercise less
stressful<00:00:44.969> overall<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> body<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.989> find

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
stressful overall in the body I find

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
stressful overall in the body I find
them<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.770> recover<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.160> lot<00:00:47.340> faster<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
them I can recover a lot faster and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.940 
them I can recover a lot faster and
because<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> can<00:00:49.140> deadlift<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.530> often

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
because that I can deadlift more often

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.979 
because that I can deadlift more often
so<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> tend<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> deadlift<00:00:50.789> about<00:00:51.539> three<00:00:51.870> to

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
so I tend to deadlift about three to

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
so I tend to deadlift about three to
four<00:00:52.140> times<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.530> week<00:00:52.559> during<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.670> competition

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
four times a week during a competition

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.590 
four times a week during a competition
prep<00:00:55.010> I<00:00:56.010> don't<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> scientific<00:00:57.329> cited

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
prep I don't have a scientific cited

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.970 
prep I don't have a scientific cited
back<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.899> up<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.170> might<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.469> complete<00:00:58.800> bro

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
back that up that might be complete bro

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.790 
back that up that might be complete bro
science<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.940> that's<00:01:00.090> what<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.300> find<00:01:00.770> one<00:01:01.770> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
science but that's what I find one of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.990 
science but that's what I find one of
the<00:01:01.890> reasons<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.160> all<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.430> straps<00:01:02.730> pretty

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the reasons that all you straps pretty

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.760 
the reasons that all you straps pretty
often<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.809> other<00:01:04.019> reason<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.189> find<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.939> my

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
often the other reason is I find that my

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.170 
often the other reason is I find that my
hands<00:01:07.770> are<00:01:07.860> more<00:01:08.280> rested<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> I

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
hands are more rested when I do that I

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.120 
hands are more rested when I do that I
don't<00:01:09.450> tear<00:01:09.659> him<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:10.020> often<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:10.950> when<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
don't tear him up as often and so when I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
don't tear him up as often and so when I
do<00:01:11.250> dead<00:01:12.000> live<00:01:12.150> without<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> straps<00:01:12.830> my<00:01:13.830> grip

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
do dead live without the straps my grip

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.320 
do dead live without the straps my grip
my<00:01:14.340> my<00:01:14.760> grip<00:01:14.939> feels<00:01:15.180> fresher<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.820> i<00:01:17.820> guess<00:01:18.240> i

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
my my grip feels fresher and i guess i

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.880 
my my grip feels fresher and i guess i
don't<00:01:18.390> i<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:18.930> find<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.350> any<00:01:19.470> grip<00:01:19.619> issues

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
don't i don't find have any grip issues

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.550 
don't i don't find have any grip issues
i<00:01:19.979> actually<00:01:20.400> feel<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.729> grip<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> stronger<00:01:21.560> then

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
i actually feel my grip is stronger then

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.109 
i actually feel my grip is stronger then
i<00:01:22.650> went<00:01:22.770> on<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.070> squat<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.610> next<00:01:23.850> day<00:01:24.000> on

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
i went on to squat the next day on

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
i went on to squat the next day on
wednesday<00:01:24.570> i<00:01:25.200> wasn't<00:01:25.890> particularly<00:01:26.610> pleased

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
wednesday i wasn't particularly pleased

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.370 
wednesday i wasn't particularly pleased
with<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.360> squats<00:01:27.659> there's<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> power

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
with these squats there's a lot of power

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.109 
with these squats there's a lot of power
here<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.460> form<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.000> little

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
here but the form is just a little

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.660 
here but the form is just a little
sloppy<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> my<00:01:31.590> left<00:01:31.860> shoulder<00:01:32.070> was<00:01:32.310> bugging

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
sloppy so my left shoulder was bugging

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.219 
sloppy so my left shoulder was bugging
me<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> little<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:33.900> took<00:01:33.960> my

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
me a little bit and I think I took my

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.810 
me a little bit and I think I took my
grip<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.560> just<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> touch<00:01:35.130> too<00:01:35.340> wide<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
grip out just a touch too wide on the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.270 
grip out just a touch too wide on the
left<00:01:36.000> side<00:01:36.290> without<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.560> noticing<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
left side without really noticing it and
