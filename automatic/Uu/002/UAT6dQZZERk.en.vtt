00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.979
 hey viewers of daily shovel 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.469
 welcome my new dan punishment episode 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.339
 and today we are going to be our very first 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.339
 at your box 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.910
 I just saw this to fly by 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.410
 and we need a little bit more and then 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.900
 are we completely 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.199
 set for making our first 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.789
 bible grow with freeze reclaim the ga 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.480
 you go nicely because i also reasonable you 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.439
 far from it on how come so 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.439
 they can not deliver anyway 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.510
 I suggest they just leave 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.250
 its still a lot of box i just bite him away 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.770
 I do n't run, they ca n't coach 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.620
 more so that my food starts one 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.600
 to get a bit low but not to go 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.329
 make one at your box and we do that 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.620
 oh no influence belief that two 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:55.090
 gets guidelines and then we go ours 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.030
 make you angry first and put it 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.289
 We here near the flowers but 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.960
 all in flowers but i'm going to one 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.890
 I think make a few extra 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.420
 his idea was who is you okay so you will 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.490
 go to work automatically and then 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.780
 goes the first at all and he can 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 then go 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.420
 harvest plants eventually 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.800
 and so naturally what we do now goes well 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.150
 want to do i have honey here 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.350
 and then I want a nice set my go 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.010
 but I want a good recipe 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.970
 experience it 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:32.040
 and then we need a joke pot 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.140
 and we will find it here but then 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.790
 we must first have the science alchemy 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 engine will make the first go 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.990
 it happened stone needed because there have 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.830
 we need these blocks i find 7 needed 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.740
 just 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.530
 are two and four do we have 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.160
 not enough to keep it going 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.220
 will this one 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.860
 when we stop here 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.260
 petri with your kit in case someone 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.690
 ill cannot open it 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.300
 the three rows of three actually managed to 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.820
 pull out fuck your own 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.429
 job job job if pressing space works 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.250
 here too this is really intense road 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 guys i'm so happy with that tip 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.670
 you really don't know 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.330
 the battles well because we have food 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.590
 really don't want that club anymore 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.209
 also have 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.180
 shark while indeed a scale here 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.019
 make a torch and then we go one 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.019
 forest trail founder 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.580
 we can do that here too 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.500
 gain of place where not much 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.209
 another shit when being harmed 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 damaged I want to swallow this Dineke 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.870
 dig up like this and the would be a shame like that 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.870
 us to go 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.790
 first a nice tree 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.660
 see one is picking up a clock in itself 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.310
 there is also a new arrow 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.290
 that is not possible because the captain does not flint 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:04.540

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.810
 me that I pull things out nicer 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.520
 miles since I need everything like 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.910
 you are going to catch and just a farce 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.260
 then you should plant something there once 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.460
 almost didn't have it with you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.020
 look around 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.610

 rupes 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:24.530

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.960
 Raise you can not combine work with 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.920
 each other and then we go science here 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.010
 engine days 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:15.160
 alchemy injun puts him here 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:17.110
 stood in between each other every now and then 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.830
 we used the quad path because we are short 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.320
 what broken broken broken three cities needed 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.840

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.170
 I'm just going to do something I could be the hardest 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.170
 and we work mailing 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:53.050

 there is a piece of eating fire 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:19.819
 something also plants well and then 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:23.289
 we go into the next enlargement 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.289
 me at the next episode 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.910
 forest camp everything 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:36.370
 look at what is the tafi candies 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:40.590
 pray during the dignified we now look 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.180
 what about doing this with meat 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.210
 and these can cook for a while and go 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.130
 eat it and go into the next episode 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.540
 our base further expand what I then 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:52.300
 going to do is going to make 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.500
 and then I go different supplies 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.570
 different raw materials I go 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.570
 collect so think about doing 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:05.499
 such a lesson about intro think of who who 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.879
 chop the rest discipline 

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:08.469
 the best things you can do 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.939
 dug up and I can put it down 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:11.229
 flat water base and that is whole 

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:12.759
 easy to go we don't have to 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.110
 to walk for it so that are the 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:15.339
 See next episode for this
