00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.270 
couple more then you see like a whole
big<00:04:36.480> flock<00:04:36.840> covering<00:04:37.740> up<00:04:37.830> pretty<00:04:37.980> much<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
big flock covering up pretty much the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.240 
big flock covering up pretty much the
entire<00:04:38.580> sky<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.810> they're<00:04:39.990> flying<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.040> just

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
entire sky and they're flying and just

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.800 
entire sky and they're flying and just
like<00:04:41.430> going<00:04:41.790> all<00:04:42.030> around<00:04:43.520> and<00:04:44.520> there's<00:04:45.480> I

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
like going all around and there's I

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.629 
like going all around and there's I
think<00:04:45.990> they<00:04:46.260> have<00:04:46.350> something<00:04:46.560> too<00:04:46.889> my<00:04:47.340> theory

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
think they have something too my theory

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.590 
think they have something too my theory
is<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.850> they<00:04:48.090> have<00:04:48.180> something<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.510> do<00:04:48.750> with

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
is that they have something to do with

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.360 
is that they have something to do with
my<00:04:51.600> hero's<00:04:51.960> magic<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:53.520> magic<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:54.000> he<00:04:54.060> has<00:04:55.370> so

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
my hero's magic the magic that he has so

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.530 
my hero's magic the magic that he has so
like<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.960> virus<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.940> think<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.389> KU

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
like and the virus I think that the KU
