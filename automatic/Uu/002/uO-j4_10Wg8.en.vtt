cartoon<00:00:16.529> characters<00:00:16.890> now<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.070> honestly<00:00:17.279> don't

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
cartoon characters now I honestly don't

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.359 
cartoon characters now I honestly don't
know<00:00:17.730> why<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.740> it<00:00:19.740> could<00:00:19.920> be<00:00:19.949> any<00:00:20.160> number

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
know why this is it could be any number

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.480 
know why this is it could be any number
of<00:00:20.640> reasons<00:00:22.609> honestly<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:25.039> think<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.400> just

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
of reasons honestly I think it's just

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
of reasons honestly I think it's just
because<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> female<00:00:27.269> body<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
because the female body is more of a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.220 
because the female body is more of a
work<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.529> art<00:00:29.090> it<00:00:30.090> also<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.570> seems<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.960> when

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
work of art it also just seems like when

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.830 
work of art it also just seems like when
it<00:00:31.320> comes<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.800> drawing<00:00:32.790> female<00:00:33.329> characters

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it comes to drawing female characters

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:50.260 
it comes to drawing female characters
there's<00:00:34.079> less<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.469> margin<00:00:34.920> for<00:00:34.950> mistakes

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.939 

it's<00:00:51.270> impossible<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.020> really<00:00:52.230> explain<00:00:52.680> why

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
it's impossible to really explain why

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
it's impossible to really explain why
honestly<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> don't<00:00:53.910> really<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.540> I<00:00:54.570> haven't

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
honestly I don't really know I haven't

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180 
honestly I don't really know I haven't
really<00:00:55.020> given<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> much<00:00:55.680> thought<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
really given all that much thought to it

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.350 
really given all that much thought to it
all<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.340> know<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.789> when<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> comes<00:00:57.030> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all I know is that when it comes to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.619 
all I know is that when it comes to
drawing<00:00:57.540> women<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.820> definitely<00:00:59.820> take<00:01:00.089> my<00:01:00.329> time

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
drawing women I definitely take my time

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.110 
drawing women I definitely take my time
and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.930> don't<00:01:00.989> just<00:01:01.260> rush<00:01:01.730> into<00:01:02.730> any

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and I don't just rush into any

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.789 
and I don't just rush into any
particular<00:01:03.329> part<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> process<00:01:04.589> just

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
particular part of the process just

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.969 
particular part of the process just
because<00:01:05.270> more<00:01:06.270> often<00:01:06.600> than<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.810> seems<00:01:07.800> like

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
because more often than not seems like

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.969 
because more often than not seems like
when<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.460> rush<00:01:09.110> you<00:01:10.110> wind<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.440> making<00:01:10.560> way

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
when you do rush you wind up making way

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.710 
when you do rush you wind up making way
more<00:01:11.009> mistakes<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.030> women<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.600> lot
