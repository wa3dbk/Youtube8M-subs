the first one you guys price all my
other<00:00:06.299> videos<00:00:06.660> was<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.140> sample<00:00:07.529> that<00:00:07.589> received

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
other videos was to sample that received

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540 
other videos was to sample that received
in<00:00:08.130> which<00:00:08.340> has<00:00:08.580> smaller<00:00:09.469> motors<00:00:10.469> are<00:00:10.710> smaller

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
in which has smaller motors are smaller

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.360 
in which has smaller motors are smaller
propellers<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.200> have<00:00:13.410> right<00:00:13.679> here<00:00:13.740> to

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
propellers which I have right here to

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.359 
propellers which I have right here to
give<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.549> guys<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.790> idea<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.960> see<00:00:16.369> how

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
give you guys an idea you can see how

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.330 
give you guys an idea you can see how
the<00:00:17.880> motor<00:00:18.090> stuck<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.510> each<00:00:18.600> other<00:00:19.340> the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
the motor stuck to each other the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.210 
the motor stuck to each other the
magnets<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.630> can<00:00:21.779> see<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.010> big

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
magnets but you can see here it's a big

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.130 
magnets but you can see here it's a big
difference<00:00:23.670> this<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.269> new<00:00:24.449> one<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.779> top

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
difference this is the new one on top

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.890 
difference this is the new one on top
and<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.949> bottom<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.420> sample

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
and the bottom one is was the sample

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.950 
and the bottom one is was the sample
which<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.760> earlier<00:00:30.150> versions<00:00:30.750> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
which is one of the earlier versions you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560 
which is one of the earlier versions you
can<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.470> much<00:00:32.130> smaller<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.090> spins<00:00:33.390> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
can see here much smaller so it spins a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.600 
can see here much smaller so it spins a
little<00:00:33.809> bit<00:00:33.930> faster<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.680> it's<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> little<00:00:35.520> bit

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
little bit faster and it's a little bit

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.720 
little bit faster and it's a little bit
louder<00:00:35.820> with<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> smaller<00:00:36.600> ones<00:00:37.730> canopies

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
louder with the smaller ones canopies

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450 
louder with the smaller ones canopies
are<00:00:39.350> pretty<00:00:40.350> much<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.559> same<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:41.040> stuff<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
are pretty much the same as stuff in the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.119 
are pretty much the same as stuff in the
ones<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.290> production<00:00:43.290> run<00:00:43.410> has<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> darker

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
ones the production run has a darker

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
ones the production run has a darker
shade<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.489> red<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:46.110> sample<00:00:46.350> one<00:00:46.739> was<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
shade of red and the sample one was a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.520 
shade of red and the sample one was a
lighter<00:00:48.149> shade<00:00:48.270> kind<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> more<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.350> red

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
lighter shade kind of more of a red

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.380 
lighter shade kind of more of a red
color<00:00:49.739> compared<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> candy<00:00:50.789> apple<00:00:51.149> red

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
color compared to the candy apple red

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.279 
color compared to the candy apple red
and<00:00:52.789> now<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:54.120> see<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.510> app<00:00:54.780> it's

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and now you can see here app it's

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.920 
and now you can see here app it's
already<00:00:55.500> plugged<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> newer<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.660> is

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
already plugged in and the newer one is

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.069 
already plugged in and the newer one is
flipped<00:00:58.440> ready<00:00:58.710> which<00:00:59.129> has<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.699> red<00:01:00.079> 46

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.460 
prepared to the mqx from Horizon the
Lady<00:02:52.820> Bird<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.480> my<00:02:53.600> opinion<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:54.140> little<00:02:54.380> bit

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
Lady Bird and my opinion is a little bit

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.250 
Lady Bird and my opinion is a little bit
more<00:02:54.650> stable<00:02:55.720> especially<00:02:56.720> in<00:02:56.840> flying<00:02:57.020> outside

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
more stable especially in flying outside

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.770 
more stable especially in flying outside
the<00:02:57.620> wind<00:02:57.860> just<00:02:58.010> I<00:02:58.250> find<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.880> just<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.210> it's

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the wind just I find it it just it it's

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.250 
the wind just I find it it just it it's
not<00:02:59.900> as<00:03:00.020> bad<00:03:00.260> as<00:03:00.710> mqx<00:03:01.460> but<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.420> does<00:03:02.750> do<00:03:02.930> flips

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
not as bad as mqx but it does do flips

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.380 
not as bad as mqx but it does do flips
of<00:03:03.440> em<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.770> wax<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> stable<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:05.060> it<00:03:05.180> flies

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
of em to wax it is stable and it flies

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.230 
of em to wax it is stable and it flies
very<00:03:05.450> similar<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.260> it's<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.680> lot<00:03:06.890> smaller<00:03:07.280> you

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
very similar so it's a lot smaller you

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.020 
very similar so it's a lot smaller you
can<00:03:08.420> see<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:09.380> know<00:03:09.500> they're<00:03:09.680> not<00:03:09.830> mq<00:03:10.190> x<00:03:10.370> FX<00:03:10.790> has

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
can see you know they're not mq x FX has

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.810 
can see you know they're not mq x FX has
the<00:03:11.720> propeller<00:03:12.170> on<00:03:12.350> FX<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:12.980> probably<00:03:13.460> too<00:03:13.640> seen

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
the propeller on FX is probably too seen

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.990 
the propeller on FX is probably too seen
the<00:03:13.910> ammeter<00:03:14.330> as<00:03:14.870> this<00:03:15.320> QR<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.550> you<00:03:16.610> know<00:03:16.850> so

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
the ammeter as this QR so you know so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.420 
the ammeter as this QR so you know so
far<00:03:17.210> I'm<00:03:17.390> enjoying<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.900> flies<00:03:18.590> very<00:03:18.740> good<00:03:19.160> and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
I'm put the battery because my

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.070 
I'm put the battery because my
transmitter<00:03:21.800> is<00:03:22.040> almost<00:03:22.550> out<00:03:22.850> from<00:03:23.630> finest

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
transmitter is almost out from finest

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.420 
transmitter is almost out from finest
