00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.999
 if you are a petare 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:21.060
 I went out to walk alone and the line was specifically in Canaanite that the 

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:23.259
 which are like this in format the 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.130
 so good, how many times has it happened to us that 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.259
 we're going to paint the eye, we're not going to live here 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.920
 they do not paint enough and review what we review we do not take an eye and 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 unexpectedly Ecuador's attempt 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:53.930
 as already 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.540
 or good hayes abás 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.620
 for those reasons then good he who should approach what is a 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.030
 sheet 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.150
 what is long wait the tip is requested 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.570
 then then that's why he does not paint 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.830
 its very comfortable reason then good percent a few templates that there are for 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.570
 get this bolívar passed this original choose 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.910

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.480

 we will pass lightly on the flashy it will be fast 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:41.080
 so that it would be delivered what is the tip and I say we will wait a little bit 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 before it was not downloaded for Peruvians and in this way we would get 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.460
 Well, I think that street art 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 and other sectors in the walk 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.870
 equality to china daily the alzheimer 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220
 to a light bulb that has been here for a while now because you already know that 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 they put 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.430
 hot with a lot of temperature and 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.580

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.960

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.919

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.979
 you do not have to abuse so much of destiny miguel angel revilla because what 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.769
 we can do is that the tip could be given 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.120
 we piss off the state but let's go these two projects should 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.580
