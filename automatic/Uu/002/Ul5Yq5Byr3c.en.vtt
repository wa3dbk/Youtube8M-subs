well folks here we are of part 5 with
the<00:00:04.170> four-wheel<00:00:04.529> drive<00:00:04.830> gravely<00:00:05.310> tractor

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
the four-wheel drive gravely tractor

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.000 
the four-wheel drive gravely tractor
build<00:00:05.910> and<00:00:06.150> as<00:00:06.690> you<00:00:06.839> can<00:00:06.960> see<00:00:07.140> since<00:00:07.410> last<00:00:07.680> time

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
build and as you can see since last time

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.009 
build and as you can see since last time
I<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> center<00:00:09.030> joint<00:00:09.300> all<00:00:09.510> tacked<00:00:09.840> up

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
I got the center joint all tacked up

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.009 
I got the center joint all tacked up
together<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:11.400> on<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> tractor<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.300> still<00:00:12.870> have

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
together and on the tractor I still have

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.039 
together and on the tractor I still have
to<00:00:13.139> cut<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.469> welds<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.130> sides<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.210> this

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
to cut the welds on the sides of this

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.439 
to cut the welds on the sides of this
bottom<00:00:16.440> plate<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.430> between<00:00:18.060> this

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
bottom plate here because between this

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.970 
bottom plate here because between this
one<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:18.900> one<00:00:19.140> they're<00:00:19.350> off<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.830> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
one and this one they're off just a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
one and this one they're off just a
little<00:00:20.010> bit<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.490> that<00:00:20.520> which<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> making<00:00:21.600> it

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
little bit like that which is making it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.290 
little bit like that which is making it
hard<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.289> get<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> bolts<00:00:23.250> lined<00:00:23.490> up<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.000> once<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
hard to get the bolts lined up so once I

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.880 
hard to get the bolts lined up so once I
do<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.930> can<00:00:25.109> finish<00:00:25.289> welding<00:00:25.740> this

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
do that then I can finish welding this

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.500 
do that then I can finish welding this
thing<00:00:26.130> up<00:00:26.279> because<00:00:26.490> everything<00:00:27.000> else<00:00:27.300> fits

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
thing up because everything else fits

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.169 
thing up because everything else fits
good<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.310> today<00:00:29.310> I'm<00:00:29.550> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.699> be<00:00:29.789> working<00:00:29.970> on

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
good so today I'm going to be working on

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.749 
good so today I'm going to be working on
getting<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.779> dog<00:00:31.019> gears<00:00:31.410> for<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> PTO<00:00:32.189> inside

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
getting the dog gears for the PTO inside

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.250 
getting the dog gears for the PTO inside
these<00:00:32.969> transmissions<00:00:33.690> along<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
these transmissions along with the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.069 
these transmissions along with the
shipper<00:00:34.500> shafts<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.100> both<00:00:35.280> sides<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.750> PTO

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
shipper shafts in both sides and the PTO

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.700 
shipper shafts in both sides and the PTO
shafts<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.649> whatnot<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:39.320> getting<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.469> rear

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
shafts and whatnot and getting this rear

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.119 
shafts and whatnot and getting this rear
transmission<00:00:41.510> getting<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:43.129> high-low

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
transmission getting the high-low

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.850 
transmission getting the high-low
planetaries<00:00:44.879> into<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> back<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:46.140> because

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
planetaries into the back here because

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.680 
planetaries into the back here because
you'll<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> because

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you'll see what I do to get this because

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.119 
you'll see what I do to get this because
I<00:00:48.840> don't<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.170> need<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> planetaries

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
I don't actually need the planetaries

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.260 
I don't actually need the planetaries
we're<00:00:50.309> just<00:00:50.460> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> make<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.149> way

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
we're just going to make it so that way

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.869 
we're just going to make it so that way
this<00:00:51.480> shaft<00:00:52.170> stays<00:00:52.500> on<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> centre<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.340> you'll

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this shaft stays on the centre so you'll

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.840 
this shaft stays on the centre so you'll
see<00:00:54.090> how<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:55.460> but<00:00:56.460> I'm<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> try

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
see how I do that but I'm going to try

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.760 
see how I do that but I'm going to try
to<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> transmissions<00:00:57.840> pretty<00:00:58.620> much

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
to get the transmissions pretty much

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
to get the transmissions pretty much
done<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.850> focus<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.539> getting

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
done so that way I can focus on getting

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.569 
done so that way I can focus on getting
the<00:01:01.109> center<00:01:01.379> joint<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> everything<00:01:02.460> else

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
the center joint and everything else

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.450 
the center joint and everything else
built<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> tractor<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> went<00:01:05.220> up<00:01:05.309> on

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
built up on the tractor so I went up on

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.550 
built up on the tractor so I went up on
the<00:01:05.489> hill<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.240> found<00:01:06.540> an<00:01:06.659> alright<00:01:06.960> set<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
the hill and I found an alright set of

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.399 
the hill and I found an alright set of
high<00:01:07.710> low<00:01:07.920> planetaries<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.909> L<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
high low planetaries from an L so this

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.050 
high low planetaries from an L so this
is<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> front<00:01:11.130> half<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.610> goes<00:01:11.760> into

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
is just the front half that goes into

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 
is just the front half that goes into
the<00:01:12.180> engine<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.930> has<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.760> Sun<00:01:14.760> gear<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
the engine it has the Sun gear with the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.060 
the engine it has the Sun gear with the
orbital<00:01:15.659> gears<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.320> orbital<00:01:16.650> gears<00:01:16.860> will<00:01:17.040> be

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
orbital gears the orbital gears will be

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
orbital gears the orbital gears will be
coming<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:17.909> be<00:01:18.030> putting<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.450> these

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
coming out and I'll be putting on these

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.289 
coming out and I'll be putting on these
pieces<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.259> 180<00:01:19.590> flat<00:01:19.920> stock<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.970> those<00:01:21.150> will

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
pieces of 180 flat stock and those will

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539 
pieces of 180 flat stock and those will
be<00:01:21.390> sitting<00:01:21.659> flush<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.380> against<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> Sun<00:01:23.220> gear

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
be sitting flush up against the Sun gear

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.520 
be sitting flush up against the Sun gear
just<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> hold<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> place<00:01:24.509> but<00:01:24.869> you'll

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
just to hold that in place but you'll

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.289 
just to hold that in place but you'll
see<00:01:25.740> more<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.159> later<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.700> also<00:01:27.060> got<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
see more on that later I also got a

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.030 
see more on that later I also got a
clutch<00:01:27.570> for<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.380> came<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
clutch for it which this came out of and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.179 
clutch for it which this came out of and
I<00:01:29.250> think<00:01:29.640> an<00:01:29.729> le<00:01:29.939> transmission<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.840> blew<00:01:31.079> up

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
I think an le transmission that blew up

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.859 
I think an le transmission that blew up
so<00:01:32.189> it's<00:01:32.729> not<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.270> shape<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:33.540> I'll<00:01:33.780> be

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
so it's not really good shape so I'll be

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
so it's not really good shape so I'll be
putting<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.229> in<00:01:34.409> there<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.799> hold<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.280> in

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
putting that in there to hold this in

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.090 
putting that in there to hold this in
place<00:01:35.610> but<00:01:36.540> like<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.229> said<00:01:37.290> you'll<00:01:37.619> see<00:01:37.799> more<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
place but like I said you'll see more of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
place but like I said you'll see more of
that<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.460> gets<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.229> also<00:01:40.229> got

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
that when it gets to there I also got

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
that when it gets to there I also got
the<00:01:40.530> two<00:01:40.650> brackets<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.310> swifter<00:01:41.759> Mattox

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the two brackets for the swifter Mattox

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.840 
the two brackets for the swifter Mattox
on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.930> 400<00:01:43.439> series<00:01:43.649> transmissions<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
on the 400 series transmissions and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
on the 400 series transmissions and
these<00:01:45.450> are<00:01:45.540> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.689> be<00:01:45.840> going<00:01:45.990> back<00:01:46.229> on

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
these are going to be going back on

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
these are going to be going back on
because<00:01:46.740> they're<00:01:47.280> fairly<00:01:47.520> easy<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.970> hook<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.299> I

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
because they're fairly easy to hook up I

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.469 
because they're fairly easy to hook up I
can<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.630> use<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> rod<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:49.590> cable<00:01:50.040> or<00:01:50.210> ship<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
can just use a rod or cable or ship so

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.789 
can just use a rod or cable or ship so
I'm<00:01:51.570> not<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.200> own<00:01:52.229> brackets

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
I'm not going to make my own brackets

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.920 
I'm not going to make my own brackets
for<00:01:52.979> those<00:01:53.159> along<00:01:53.970> with<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.299> spring<00:01:54.630> which<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
for those along with the spring which I

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.679 
for those along with the spring which I
have<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.259> another

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
have to get another

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.919 
have to get another
and<00:01:56.679> for<00:01:57.189> the<00:01:57.280> dog<00:01:57.520> gears<00:01:58.390> and<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.719> shipper

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
and for the dog gears and the shipper

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:01.980 
and for the dog gears and the shipper
shafts<00:01:59.289> on<00:01:59.619> the<00:02:00.280> front<00:02:00.759> transmission<00:02:01.450> I'm

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
shafts on the front transmission I'm

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.660 
shafts on the front transmission I'm
going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.229> have<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.499> original<00:02:02.590> 400<00:02:03.429> series

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
going to have the original 400 series

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.480 
going to have the original 400 series
shifter<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.719> way<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:05.069> shut<00:02:06.069> on<00:02:06.310> and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
shifter so that way I can shut on and

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.660 
shifter so that way I can shut on and
off<00:02:06.609> the<00:02:07.289> back<00:02:08.289> transmission<00:02:09.129> so<00:02:09.429> I<00:02:09.519> could

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
off the back transmission so I could

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.430 
off the back transmission so I could
take<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.000> down<00:02:10.119> in<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.599> out<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.810> gear<00:02:11.049> as<00:02:11.260> I'd

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
take it down in and out of gear as I'd

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.920 
take it down in and out of gear as I'd
like<00:02:11.680> and<00:02:12.030> that'll<00:02:13.030> be<00:02:13.120> easy<00:02:13.299> enough<00:02:13.569> you<00:02:13.780> can

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
like and that'll be easy enough you can

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.199 
like and that'll be easy enough you can
hook<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.290> rod<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.920> and<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.060> back

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
hook up a rod to it and the back

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.390 
hook up a rod to it and the back
transmission<00:02:16.870> will<00:02:16.989> be<00:02:17.019> like<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.530> L<00:02:17.709> 4<00:02:18.220> wheel

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
transmission will be like the L 4 wheel

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.520 
transmission will be like the L 4 wheel
drive<00:02:18.730> how<00:02:19.360> I'll<00:02:19.540> just<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.170> old-style

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530

you<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:13.280> going<00:03:13.430> to<00:03:13.519> line<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.730> up<00:03:13.909> with<00:03:14.060> a<00:03:14.120> flat

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
you just going to line it up with a flat

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.270 
you just going to line it up with a flat
spot<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:16.159> shipper<00:03:16.489> shaft

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.560

you<00:03:29.570> play<00:03:30.520> hard

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.289 

now<00:03:38.769> be<00:03:39.010> pretty<00:03:39.250> good<00:03:39.489> because<00:03:39.700> it's<00:03:40.090> nice<00:03:40.239> and

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
now be pretty good because it's nice and

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.030 
now be pretty good because it's nice and
tight<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.379> ball<00:03:41.709> goes<00:03:41.980> into<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.459> d-10<00:03:43.330> so

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
tight and ball goes into the d-10 so

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.630 
tight and ball goes into the d-10 so
keep<00:03:45.040> it<00:03:45.159> from<00:03:45.310> moving<00:03:45.459> on<00:03:45.700> everything<00:03:47.640> all

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
keep it from moving on everything all

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.750 
keep it from moving on everything all
right<00:03:48.879> works<00:03:49.120> out<00:03:49.329> pretty<00:03:49.569> nice<00:03:50.489> let's<00:03:51.489> move

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
right works out pretty nice let's move

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.039 
right works out pretty nice let's move
it<00:03:51.940> everything<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:54.310> see<00:03:55.120> down<00:03:55.329> inside<00:03:55.540> there

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
it everything you see down inside there

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:02.399 
it everything you see down inside there
maybe<00:03:59.250> everything's<00:04:00.480> over<00:04:01.480> camming<00:04:01.930> nicely

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
maybe everything's over camming nicely

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
together so tomorrow I'll probably be

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.590 
together so tomorrow I'll probably be
cutting<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> welds<00:04:24.100> to<00:04:24.280> realign<00:04:24.669> these<00:04:25.330> two

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
cutting the welds to realign these two

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.150 
cutting the welds to realign these two
pieces<00:04:25.840> up<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:26.470> then<00:04:26.590> hopefully<00:04:26.949> I'll<00:04:27.070> get

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
pieces up and then hopefully I'll get

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.310 
pieces up and then hopefully I'll get
the<00:04:27.310> gussets<00:04:27.699> done<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:28.090> all<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.990> if<00:04:29.080> I<00:04:29.139> can

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
the gussets done and all see if I can

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.960 
the gussets done and all see if I can
finish<00:04:29.530> welding<00:04:29.949> this<00:04:30.070> up<00:04:30.250> for<00:04:30.430> tomorrow<00:04:30.729> I

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
so both of those are all hooked up with

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.730 
so both of those are all hooked up with
the<00:04:36.669> springs<00:04:37.030> is<00:04:37.750> able<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.110> find<00:04:38.320> another<00:04:38.560> one

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
the springs is able to find another one

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.409 
the springs is able to find another one

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
horse sheetmetal and the head shroud

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.010 
horse sheetmetal and the head shroud
here<00:04:53.979> in<00:04:54.099> this<00:04:54.430> side<00:04:54.700> shroud<00:04:55.090> as<00:04:55.389> you<00:04:55.720> can<00:04:55.840> see

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.469 
here in this side shroud as you can see
it<00:04:56.139> doesn't<00:04:56.349> line<00:04:56.620> up<00:04:56.970> are<00:04:57.970> both<00:04:58.210> different

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
it doesn't line up are both different

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.930 
it doesn't line up are both different
sizes<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.620> I'll<00:04:59.740> have<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.039> go<00:05:00.130> on<00:05:00.250> eBay<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.760> see

sizes so I'll have to go on eBay and see

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.029 
sizes so I'll have to go on eBay and see
what<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.210> find<00:05:01.599> but<00:05:02.470> for<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.800> time<00:05:03.010> being

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
what I can find but for the time being

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.680 
what I can find but for the time being
it<00:05:03.490> should<00:05:03.699> be<00:05:03.820> enough<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.150> I<00:05:04.210> can<00:05:04.389> run<00:05:04.570> it

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
it should be enough so I can run it

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.600 
it should be enough so I can run it
because<00:05:04.840> I<00:05:04.990> still<00:05:05.139> haven't<00:05:05.320> ran<00:05:05.560> this<00:05:05.770> sense<00:05:06.430> I

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
because I still haven't ran this sense I

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.670 
because I still haven't ran this sense I
did<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.880> rebuild<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.510> got<00:05:08.139> my<00:05:08.260> wheel<00:05:08.410> horse

did the rebuild I got my wheel horse
muffler<00:05:09.130> on<00:05:09.280> there<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:10.000> I<00:05:10.120> rigged<00:05:10.419> up<00:05:10.539> a<00:05:10.690> fuel

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
muffler on there and I rigged up a fuel

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.250 
muffler on there and I rigged up a fuel
tank<00:05:11.550> coil<00:05:12.550> this<00:05:13.479> is<00:05:13.599> the<00:05:13.690> carburetor<00:05:14.020> I'm

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:14.260 
tank coil this is the carburetor I'm

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.719 
tank coil this is the carburetor I'm
going<00:05:14.380> to<00:05:14.440> be<00:05:14.560> using<00:05:14.860> on<00:05:14.949> the<00:05:14.979> tractor<00:05:15.310> along

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
going to be using on the tractor along

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:16.920 
going to be using on the tractor along
with<00:05:15.849> the<00:05:15.940> fuel<00:05:16.150> pump<00:05:16.389> so<00:05:16.570> those<00:05:16.720> will<00:05:16.840> be

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
with the fuel pump so those will be

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.439 
with the fuel pump so those will be
staying<00:05:17.169> on<00:05:17.550> points<00:05:18.550> does<00:05:18.729> not<00:05:18.880> doesn't<00:05:19.240> don't

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
staying on points does not doesn't don't

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.000 
staying on points does not doesn't don't
have<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.630> cover<00:05:19.930> but<00:05:20.199> I<00:05:20.380> can<00:05:20.530> still<00:05:20.740> run<00:05:20.860> them

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
have a cover but I can still run them

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.430 
have a cover but I can still run them
the<00:05:21.099> way<00:05:21.190> it<00:05:21.340> is<00:05:21.490> for<00:05:21.729> now<00:05:21.880> just<00:05:22.780> to<00:05:22.960> break<00:05:23.260> this

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
the way it is for now just to break this

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.900 
the way it is for now just to break this
in<00:05:23.620> a<00:05:23.650> little<00:05:23.889> bit<00:05:23.979> I'll<00:05:24.160> let<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.400> idle<00:05:24.550> for<00:05:24.699> a

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
in a little bit I'll let it idle for a

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.180 
in a little bit I'll let it idle for a
while<00:05:25.120> so<00:05:25.510> anyways<00:05:26.349> we'll<00:05:26.560> roll<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:26.860> out<00:05:27.039> to

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
while so anyways we'll roll this out to

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.770 
while so anyways we'll roll this out to
the<00:05:27.280> front<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.610> garage<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.210> we'll<00:05:28.570> see<00:05:28.720> if

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
the front of the garage and we'll see if

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.320 
the front of the garage and we'll see if
we<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:28.960> get<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.139> a<00:05:29.229> fire<00:05:29.470> up<00:05:29.620> all<00:05:30.120> right<00:05:31.120> to

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
we can get it a fire up all right to

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.150 
we can get it a fire up all right to
crank<00:05:31.599> this<00:05:31.750> over<00:05:32.139> a<00:05:32.169> few<00:05:32.440> times<00:05:32.740> without<00:05:32.979> the

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
crank this over a few times without the

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:40.409 
crank this over a few times without the
ignition<00:05:33.729> hooked<00:05:33.940> up<00:05:34.150> to<00:05:34.360> get<00:05:34.510> some<00:05:34.720> fuel

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:54.560 

little<00:05:41.419> fire

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:54.570 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:47.030 

ignition

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.490 

now<00:06:48.040> too<00:06:48.100> bad<00:06:48.490> for<00:06:48.760> a<00:06:48.790> fresh<00:06:49.060> start<00:06:49.690> fired

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
now too bad for a fresh start fired

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.070 
now too bad for a fresh start fired
right<00:06:50.770> up

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
right up

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.510 
right up
so<00:06:53.080> I'll<00:06:53.170> pilot<00:06:53.440> this<00:06:53.740> idle<00:06:54.100> for<00:06:54.250> a<00:06:54.280> little

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:54.520 
so I'll pilot this idle for a little

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.100 
so I'll pilot this idle for a little
while<00:06:54.670> like<00:06:54.910> this<00:06:55.210> just<00:06:55.480> a<00:06:55.600> break<00:06:55.810> in<00:06:55.990> the

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
while like this just a break in the

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.230 
while like this just a break in the
rings<00:06:56.320> and<00:06:56.500> everything<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:57.220> see<00:06:57.940> how<00:06:58.060> it<00:06:58.210> does

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
rings and everything and see how it does

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.140 
rings and everything and see how it does
so<00:06:58.630> far<00:06:59.020> no<00:06:59.440> smoke<00:06:59.830> which<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.070> good<00:07:00.430> no<00:07:00.850> knocks

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.150 
so far no smoke which is good no knocks

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.380 
so far no smoke which is good no knocks
or<00:07:01.420> anything<00:07:01.630> so<00:07:02.310> might<00:07:03.310> just<00:07:03.520> get<00:07:03.700> lucky<00:07:03.760> and

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:04.390 
or anything so might just get lucky and

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.420 
or anything so might just get lucky and
once<00:07:05.350> again<00:07:05.470> I<00:07:05.620> don't<00:07:05.740> have<00:07:05.890> the<00:07:05.980> high<00:07:06.160> level

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
once again I don't have the high level

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.890 
once again I don't have the high level
planetaries<00:07:07.000> in<00:07:07.150> here<00:07:07.360> so<00:07:07.510> not<00:07:07.690> to<00:07:07.870> worry

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
planetaries in here so not to worry

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:12.420 
planetaries in here so not to worry
about<00:07:08.170> some<00:07:08.500> transmission<00:07:09.010> oil<00:07:10.440> but<00:07:11.440> there

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430 
about some transmission oil but there

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.280 
about some transmission oil but there
you<00:07:12.580> have<00:07:12.610> it<00:07:12.910> that's<00:07:13.480> the<00:07:13.660> first<00:07:13.900> start<00:07:14.170> up

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290
