shield vs evolution so I think might be
a<00:01:54.090> good<00:01:54.240> match<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:56.130> know<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.490> fighters<00:01:56.790> are

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
opinion of a masked Kane is we've been

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.390 
opinion of a masked Kane is we've been
there<00:02:39.090> done<00:02:39.329> that<00:02:39.359> we've<00:02:39.659> already<00:02:39.780> seen<00:02:40.049> that
