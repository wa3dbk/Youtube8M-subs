00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
little wine cut out and then there's

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.240 
little wine cut out and then there's
this<00:01:01.859> bar<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.190> moves<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> what<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.040> does

then you can see the blade is free and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.580 
then you can see the blade is free and
it'll<00:01:08.820> move<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.080> when<00:01:10.170> you're<00:01:10.290> closing

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.880 
it'll move and then when you're closing
this<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:13.260> will<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.760> move<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.890> so

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
