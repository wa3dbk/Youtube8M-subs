00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.609
 this kind of stealing the ps leader still prospect 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.449
 the skeleton reconverts these companies into an audio 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.119
 In this video, you give us our impressions of how these 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.490
 faces 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.820
 the box and the scanner concourse safe a usb cable 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.410
 an adapter holding 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.519
 silvia fast not knowing with the software needed the high version of the manual 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.390
 Before installing the driver you need the scanner right 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.410
 a key on the bottom 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.339
 then switch it on 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.920
 also connect the usb cable 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.090
 the scania must be connected for installation of software 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 the computer restarts automatically so it is recommended 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.090
 use your active feet before installing the drivers 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.930
 ease of use is a plus point 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 just put the book and click a button to scan a page 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 the great advantage of this for other students is the specific design for 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.020
 books 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.560
 the standby speed is fast 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.430
 each page takes about ten seconds until the text appears on the screen 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.310
 the post is that it has considered efficiency to identify words 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.580
 in the corners of pages 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.760
 it is not always that he can identify with perfection 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.600
 but the average is much more correct than errors in these situations 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.390
 who has the highest occurrence child 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.530
 can produce 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.610
 it is possible to only extend one track at a time 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.480
 but it's easy to merge all the pages into a single text file 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.659
 the reading of the texts is little used unnatural this is interpretation 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.640
 despite the computex action 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.770
 the identification of impotent words and seats can be considered 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.540
 positive 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.090
 a feature that also deserves positive prominence is that the user can adjust 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.090
 the volume of appeal city of reading 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:12.579
 you can scan a page while you only lost another 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.709
 and gives less work than expected 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.659
 google reader software jungle audio files in formats 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.489
 Guilherme de Freitas 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.510
 in the latter case it is possible to determine the quality until 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.869
 128 kbps 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.899
 in the case of losing the rest do not present unique 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.519
 another positive point is a magnifying glass is already part of the software 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.159
 the former singer to have been confused almost all the seats 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.789
 and special characters in Portuguese 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:50.789
 this impairs the reading in some moments 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.609
 the ideal beyond the pdf format 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.759
 and you can not miss special characters 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.749
 the down side is that editing your bush is a little more laborious 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:07.579
 something that can confuse in many moments is that is made the reading of 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.679
 all buttons of the software part 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.489
 everything the user clicks eli 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.379
 then with two quick clicks 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.999
 the reading is already confused upon making a minor retreat in line 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.229
 phone the window in the middle of the street and help us 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.090
 the post the clip has besides the three portistas 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.149
 other four buttons 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:30.469
 and what they do 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.219
 only to developers the disease users should expect to know 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.919
 in the manual it is written that these buttons are for future functions and 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.919
 moment has no functionality 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.289
 in short the wider prospect is a niche product 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.070
 for your use the large buttons and the reading by the general 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.630
 make a little choice of accessibility software for the visually impaired 

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:59.789
 work is very bad 

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:02.899
 since one page is scanned at a time 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.239
 but this is the only drawback to creating your own audio file at 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.839
 from a book 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:14.459
 as soon as the inter is unable to replace the common image scanner 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.459
 asphalt work resources with this file type 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.539
 this in addition to the price that is around two thousand reais 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.680
 reinforces a product characteristic for a rather specific niche of 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.849
 Marketplace 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:27.659
 for example 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.749
 libraries serving people with visual limitations 

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:32.800
 and not for the general public 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.250
 after all recognition software that this is already common 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.770
 How did you live only in France?
