00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 in this video I'm going to show you a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:21.960
 quick and easy alternative of preparations 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:24.090
 very fast this is not a recipe 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.699
 how to prepare a traditional 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.680
 dolls like I told you at the beginning is a 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.619
 alternative for housewives who do not 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.969
 we have a lot of time that we work 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.829
 we're in the races and in this 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.440
 Christmas we want to enjoy a rich 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.420
 very flights but it does not take us out between seasons 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.559
 Well here I bring you an option so that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.590
 make them easy and fast and delicious I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.200
 I went to the super and bought these tortillas 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.379
 that remain in the super and sell them 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.199
 those tortillas made especially for 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.809
 fritters come the raw tortillas 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.510
 nothing else to fry them in the oil in 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.000
 any other super tortilla 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.650
 of flour already sell tortillas ready 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.970
 for 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.160
 and in case you can not find them 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 articulated you can use the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.960
 tortillitas which commonly 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.550
 we use to make quesadillas 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 It is also accessible to make them 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.350
 this easy and fast way and also 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.060
 they are very very rich and for the syrup 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.330
 assuming the very good ones we are going to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.400
 use a box of piloncillo 5 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.390
 cloves I will bring it closer so that 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.670
 look good these are 5 cloves 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.880
 this I am going to use a little flower 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 anise here you can see if it has the 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.380
 use and if you do not have it do not worry 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 It's not very essential, I 'm going to 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 use because I already have it and I like it 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 the flavor that anise gives you but also 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.910
 you can omit too let's put 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.820
 a cinnamon hairline this amount is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.920
 to make a liter of water I go to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.740
 make 10 models that would be 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.509
 approximately 5 portions and it reaches me 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.759
 a liter of water reaches me perfect 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.110
 for the 5 portions if you go to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.810
 do more lots then they would put 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.570
 and would put double the amount of 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.200
 these ingredients here I have a liter 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.870
 water I'll put the brown sugar will 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.900
 we put the five sections of smell one 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 Hairline cinnamon and anise florecita 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.820
 In case you have it, we are going to 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.220
 occupy a little sugar this is at 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.770
 Taste and it 's optional 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.990
 this I'm going to put it in a term this is 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 to put the models already after 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.490
 that are cold they were very numerous 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.550
 for the sugar with a little cinnamon in 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.550
 powder 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 let's mix and it's super very big 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.220
 valley we have ready to bathe my 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.739
 primary as it warms up 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.030
 the water the piloncillo is undoing 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.830
 in water 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.349
 let's wait one more to start 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.739
 well and have grass let's tell 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.540
 five minutes and we're going to put out the fire 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.310
 here I have the oil heating up and I'm going to 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.150
 wait until it's too hot to 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 start frying the tortillas 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.379
 the water has already started to boil I'm going to go down 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.079
 the fire and I'll let it boil 5 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.299
 minutes since the front is very 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.470
 hot we're just going to put the 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.470
 tortillas to fry 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.680
 how beautiful is it made 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.680
 to fry faster we can 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.709
 tarnish with oil above we go to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.319
 turn the tortilla so 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.930
 we are we can be putting oil 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.590
 hot on top so that this one had 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.930
 faster 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.379
 let's wait for it to turn golden 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.870
 on the one hand to flip so that by 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.269
 other side 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.790
 since it is golden on both sides 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.129
 let's take out let's hope that it 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.040
 Drains very well because if it is too much 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.280
 oil the one that grabs we're going to drain it 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.650
 here in the pan I'll put in a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.959
 grate as well as a flavor so that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.319
 Drain a little more and in the end 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.360
 let's pass him a paper napkin 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.540
 absorbent to remove all the excess 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.630
 of fat that is possible see what 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.720
 preciousness of fritters the truth that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.729
 these new ones do not ask anything from us 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.310
 very numbers that we ourselves 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.860
 prepare for the flour if we do not have 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.880
 time to prepare the flour and make the 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:37.610
 tortillas because this is the alternative 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.479
 Rich easy and fast to make us the 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.080
 true that are left 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.080
 very very rich 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 the water has 5 minutes serving I'm going 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.800
 to put out the fire is returning and eni 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.039
 I enrich years to you the smell that is 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.410
 dismissing these and also here already almost 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.560
 I finished frying my tortillas in 5 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.620
 this was practically done 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.009
 It is very fast so I like the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:15.810
 I recommend if you are well - being of ones 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:18.610
 rich donuts fast and easy because this one 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.099
 It is another solution 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.900
 and in the end we're just going to sprinkle a 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.900
 little oil with cinnamon 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.890
 and now I'm going to tell you how 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.960
 let's eat if you want to see us 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.770
 with sugar and cinnamon these can be 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.680
 eat simply dried and the other two 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.320
 all away and more sugar 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.030
 let's start in numbers inside the 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.030
 term without bits 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:05.300
 and here we are going to put the corpse as the 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.300
 shit we prepare 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.960
 Y 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:20.080
 when it tastes too sweet but already 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:22.719
 here decision of you and more want 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.289
 also put us to overcome bear and how 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:28.539
 is this is how I like 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.349
 eat it and you decide the way 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:31.449
