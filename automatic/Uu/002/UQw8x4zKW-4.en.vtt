here<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.360> quickly<00:01:24.600> you're<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.170> see

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
here really quickly you're going to see

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.870 
here really quickly you're going to see
micro<00:01:25.680> elastication<00:01:25.830> along<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.549> back<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
micro elastication along the back of the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420 
micro elastication along the back of the
elbow<00:01:27.000> micro<00:01:27.720> elastication<00:01:27.869> along<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.250> hip

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
elbow micro elastication along the hip

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
elbow micro elastication along the hip
that<00:01:29.640> goes<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.090> across<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.570> across<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
that goes down across the across the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.620 
that goes down across the across the
quad<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.880> an<00:01:33.060> area<00:01:33.360> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
quad and what that is it's an area that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.080 
quad and what that is it's an area that
allows<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:34.170> better<00:01:34.229> flex<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.520> also<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
allows for better flex but also it

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.760 
allows for better flex but also it
doesn't<00:01:36.299> introduce<00:01:36.659> an<00:01:37.079> accordion<00:01:37.560> stretch

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
doesn't introduce an accordion stretch

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.260 
doesn't introduce an accordion stretch
panel<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> lot<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.640> times<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:38.970> backs<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
panel so a lot of times on the backs of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.249 
panel so a lot of times on the backs of
suits<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.600> you'll<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.170> we

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
suits and you'll see it on this one we

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.630 
suits and you'll see it on this one we
have<00:01:40.290> accordion<00:01:40.740> stretch<00:01:40.920> panels<00:01:41.250> they<00:01:41.490> give

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a great deal of flexibility and they

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.330 
a great deal of flexibility and they
allow<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> breathe<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
allow you to breathe but really you

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.160 
allow you to breathe but really you
don't<00:01:44.460> want<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> have<00:01:44.850> those<00:01:45.000> panels<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.659> areas

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
don't want to have those panels in areas

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
don't want to have those panels in areas
of<00:01:46.320> hot<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.799> their<00:01:47.009> impact<00:01:47.460> prone<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.090> by

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
of hot that are their impact prone so by

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.550 
of hot that are their impact prone so by
adding<00:01:48.810> these<00:01:48.930> panels<00:01:49.320> you're<00:01:49.409> not

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
adding these panels you're not

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
adding these panels you're not
eliminating<00:01:50.130> stretch<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.640> eliminating

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
eliminating stretch or eliminating

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
eliminating stretch or eliminating
strength<00:01:51.540> but<00:01:51.840> you're<00:01:51.990> adding<00:01:52.320> stretch<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
strength but you're adding stretch to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.399 
strength but you're adding stretch to
