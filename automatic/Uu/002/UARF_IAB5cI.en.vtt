against using a heat protectant also

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.040 
against using a heat protectant also
leads<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.700> damage<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> hair<00:00:42.540> cuticle

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
leads to damage of the hair cuticle

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.069 
leads to damage of the hair cuticle
which<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.890> turn<00:00:44.250> leads<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.940> frizz<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.870> if

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
which in turn leads to frizz so if

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
which in turn leads to frizz so if
you're<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.559> use<00:00:46.680> any<00:00:46.980> heat<00:00:47.550> at<00:00:47.579> all<00:00:47.910> on

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
setting and power on your hair dryer
does<00:00:55.110> make<00:00:55.410> things<00:00:55.649> faster<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> also

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
does make things faster but it also

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
does make things faster but it also
leads<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.510> dry<00:00:57.809> scalp<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.440> hair<00:00:58.559> cuticle

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
leads to a dry scalp and hair cuticle

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.189 
leads to a dry scalp and hair cuticle
the<00:00:59.789> scalp<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.329> where<00:01:00.510> most<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> natural

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the scalp is where most of the natural

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.130 
the scalp is where most of the natural
oil<00:01:01.620> lies<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.850> oil<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.329> necessary<00:01:03.899> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
oil lies and that oil is necessary for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.750 
oil lies and that oil is necessary for
growth<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.619> protection<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> roots<00:01:05.610> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
growth and protection of the roots of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.149 
growth and protection of the roots of
your<00:01:05.850> hair<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.900> blow<00:01:07.200> drying<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> scalp<00:01:07.979> not

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
your hair so blow drying the scalp not

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
your hair so blow drying the scalp not
only<00:01:08.670> increases<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.210> odds<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.659> breakage<00:01:10.140> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
only increases the odds of breakage and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
only increases the odds of breakage and
damage<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> roots<00:01:11.520> which<00:01:11.939> causes

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
damage out the roots which causes

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
damage out the roots which causes
frizziness<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.350> also<00:01:13.560> restricts<00:01:14.280> hair

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
frizziness but it also restricts hair

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.060 
frizziness but it also restricts hair
growth<00:01:14.729> so<00:01:15.450> obviously<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.500> you're<00:01:16.650> trying<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
growth so obviously if you're trying to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.310 
growth so obviously if you're trying to
avoid<00:01:17.310> frizz<00:01:17.820> it's<00:01:18.090> probably<00:01:18.720> smart<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.200> go

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
avoid frizz it's probably smart to go

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
avoid frizz it's probably smart to go
down<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.530> different<00:01:19.650> road<00:01:20.100> my<00:01:20.729> hair<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> damp

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
down a different road my hair is damp

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.539 
down a different road my hair is damp
here<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> reduce<00:01:22.439> frizziness<00:01:23.070> even

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here but to reduce frizziness even

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
here but to reduce frizziness even
before<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.030> point<00:01:24.390> only<00:01:24.659> shampoo<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.680> hair
