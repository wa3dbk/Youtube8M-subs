00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
that I used to love back when I was a

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479 
that I used to love back when I was a
kid<00:00:30.510> so<00:00:30.779> first<00:00:31.650> you're<00:00:31.800> gonna<00:00:31.890> start<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
kid so first you're gonna start with the

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.100 
kid so first you're gonna start with the
tortilla<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.329> you're<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.630> lay<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> flat

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
tortilla and you're gonna lay it flat

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.930 
tortilla and you're gonna lay it flat
and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:34.980> you're<00:00:35.100> gonna<00:00:35.219> spread<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.640> little

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and then you're gonna spread a little

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.389 
and then you're gonna spread a little
thin<00:00:36.170> layer<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.530> cream<00:00:37.739> cheese<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.040> top

thin layer of cream cheese on top

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
thin layer of cream cheese on top
because<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:38.969> helps<00:00:39.210> keep<00:00:39.360> everything

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
because it kind of helps keep everything

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.630 
because it kind of helps keep everything
together<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> then<00:00:40.920> depending<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:41.399> you
