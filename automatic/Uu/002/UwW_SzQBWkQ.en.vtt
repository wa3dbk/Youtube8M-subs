00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.229 
well there you see the answer the Seb
have<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> fault<00:03:51.510> they<00:03:52.290> wipe<00:03:52.590> us<00:03:52.830> out<00:03:53.130> they<00:03:53.880> break

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
have a fault they wipe us out they break

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.570 
have a fault they wipe us out they break
us<00:03:54.450> down<00:03:54.480> they<00:03:55.200> reduce<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:56.190> environmental

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
us down they reduce the environmental

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:08.500 
us down they reduce the environmental
impact<00:03:57.209> almost<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.620> zero<00:04:00.050> exemplary

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280 

yes<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:10.470> see<00:04:10.740> all<00:04:11.340> are<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.060> same<00:04:12.290> biomass

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
yes you see all are the same biomass

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.030 
yes you see all are the same biomass
processing<00:04:14.280> system<00:04:14.850> for<00:04:15.750> one<00:04:15.990> purpose

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
processing system for one purpose

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.810 
processing system for one purpose
well<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:18.209> is<00:04:18.420> quite<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.930> question

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
well that is quite the question

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:56.140 
well that is quite the question
repulsive<00:04:20.820> yes<00:04:21.269> but<00:04:21.720> quite<00:04:22.200> fascinating

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.879 

you<00:04:57.150> should<00:04:57.419> be<00:04:57.570> able<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.990> make<00:04:58.199> out<00:04:58.410> some

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
you should be able to make out some

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.270 
you should be able to make out some
exposed<00:04:59.790> elements<00:05:00.690> of<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.990> alien<00:05:01.530> structure

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
exposed elements of the alien structure

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.600 
exposed elements of the alien structure
from<00:05:02.430> where<00:05:02.669> you<00:05:02.820> are<00:05:02.880> now

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.340 

somewhere<00:05:09.120> around

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
somewhere around

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.680 
somewhere around
for<00:05:11.740> anything<00:05:12.130> resembling<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:13.120> tower<00:05:13.680> recital
