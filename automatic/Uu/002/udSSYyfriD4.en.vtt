00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.300 
stay in the bushes and when you're near
there<00:03:49.510> they<00:03:49.989> come<00:03:50.230> out<00:03:50.410> I<00:03:50.620> don't<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.010> don't<00:03:51.070> know

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
there they come out I don't I don't know

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.680 
there they come out I don't I don't know
what's<00:03:51.489> with<00:03:51.670> that<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:52.150> makes<00:03:52.329> it<00:03:52.450> kind<00:03:52.660> of

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
what's with that that makes it kind of

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.479 
what's with that that makes it kind of
difficult<00:03:53.200> because<00:03:53.799> there's<00:03:54.040> no<00:03:54.220> way<00:03:54.370> of

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
difficult because there's no way of

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.340 
difficult because there's no way of
telling<00:03:54.519> when<00:03:55.030> something's<00:03:55.450> in<00:03:55.600> there<00:03:55.720> I<00:03:55.930> mean

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
telling when something's in there I mean

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.410 
telling when something's in there I mean
most<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.890> time<00:03:56.980> they're<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.430> but<00:03:57.760> just<00:03:58.180> I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
most of the time they're not but just I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.800 
most of the time they're not but just I
don't<00:03:58.810> know<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.019> it's<00:03:59.140> a<00:03:59.170> glitch<00:03:59.380> or<00:03:59.530> something

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
don't know if it's a glitch or something

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.880 
don't know if it's a glitch or something
another<00:04:01.810> thing<00:04:02.109> is

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
another thing is

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.280 
another thing is
some<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.160> them<00:04:03.220> are<00:04:03.460> flaming<00:04:04.020> furries<00:04:05.020> which

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
some of them are flaming furries which

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.790 
some of them are flaming furries which
means<00:04:05.650> they<00:04:05.830> go<00:04:05.980> off<00:04:06.190> faster<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:06.990> have<00:04:07.990> more

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
means they go off faster and have more

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.460 
means they go off faster and have more
power<00:04:09.069> to<00:04:09.280> kill<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:09.810> so<00:04:10.810> if<00:04:10.870> we<00:04:10.990> could<00:04:11.140> see<00:04:11.290> one

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
power to kill you so if we could see one

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.620 
power to kill you so if we could see one
of<00:04:11.560> those<00:04:11.910> there's<00:04:12.910> one<00:04:12.940> of<00:04:13.060> those<00:04:13.209> boxes

of those there's one of those boxes

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.069 
of those there's one of those boxes

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
powerful than the machine gun but that's

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.540 
powerful than the machine gun but that's
really<00:04:52.660> for<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.990> weapons<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.560> enemies
