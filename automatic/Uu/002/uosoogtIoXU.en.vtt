the shrimp and the veggies separate from

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.640 
the shrimp and the veggies separate from
the<00:02:28.459> rice<00:02:29.019> now<00:02:30.019> you<00:02:30.080> could<00:02:30.409> cook<00:02:30.620> them

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
the rice now you could cook them

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.610 
the rice now you could cook them
together<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:32.480> all<00:02:32.659> reality<00:02:32.810> once<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.379> mean<00:02:33.530> you

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
together in all reality once I mean you

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.869 
together in all reality once I mean you
could<00:02:33.709> cook<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.159> rice<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.489> put<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.700> rice<00:02:34.849> in

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
could cook the rice and put the rice in

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.699 
could cook the rice and put the rice in
two<00:02:35.690> with<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.019> shrimp<00:02:36.290> I'm<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.620> cook

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
two with the shrimp I'm going to cook

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.080 
two with the shrimp I'm going to cook
them<00:02:36.829> completely<00:02:37.190> separate<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.819> whole<00:02:37.940> way

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
them completely separate the whole way

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.110 
them completely separate the whole way
through<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:39.200> reason<00:02:39.530> being<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:40.670> can<00:02:40.909> measure

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
through the reason being you can measure

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.970 
through the reason being you can measure
out<00:02:41.299> your<00:02:41.329> rice<00:02:41.599> and<00:02:42.019> then<00:02:42.530> measure<00:02:42.769> out<00:02:42.920> your

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
out your rice and then measure out your

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.130 
out your rice and then measure out your
shrimp<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.549> veggies<00:02:44.269> separately<00:02:44.840> so<00:02:44.989> that's

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
shrimp and veggies separately so that's

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.420
