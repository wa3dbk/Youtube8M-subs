00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.140
to make these very beautiful balancing toys
you need a butterfly, card sheet, a couple

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.410
of press buttons, a toothpick mounted on a
bottle. now take the card sheet which is 15cm

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:21.480
long and 10cm wide and cut the butterfly.
now color this butterfly so that it looks

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.060
beautiful. this is the colored butterfly and
then mark 3 points, two on the wing tips and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.719
one right in the middle. this is a single
punch 
and cut out 3 holes. you can see the 3 holes

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.820
here. and then take big press buttons, open
them up and fix them. the one with the little

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.920
depression goes in such that the depression
part is below. similarly fix the other two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.130
buttons on the wing tips. they will add weight
to the wing tips and help the butterfly balance.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.270
now finally bend the butterfly so that the
wing tips are slightly below and just perch

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.170
it. this is the toothpick mounted on the bottle
full of sand and now perch it on the end of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.170
the toothpick by the press button. the butterfly
will balance beautifully and you give it a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.310
twirl and it keeps rotating. this is the beautiful
top view of the balancing butterfly. instead

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.090
of a butterfly you can also make a card figurine
like this. two long hands, two long legs.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:01.829
once again punch the 3 marked points, one
on the neck and two almost on the palms. once

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.020
again press fit 3 press buttons. we can see
that the part that is depressed is below because

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.640
this is where the press button will perch
on the toothpick. once again bend the hands

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.489
and the legs for more stability. and place
the press button on the tip of the toothpick.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.500
and once you give it a twirl, this card figurine
will keep going round and round very gracefully.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.500
enjoy the top view. these are two simple and
beautiful balancing toys. here you can see

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.340
this little kid enjoying it.
