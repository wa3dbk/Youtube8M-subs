up<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.819> local<00:01:47.819> game<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:49.159> Sasa's<00:01:50.159> Creed

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:29.890

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.370 

single<00:02:30.900> campaign<00:02:34.819> so<00:02:35.900> can't<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.110> play

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
single campaign so can't really play

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.440 
single campaign so can't really play
right<00:02:37.680> this<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.819> hand<00:02:39.060> but<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.300> can

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
right this is just one hand but you can

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.330 
right this is just one hand but you can
see<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:40.080> fairly<00:02:40.740> responsive<00:02:42.590> round<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.709> bit

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
see it's a fairly responsive round a bit

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.250 
see it's a fairly responsive round a bit
works<00:02:45.240> pretty<00:02:45.600> well<00:02:45.780> for<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.350> most<00:02:46.530> part<00:02:46.950> like

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
works pretty well for the most part like

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.860 
works pretty well for the most part like
the<00:02:49.260> only<00:02:50.090> complaint<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.240> would<00:02:51.360> have<00:02:51.540> about

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
the only complaint I would have about

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
the only complaint I would have about
the<00:02:52.350> remote<00:02:53.220> play<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.680> ideal

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the remote play is that it's not ideal

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.250 
the remote play is that it's not ideal
for<00:02:56.280> like<00:02:56.430> battlefield<00:02:57.390> or<00:02:57.600> something<00:02:58.020> cuz

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
for like battlefield or something cuz

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.570 
for like battlefield or something cuz
mainly<00:02:58.890> because<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.100> don't<00:02:59.340> have<00:02:59.459> the

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
mainly because you don't have the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.240 
mainly because you don't have the
additional<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.510> lock<00:03:01.319> stick<00:03:01.560> clickers<00:03:02.010> and

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
additional and lock stick clickers and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.580 
additional and lock stick clickers and
the<00:03:02.550> shoulder<00:03:02.880> buttons<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.750> pretty<00:03:04.410> much

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590

while<00:03:53.160> it's<00:03:53.370> using<00:03:53.730> remote<00:03:53.970> play<00:03:57.049> and<00:04:01.760> you<00:04:02.760> can

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
while it's using remote play and you can

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:14.170 
while it's using remote play and you can
play<00:04:12.110> see

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
play see

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.910 
play see
guess<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.930> might<00:04:15.140> not<00:04:15.349> be<00:04:15.500> able<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.709> play

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
guess you might not be able to play

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:28.320 
guess you might not be able to play
directly<00:04:16.400> huh

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.969 

strange<00:04:29.330> so<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.870> didn't<00:04:30.080> try<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.440> one<00:04:30.620> out<00:04:30.770> but

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
strange so I didn't try that one out but

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.379 
strange so I didn't try that one out but
you<00:04:31.850> can<00:04:32.090> launch<00:04:32.540> another<00:04:32.960> game<00:04:33.910> see<00:04:34.910> try<00:04:35.150> rez

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
you can launch another game see try rez

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:46.180 
you can launch another game see try rez
event<00:04:35.720> here<00:04:44.260> yeah<00:04:45.260> so<00:04:45.290> I<00:04:45.470> guess<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:46.010> one

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
event here yeah so I guess that one

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.730 
event here yeah so I guess that one
didn't<00:04:46.490> work<00:04:46.699> particularly<00:04:47.330> because<00:04:47.660> of<00:04:47.990> how

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
didn't work particularly because of how

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.529 
didn't work particularly because of how
handles<00:04:49.340> users<00:04:49.760> so<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.060> can't<00:04:50.389> like

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
handles users so you can't like

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.450 
handles users so you can't like
dynamically<00:04:51.440> switch<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.770> controller<00:04:52.190> in<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
dynamically switch a controller in the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.730 
dynamically switch a controller in the
middle<00:04:52.669> of<00:04:52.789> a<00:04:52.850> game<00:04:53.060> I<00:04:53.300> hope<00:04:53.870> Sony<00:04:54.169> addresses

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
middle of a game I hope Sony addresses

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.230 
middle of a game I hope Sony addresses
that<00:04:54.889> because<00:04:55.190> I<00:04:55.340> mean<00:04:55.460> that's<00:04:55.580> kind<00:04:56.060> of<00:04:56.150> a

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
that because I mean that's kind of a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.969 
that because I mean that's kind of a
feature<00:04:56.419> that<00:04:56.570> is<00:04:56.960> done<00:04:57.350> on<00:04:57.440> the<00:04:57.500> PlayStation

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
feature that is done on the PlayStation

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.770

see it's the DualShock 4 control so as

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.610 
see it's the DualShock 4 control so as
far<00:05:34.310> as<00:05:34.370> the<00:05:34.550> playstation<00:05:35.090> is<00:05:35.180> concerned<00:05:36.169> it's

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
far as the playstation is concerned it's

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:46.420 
far as the playstation is concerned it's
just<00:05:36.710> like<00:05:37.010> using<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.550> television

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:49.219 

you<00:05:47.430> can't<00:05:47.639> really<00:05:47.789> control<00:05:48.389> well<00:05:48.840> like<00:05:49.020> this

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
you can't really control well like this

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.230 
you can't really control well like this
but<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.889> mean<00:05:50.099> you<00:05:50.250> you<00:05:50.400> get<00:05:50.580> the<00:05:50.729> picture<00:05:51.060> that

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
but I mean you you get the picture that

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.969 
but I mean you you get the picture that
it's<00:05:51.389> basically<00:05:51.599> working<00:05:53.030> as<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.990> display<00:05:55.590> so

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
it's basically working as a display so

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.800 
it's basically working as a display so
it's<00:05:56.129> it's<00:05:56.490> kind<00:05:56.550> of<00:05:56.729> like<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:57.030> guess<00:05:57.240> like<00:05:57.780> the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
it's it's kind of like I guess like the

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.149 
it's it's kind of like I guess like the
we<00:05:58.080> in<00:05:58.259> the<00:05:58.349> sense<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.650> you<00:05:58.830> could<00:05:58.949> pretty

00:05:59.149 --> 00:05:59.159 
we in the sense that you could pretty

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.909 
we in the sense that you could pretty
much<00:05:59.340> just<00:05:59.520> travel<00:05:59.939> with<00:05:59.969> it<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.389> place<00:06:01.259> just

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
much just travel with it in place just

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.499 
much just travel with it in place just
like<00:06:02.039> a<00:06:02.099> headless<00:06:02.400> consul<00:06:03.000> without<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.360> TV

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
like a headless consul without the TV

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.469 
like a headless consul without the TV
and<00:06:04.159> some<00:06:05.159> portable<00:06:05.580> gaming<00:06:05.759> I<00:06:06.090> mean<00:06:06.330> it's

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
and some portable gaming I mean it's

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:08.270
