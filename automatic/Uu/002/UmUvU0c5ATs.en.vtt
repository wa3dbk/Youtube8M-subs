 prepared morning theories 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.829
 Instructors explain what consistency 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.109
 the dough should have 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.900
 wholegrain bread lumberjack stand today

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:42.060
 back pupil only yeast salt water flour 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.060

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.650
 some can not afford expensive ones 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.319
 but they are not 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.250
 absolutely necessary more than 100 recipes 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.510
 learn here 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.849
 and they can be indigenous 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.150
 ingredients modify the most important in 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.310
 bread baking precision 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.640
 Everything is very much the consistency of the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 Day is very important to the temperature too 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.780
 I would never have thought of that 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.250
 the standard is very high and the 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.250
 I want to try to keep up 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.519

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.590
 a good bread learned here 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:37.600
 Students discuss with the subject teachers 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.490
 the results of our bread is a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.070
 bit too flat because of the dough 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.419
 commenting too long has led to that 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.220
 that the bread does not rise 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.320
 we could still improve 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.600
 and then it will be the next German 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.700
 maybe bread in miami tel 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.700
