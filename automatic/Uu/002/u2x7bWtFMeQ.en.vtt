00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.450 
latest and upcoming library collections
we<00:00:18.300> rethought<00:00:18.779> everything<00:00:19.560> related<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.220> how

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
we rethought everything related to how

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.490 
we rethought everything related to how
we<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.730> make<00:00:20.939> our<00:00:21.150> sample<00:00:21.689> collections<00:00:22.170> more

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
we can make our sample collections more

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040 
we can make our sample collections more
intuitive<00:00:23.160> how<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> make<00:00:24.449> them<00:00:24.689> more

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050

flexible<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.340> playable<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.590> how<00:00:28.590> we<00:00:28.650> can

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
flexible and playable and how we can

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.040 
flexible and playable and how we can
unleash<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> potential<00:00:30.359> captured

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
unleash all the potential captured

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.190 
unleash all the potential captured
within<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.529> samples<00:00:32.059> so<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.510> decided<00:00:33.960> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
within the samples so we decided to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.950 
within the samples so we decided to
provide<00:00:34.920> single<00:00:35.280> articulation<00:00:36.120> patches<00:00:36.630> as

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
provide single articulation patches as

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.639 
provide single articulation patches as

some<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.760> patches<00:00:45.000> are<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.450> special

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
some of the patches are very special

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.690 
some of the patches are very special

to<00:00:59.219> keep<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> structure<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.210> concept

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
to keep the structure and concept

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.340 
to keep the structure and concept
consistent<00:01:01.730> both<00:01:02.730> types<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.329> patches<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
consistent both types of patches the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.340 
consistent both types of patches the
singles<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:05.129> well<00:01:05.790> as<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> multi<00:01:06.270> patches<00:01:06.689> are

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
singles as well as the multi patches are

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.230 
singles as well as the multi patches are
very<00:01:07.680> similar<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.280> comes<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.820> settings

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
very similar when it comes to settings

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.580 
very similar when it comes to settings
and<00:01:09.360> customization<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.299> why<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.170> would

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
and customization so that's why I would

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
and customization so that's why I would
like<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.040> show<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.850> multi<00:01:15.420> articulation

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
like to show you the multi articulation

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.249 
like to show you the multi articulation
patches<00:01:16.439> first<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> number<00:01:19.140> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
patches first you see a number of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.320 
patches first you see a number of
elements<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> look<00:01:20.070> quite<00:01:20.430> familiar<00:01:20.790> and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
elements that look quite familiar and

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.130 
elements that look quite familiar and
easy<00:01:22.310> but<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:24.119> system<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> articulations

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
easy but the system of articulations

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
easy but the system of articulations
switching<00:01:25.799> behind<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.580> very<00:01:26.939> intelligent

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
switching behind it is very intelligent

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.460 
switching behind it is very intelligent
but<00:01:28.140> let's<00:01:28.650> start<00:01:28.979> with<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> basics<00:01:30.470> where

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
but let's start with the basics where

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
but let's start with the basics where
