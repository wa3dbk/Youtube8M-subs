this is all I have to say I kind of

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.640 
this is all I have to say I kind of
ripped<00:00:38.500> that<00:00:38.620> part<00:00:38.890> but<00:00:39.340> um<00:00:39.550> here's<00:00:40.270> the<00:00:40.360> case

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
ripped that part but um here's the case

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.860 
ripped that part but um here's the case
so<00:00:42.040> yeah<00:00:42.309> this<00:00:42.460> case<00:00:42.700> looks<00:00:42.940> kind<00:00:43.360> of<00:00:43.420> nice

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
so yeah this case looks kind of nice

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.100 
so yeah this case looks kind of nice
it's<00:00:44.860> obviously<00:00:45.250> clear<00:00:45.540> has<00:00:46.540> some<00:00:46.750> bumpers

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
it's obviously clear has some bumpers

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.080 
it's obviously clear has some bumpers
here<00:00:47.410> on<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.800> top<00:00:47.980> it<00:00:48.220> you<00:00:48.309> know<00:00:48.400> you<00:00:48.489> have<00:00:48.760> the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
here on the top it you know you have the

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.680 
here on the top it you know you have the
lock<00:00:49.449> button<00:00:49.720> here<00:00:50.080> because<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.210> I<00:00:52.239> think<00:00:52.480> the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
lock button here because so I think the

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.119 
lock button here because so I think the
IR<00:00:52.900> blaster<00:00:52.930> can<00:00:53.379> be<00:00:53.440> used<00:00:53.620> through<00:00:53.830> it<00:00:53.949> since

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
IR blaster can be used through it since

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.640 
IR blaster can be used through it since

through it so let's see how a huge gripe

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.950 
through it so let's see how a huge gripe
I<00:01:24.430> had<00:01:24.610> about<00:01:24.880> the<00:01:25.119> speed<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.539> case<00:01:25.690> was<00:01:25.869> that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
I had about the speed in case was that

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320 
I had about the speed in case was that
the<00:01:26.080> volume<00:01:26.380> buttons<00:01:26.649> kind<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.610> sticky<00:01:28.180> but

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
the volume buttons kind of sticky but

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.760 
the volume buttons kind of sticky but
this<00:01:28.539> case<00:01:28.810> does<00:01:28.990> not<00:01:29.140> seem<00:01:29.380> to<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.590> that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
this case does not seem to have that

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.180 
this case does not seem to have that
problem

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
problem

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.820 
problem
so<00:01:31.119> yeah<00:01:31.299> this<00:01:31.420> case<00:01:31.630> is<00:01:31.810> actually<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.320> lot

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
so yeah this case is actually a lot

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.450 
so yeah this case is actually a lot
lighter<00:01:33.640> than<00:01:33.760> I<00:01:33.970> anticipated<00:01:34.299> it<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:34.720> be<00:01:34.930> I

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
lighter than I anticipated it to be I
