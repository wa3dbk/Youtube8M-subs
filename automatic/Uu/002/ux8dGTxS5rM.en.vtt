jazz ride on your right hand the idea of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
jazz ride on your right hand the idea of
this<00:00:29.519> exercise<00:00:30.149> actually<00:00:30.419> came<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.199> was

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
this exercise actually came about I was

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.700 
this exercise actually came about I was
doing<00:00:31.979> a<00:00:32.239> gig<00:00:33.239> recently<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.350> were<00:00:34.410> doing<00:00:34.620> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
doing a gig recently and we were doing a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.750 
doing a gig recently and we were doing a
lot<00:00:34.859> of<00:00:35.449> very<00:00:36.449> quiet<00:00:37.140> slow<00:00:37.800> jazz<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.609> was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
lot of very quiet slow jazz and I was

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.110 
lot of very quiet slow jazz and I was
playing<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.179> lot<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.449> quarter<00:00:39.719> note<00:00:39.870> kick<00:00:40.829> drum

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
playing a lot of quarter note kick drum

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.759 
playing a lot of quarter note kick drum
patterns<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.329> generally<00:00:43.230> when<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
patterns and generally when I do that I

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.709 
patterns and generally when I do that I
played<00:00:44.579> two<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.879> four<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.210> high<00:00:45.329> hat<00:00:45.510> but

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
played two and four in the high hat but

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
played two and four in the high hat but
I<00:00:45.809> wanted<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> try<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> vary<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> pattern

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
I wanted to try to vary at that pattern

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.009 
I wanted to try to vary at that pattern
a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.179> and<00:00:48.359> when<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> tried<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.839> I

00:00:49.009 --> 00:00:49.019 
a little bit and when I tried to I

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.020 
a little bit and when I tried to I
realized<00:00:49.589> that<00:00:50.300> I<00:00:51.300> wasn't<00:00:52.109> able<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.469> do<00:00:52.620> it

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
realized that I wasn't able to do it

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.399 
realized that I wasn't able to do it
without<00:00:54.030> interfering<00:00:54.839> with<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> right<00:00:55.140> foot

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
without interfering with the right foot

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.349 
without interfering with the right foot
so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> realized<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.429> needed<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.820> actually<00:00:56.999> work

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
so I realized I needed to actually work

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.139 
so I realized I needed to actually work
on<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.769> so<00:00:58.769> I<00:00:59.280> thought<00:00:59.789> would<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> good

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
on that so I thought would be a good

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.930 
on that so I thought would be a good
idea<00:01:00.710> to<00:01:01.710> me<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.069> video<00:01:02.249> together<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.879> it

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
idea to me put a video together for it

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.710 
idea to me put a video together for it
as<00:01:03.030> well<00:01:03.290> so<00:01:04.290> in<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.280> video<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:06.149> look<00:01:06.329> at<00:01:06.450> four

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
as well so in this video we look at four

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.080 
as well so in this video we look at four
different<00:01:06.869> ways<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:08.070> way<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.610> ways

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
different ways and the way you can ways

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.870 
different ways and the way you can ways
you<00:01:09.270> can<00:01:09.420> build<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.799> left<00:01:11.130> foot<00:01:11.340> against<00:01:11.790> the

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
you can build that left foot against the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.050 
you can build that left foot against the
right<00:01:12.060> foot<00:01:12.299> quarter<00:01:12.630> note<00:01:12.930> kick<00:01:13.200> pattern<00:01:14.060> the

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
right foot quarter note kick pattern the

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.429 
right foot quarter note kick pattern the
first<00:01:15.329> demonstration<00:01:15.899> shows<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.040> pattern<00:01:17.640> of

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
first demonstration shows a pattern of

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.289 
first demonstration shows a pattern of
downbeats<00:01:19.439> upbeats<00:01:20.130> quarter<00:01:20.790> note<00:01:20.909> triplets

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
downbeats upbeats quarter note triplets

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.319 
downbeats upbeats quarter note triplets
and<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.780> cyber<00:01:22.500> shuffle<00:01:23.100> feel<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> left

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
and a cyber shuffle feel on the left

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.940 
and a cyber shuffle feel on the left
foot<00:01:24.540> against<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.229> quarter<00:01:25.530> note<00:01:25.680> pattern

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
foot against that quarter note pattern

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.480 
foot against that quarter note pattern
in<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.250> jazz<00:01:26.549> ride<00:01:27.320> then<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:28.890> two

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
in the jazz ride then we look at two

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.920 
in the jazz ride then we look at two
measures<00:01:29.789> taken<00:01:29.969> out<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.299> Ted<00:01:30.479> read<00:01:30.689> book

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
measures taken out of the Ted read book

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.870 
measures taken out of the Ted read book
so<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:31.920> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> rhythmic<00:01:32.399> figures<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
so we look at the rhythmic figures and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.550 
so we look at the rhythmic figures and
we<00:01:32.969> read<00:01:33.180> those<00:01:33.390> figures<00:01:33.840> with<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> left<00:01:34.350> foot

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
we read those figures with the left foot

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.200 
we read those figures with the left foot
while<00:01:34.829> we're<00:01:34.979> playing<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.759> right<00:01:35.969> foot

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
while we're playing the right foot

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.289 
while we're playing the right foot
quarter<00:01:36.539> note<00:01:36.689> kick<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> jazz<00:01:37.829> ride<00:01:38.299> then

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
quarter note kick and the jazz ride then

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.959 
quarter note kick and the jazz ride then
we<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.110> same<00:01:40.320> figure<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> apply<00:01:41.939> a

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
we take that same figure and apply a

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:44.359 
we take that same figure and apply a
left<00:01:42.270> hand<00:01:42.539> pattern<00:01:43.200> simple<00:01:43.979> left<00:01:44.159> hand

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
left hand pattern simple left hand

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
left hand pattern simple left hand
pattern<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.539> we<00:01:45.659> take<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.930> same<00:01:46.109> figure

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
pattern and then we take the same figure

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
pattern and then we take the same figure
again<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.549> go<00:01:47.729> back<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.149> we<00:01:48.210> play<00:01:48.479> down

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
again and we go back and we play down

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
again and we go back and we play down
beats<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.320> then<00:01:49.590> upbeats<00:01:50.149> alternating<00:01:51.149> on

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
beats and then upbeats alternating on

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.090 
beats and then upbeats alternating on
the<00:01:51.509> high<00:01:51.659> hat<00:01:51.689> while<00:01:52.560> we're<00:01:52.770> playing<00:01:53.009> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the high hat while we're playing that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.029 
the high hat while we're playing that
rhythmic<00:01:53.340> figure<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.880> left<00:01:54.090> hand<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.539> I

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
rhythmic figure on the left hand so I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.289 
rhythmic figure on the left hand so I
put<00:01:56.039> graphics<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:56.850> each<00:01:56.939> videos

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
put graphics up for each videos

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
put graphics up for each videos
