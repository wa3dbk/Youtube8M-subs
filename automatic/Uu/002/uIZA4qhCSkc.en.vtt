00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 washing machine repair by example 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.519
 candy one of the most author reasons 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.179
 machine breakdown 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:25.050
 it is not working discharge of water causes 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:27.599
 somewhat clogged filter in this filter 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.239
 gets socks 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:39.800
 easier items and prevent water from draining 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:39.800
 check clean the following reason 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:48.410
 faulty pump with this later 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:01.100
 there is a problem with the controller that is 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:11.310
 pump controls 7 page 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:13.080
 the thing is falling apart to a to a to a to a to a to 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.110
 controls 7 pp 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.710
 pump that is, in the absence of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.710
 voltage 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 the reason in him is he replaced costs 130 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 rubles and that is, the control fee is not 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:37.860
 necessarily change everything happens instead 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.140
 Seven fear worth unloading relay here 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.430
 such a plan 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:51.710
 wake noel and all this can be done 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:51.710
 in radio stores work with soldering can 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 entrust in any repair service 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.700
 cell phones even rubles 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.750
 two hundred three hundred can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.019
 get to the main culprit 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.060
 faults must be put 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.760
 put the car on a god somewhere else 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.720
 so many nuances 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.510
 side of the filter where the pump is installed 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:31.739
 just as well you can get here 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:34.530
 first check this pump 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.959
 an image on it that is or 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:43.349
 controller we connect the tester 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:03:01.370
 750 volts AC and run 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:03:06.440
 program water flush clicked 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:13.760
 the voltage is there should work 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:16.760
 It is equally important that the voltage 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.760
 turned off 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:35.609
 press the controller because I am 7 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:39.930
 pp me the second time and on this machine u 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:42.750
 whom is the pad which is such a narrow block 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.990
 pin close together 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.990
 and they are the world of owl times 0 and 7 pages 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.470
 constantly was this state 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.030
 turned off 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:03.810
 but not with the movement therefore had to 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:06.180
 I changed the image of the pads at all such 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:12.300
 Russian pads still Chinese better 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:18.049
 immediately replace the normal terminals means 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:27.570
 the voltage we have remains this 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:29.930
 the main culprit friction time 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:43.500
 self-tapping screws 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:46.220
 ironik style star t15 all 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:52.290
 cars such tunisia pump costs 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.500
 different power pump in general tourist 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.500
 she is 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:07.350
 power and different pads 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:14.550
 the arrangement of boats chips in principle 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:17.700
 the idea is the same there is such a thing that pump 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.960
 and supply voltage there turn on 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.720
 socket to turn it on 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.419
 will work even this faulty 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:28.169
 the pump will work but the trick is 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:33.450
 that I teach with pressure when it is flooded 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:36.210
 water this impeller it shifts and and 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.760
 starts to go, that is for this reason 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.479
 and cars 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.600
 regime work then rises in the poet 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:48.960
 hardly something that the impeller is 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:52.500
 blocked just got smeared 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.910
 itâ€™s useless to buy a new one 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.530
 don't go through brains 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:01.990
 there throws there costs another 500 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:07.450
 normal followers can be Chinese 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:10.230
 work fine go shop buy 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.230
 document pump itself 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:32.320
 set the screws twist and turn off 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:36.330
 fermentation pads make sure they don't see 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.330
 flow all
