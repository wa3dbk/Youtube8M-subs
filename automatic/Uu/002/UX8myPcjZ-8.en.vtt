00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.379
 new video from auto.de we have today 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.599
 a different vehicle for you 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.059
 is for me a living room at four 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.670
 the luxury and comfort in the truest sense 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.710
 senses of the word embodied and from what 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.020
 Of course, I speak is the new one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.699
 mercedes benz s class coupe directly 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.279
 I have to say in advance before we go to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.029
 design go over that on this car 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.189
 scary gadgets and gadgets 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.260
 But comfortable innovations can be found 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.239
 Let's summarize design technically 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.430
 what has changed because who the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.860
 predecessor of the new s class coupes 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.050
 knows who knows that we are here with this 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.879
 dare a completely different world before us 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.950
 have in contrast to this baby 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.739
 not only is the predecessor here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.539
 chunky and a bit unfair to me 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.399
 It is not such a stream less beautiful 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.340
 Form that says my god is one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 nice car no but find the whole 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.730
 we are here now 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.250
 the front remains typical bands gorgeous 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 massive and yet somehow dynamic that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.330
 means we have such a swing here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.210
 The front is also in the crib below 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.100
 shows usually finds yes com is like that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.720
 great but here I can 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.850
 tolerate and think that fits in well 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.130
 overall picture maybe that is something 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.170
 atypical hre grill in the amg leyen 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 Ever noticed somehow with you 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 because we have these little ones here 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.909
 say times points squares diamonds stone 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 shape and thus I already give 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 a little hint to what now 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.840
 comes namely the headlights full led 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.790
 here is quite normal that circle 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.530
 we can not get worse 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.270
 but of course it is still possible 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.530
 icing on the cake why not 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.880
 we have 47 real swarovski here 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.040
 crystals integrated in the leds that is 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.860
 but really decadence of this car 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.869
 is really wonderful and beautiful 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.240
 Of course, that fits 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.159
 coupéform super nice in such a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.689
 streamline picture is pure that is 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.540
 basic form I've been really nice 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.759
 but also given the lines to 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.469
 to the headlights everything is wonderful 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.440
 There is agreement with each other 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.060
 of course the possibility our 19 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.980
 inch rims here also with 20 inches 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.780
 because something else to replace and 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.730
 Normally I would also recommend 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.160
 to choose the 20s for me personally 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.400
 optically, that's always very good 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.760
 19 inches are doing really well here 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.530
 the tail reminds a very small one 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.700
 a bit to the cl so a whole 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 little bit you do not want it 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.680
 really, but yes, this is true 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.330
 typical sloping elongated very 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.910
 pulled it back one more 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.830
 a bit there but also back in here 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.390
 beautiful again an elegant again 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.480
 sportier again in better 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.030
 under the hood of the s 500 4matic op 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.370
 here is the 4.6 liter v8 offer 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.610
 he does not come from amg though 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.530
 I personally am a super drifting 450 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.500
 ps will be enough for these two 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.959
 very elegant to move and man 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.959
 has a wonderful researched music 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.480
 As said at the beginning, ours 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.489
 test object here now also small 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.129
 gadgets that life so a bit 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.110
 make it more luxurious, such as soft close 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.140
 that means if I do not open the door 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.269
 really want to be peppered 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.840
 the dare just closes that off 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.250
 alone 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.870
 You see, we have a little one again 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.040
 Guest with us no longer wait 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.360
 but that was not wanted 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.909
 Bad because I wanted you now 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.790
 the interior of the class a little bit 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:45.069
 bring closer I believe the whole 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.629
 speaks a little bit for himself 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.700
 if you purely sets here just with 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.280
 this bright leather and this silver 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.590
 you first think of the faceted disguise 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.239
 times okay here you could stay longer 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.099
 but if you then also clean up 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.959
 It all feels scary 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.569
 comfortable and comfortable 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.790
 You can really spend several hours here 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.139
 spend without boring that 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.269
 not just because of the whole 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.310
 Electronic gadgets are the same color 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.290
 will show but also at the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.670
 Incidentally, we also contribute with the atmosphere 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.560
 appropriate lighting and a 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.669
 It is now possible to change a little 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.380
 on the back seat of the s class coupé 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.849
 and I think it's the same here 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.919
 comfortable as in front 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.080
 you say that a bit back here 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.690
 pure and then adapts automatically 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.270
 This form of so everything is very quiet 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:34.120
 and pleasantly built around a rum 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.669
 he is now sitting on the position 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.889
 adjusted how I need the seat 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.110
 and I still have a lot of legroom 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.150
 I can imagine if we are now 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.770
 a very tall male driver 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.240
 and then someone again 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 male back here that is then 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.550
 could be something from the two 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.680
 but that's just a guess because 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.260
 It's so comfortable and blogger here 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.449
 built that here I believe also men 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.639
 find very good place and what, by the way 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.039
 very noticeable if you are here 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.560
 ever moved in this vehicle 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.780
 that we are everywhere from every direction 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.159
 speakers have us from all 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.610
 can sound on the side if we have the 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:14.080
 even want down here but of course 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.000
 Again, there are practical ones 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.580
 possibilities on the side you see 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.780
 there is nothing for it but in the middle 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.750
 or 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.880
 something more hidden here where we are then 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.830
 different possibilities have ours 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.340
 to store little things that's 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.190
 mentioned it has class coupe sit up 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.810
 also good but there she goes course 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.190
 Also good we get from the outside world 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.130
 we have hardly anything with the engine 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.070
 unfortunately only with open windows 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.200
 but what we always so easy 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.940
 beautiful eight years of the exhaust system 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.889
 I already mentioned you are here 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.030
 really a bit of a passenger though 

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.950
 that's all right we have 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.270
 here for example the stop and go 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.890
 pilots I just call him 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.230
 autopilot over a speed of 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.970
 maximum 60 km / h if with a traffic jam 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.470
 stand for easy clean 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.030
 that means he takes over the steering of the 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.340
 tronic plus takes over the decency gas 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.500
 and brake actually turned 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.040
 theoretically by itself which is also a lot 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:14.060
 Chains is the 3d high end 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.160
 surround plant of buhrmester there can 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:21.110
 you set various modes but that is 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:25.250
 not so important as the important one 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:27.050
 point is that you have what speakers in the 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.700
 That is why she has crossbeams from the moon 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.260
 are not in the doors and stairs then 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.140
 as it may be from the cheap 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.479
 blaupunkt conversion knows but the 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:39.260
 There are sound with the body 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:41.120
 160,000 also something to complain of course 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.979
 Something can always be found and 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.320
 Although it is this bipartite display 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:49.330
 but that is common knowledge that is 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.979
 not so nice and I think 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:55.550
 the facelift will come or the new one 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.960
 s class then that is also cleaned up 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.940
 be and look a bit beautiful 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.980
 second crack point for me is I know 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.080
 not how well you see it 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.480
 the sitting position I really like that 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.340
 deep as current, however, there 

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.190
 so much technology in this seat in it 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.110
 is just for a coupe in 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.240
 Much like me personally 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.950
 could be on the swarovski shepherd 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.020
 but I have to give up altogether 

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.550
 Honestly say that's a different kind 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.460
 Driving is really a man 

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:23.990
 Passenger himself as a driver and totally 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.550
 decoupled from the world compared with 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.980
 other luxury coupés already love 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.230
 I think Mercedes has 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.940
 the one made a great job and it 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.650
 of course, hurts a little details 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.360
 but it is still a wonderful one 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.920
 car that was already synonymous with the video 

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.450
 we hope you enjoyed it very much 

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.580
 If so, then give us 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:43.010
 just a thumb up or last one 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.410
 Abo there or just do both directly 

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:47.390
 is and remains free and you stay 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:49.730
 always up to date otherwise 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:52.240
 say thank you very much for seeing and 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:52.240
 until next time
