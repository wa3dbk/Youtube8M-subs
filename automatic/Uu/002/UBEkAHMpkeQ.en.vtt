 Hi, this is Laurent Garnier. We are in Prague club ROXY and I am curious, 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
 what it will be like today! 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.200
 I just play music that I like 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.800
 I've always liked music, actually since childhood. 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:43.000
 That's why I think there's nothing wrong with playing different styles for people in the club. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 I don't know borders in music. Definitely not the one I listen to at home. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 Listening to one and the same style of music would probably bore me to death. 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.909
 I hate to repeat myself, so I'm sure today's tracks won't be the same as ten percent, 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.319
 what I played yesterday. 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:33.100
 So is it a new show every time? 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.560
 Definitely for me. In my opinion, the right DJ should not be repeated. It's the same as when 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.000
 the same style of music is played in one piece. Just boring! 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.400
 Prague is one of the top five TOP 5 places in the world. 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.300
 Last time I arrived at ROXY until afterparty. We played with the band before and then we decided, "How about going to Roxy 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.819
 and play there? "Suddenly I just stagi and played long, really late into the night. 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.819
 It was a little crazy. Yes, I remember it, though only a little ... 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.330
 I'm very lucky because I have a very strong relationship with ROXY 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.200
 Here it is every time. We just hit it. We climbed the stage, tried a few things, and people suddenly felt it 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.310
 It was unbelievable. I really think I'm with the locals 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.700
 people a great relationship.
