like they're obviously laid back in
their<00:01:15.240> plate<00:01:15.450> because<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.840> took<00:01:15.960> them<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> while

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
their plate because it took them a while

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
their plate because it took them a while
to<00:01:16.350> things<00:01:16.979> but<00:01:17.490> they're<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.790> sure<00:01:18.060> about

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
their engagements and grabbing a seems a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.940 
their engagements and grabbing a seems a
lot<00:01:20.790> easier<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.659> which<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.259> huge

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
lot easier for them now which is a huge

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.200
