 Zips are very good for me 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.780

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.309
 Variation in the story has the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.199
 taken out and thought it says can 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.760
 Also, do not say how easy this route is 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.670
 has me times on a letter 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.770
 question posed there can be incredible 189 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 gram out, it indicates a 2 meters 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.640
 seventy route that's really damn 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.379
 easily and it comes through the highly 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.830
 compacted carbon now here in this 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.380

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.420
 of the carbons here in the frame of the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.880
 fishing for real his route to the predator 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.270
 on fuzzy roll everything that you think 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.430
 Expects this thing here with the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.200
 the roll holder for the role 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.110
 of course fix this in this 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.240
 Price range of the classics that one here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.890
 no star screw has but also 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.110
 again this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.200
 dunlop material here in the handle area 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.880
 very nice grip this great details 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.560
 in the transitions so that already 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.270
 really a really nice professional route 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.860
 you see, it was much better 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.950
 put in here with this stamp 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.930
 again with the fox logo I have now 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.759
 just here we are the action 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.140
 looked at the route so that I would 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.840
 sometimes shipping goes into the curative education 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.909
 that means that the first half 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.080
 the route offers this the top 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.070
 is quite sensitive so perfect too 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.960
 fish with rubber fish and the grains 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.619
 So tick has three in there 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.050
 variants and that always has seven to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.000
 56 grams so a really great range 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.890
 with which you can fish everything from 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.600
 little jerking little rubber fish 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.090
 up to the heavier lures 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.140
 and then there are in three lengths and 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.209
 although in two meters 240 and 270 you 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
