00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 we left for brioche friends 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.610
 shooting 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 so here I put the 250 g of milk a 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:19.830
 little bag of baker's yeast 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.289
 which is 7 g and 80 g of sugar so there I 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.330
 am going to heat up so six minutes I 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:36.110
 go close the lid took then 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:47.039
 even a montage in the program six minutes 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:58.199
 37 degrees so I 'll add 5 g 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:01:00.109
 of butter me my balance I find 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.960
 that she works very well 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.930
 the whole thing is that there are no things 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.150
 under the talent of those to read 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.180
 the three small plastic supports that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.950
 I am well flat and very clean this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.360
 is not the body in a thermos miss 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.369
 because it made a lot of things 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.770
 who are paf keane cold too hot 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.930
 that's otherwise I have already done several 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.500
 checks with my little scale there 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.500
 no problem 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.110
 so I was looking for my time 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:02:00.729
 and here we go, let's go back three 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.630
 minutes 35 degrees so here I go 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.119
 now be my flour and I 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.370
 will put my spoon a bastard of flow and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:18.250
 I'm going m now so the bowl is closed on 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:31.150
 will schedule four minutes 30 in 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:33.970
 function kneaded I filmed my paw and 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.670
 it was worth at rest I will monitor it 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.489
 in general it takes an hour and a half 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 something like that and she should arrive 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.870
 the Belgian to the cellophane of the salad bowl 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.319
 at a while ago so that's it 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.970
 exactly a revenge that the dough 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:55.150
 rest 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.389
 so in fact I'm going to take her out of the salat 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.389
 said 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:22.500
 it's a bit complicated but good so I 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:29.239
 can just show you that 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.239
 gives when it picks up the salad bowl 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.680
 so personal I just clear to 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.220
 so lead her by folding a little bit of a 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.480
 principle of puff pastry in 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:54.570
 portfolio species many times 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:04:02.310
 now and in a little bit of air 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:07.470
 who is coming out here are my good patriots in 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.750
 what a minute was enough 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.690
 so here I put down my paper 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.060
 greased on a plate I made my 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.970
 little balls so well I actually did 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 the shape of a prettiest shape 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.610
 possible 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.160
 ben I like to do a kind of 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.930
 Daisy 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.980
 this is actually just to file 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.170
 little balls next to each other 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.300
 others like a little bit tight like that 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.350
 when she swells 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.350
 she clings leads 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.969
 that's okay if she feels 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:50.879
 not perfect because anyway in 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:54.990
 swelling that's a little bit more 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:57.180
 pretty lady here and we'll leave 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.539
 rest a little half an hour there so there 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.089
 I rested a quarter of an hour 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.639
 because I have to leave 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:08.699
 but see that already a little bit 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.219
 inflated the time that the oven preheated to 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:14.569
 200 degrees so here I'm basting 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.569
 with a little milk actually 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.600
 so that it sleeps and so that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.800
 sugar seed can stick well on 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.830
 can also put nuggets of 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.830
 chocolate 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:38.440
 sorry for the sound of children who 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:51.610
 did not want to nap this 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:56.910
 after noon but the small grains here 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.910
 so here I am baking at 200 degrees 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.380
 for a quarter of an hour 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:15.460
 we are one minute from the end 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.610
 that's what she looks like 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.180
 so when he is like that after you 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:24.280
 to monitor how you want 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.050
 whether she is me I will leave her 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.440
 three famous minutes and I show you 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:33.330
 after tasting so tasting 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.330
 is the friend and finances 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:57.400
 we can still see which thread of 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:07:05.259
 month it's all tastes selanne the 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:06.500
 bun duck the France it 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:14.620

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.620
 is it good
