00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.080
 in this presentation we are going to review 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:20.190
 three defensive tactical principles that 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:23.160
 they are toppling and swap coverages 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:25.800
 the players or the yellow circles 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.550
 will be the players in attack the circle 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.130
 in black it will be the ball and the circles 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:37.430
 blue will be the defensive line 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.910
 naming those on this right and 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.430
 left will be right lateral central 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.730
 Left central right and slope of 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.730
 left foot 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.360
 we will see how the defense moves 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.990
 depending on who has the position 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.990
 of the ball 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.329
 let's see in the 1st 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 In the first instance, how is the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.500
 defense against an attack by the band 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.500
 left 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.590
 be a player of the left band 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.560
 the marking to that player will be done by 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.729
 closest defense is to say the lateral 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.399
 left goes to the mark and all the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.609
 defense as you would have seen scale 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.230
 to the left is to say that of the 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.690
 position that was 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.300
 they went back 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.510
 and cover the spaces where the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.510
 ball 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.979
 the player the left center 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.670
 is exercising what is called a 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.979
 I mean coverage 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.869
 be in a position to cover the player 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.730
 that goes to the marking in case this one 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.780
 be remembered by the owner of the color 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:03.810
 which we will see a little later 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.640
 What is important here is that the player 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.240
 left side has left to the marking 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:12.700
 because he was the closest player and has 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.209
 left diagonally for what 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.580
 that is to be somewhat overflowing the central 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.390
 left have time to reach the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.180
 mark well also in this case the 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.280
 attacker has decided not to overflow or has 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.349
 judged that he can not do it so 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.230
 both will change the game towards the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.720
 another band 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.300
 and observe 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.210
 the defense has recovered to the position 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.480
 initial that is to say it has tilted to its 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.420
 start position now the step will come out 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.790
 towards the other band and look again 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.120
 that now the tilt is towards the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.120
 right side 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.549
 and the right side will go to the mark 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.549
 of the attacker by right 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.610
 the marking 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.940
 this time the overflow will be 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.030
 the attacker 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.820
 and the player who is doing coverage 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.250
 will come out by marking that once the lateral 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.280
 right has been overflowed 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.030
 in that way 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.190
 that way prevents this player 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.520
 delay the penetration of that player on 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:34.560
 player who has been mocked 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:39.390
 must perform what is called a swap 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.870
 that is to recover or go to occupy the 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.870
 space 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.400
 de jova has been his partner for going to 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.900
 cover him 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.540
 that is, the player who was 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.430
 making coverage 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.970
 that he was doing coverage he has 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.220
 had to leave the mark 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.460
 and this player will retrieve it from this 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.460
 mode 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.950
 that is the trade-off
