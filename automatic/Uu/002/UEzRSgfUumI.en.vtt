you<00:00:31.260> can<00:00:31.439> use<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> styrofoam<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.180> egg

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
you can use the styrofoam on an egg

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
you can use the styrofoam on an egg
carton<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:34.469> also<00:00:34.710> works<00:00:35.130> but<00:00:35.399> it's<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.610> as

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
carton which also works but it's not as

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.860 
carton which also works but it's not as
durable<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.380> will<00:00:38.570> determine<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
durable so you will determine the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.869 
durable so you will determine the
fitting<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.500> size<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.040> diameter<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
fitting the size of the diameter of the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of the rubber whooping gasket you going

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.650 
of the rubber whooping gasket you going
to<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.579> there<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.300> socket

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to put in there I like to use a socket

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.479 
to put in there I like to use a socket
set<00:00:45.870> try<00:00:46.200> different<00:00:46.379> sizes<00:00:46.950> till<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.219> find

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
set try different sizes till you find

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.360 
set try different sizes till you find
the<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> fits<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.899> okay<00:00:49.829> when

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
the one that fits like that okay when

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.750 
the one that fits like that okay when
you've<00:00:50.520> got<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.030> place<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.760> rubber

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
you've got that place it on your rubber

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.439 
you've got that place it on your rubber
take<00:00:54.300> up<00:00:54.480> ten<00:00:54.780> describe<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
take up ten describe it so you have you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.720 
take up ten describe it so you have you
can<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> outline<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.739> cut<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> out

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
can see what the outline is cut it out

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
can see what the outline is cut it out
until<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:01.020> disc<00:01:01.829> made<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> rubber<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
until you have a disc made of rubber or

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.719 
until you have a disc made of rubber or
styrofoam<00:01:04.049> from<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> egg<00:01:04.500> carton<00:01:05.100> here's<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
styrofoam from the egg carton here's the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.870 
styrofoam from the egg carton here's the
key<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.570> take<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:07.159> exacto<00:01:08.159> knife<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
key you then take your exacto knife and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.090 
key you then take your exacto knife and
you<00:01:09.000> cut<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> slot<00:01:09.720> right<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.530> quarter

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you cut a slot right into it quarter

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.429 
you cut a slot right into it quarter
inch<00:01:11.250> slot<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.240> you're<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> have<00:01:12.900> your

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
inch slot so you're going to have your

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.070 
inch slot so you're going to have your
rubber<00:01:13.710> disc<00:01:14.100> okay<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> quarter<00:01:15.659> inch<00:01:15.840> slot

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
rubber disc okay and a quarter inch slot

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.170 
rubber disc okay and a quarter inch slot
there<00:01:16.439> do<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.100> cut<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.369> outer<00:01:17.670> edge<00:01:17.939> because

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
there do not cut the outer edge because

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
there do not cut the outer edge because
that's<00:01:18.330> what's<00:01:18.570> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.810> seal<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.470> keep

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that's what's going to seal up and keep

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.020 
that's what's going to seal up and keep
your<00:01:20.580> pressure<00:01:20.880> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.630> can<00:01:21.810> see<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:23.030> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
your pressure if you can see that the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.690 
your pressure if you can see that the
air<00:01:24.210> pressure<00:01:24.600> will<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:25.049> through<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.310> slot

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
air pressure will go through the slot

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.230 
air pressure will go through the slot
there<00:01:27.710> or<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> water<00:01:29.040> won't<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.970> then<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
there or the water won't so then you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.370 
there or the water won't so then you
just<00:01:30.450> take<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:32.340> put<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> inside

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
just take that and you put it inside

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.560 
just take that and you put it inside
like<00:01:34.380> so<00:01:34.970> you're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.150> have<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.450> have<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
like so you're going to have to have a

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
like so you're going to have to have a
fitting<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> fittings<00:01:37.950> later

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
fitting for about the fittings later

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.840 
fitting for about the fittings later
just<00:01:38.820> screw<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.390> okay<00:01:40.610> there<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> go

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just screw that on okay there you go

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.220 
just screw that on okay there you go
like<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.170> now<00:01:43.170> when<00:01:43.409> you're<00:01:43.530> fast

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.750 

all<00:01:48.230> right<00:01:48.910> turn<00:01:49.910> over<00:01:50.150> no<00:01:50.900> water<00:01:51.140> comes<00:01:51.440> out

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
all right turn over no water comes out

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.960 
all right turn over no water comes out
okay

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
okay

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.590 
okay
and<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:54.560> does<00:01:54.770> hold<00:01:54.950> pressure<00:01:55.390> we'll<00:01:56.390> take

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
and it does hold pressure we'll take

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.969 
and it does hold pressure we'll take
that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.980 

friction<00:02:05.610> fitting<00:02:06.149> onto<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.780> hope<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
friction fitting onto that I hope the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.440 
friction fitting onto that I hope the
holes<00:02:07.289> give<00:02:08.220> us<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> pumping<00:02:09.030> some<00:02:09.239> pressure

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
holes give us a pumping some pressure

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.570 
holes give us a pumping some pressure
there<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.569> go<00:02:12.720> old<00:02:13.680> fresh<00:02:14.099> from<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> water

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
there you go old fresh from the water

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.699 
there you go old fresh from the water
does<00:02:14.790> not<00:02:14.819> leaked<00:02:15.209> out<00:02:15.390> now<00:02:16.019> when<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.260> fire<00:02:16.560> it

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
does not leaked out now when you fire it

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.500 
does not leaked out now when you fire it
