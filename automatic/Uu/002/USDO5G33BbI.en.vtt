00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
get to call in a blackbird but the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.879 
get to call in a blackbird but the

killstreaks I'm running and this are

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.520 
killstreaks I'm running and this are
quite<00:03:02.069> different<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.760> my<00:03:03.000> my<00:03:03.510> huge<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.169> that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
quite different from my my huge and that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.199 
quite different from my my huge and that
is<00:03:04.709> obviously<00:03:05.430> what<00:03:05.700> I've<00:03:05.819> mentioned<00:03:06.030> before

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
is obviously what I've mentioned before

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.839 
is obviously what I've mentioned before
and<00:03:06.750> these<00:03:07.379> are<00:03:07.439> ones<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:07.919> are<00:03:08.609> mapped

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
and these are ones that are mapped

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.420 
and these are ones that are mapped
specific<00:03:09.810> kill<00:03:09.989> streaks<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.379> I<00:03:10.439> tend<00:03:10.919> to<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
specific kill streaks that I tend to to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.149 
specific kill streaks that I tend to to
turn<00:03:11.700> on<00:03:11.879> depending<00:03:12.480> on<00:03:12.569> the<00:03:12.659> map<00:03:12.810> type<00:03:13.049> as<00:03:13.980> you

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:14.159 
turn on depending on the map type as you

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.710 
turn on depending on the map type as you
can<00:03:14.280> tell<00:03:14.430> there<00:03:14.579> a<00:03:14.609> certain<00:03:14.819> maps<00:03:15.150> such<00:03:15.540> as

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
can tell there a certain maps such as

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.270 
can tell there a certain maps such as
jungle<00:03:16.970> firing<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.120> range<00:03:18.799> that's<00:03:19.799> that's

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
jungle firing your range that's that's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
jungle firing your range that's that's
about<00:03:20.790> it<00:03:20.819> grid<00:03:21.629> is<00:03:21.810> actually<00:03:22.109> pretty<00:03:22.319> good

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
about it grid is actually pretty good

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.210 
about it grid is actually pretty good
for<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.889> as<00:03:23.010> well<00:03:23.810> where<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.049> alternate<00:03:25.949> from

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
for it as well where I alternate from

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.759 
for it as well where I alternate from
dogs<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.819> then<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.090> put<00:03:27.299> on<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:27.540> gunship<00:03:27.989> so

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
dogs and then I put on the gunship so

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.020 
dogs and then I put on the gunship so
this<00:03:28.919> should<00:03:29.099> be<00:03:29.129> the<00:03:29.310> first<00:03:29.459> game<00:03:29.760> where<00:03:29.970> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
this should be the first game where you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.520 
this should be the first game where you
see<00:03:30.180> me<00:03:30.299> to<00:03:30.389> use<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.629> gunship<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.229> reason

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
see me to use the gunship and the reason

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.280 
see me to use the gunship and the reason
for<00:03:31.769> being<00:03:32.329> the<00:03:33.329> plus<00:03:33.569> side<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.959> having<00:03:34.199> a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
for being the plus side of having a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.020 
for being the plus side of having a
gunship<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:34.919> map<00:03:35.129> even<00:03:35.280> more<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:35.849> is

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
gunship on this map even more so is

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.580 
gunship on this map even more so is
because<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.449> get<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:36.989> some<00:03:37.019> damn<00:03:37.409> good

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
because you get you know some damn good

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.890 
because you get you know some damn good
sexiness<00:03:38.190> kills<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.329> that's<00:03:39.479> always<00:03:39.629> a<00:03:39.750> good

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
sexiness kills so that's always a good

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.449 
sexiness kills so that's always a good
plus<00:03:40.229> because<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.590> chopper<00:03:40.919> gunner<00:03:41.159> on<00:03:41.190> this

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
plus because the chopper gunner on this

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.219 
plus because the chopper gunner on this
map<00:03:41.669> anybody<00:03:42.060> can<00:03:42.239> agree<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.690> false<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.169> you

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
map anybody can agree is false so you

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:45.080 
map anybody can agree is false so you
can<00:03:43.379> get<00:03:43.500> 30<00:03:43.709> 40<00:03:44.340> kills<00:03:44.549> from<00:03:44.669> a<00:03:44.790> chopper

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
can get 30 40 kills from a chopper

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.969 
can get 30 40 kills from a chopper
gunner<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.359> this<00:03:45.540> map<00:03:45.750> or<00:03:45.989> jungle<00:03:46.199> etc<00:03:46.709> cetera

not you know get a gunship just like
this<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:51.000> then<00:03:51.780> run<00:03:51.930> into<00:03:52.139> back<00:03:52.290> again

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
this and then run into back again

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:56.020 
this and then run into back again
correct<00:03:53.449> sounds<00:03:54.449> smart<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:55.109> can<00:03:55.229> control<00:03:55.560> it

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
correct sounds smart you can control it

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.610 
correct sounds smart you can control it
it's<00:03:57.030> good<00:03:57.180> shit<00:03:57.419> it's<00:03:57.870> good<00:03:58.019> shit<00:03:58.199> so<00:03:58.500> the

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
it's good shit it's good shit so the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.500 
it's good shit it's good shit so the
great<00:03:58.799> combo<00:03:59.099> to<00:03:59.159> put<00:03:59.340> together<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.849> one<00:04:00.419> of

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
great combo to put together and one of

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.030 
great combo to put together and one of
the<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.930> bonuses<00:04:01.290> that<00:04:01.349> people<00:04:01.680> tend<00:04:01.859> to

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
the the bonuses that people tend to

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.719 
the the bonuses that people tend to
neglect<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:03.030> why<00:04:03.479> you<00:04:03.540> are<00:04:03.720> in<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:04.139> gunner<00:04:04.729> you

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
neglect is why you are in a gunner you

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.789 
neglect is why you are in a gunner you
were<00:04:05.879> genuinely<00:04:06.120> safe<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.229> I<00:04:07.500> know<00:04:07.620> this

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
were genuinely safe and I know this

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.960 
were genuinely safe and I know this
probably<00:04:07.949> might<00:04:08.280> not<00:04:08.370> be<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.579> best<00:04:08.760> gameplay

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
probably might not be the best gameplay

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.119 
probably might not be the best gameplay
for<00:04:09.299> it<00:04:09.359> because<00:04:09.449> I<00:04:09.540> think<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> died<00:04:09.930> twice<00:04:10.259> well

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129

or<00:04:31.710> something<00:04:31.860> where<00:04:32.190> you're<00:04:32.340> in<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.550> gunship

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
or something where you're in a gunship

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.220 
or something where you're in a gunship
in<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.210> gunner<00:04:33.420> if<00:04:33.600> you<00:04:33.660> combine<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:33.960> time

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
in a gunner if you combine that time

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.690 
in a gunner if you combine that time
together<00:04:34.410> it's<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.710> minute<00:04:34.920> and<00:04:35.010> a<00:04:35.070> half<00:04:35.100> where

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
together it's a minute and a half where

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.640 
together it's a minute and a half where
you're<00:04:36.120> getting<00:04:36.360> stacking<00:04:36.960> up<00:04:37.080> kills<00:04:37.350> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
you're getting stacking up kills and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.050 
you're getting stacking up kills and
you're<00:04:37.770> basically<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.130> vulnerable<00:04:38.490> if<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.730> you

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
you're basically a vulnerable if you you

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.640 
you're basically a vulnerable if you you
pick<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> right<00:04:39.510> spot<00:04:39.810> to<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.050> know<00:04:40.170> cozy<00:04:40.530> up

they<00:05:54.570> often<00:05:55.050> you<00:05:55.470> know<00:05:55.590> they<00:05:55.740> jump<00:05:55.950> over<00:05:56.160> the

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
they often you know they jump over the

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.920 
they often you know they jump over the
gates<00:05:56.490> most<00:05:56.970> of<00:05:57.090> the<00:05:57.150> spawns<00:05:57.390> back<00:05:57.630> they<00:05:57.780> wear

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
gates most of the spawns back they wear

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.840 
gates most of the spawns back they wear
their<00:05:57.960> spawn<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.470> they<00:05:58.530> come<00:05:58.740> from<00:05:58.980> the<00:05:59.280> other

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
their spawn and they come from the other

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.570 
their spawn and they come from the other
spawn<00:06:00.180> on<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.419> backside<00:06:00.840> of<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:01.260> so<00:06:02.190> if<00:06:02.310> you<00:06:02.430> got

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
spawn on the backside of a so if you got

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.220 
spawn on the backside of a so if you got
them<00:06:02.760> locked<00:06:02.910> at<00:06:03.150> a<00:06:03.270> on<00:06:03.419> this<00:06:03.570> map<00:06:03.750> dogs<00:06:04.050> are

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
them locked at a on this map dogs are

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.430 
them locked at a on this map dogs are
just<00:06:04.260> as<00:06:04.590> good<00:06:04.710> as<00:06:04.860> a<00:06:04.890> gunship<00:06:05.510> usually<00:06:06.510> and<00:06:06.720> it

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
just as good as a gunship usually and it

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.530 
just as good as a gunship usually and it
also<00:06:07.620> covers<00:06:07.980> you<00:06:08.250> if<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.430> have<00:06:08.520> your<00:06:08.640> gun<00:06:09.390> out

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
also covers you if you have your gun out

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.290 
also covers you if you have your gun out
as<00:06:09.750> well<00:06:09.900> so<00:06:10.410> it's<00:06:11.400> just<00:06:11.580> my<00:06:11.700> little<00:06:11.820> tip<00:06:12.120> for

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
as well so it's just my little tip for

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.030 
as well so it's just my little tip for
you<00:06:12.390> guys<00:06:12.600> that<00:06:12.630> you<00:06:13.169> know<00:06:13.200> typically<00:06:13.620> run<00:06:13.890> it

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
you guys that you know typically run it

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.590 
you guys that you know typically run it
you<00:06:14.190> know<00:06:14.310> on<00:06:14.430> a<00:06:14.520> map<00:06:14.700> like<00:06:14.910> summit<00:06:15.360> where<00:06:15.510> you

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
you know on a map like summit where you

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.970 
you know on a map like summit where you
don't<00:06:15.720> get<00:06:15.900> too<00:06:16.020> many<00:06:16.050> chopper<00:06:16.530> gunner<00:06:16.740> kills

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
don't get too many chopper gunner kills

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.730 
don't get too many chopper gunner kills
there's<00:06:17.190> no<00:06:17.280> point<00:06:17.520> in<00:06:17.610> having<00:06:17.700> gunship<00:06:18.210> on

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
there's no point in having gunship on

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.470 
there's no point in having gunship on
dogs<00:06:19.740> even<00:06:20.400> more<00:06:20.580> so<00:06:20.850> it's<00:06:21.030> probably<00:06:21.210> not<00:06:21.450> the

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
dogs even more so it's probably not the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.970 
dogs even more so it's probably not the
best<00:06:21.570> thing<00:06:21.810> to<00:06:21.930> do<00:06:22.140> so<00:06:22.320> usually<00:06:22.620> when<00:06:22.710> i<00:06:22.770> run

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
best thing to do so usually when i run

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:24.590 
best thing to do so usually when i run
on<00:06:23.100> summit<00:06:23.490> you<00:06:23.669> know<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.790> put<00:06:24.030> the<00:06:24.090> napalm<00:06:24.450> on

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:24.600 
on summit you know I put the napalm on

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.200 
on summit you know I put the napalm on
I'd<00:06:24.840> take<00:06:25.050> that<00:06:25.230> over<00:06:25.350> the<00:06:25.530> other<00:06:25.650> killstreaks

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 
I'd take that over the other killstreaks

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.360 
I'd take that over the other killstreaks
because<00:06:27.210> somebody<00:06:27.930> is<00:06:27.960> a<00:06:28.020> is<00:06:28.410> a<00:06:28.860> very<00:06:29.160> strong

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
because somebody is a is a very strong

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.130 
because somebody is a is a very strong
map<00:06:29.669> for<00:06:29.940> me<00:06:30.030> it's<00:06:30.510> one<00:06:30.660> of<00:06:30.690> my<00:06:30.810> favorites

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
map for me it's one of my favorites

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.080 
map for me it's one of my favorites
actually<00:06:31.230> is<00:06:31.440> my<00:06:31.530> favorite<00:06:31.830> map<00:06:32.010> and<00:06:32.280> I'm<00:06:32.880> very

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 
actually is my favorite map and I'm very

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:34.490 
actually is my favorite map and I'm very
strong<00:06:33.419> on<00:06:33.630> that<00:06:33.660> map<00:06:33.900> when<00:06:34.050> it<00:06:34.140> comes<00:06:34.290> down<00:06:34.440> to

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:34.500 
strong on that map when it comes down to

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.620 
strong on that map when it comes down to
controlling<00:06:35.340> patrolling<00:06:35.910> all<00:06:36.240> that<00:06:36.479> good

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
controlling patrolling all that good

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.320 
controlling patrolling all that good
sexy<00:06:37.020> stuff<00:06:37.229> killing<00:06:37.740> people<00:06:38.150> my<00:06:39.150> killstreaks

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
sexy stuff killing people my killstreaks

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.150 
sexy stuff killing people my killstreaks
generally<00:06:39.960> don't<00:06:40.140> do<00:06:40.260> me<00:06:40.380> justice<00:06:40.710> on<00:06:40.890> them

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
generally don't do me justice on them

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.620 
generally don't do me justice on them
so<00:06:41.430> it's<00:06:41.550> pretty<00:06:41.670> much<00:06:41.880> all<00:06:42.090> me<00:06:42.300> and<00:06:42.510> just

so it's pretty much all me and just

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.140 
so it's pretty much all me and just
running<00:06:42.900> down<00:06:42.930> some<00:06:43.230> skill<00:06:43.850> so<00:06:44.850> what<00:06:44.940> you<00:06:45.030> guys

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
running down some skill so what you guys

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.210 
running down some skill so what you guys
see<00:06:45.360> here<00:06:45.570> is<00:06:45.660> obviously<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.170> the<00:06:46.590> afterbirth

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
see here is obviously the the afterbirth

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.940 
see here is obviously the the afterbirth
of<00:06:47.610> you<00:06:48.180> know<00:06:48.330> holding<00:06:49.170> up<00:06:49.290> these<00:06:49.410> killstreaks

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950 
of you know holding up these killstreaks

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:51.940 
of you know holding up these killstreaks
I<00:06:50.070> think<00:06:50.250> I've<00:06:50.340> got<00:06:50.550> like<00:06:50.790> three<00:06:51.270> or<00:06:51.450> four

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
I think I've got like three or four

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.310 
I think I've got like three or four
helicopters<00:06:52.950> that<00:06:53.460> I'm<00:06:54.290> patrolling<00:06:55.290> with

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
helicopters that I'm patrolling with

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.400 
helicopters that I'm patrolling with
right<00:06:55.710> now<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:56.790> uh<00:06:57.020> you<00:06:58.020> know<00:06:58.140> it's<00:06:58.260> going<00:06:58.350> to

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
right now it uh you know it's going to

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:59.840 
right now it uh you know it's going to
be<00:06:58.470> stacked<00:06:58.830> up<00:06:59.040> so<00:06:59.190> this<00:06:59.310> is<00:06:59.400> pretty<00:06:59.520> much<00:06:59.640> all

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
be stacked up so this is pretty much all

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.340 
be stacked up so this is pretty much all
you're<00:07:00.030> going<00:07:00.120> to<00:07:00.180> see<00:07:00.360> from<00:07:00.630> the<00:07:00.930> rest<00:07:01.110> of<00:07:01.260> me

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350

throughout the rest of the videos meet

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.000 
throughout the rest of the videos meet
in<00:07:03.090> a<00:07:03.270> fucking<00:07:03.630> Gunners<00:07:03.990> of<00:07:04.320> some<00:07:04.620> sort

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
in a fucking Gunners of some sort

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:06.770 
in a fucking Gunners of some sort
because<00:07:05.640> i<00:07:05.850> stacked<00:07:06.240> them<00:07:06.360> up<00:07:06.540> not

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 
because i stacked them up not

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.330 
because i stacked them up not
intentionally<00:07:07.440> it<00:07:07.560> just<00:07:07.800> happened<00:07:08.250> to<00:07:08.280> be

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340 
intentionally it just happened to be

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.100 
intentionally it just happened to be
that<00:07:08.550> way<00:07:08.730> and<00:07:08.970> it<00:07:09.420> just<00:07:09.480> goes<00:07:09.750> to<00:07:09.780> show<00:07:09.990> that

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:10.110 
that way and it just goes to show that

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.440 
that way and it just goes to show that
over<00:07:10.710> half<00:07:11.070> of<00:07:11.250> this<00:07:11.400> map<00:07:11.640> I<00:07:11.880> was<00:07:12.030> pretty<00:07:12.210> much

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
over half of this map I was pretty much

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.200 
over half of this map I was pretty much
in<00:07:12.600> a<00:07:12.660> gunship<00:07:13.050> I<00:07:13.290> was<00:07:14.100> you<00:07:14.490> know<00:07:14.640> not<00:07:14.670> worrying

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.210 
in a gunship I was you know not worrying

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.930 
in a gunship I was you know not worrying
about<00:07:15.270> dying<00:07:15.690> respawning<00:07:16.410> dying<00:07:16.710> and<00:07:17.580> I<00:07:17.760> was

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:17.940 
about dying respawning dying and I was

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.340 
about dying respawning dying and I was
pretty<00:07:18.120> much<00:07:18.270> it's<00:07:18.690> the<00:07:18.780> same<00:07:18.990> thing<00:07:19.020> it's

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
pretty much it's the same thing it's

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.990 
pretty much it's the same thing it's
safe<00:07:19.590> bet<00:07:19.830> so<00:07:20.430> it's<00:07:20.550> always<00:07:20.670> a<00:07:20.790> good<00:07:20.970> thing

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
safe bet so it's always a good thing

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.400 
safe bet so it's always a good thing
when<00:07:21.300> you've<00:07:21.420> got<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:21.570> proper<00:07:21.930> map<00:07:22.140> that<00:07:22.320> you

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:22.410 
when you've got the proper map that you
