00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.250 
sixth lowest base stat total pokemon now
you're<00:00:32.790> thinking<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.329> probably<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:34.079> he's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
you're thinking it probably that he's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
you're thinking it probably that he's
obviously<00:00:34.380> obviously<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> win<00:00:35.820> but

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
obviously obviously going to win but

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.420 
obviously obviously going to win but
we've<00:00:37.140> scaled<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.860> his<00:00:37.950> boat<00:00:38.129> went<00:00:38.370> down

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
we've scaled all of his boat went down

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
we've scaled all of his boat went down
to<00:00:38.730> level<00:00:38.940> 15<00:00:39.300> years<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.660> hopefully<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.890> should

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to level 15 years so hopefully it should

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.530 
to level 15 years so hopefully it should
be<00:00:41.250> pretty<00:00:41.430> balanced<00:00:41.879> we've<00:00:42.120> done<00:00:42.329> some

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
be pretty balanced we've done some

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.900 
be pretty balanced we've done some
calculations<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:43.469> seems<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.760> be

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
calculations it seems like it's gonna be

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.830 
calculations it seems like it's gonna be
quite<00:00:45.239> fair<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:47.370> tried<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> level<00:00:47.940> 40<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.539> it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
quite fair so we tried a level 40 and it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
quite fair so we tried a level 40 and it
didn't<00:00:49.140> go<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.440> great<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:49.920> me<00:00:50.100> yeah<00:00:50.340> we're
