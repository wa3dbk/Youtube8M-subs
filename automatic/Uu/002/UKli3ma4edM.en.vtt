00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.299
 so my people as you see i have in 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.550
 Chicago 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.849
 That's what today is today 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.120
 you just like her, easy and fast 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.119
 You can do a chipcard yourself 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.850
 you do not really need many things 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.550
 The only important thing is that you 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.849
 sekret clock attracts because of which department 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.380
 get so that would listen just right 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:35.309
 outside so what is outside also 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.570
 better so few think so much fun 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 we ask now times with the lead 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.710
 Now pour the mold once 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.710
 check cards trick had the casting mold 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:58.079
 like once has parking size 3 I was allowed 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.579
 Do not forget a bunsenbrenner her 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 can of course also a hotplate 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:08.159
 Take and a vessel where you pour 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.510
 gold is also important that we always 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.600
 while wearing shoes 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.460
 such a bunsenbrenner team made 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.310
 ever the lead in small snacks 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:27.920
 then it melts later 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:31.850
 after that subject ever so pure here 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.150
 in the time where it can schmidt that 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.150
 normally give the hook this shape 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 so jan markus baur up once where 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.250
 The user ranking from the hook then you put 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.250
 that's so pure 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.120
 you have the feeling now you can too 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.900
 Enter a bit of kneading up here 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:08.619
 with it reserves 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:13.090
 and then just put it up 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.460
 the costs on as you want to be sure 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.370
 That's right, once a little bit 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:24.850
 think about it first then come here later 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.650
 up so here's a man came in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.580
 up here 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.580
 the flyer is poured 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:40.049
 Once melted there you have to 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.049
 the security gates are confiscated 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.550
 but you can recognize it well 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.550
 just have to swing back and forth 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.000
 always a bit strong of the plan 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.319
 left but who not so bad 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 after that comes only that risks 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:59.470
 stay 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:13.230
 so a listener gets dressed 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.900
 Be careful about the lead 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.290
 that it is really melted and 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.290
 tip as a boy 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.290
 it's not bad then something upstairs 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.680
 you can cut it off 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.239
 it cools that a bit 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.200
 you can show yourself out now 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.420
 just like cabbage family cool down 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.599
 to let 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.599
 serve up 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.390
 here is the whole 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.910
 then to still fit the fronts 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.210
 still be very hot because what ever 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.210
 Out 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:18.900
 We even came by and what 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:22.330
 does not matter and here you see it some 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.290
 groups and done 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:33.110
 Now in the call of ours 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:39.260
 compensation time just take a time 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.860
 side cutter and pinch this around 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:47.690
 , and already you have your 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:52.850
 Homemade ones look very simple and 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.000
 needs sporty so here is 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.220
 You had the pedagogy you can see that 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.960
 not hard could easily yourself 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.190
 do 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.260
 it also came a very different one 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.640
 make sizes 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:10.760
 put in shape possible sizes 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.419
 that to me as elite cards because I want 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.350
