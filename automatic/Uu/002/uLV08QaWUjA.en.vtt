review<00:00:18.570> first<00:00:19.289> things<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.680> we're<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.220> to

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
review first things first we're going to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
review first things first we're going to
take<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.490> look<00:00:20.789> at<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.300> tag<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:21.990> you<00:00:22.080> see<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
take a look at the tag so you see the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.759 
take a look at the tag so you see the
size<00:00:22.619> large<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.279> retails<00:00:23.789> for<00:00:23.900> $32<00:00:24.900> picked<00:00:25.650> it

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
size large and retails for $32 picked it

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.730 
size large and retails for $32 picked it
up<00:00:25.830> from<00:00:26.070> Nike<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.500> dry

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
up from Nike you can see here it's dry

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.569 
up from Nike you can see here it's dry
fit<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:30.119> got<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.750> compression<00:00:31.679> not<00:00:32.399> the

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
fit and I got the compression not the

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
fit and I got the compression not the
fitted<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.480> competition<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
fitted and it's competition and it's a

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.940 
fitted and it's competition and it's a
base<00:00:34.770> layer<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.320> does<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.649> mean

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
base layer so what does all that mean

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.470 
base layer so what does all that mean
the<00:00:38.340> fact<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> base<00:00:39.000> layer<00:00:39.210> means

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the fact that it's a base layer means

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
the fact that it's a base layer means
you<00:00:39.660> wear<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.899> under<00:00:40.200> your<00:00:40.500> uniform<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.190> said<00:00:42.000> I

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
you wear it under your uniform I said I

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760 
you wear it under your uniform I said I
was<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> compare<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.899> personally<00:00:43.710> at

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
was going to compare it to personally at

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.080 
was going to compare it to personally at
least<00:00:43.920> some<00:00:44.040> differences<00:00:44.489> between<00:00:44.700> something

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
least some differences between something

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.880 
least some differences between something
like<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> Under<00:00:45.570> Armor<00:00:45.750> heat<00:00:45.899> gear<00:00:46.110> so<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
like the Under Armor heat gear so I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
like the Under Armor heat gear so I
tested<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.309> shirt<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.090> most

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
tested this shirt and what I like most

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.470 
tested this shirt and what I like most
about<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.809> shirt<00:00:49.050> was<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.890> long<00:00:50.390> portion<00:00:51.390> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
about the shirt was the long portion of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.209 
about the shirt was the long portion of
it<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:51.989> see<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.649> cut<00:00:52.860> right

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
it so you can see that kind of cut right

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.060 
it so you can see that kind of cut right
here<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.899> that's<00:00:54.899> because<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
here and that's because it's a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.099 
here and that's because it's a
compressive<00:00:56.610> fit<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.059> then<00:00:57.809> under<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
compressive fit and then under that

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
compressive fit and then under that
grade<00:00:58.469> line<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:59.039> actually<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> looser<00:01:00.239> fit<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
grade line it's actually a looser fit so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.790 
grade line it's actually a looser fit so
you<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.170> tuck<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you don't have to tuck it in it's a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.260 
you don't have to tuck it in it's a
little<00:01:02.039> bit<00:01:02.160> longer<00:01:02.370> it's<00:01:02.699> not<00:01:02.879> going<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> ride

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
little bit longer it's not going to ride

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.939 
little bit longer it's not going to ride
up<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.510> your<00:01:03.870> body<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.589> that's<00:01:04.739> something

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
up on your body and that's something

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.370 
up on your body and that's something
that<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.670> liked<00:01:05.880> about<00:01:06.000> Nike<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.260> if

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that I really liked about Nike so if

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.440 
that I really liked about Nike so if
it's<00:01:07.619> just<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> other<00:01:08.490> compression

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
it's just like all the other compression

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's just like all the other compression
shirts<00:01:09.840> from<00:01:09.960> Nike<00:01:10.369> the<00:01:11.369> sleeves<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.060> weight

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
shirts from Nike the sleeves the weight

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.940 
shirts from Nike the sleeves the weight
fit<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> sleet<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.930> wrist<00:01:13.380> were<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> little

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
fit the sleet the wrist were a little

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
fit the sleet the wrist were a little
bit<00:01:14.130> loose<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.580> other<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.210> was

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bit loose but other than that it was

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.700 
bit loose but other than that it was
tight<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.930> wasn't<00:01:16.170> bunching<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
tight but it wasn't bunching and it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.550 
tight but it wasn't bunching and it
wasn't<00:01:16.830> restrictive<00:01:17.990> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.080> take<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> look<00:01:19.439> at

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
wasn't restrictive if you take a look at

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.550 
wasn't restrictive if you take a look at
the<00:01:19.619> collar<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.460> 2.0<00:01:21.560> what's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the collar this is the 2.0 what's

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.870 
the collar this is the 2.0 what's
different<00:01:22.860> about<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:23.700> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
different about it is that has this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
different about it is that has this
little<00:01:24.119> gray<00:01:24.330> tag<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:24.990> pro<00:01:25.110> combat<00:01:25.530> on

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little gray tag so it's pro combat on

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.289 
little gray tag so it's pro combat on
the<00:01:25.860> outside<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.460> well<00:01:26.520> as<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.540> inside<00:01:29.299> now

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the outside as well as the inside now

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.969 
the outside as well as the inside now
the<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.600> thing<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:31.829> about

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the one thing that is different about

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.310 
the one thing that is different about
this<00:01:32.189> than<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.430> heat<00:01:32.670> gear<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.810> not

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
this than the heat gear is this is not

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.429 
this than the heat gear is this is not
for<00:01:34.770> hot<00:01:35.220> weather<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.200> can<00:01:37.350> get

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
for hot weather it's not you can get

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
for hot weather it's not you can get
away<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.829> wearing<00:01:38.009> heat<00:01:38.340> gear<00:01:38.549> long<00:01:38.880> sleeve
