00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.050
 minecraft with singing studies at sem 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.410
 bugs and no legmann thinking to you there 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.390
 with stage this beauty the first step is 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.829
 continue the bug I've already prepared a video 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.610
 on here 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.160
 I do not know if the bug is that the guys are bronze 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.160
 is this little white thing that people 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.680
 this thing our black kitchen that I 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.500
 had this thing is too much can take is only 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 you come here sit here die or 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.780
 wine with your faith 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 here the concept you get this thing that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 O good blood musician are you to explain to us 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 enable option 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.080
 then a new one is going to be removed. 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:13.970
 here in the corner of the screen every month 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.970
 This is the first legging shot between 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 you 'll open minecraft with the 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.790
 open microphone and you will come here with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.439
 right to a task check 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.240
 there was some contact antÃ£o recalls 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.150
 define affinity 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.630
 Then the case I do not know has four 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630
 processors 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.660
 I'm going to leave two then 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.260
 for the contagion there you go there in a 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.260
 I say go now, you come here in the 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.600
 community puts these here were the 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.660
 other two are here to your pc not 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.110
 I have four logical processors you 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:12.220
 put one down for each 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.850
 a logical processor for what you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.860
 does 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 Then you come here in Japan and you go. 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.950
 set ownership you place on the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.240
 close and everything 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.380
 every time a manifesto is opened 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.420
 otherwise you will have to do this 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.510
 beauty procedure again 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.860
 so whenever it was too easy you 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.400
 will play free of lego and I really like 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:45.459
 to record with a ghost in craft 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:49.510
 why to use when apps do not 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.269
 can do it and also it arrived 20 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.190
 very big, so this is what you 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.269
 enjoyed the book like me to stay 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.400
 I did not like it there 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.360
 add the video to your colorful ones 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.400
 This helps a lot and I also write without 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.410
 channel the channel is still small 10 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.459
 thousand enrolled in that moment that is left 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.470
 in the middle 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.470
 so this is it people I went
