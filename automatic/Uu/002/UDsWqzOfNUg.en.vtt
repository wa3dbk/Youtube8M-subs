anyway but it's a high end fat and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.790 
anyway but it's a high end fat and
collagen<00:00:21.630> so<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:21.990> very<00:00:22.080> good<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.470> your<00:00:22.529> hair

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800

and your skin but it is high in fat so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.500 
and your skin but it is high in fat so
it's<00:00:25.710> not<00:00:25.859> necessarily<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.400> thing<00:00:26.550> well

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

happening that way there's my pigskin
I've<00:01:10.740> already<00:01:11.070> cut<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:12.110> cubes<00:01:13.110> I'm

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
I've already cut this up into cubes I'm

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.469 
I've already cut this up into cubes I'm
going<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> strip<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.490> up<00:01:14.640> make<00:01:14.880> strips<00:01:15.210> out<00:01:15.330> of

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
going to strip it up make strips out of

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.580 
going to strip it up make strips out of
it<00:01:15.600> later<00:01:16.369> you'll<00:01:17.369> see<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.479> could<00:01:18.689> go

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
it later you'll see that you could go

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.520 
it later you'll see that you could go
ahead<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:21.270> big<00:01:21.509> pieces<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.200> want

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
ahead and use the big pieces if you want

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
ahead and use the big pieces if you want
to<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.040> figure<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.520> easier<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.970> work<00:01:24.119> with

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
to but I figure it's easier to work with

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
to but I figure it's easier to work with
this<00:01:24.509> we're<00:01:25.380> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> throw<00:01:25.799> this<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.040> here
