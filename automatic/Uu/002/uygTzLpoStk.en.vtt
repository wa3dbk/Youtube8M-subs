you<00:00:22.109> can<00:00:22.289> cut<00:00:22.829> a<00:00:22.859> series<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.310> grooves<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.419> an

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:25.079 
you can cut a series of grooves in an

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.229 
you can cut a series of grooves in an
ordinary<00:00:25.259> piece<00:00:25.679> of<00:00:25.710> wood<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.340> turn<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.029> with

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:27.239 
ordinary piece of wood and turn out with

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:29.420 
ordinary piece of wood and turn out with
a<00:00:27.269> pretty<00:00:28.019> fancy<00:00:28.289> looking<00:00:28.710> trivet<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
a pretty fancy looking trivet and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.909 
a pretty fancy looking trivet and
depending<00:00:30.329> on<00:00:30.419> how<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.660> spaced<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.679> grooves

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
depending on how you spaced the grooves

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:33.890 
depending on how you spaced the grooves
and<00:00:32.160> where<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.430> place<00:00:32.699> them<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.750> make

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
and where you place them you can make

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.229 
and where you place them you can make
different<00:00:34.050> patterns<00:00:34.409> here<00:00:35.220> I've<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.120> an

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
different patterns here I've got just an

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.720 
different patterns here I've got just an
ordinary<00:00:36.480> lattice<00:00:37.019> work<00:00:37.250> over<00:00:38.250> here

ordinary lattice work over here

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.939 
ordinary lattice work over here
I've<00:00:39.329> created<00:00:39.629> something<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.530> looks<00:00:40.769> more

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:40.949 
I've created something that looks more

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.969 
I've created something that looks more
like<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.159> checkerboard<00:00:42.019> but<00:00:43.019> all<00:00:43.170> depends<00:00:43.530> on

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:43.979 
like a checkerboard but all depends on

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:46.460 
like a checkerboard but all depends on
where<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.820> want<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.269> put<00:00:45.449> the<00:00:45.629> grooves<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.290> it

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:46.470

order to place them precisely you've got

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.570 
order to place them precisely you've got
to<00:00:48.570> have<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> jig<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> hold<00:00:49.979> the<00:00:50.159> wood<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.549> you

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580
