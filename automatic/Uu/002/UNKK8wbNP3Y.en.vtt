00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that aren't good for us of course some

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.450 
that aren't good for us of course some
people<00:01:18.870> would<00:01:19.320> say<00:01:19.380> well<00:01:19.620> these<00:01:20.010> things<00:01:20.280> are

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
good for you but my perspective is most

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
good for you but my perspective is most
of<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.549> if<00:01:23.729> you've<00:01:23.850> watched<00:01:24.540> my<00:01:24.690> videos

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
of you know if you've watched my videos

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.590 
of you know if you've watched my videos
before<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.520> these<00:01:27.060> things<00:01:27.299> aren't<00:01:27.510> really

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
before that these things aren't really

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.750 
before that these things aren't really
good<00:01:27.869> for<00:01:27.900> us<00:01:28.110> at<00:01:28.320> all<00:01:28.470> they're<00:01:29.040> harmful<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.610> us

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
good for us at all they're harmful to us

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.060 
good for us at all they're harmful to us
but<00:01:30.330> the<00:01:30.450> body<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:30.840> dreaming<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.740> why<00:01:32.010> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
but the body is dreaming of them why is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.910 
but the body is dreaming of them why is
that<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.729> it's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> great<00:01:33.420> question<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:34.049> I

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that and it's a great question and I

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.520 
that and it's a great question and I
don't<00:01:35.729> really<00:01:35.880> know<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> answer<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.780> believe<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
don't really know the answer I believe I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.740 
don't really know the answer I believe I
mean<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.250> answer<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> just<00:01:38.970> can't<00:01:39.180> prove

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
mean I have an answer I just can't prove

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810 
mean I have an answer I just can't prove
it's<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.290> answer<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.220> think<00:01:41.580> what's

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it's the right answer but I think what's

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.780 
it's the right answer but I think what's
happening<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:43.400> because<00:01:44.400> it's<00:01:44.580> such<00:01:44.760> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
happening is that because it's such a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.310 
happening is that because it's such a
common<00:01:45.090> experience<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.720> imagine<00:01:46.140> what's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
common experience I imagine what's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.250 
common experience I imagine what's
happening<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> body<00:01:47.640> is

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
happening is that as the body is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.910 
happening is that as the body is
detoxifying<00:01:49.909> releasing<00:01:50.909> either<00:01:51.180> actual

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
detoxifying releasing either actual

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.630 
detoxifying releasing either actual
physical<00:01:54.470> material<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.130> stuff<00:01:56.400> or

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
physical material from this stuff or

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.429 
physical material from this stuff or
energy<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.720> these<00:01:58.619> substances<00:02:00.140> they're<00:02:01.140> back

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
on is that

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.589 
on is that
