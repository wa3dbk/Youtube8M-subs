now<00:01:44.340> personally<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.149> mind<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.720> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
now personally I don't mind it and I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.510 
now personally I don't mind it and I
don't<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.649> side<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.159> would<00:01:47.369> normally

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
don't need that side I would normally

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.730 
don't need that side I would normally
just<00:01:47.729> carry<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.450> side<00:01:48.720> tape<00:01:49.020> off<00:01:49.200> carry<00:01:49.470> and

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
just carry right side tape off carry and

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.170 
just carry right side tape off carry and
that's<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> things<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> wanted

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
that's one of the things that I wanted

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
that's one of the things that I wanted
to<00:01:51.240> talk<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.450> too<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.799> originally<00:01:53.220> came

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
to talk about too it originally came

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
to talk about too it originally came
with<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.610> pocket<00:01:53.970> clip<00:01:54.119> for<00:01:54.390> tip<00:01:54.659> down<00:01:54.930> carry

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
with the pocket clip for tip down carry

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.200 
with the pocket clip for tip down carry
obviously<00:01:56.189> switched<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.579> over<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> tip<00:01:57.060> up

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
obviously switched it over to tip up

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.340 
obviously switched it over to tip up
carry<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.740> notice<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:01.170> one

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
carry and what I notice is the the one

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.350 
carry and what I notice is the the one
the<00:02:01.560> holes<00:02:01.829> are<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.130> lot<00:02:02.310> higher<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.149> tip

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
the holes are a lot higher on the tip

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.420 
the holes are a lot higher on the tip
down<00:02:03.509> carry<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.259> see<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> lot<00:02:04.890> less<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
down carry so you see a lot less of the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.969 
down carry so you see a lot less of the
knife<00:02:05.640> even<00:02:05.909> though<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> pretty<00:02:06.979> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
knife even though this is a pretty you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.949 
knife even though this is a pretty you
know<00:02:08.039> deep<00:02:08.310> ride<00:02:08.849> pocket<00:02:09.330> clip<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:09.750> when<00:02:09.869> you

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
know deep ride pocket clip so when you

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.240 
know deep ride pocket clip so when you
do<00:02:10.110> switch<00:02:10.319> it<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.590> this<00:02:10.709> side<00:02:10.920> you'll<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
do switch it to this side you'll see a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.410 
do switch it to this side you'll see a
little<00:02:11.489> bit<00:02:11.610> more<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.940> handle<00:02:12.270> sticking

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
little bit more of the handle sticking

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.290 
little bit more of the handle sticking
up

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300

good with authority then the other

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.400 
good with authority then the other
option<00:02:42.610> is<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.790> do<00:02:43.060> have<00:02:43.210> the<00:02:43.420> thumb<00:02:44.110> studs

option is you do have the thumb studs

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.350

here<00:02:44.740> dual<00:02:45.160> thumb<00:02:45.430> studs<00:02:45.490> so<00:02:45.820> you<00:02:45.910> can<00:02:46.030> open<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
here dual thumb studs so you can open it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.600 
here dual thumb studs so you can open it
that<00:02:46.480> way<00:02:46.690> also<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.320> do<00:02:47.920> like<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> fact<00:02:48.520> that

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
that way also I do like the fact that

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.090 
that way also I do like the fact that
they<00:02:48.790> left<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.270> lock<00:02:49.630> bar<00:02:49.960> kind<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.860> sticking

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
they left the lock bar kind of sticking

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.250 
they left the lock bar kind of sticking
out<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.550> bit<00:02:51.730> more<00:02:51.970> from<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.420> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
out a little bit more from the the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.740 
out a little bit more from the the
handle<00:02:53.830> itself<00:02:54.130> because<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.090> allows<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
handle itself because that allows you to

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.350 
handle itself because that allows you to
disengage<00:02:56.740> the<00:02:56.950> blade<00:02:57.160> very<00:02:57.430> easily<00:02:57.640> and<00:02:58.090> then

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
disengage the blade very easily and then

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.330 
disengage the blade very easily and then
just<00:02:58.570> close<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.930> there<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.530> guys<00:02:59.740> you<00:03:00.160> guys

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
just close it there so you guys you guys

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.070 
just close it there so you guys you guys
can<00:03:00.520> see<00:03:00.670> there<00:03:00.880> I<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.540> do<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.750> pretty<00:03:01.870> much

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
can see there I can do it pretty much

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.770 
can see there I can do it pretty much
