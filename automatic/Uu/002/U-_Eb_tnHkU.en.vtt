00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.729 
this is our Dragon Ball Z Dragon Ball
controller<00:00:49.880> and<00:00:50.210> we<00:00:51.050> took<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.230> picture<00:00:51.470> of<00:00:51.560> this

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
controller and we took a picture of this

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.710 
controller and we took a picture of this
and<00:00:51.800> actually<00:00:52.310> uploaded<00:00:53.120> it<00:00:53.210> to<00:00:53.239> our<00:00:53.450> Facebook

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
and actually uploaded it to our Facebook

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.229 
and actually uploaded it to our Facebook
page<00:00:54.110> when<00:00:54.380> we<00:00:54.410> first<00:00:54.829> started<00:00:55.250> painting<00:00:55.520> you

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
page when we first started painting you

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.190

know<00:00:56.329> first<00:00:56.570> started<00:00:56.840> building<00:00:56.989> this

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
know first started building this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.630 
know first started building this
controller<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:57.710> I<00:00:57.770> think<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.130> got<00:00:58.220> like<00:00:58.340> 500

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
controller and I think it's got like 500

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.340 
controller and I think it's got like 500
locks<00:00:59.180> just<00:00:59.480> within<00:00:59.809> you<00:00:59.960> know<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:00.170> first

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.269 
else can do long as you can just see
what<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:30.259> controller<00:01:30.649> just<00:01:30.920> starting<00:01:31.159> out

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:31.279 
what this controller just starting out

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:32.679 
what this controller just starting out
is<00:01:31.399> they're<00:01:31.579> clear<00:01:31.850> you<00:01:32.090> know<00:01:32.179> you<00:01:32.270> can<00:01:32.509> see<00:01:32.659> it

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
is they're clear you know you can see it

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.949 
is they're clear you know you can see it
reflecting<00:01:34.359> throughout<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:35.450> controller<00:01:35.810> on

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
reflecting throughout the controller on

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:38.649 
reflecting throughout the controller on
the<00:01:36.109> left<00:01:36.499> right<00:01:36.740> hand<00:01:37.009> top<00:01:37.939> bottom<00:01:38.389> you<00:01:38.569> know

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
the left right hand top bottom you know

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.849 
the left right hand top bottom you know
just<00:01:38.869> all<00:01:39.049> through<00:01:39.229> this<00:01:39.380> controller<00:01:39.709> it's

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
just all through this controller it's

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.399 
just all through this controller it's
very<00:01:40.099> reflective<00:01:40.310> but<00:01:41.149> that<00:01:41.389> is<00:01:41.599> not<00:01:41.990> just<00:01:42.319> a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
very reflective but that is not just a

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.929 
very reflective but that is not just a
key<00:01:42.649> feature<00:01:42.889> that<00:01:43.039> separates<00:01:43.700> this

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
key feature that separates this

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.819 
key feature that separates this
controller<00:01:44.329> from<00:01:44.479> any<00:01:44.719> others<00:01:44.990> it's

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
controller from any others it's

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.199 
controller from any others it's
something<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.249> we've<00:01:46.399> never<00:01:46.549> done<00:01:46.700> and

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:47.209 
something that we've never done and

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:48.179 
something that we've never done and
never<00:01:47.509> seen<00:01:47.749> online

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
never seen online

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.279

that we've just had to add and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.839 
that we've just had to add and
incorporate<00:03:58.410> on<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.650> controller<00:03:59.010> just<00:03:59.699> to

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
incorporate on this controller just to

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.479 
incorporate on this controller just to
sort<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> tie<00:04:00.299> in<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.629> black<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.370> you<00:04:02.370> know

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
sort of tie in the black and you know

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.309 
sort of tie in the black and you know
with<00:04:02.639> the<00:04:02.760> front<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.269> controller<00:04:03.720> as<00:04:03.989> it

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
with the front of the controller as it

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.619 
with the front of the controller as it
is<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:04.709> know<00:04:04.799> it<00:04:04.919> looks<00:04:05.099> perfect<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.940> think<00:04:06.449> the

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
is you know it looks perfect I think the

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.110 
is you know it looks perfect I think the
the<00:04:07.409> customer<00:04:07.709> actually<00:04:07.889> requested<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:08.909> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the customer actually requested that the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.509 
the customer actually requested that the
orange<00:04:09.449> is<00:04:09.599> the<00:04:09.750> exact<00:04:10.199> orange<00:04:10.889> from<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.250> Z

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
orange is the exact orange from the Z

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.970 
orange is the exact orange from the Z
fighter<00:04:11.879> uniform<00:04:12.419> so<00:04:13.290> we<00:04:13.409> left<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.739> front

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
fighter uniform so we left the front

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.530 
fighter uniform so we left the front
just<00:04:14.129> like<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.519> but<00:04:14.760> on<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:15.000> back<00:04:15.209> you<00:04:15.419> know

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
just like that but on the back you know

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.659 
just like that but on the back you know
we<00:04:15.659> sort<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:15.900> got<00:04:15.989> to<00:04:16.109> have<00:04:16.260> fun<00:04:16.500> with<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.739> we

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
we sort of got to have fun with it we

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.180 
we sort of got to have fun with it we
put<00:04:17.909> this<00:04:18.060> black<00:04:18.449> on<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.959> very<00:04:19.199> bottom<00:04:19.409> up

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
put this black on the very bottom up

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.520 
put this black on the very bottom up
into<00:04:20.430> like<00:04:20.639> this<00:04:20.789> metallic<00:04:21.510> flake<00:04:21.870> orange<00:04:22.380> and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.710 
into like this metallic flake orange and
then<00:04:22.919> just<00:04:23.190> back<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.550> into<00:04:23.760> the<00:04:24.030> solid<00:04:24.300> orange

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
then just back up into the solid orange

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.719 
then just back up into the solid orange
just<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.409> the<00:04:25.620> front<00:04:25.830> so<00:04:26.070> it's<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.370> try
