00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
we are back at our favourites of our

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.030 
we are back at our favourites of our
hunting<00:00:12.000> ground<00:00:12.300> wall<00:00:12.929> just<00:00:13.320> sort<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.679> found

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
hunting ground wall just sort of found

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.880 
hunting ground wall just sort of found
all<00:00:14.370> these<00:00:14.580> spin<00:00:14.880> ELLs<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.540> far<00:00:15.780> and<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.740> now

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
all these spin ELLs so far and so now

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099 
all these spin ELLs so far and so now
he's<00:00:17.039> putting<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> wash<00:00:17.660> into<00:00:18.660> our<00:00:18.930> little

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
he's putting a wash into our little

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.640 
he's putting a wash into our little
sieve<00:00:20.090> because<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:21.930> black<00:00:22.289> that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
sieve because it was just black that

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.880 
sieve because it was just black that
corner<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.369> black<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.119> screen<00:00:24.539> else

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
corner is just black with screen else

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.970 
corner is just black with screen else
and<00:00:26.180> then<00:00:27.180> by<00:00:27.359> splashing<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.410> banks<00:00:28.800> with

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and then by splashing the banks with

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.130 
and then by splashing the banks with
water<00:00:29.220> that's<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.760> see<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.689> sapphires

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
water that's how you see the sapphires

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.020 
water that's how you see the sapphires
or<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.710> indicators<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> which<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
or the indicators this which is the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.319 
or the indicators this which is the
spinel<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.870> or<00:00:34.559> little<00:00:35.040> black<00:00:35.190> jacks<00:00:35.670> for

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
spinel really or little black jacks for

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.729 
spinel really or little black jacks for
those<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:36.899> doesn't<00:00:37.230> know<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.410> speed

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
those of you doesn't know what speed

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.979 
those of you doesn't know what speed
Elza<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.700> hang<00:00:39.000> around<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.570> soft<00:00:39.809> bar

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
Elza they hang around with the soft bar

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.319 
Elza they hang around with the soft bar
and<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:40.890> he's<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.640> fill<00:00:41.850> up<00:00:41.940> your<00:00:41.969> sieve

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
and now he's gonna fill up your sieve

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.450 
and now he's gonna fill up your sieve
and<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:43.290> show<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> save<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.280> properly

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.270 

so<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> just<00:00:50.730> spin<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.270> sieve<00:00:51.480> around<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:53.100> get

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so you just spin to sieve around to get

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
so you just spin to sieve around to get
rid<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.420> shake<00:00:54.719> off<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> mud<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.620> also<00:00:56.809> you

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
rid of or shake off the mud and also you

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.580 
rid of or shake off the mud and also you
have<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.109> rid<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> clay<00:00:58.820> basically<00:01:00.590> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have to get rid of the clay basically it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.349 
have to get rid of the clay basically it
all<00:01:01.739> really<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.190> wash<00:01:02.489> that's<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:03.149> take<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
all really all wash that's really take a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.660 
all really all wash that's really take a
post<00:01:03.690> play<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.040> got<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> quarter<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.580> an

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
post play so you got a quarter of an

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
post play so you got a quarter of an
inch<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.479> eighth<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.930> inch

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
inch and an eighth of an inch

the top just engage this quarter inch

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.190 
the top just engage this quarter inch
our<00:01:18.020> sapphires<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.330> also<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> spin<00:01:21.689> Li<00:01:21.840> keep

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
our sapphires and also the spin Li keep

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
our sapphires and also the spin Li keep
the<00:01:22.320> spinner<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.770> well<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.400> they're

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the spinner as well because they're

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.820 
the spinner as well because they're
still<00:01:23.850> worth<00:01:24.170> something<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.799> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
have some more another sapphire look

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.000 
have some more another sapphire look
tooth

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.260 

three<00:01:46.159> one<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.280> us<00:01:47.400> appeal<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> other<00:01:48.119> one

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
three one of us appeal the other one

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050 
three one of us appeal the other one
okay<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:49.229> can't<00:01:49.860> see<00:01:49.979> having<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.369> my<00:01:50.490> glasses<00:01:50.729> on

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
okay I can't see having up my glasses on

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.359 
okay I can't see having up my glasses on
so<00:01:51.690> anyway<00:01:51.990> there's<00:01:52.200> two<00:01:52.380> subparts<00:01:52.830> actually

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
so anyway there's two subparts actually

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.960 
so anyway there's two subparts actually
and<00:01:53.549> one<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.509> spinel<00:01:54.900> so<00:01:55.110> that's<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.970> Sega

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
and one is a spinel so that's a Sega

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.320 
and one is a spinel so that's a Sega
sapphire<00:01:57.450> sapphire<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.649> those<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.640> then

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
sapphire sapphire to those two and then

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.130 
sapphire sapphire to those two and then
this<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> spinel<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.600> but<00:02:03.600> there

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this one is a spinel I think but there

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.960 
this one is a spinel I think but there
should<00:02:04.320> be<00:02:04.470> more<00:02:05.720> on<00:02:06.720> that

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
should be more on that

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
should be more on that
oops<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> junket<00:02:10.229> so<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.530> bit

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
oops you get a junket so it's a bit

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.960 
oops you get a junket so it's a bit
muddy<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.410> we<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.160> find<00:02:14.370> an<00:02:14.520> area<00:02:14.730> where

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
muddy and we have to find an area where

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.229 
muddy and we have to find an area where
it's<00:02:15.239> black<00:02:15.750> if<00:02:16.410> there<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:21.030> our<00:02:21.209> two

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
it's black if there is so with our two

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.140 
it's black if there is so with our two
sapphires<00:02:22.370> there's<00:02:23.370> actually<00:02:23.850> see<00:02:24.030> that

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
sapphires there's actually see that

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.040 
sapphires there's actually see that
zircon<00:02:24.690> there<00:02:25.730> nice<00:02:26.730> big<00:02:27.090> red<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.530> another

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
zircon there nice big red and another

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.190 
zircon there nice big red and another
red<00:02:31.050> one<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:33.799> small<00:02:34.799> sapphire<00:02:35.660> or<00:02:36.660> spinel

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
red one and a small sapphire or spinel

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.440 
red one and a small sapphire or spinel
that's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.590> spinel<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:39.620> another<00:02:40.620> zircon<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
that's a spinel and another zircon so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.910 
that's a spinel and another zircon so
