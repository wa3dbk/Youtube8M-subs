00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
where Jenna stabs herself we only did

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.939 
where Jenna stabs herself we only did
two<00:00:58.260> takes<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> first<00:00:59.190> one<00:01:00.140> he<00:01:01.140> rigs<00:01:01.739> up

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
two takes and the first one he rigs up

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the tube inside my dress so that the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.479 
the tube inside my dress so that the
blood<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.530> start<00:01:04.799> spreading<00:01:05.189> out<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> my

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
blood would start spreading out of my

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.440 
blood would start spreading out of my
stomach<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:07.140> was<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> lake

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
stomach and it was like a lake

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.399 
stomach and it was like a lake
it<00:01:09.840> was<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.229> had<00:01:10.260> literally<00:01:10.799> cut<00:01:11.250> my

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
it was like I had literally cut my

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.560 
it was like I had literally cut my
entire<00:01:13.409> insides<00:01:13.979> were<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.670> seeping<00:01:15.420> out

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
entire insides were like seeping out

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.560 
entire insides were like seeping out
through<00:01:15.840> my<00:01:15.869> dress<00:01:16.430> so<00:01:17.430> then<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.700> had<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> kind

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
through my dress so then we had to kind

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560 
through my dress so then we had to kind
of<00:01:18.630> revamp<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.530> rework<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.570> there's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
of revamp that and rework it and there's

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
of revamp that and rework it and there's
a<00:01:21.630> science<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.680> someone<00:01:22.890> was

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
a science to it because someone was

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.429 
a science to it because someone was
flying<00:01:23.490> behind<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> counter<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> using<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
flying behind the counter and using a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
flying behind the counter and using a
hand<00:01:25.710> pump<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.250> pump<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> blood<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.080> have

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hand pump to pump the blood and you have

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.050 
hand pump to pump the blood and you have
to<00:01:28.380> fall<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> certain<00:01:29.130> way<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> all

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
to fall a certain way so that it all

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.819 
to fall a certain way so that it all
doesn't<00:01:30.299> suddenly<00:01:30.659> gush<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> a

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
doesn't suddenly gush out all of a

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.609 
doesn't suddenly gush out all of a
sudden<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.200> funny<00:01:34.380> what<00:01:34.590> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
sudden and it's just funny what a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.850 
sudden and it's just funny what a
science<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.340> -<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.210> blood<00:01:36.390> work<00:01:36.799> see<00:01:37.799> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
science there is - the blood work see I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.800
