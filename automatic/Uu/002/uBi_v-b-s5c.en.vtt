00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.419
 how about youtube I come to teach you 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:10.260
 my new police car that I just 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:10.260
 make lego 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:18.120
 well this car is like 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:22.200
 is made for what are five figures 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.190
 a driver and four crew in the 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.190
 back of the vehicle 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.390
 this is the front of 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:38.210
 my car is like a truck 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.770
 police a transport 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.770
 that's the front 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.250
 the side the teacher part and the other 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.440
 side 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.590
 and good here I show you the part of 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.590
 down 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.140
 I did this vehicle based on the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.550
 patrols 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.850
 in the london police 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.130
 I feel that if it seems only 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.399
 missing as 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.799
 some details in the lower part that 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.230
 they are changing these pieces by color 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.470
 White 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.380
 and well he already appeared either for 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.820
 look completely like the vehicles of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.820
 london is the roof of this vehicle 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.979
 can be removed 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.860
 so here the driver is taken out there has 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.460
 your seat as you can see 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.920
 and for now this car just now 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.259
 It has two figures but 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.440
 can have until 4 and right now 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.390
 I teach 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.390
 completely the interior of this car 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.640
 not to do it 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 complicated to give our things but 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.220
 high 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.220
 and this one 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.400
 to see if you can see it well 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.020
 those red pieces are like the seats 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.920
 for the police the space there is 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.800
 accurate for four figures and can 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.610
 also wear helmets some weapons or 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.450
 accessories in there has 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.590
 still a small extra space at 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.069
 close the doors 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.400
 as can be seen 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:56.319
 Well this I do not know what you think 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.189
 this vehicle if you want to see what and in what 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.709
 what vehicle 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:05.129
 I'm just based write to 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.129
 100 google or on flickr this one 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.770
 you came bodies fan or so and so will you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.720
 Appear 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.000
 Well, I want you to tell me how 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:23.460
 it looks like you 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.640
 the vehicle look at us a lot in this here 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.320
 the way has had another idea to put 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.780
 only pieces one by one 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.680
 transparent blue but I saw that it looked 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.680
 better with this one 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.690
 since the vehicle that I tell you has 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.410
 equal the window in this part of the gib 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.420
 in this part of the car 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.570
 I'm seeing that this vehicle also 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.040
 I can change it if I wanted to make another 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.550
 could be with a transport of 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.390
 prisoners 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.920
 a canine unit like the laymen here 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.870
 every year 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.870
 I worked hard on the engine 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.950
 if you can see it 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.079
 this when I did this part I feel 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:23.040
 that I 'm not so bad and although the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:26.170
 pieces here are black I feel that it 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.820
 that looks good 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.740
 since it gives as a kind of touch 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.350
 that this part is armored or something 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:40.240
 seemed like this is the defense engine 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:42.460
 and here they have the two back doors 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.500
 He taught them the vehicle comparison 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.500
 a figure to see 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.150
 How big is it 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.960
 and well, this would be all 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:01.010
 thanks for watching the video I hope you 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.660
 I'll like my police car even though I know 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.409
 that he still lacks the details of 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.499
 the pieces change them to white color 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:12.739
 It's not bad at all and the colors that you 

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:15.349
 I put here are those who carry the 

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:17.550
 answer here next are those that 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:21.390
 they carry the patrols of 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.490
 the united kingdom- as a good badge 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:26.730
 again thanks for watching the video if 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:30.660
 they liked to comment subscribe and say what 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.780
 I thought I could change him and 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.910
 I leave you my flicker in the description 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.580
 to see the images of others 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.229
 things that I upload 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.229
 good greetings and until next time
