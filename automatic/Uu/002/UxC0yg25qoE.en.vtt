that's kind of how I look at it so
that's<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.740> really<00:03:19.860> really<00:03:20.400> important<00:03:21.270> tip

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
that's a really really important tip

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.750 
that's a really really important tip
that<00:03:21.870> I've<00:03:21.960> always<00:03:22.320> always<00:03:22.590> follow<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.730> then

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
that I've always always follow and then

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.570 
that I've always always follow and then
the<00:03:24.360> other<00:03:24.660> tip<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.500> always<00:03:25.920> try<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.340> do

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
the other tip that I always try and do

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.340 
the other tip that I always try and do
is<00:03:26.820> before<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.450> start<00:03:27.690> painting<00:03:28.050> your<00:03:28.140> nails

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
is before you start painting your nails

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.130 
is before you start painting your nails
eat<00:03:29.070> some<00:03:29.280> nail<00:03:29.430> polish<00:03:29.640> remover<00:03:30.050> remover<00:03:31.050> on

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
eat some nail polish remover remover on

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.900 
eat some nail polish remover remover on
them<00:03:31.320> because<00:03:31.680> you're<00:03:31.950> kind<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.370> drawing<00:03:32.640> out

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
them because you're kind of drawing out

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.160 
them because you're kind of drawing out
then<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.270> little<00:03:33.600> bit<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:33.900> you're<00:03:34.050> also

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
then a little bit but you're also

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.400 
then a little bit but you're also
removing<00:03:34.830> any<00:03:35.100> oil<00:03:35.490> cream<00:03:36.390> or<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.260> know<00:03:37.350> if

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
removing any oil cream or you know if

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.380 
removing any oil cream or you know if
you<00:03:37.500> put<00:03:37.650> any<00:03:37.830> cuticle<00:03:38.370> oil<00:03:38.760> or<00:03:39.030> anything<00:03:39.240> like

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you put any cuticle oil or anything like

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.410 
you put any cuticle oil or anything like
that<00:03:39.510> one<00:03:39.900> by<00:03:40.830> removing<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.610> what<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.270> are

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
that one by removing it what you are

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.420 
that one by removing it what you are
what<00:03:42.720> your<00:03:42.900> actual<00:03:43.070> what's<00:03:44.070> wrong<00:03:44.190> with<00:03:44.340> me

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
what your actual what's wrong with me

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.940 
what your actual what's wrong with me
what<00:03:44.970> you're<00:03:45.120> actually<00:03:45.270> doing<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.590> get

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
what you're actually doing is just get

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.100 
what you're actually doing is just get
giving<00:03:47.400> kind<00:03:47.550> of<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:48.090> bare<00:03:48.330> canvas<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
giving kind of a really bare canvas and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.660 
giving kind of a really bare canvas and
I<00:03:49.230> think<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.770> nails<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:50.070> little<00:03:50.250> bit<00:03:50.370> driver

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
I think the nails a little bit driver

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.790 
I think the nails a little bit driver
and<00:03:51.060> we<00:03:51.300> thinking<00:03:51.660> kind<00:03:51.840> of<00:03:51.900> stick<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.410> edit

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
and we thinking kind of stick to edit

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.590 
and we thinking kind of stick to edit
and<00:03:52.980> adhere<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.640> better<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.210> it<00:03:54.420> just

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
and adhere to it better and it just

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.750 
and adhere to it better and it just
works<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.020> much<00:03:55.170> nicer<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.220> just<00:03:56.400> prevents

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
works so much nicer and it just prevents

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.820 
works so much nicer and it just prevents
kind<00:03:57.090> of<00:03:57.180> tip<00:03:57.450> where<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.050> everything<00:03:58.470> of

that's not to say that kind of
other<00:04:14.129> formulas<00:04:14.610> don't<00:04:14.910> there<00:04:15.150> are<00:04:15.180> a<00:04:15.239> lot<00:04:15.360> of

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
other formulas don't there are a lot of

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.000

nail<00:04:17.160> polishes<00:04:17.549> i<00:04:17.609> think<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:17.880> pretty<00:04:17.970> good<00:04:18.239> so

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079

nail polishes i think is pretty good so
that's<00:04:19.440> um<00:04:19.950> something<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.880> be<00:04:21.000> wary<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
that's um something to be wary and

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.080 
that's um something to be wary and
another<00:04:22.079> thing<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.710> how<00:04:23.100> many<00:04:23.340> coats<00:04:23.760> you

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
another thing is the how many coats you

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.960 
another thing is the how many coats you
put<00:04:24.300> on<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.690> always<00:04:25.680> always<00:04:26.010> unless<00:04:26.639> the<00:04:26.820> nail
