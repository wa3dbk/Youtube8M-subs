foot<00:00:59.820> position<00:01:00.210> we're<00:01:00.300> doing<00:01:00.510> incline<00:01:00.780> bench

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
foot position we're doing incline bench

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.510 
foot position we're doing incline bench
make<00:01:01.289> sure<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> keep<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.920> feet<00:01:02.070> flat<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.489> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
progressive overload so I start with

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.380 
progressive overload so I start with
twelve<00:01:35.620> reps<00:01:35.920> I<00:01:36.190> keep<00:01:36.760> my<00:01:36.880> reps<00:01:37.090> a<00:01:37.150> little<00:01:37.300> bit

twelve reps I keep my reps a little bit
higher<00:01:37.600> in<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.810> beginning<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.229> exercise

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
higher in the beginning of the exercise

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.890
