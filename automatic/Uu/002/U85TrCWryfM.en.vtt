00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.990 

this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.840> your<00:00:00.960> typical<00:00:01.140> Blake<00:00:01.650> system<00:00:02.159> and<00:00:02.550> I

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
this is your typical Blake system and I

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.820 
this is your typical Blake system and I
don't<00:00:03.240> mean<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.840> keep<00:00:03.990> putting<00:00:04.350> down<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> Blake

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
don't mean to keep putting down a Blake

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.980 
don't mean to keep putting down a Blake
system<00:00:05.310> it<00:00:05.460> has<00:00:05.940> its<00:00:06.240> knees<00:00:06.540> but<00:00:06.750> I'm<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
system it has its knees but I'm going to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.450 
system it has its knees but I'm going to
show<00:00:07.170> a<00:00:07.200> couple<00:00:07.379> things<00:00:07.710> that<00:00:07.890> you<00:00:08.010> can<00:00:08.250> do

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
show a couple things that you can do

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.350 
show a couple things that you can do
with<00:00:09.450> just<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.870> little<00:00:10.230> bit<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:10.830> added<00:00:11.340> cost<00:00:11.670> not

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
with just a little bit of added cost not

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.900 
with just a little bit of added cost not
much<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.900> think<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.980> biggest<00:00:14.219> advantage<00:00:14.460> of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
much I think the biggest advantage of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.790 
much I think the biggest advantage of
the<00:00:15.030> Blake<00:00:15.210> system<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:15.780> it's<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.289> cheapest

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
the Blake system is it's the cheapest

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880 
the Blake system is it's the cheapest
system<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.310> can't<00:00:18.140> you<00:00:19.140> can't<00:00:19.439> build<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
system you can't you can't build a

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.820 
system you can't you can't build a
climbing<00:00:20.340> system<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.480> less<00:00:21.660> money<00:00:21.900> than<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
climbing system for less money than a

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.400 
climbing system for less money than a
Blake<00:00:23.130> system<00:00:23.640> all<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.480> takes<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> carabiner

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
Blake system all it takes is a carabiner

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.250 
Blake system all it takes is a carabiner
but<00:00:26.130> there's<00:00:26.400> an<00:00:26.670> awful<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.150> you<00:00:27.330> can<00:00:27.539> do<00:00:27.779> by

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
but there's an awful lot you can do by

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
but there's an awful lot you can do by
adding<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.010> couple<00:00:29.250> little<00:00:29.490> things<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
adding just a couple little things to a

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.630 
adding just a couple little things to a
closed<00:00:32.309> system<00:00:33.710> and<00:00:34.710> I'll<00:00:35.190> show<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.399> what

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
closed system and I'll show you what

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.660 
closed system and I'll show you what
some<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> those<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.320> one<00:00:37.320> thing<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.829> lot<00:00:38.550> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
some of those are one thing a lot of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.340 
some of those are one thing a lot of
people<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> first<00:00:39.690> thing<00:00:39.899> they<00:00:40.170> might

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
people do is the first thing they might

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.350 
people do is the first thing they might
do<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.710> try<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> help<00:00:41.219> make<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.879> tent<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
do to try to help make that tent a

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.270 
do to try to help make that tent a
little<00:00:42.600> easier<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.620> don't<00:00:43.890> have<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> keep

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
little easier so you don't have to keep

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.069 
little easier so you don't have to keep
pushing<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.789> knot<00:00:44.969> up<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.390> by<00:00:45.570> adding<00:00:45.840> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
pushing the knot up is by adding a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.529 
pushing the knot up is by adding a
pulley<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> blog<00:00:47.430> system<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.090> itself

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
pulley to the blog system and itself

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.920 
pulley to the blog system and itself
tends<00:00:48.980> so<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.430> my<00:00:50.760> next<00:00:50.789> configuration<00:00:51.480> I'll

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
tends so in my next configuration I'll

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
tends so in my next configuration I'll
go<00:00:52.079> ahead<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.710> pulley<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.340> show

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
go ahead and use that pulley and show

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.100 
go ahead and use that pulley and show
you<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.969> couple<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> things<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.780> can<00:00:54.930> do

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
you a couple of the things you can do

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.220 
you a couple of the things you can do
just<00:00:55.140> by<00:00:55.500> adding<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:56.129> prusik<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.420> another

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
just by adding a prusik and another

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
just by adding a prusik and another
carabiner<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.510> far<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:01.079> i've<00:01:01.350> added<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.920> at

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
carabiner so far all i've added is at

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.690 
carabiner so far all i've added is at
prusik<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.470> an<00:01:04.619> eyetie<00:01:04.799> prusik<00:01:05.519> they're

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
prusik this is an eyetie prusik they're

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
prusik this is an eyetie prusik they're
about<00:01:05.850> $20<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.080> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.470> didn't<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.799> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
about $20 but if you didn't want to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.620 
about $20 but if you didn't want to
spend<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.159> money<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
spend the money on that you can just get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.710 
spend the money on that you can just get
a<00:01:09.840> regular<00:01:10.610> perfect<00:01:11.610> court<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.150> make<00:01:12.540> your

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
a regular perfect court and make your

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.960 
a regular perfect court and make your
own<00:01:12.869> put<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.830> anchor<00:01:14.159> knot<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.729> end<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
own put an anchor knot on the end of

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.320 
own put an anchor knot on the end of
that<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.680> tie<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:17.040> friction<00:01:17.820> hitch<00:01:18.000> there's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
that and tie a friction hitch there's

you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.530> adds<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.640> lot<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
you can use so that adds a lot of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.380 
you can use so that adds a lot of
variety<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.619> what<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.520> accomplish<00:01:35.970> with

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
variety to what you can accomplish with

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.780 
variety to what you can accomplish with
your<00:01:36.570> friction<00:01:36.930> hitch<00:01:37.049> depending<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.790> the

your friction hitch depending on the
system<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:41.060> am<00:01:42.060> using<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.630> splice

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
system that you want I am using a splice

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
system that you want I am using a splice
tie<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.820> use<00:01:45.210> anchor<00:01:45.869> knots<00:01:46.110> as

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
tie on this you can use anchor knots as

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.780 
tie on this you can use anchor knots as
long<00:01:46.560> as<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.770> keep<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> anchor<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.520> away

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
long as you keep the anchor not away

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.859 
long as you keep the anchor not away
from<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> friction<00:01:48.329> hitched

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
from the friction hitched

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.920 
from the friction hitched
but<00:01:49.710> without<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.399> lot<00:01:50.880> more<00:01:50.909> expense<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
but without a lot more expense you can

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
but without a lot more expense you can
add<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> splice<00:01:52.530> tie<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> your<00:01:53.009> climbing<00:01:53.490> line

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
add a splice tie to your climbing line

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.330 
add a splice tie to your climbing line
another<00:01:54.509> great<00:01:54.780> thing<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.110> now<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
another great thing is now you have the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.069 
another great thing is now you have the
capability<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> keeping<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.719> ropes

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
capability of keeping those ropes

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.039 
capability of keeping those ropes
slightly<00:01:59.009> separated<00:01:59.729> so<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.719> fingers

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
slightly separated so your fingers

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600 
slightly separated so your fingers
aren't<00:02:01.259> getting<00:02:01.530> caught<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.890> there<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.430> now

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
aren't getting caught in there and now

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
aren't getting caught in there and now
with<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> relocation<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.990> micro<00:02:04.320> pulley

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
with the relocation of the micro pulley

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.900 
with the relocation of the micro pulley
you<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.490> self-tanning<00:02:06.060> capability

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
you have the self-tanning capability

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.249 
you have the self-tanning capability
like<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.090> did<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> Blake's<00:02:09.750> hitch<00:02:09.959> with

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
like you did on the Blake's hitch with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.800 
like you did on the Blake's hitch with
that

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.590 
that
another<00:02:12.810> cool<00:02:13.110> thing<00:02:14.360> depending<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
another cool thing depending on the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.740 
another cool thing depending on the
configuration<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.560> saddle

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.650 

is<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.620> can<00:02:21.770> put<00:02:21.980> those<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
is that you can put those on a the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.960 
is that you can put those on a the
forward<00:02:24.050> DS<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:24.620> forward<00:02:24.980> paws<00:02:25.460> of<00:02:25.850> your

forward DS or forward paws of your

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.300 
forward DS or forward paws of your
saddle<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.600> really<00:02:27.560> give<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:27.800> some

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
saddle and really give that some

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.890 
saddle and really give that some
separation<00:02:29.000> to<00:02:29.120> keep<00:02:29.270> your<00:02:29.450> fingers<00:02:29.750> from

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
separation to keep your fingers from

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.140 
separation to keep your fingers from
getting<00:02:29.960> caught<00:02:30.640> when<00:02:31.640> you're<00:02:31.790> pulling<00:02:32.120> down

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
getting caught when you're pulling down

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.040 
getting caught when you're pulling down
on<00:02:32.300> your<00:02:33.160> climbing<00:02:34.160> system<00:02:34.520> this<00:02:35.120> by<00:02:35.330> adding<00:02:35.600> a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
on your climbing system this by adding a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.830 
on your climbing system this by adding a
critic<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.340> made<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.820> one<00:02:37.880> myself<00:02:38.270> with<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
critic and I made this one myself with a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.030 
critic and I made this one myself with a
thimble<00:02:39.320> it<00:02:39.380> doesn't<00:02:39.620> have<00:02:39.710> to<00:02:39.830> have<00:02:39.920> the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
thimble it doesn't have to have the

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.190 
thimble it doesn't have to have the
thimble<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.850> made<00:02:41.510> this<00:02:41.720> pretty<00:02:42.020> sick

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
thimble but I made this pretty sick

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.500 
thimble but I made this pretty sick
myself<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.070> very<00:02:43.250> expensive<00:02:43.430> with<00:02:44.390> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
myself it's not very expensive with the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
myself it's not very expensive with the
addition<00:02:44.900> of<00:02:45.020> a<00:02:45.140> carabiner<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.830> one<00:02:46.400> more

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
addition of a carabiner and one more

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.850 
addition of a carabiner and one more
micro<00:02:47.330> pulley<00:02:47.570> now<00:02:48.290> you<00:02:48.350> could<00:02:48.560> do<00:02:48.710> this

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
micro pulley now you could do this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.500 
micro pulley now you could do this
without<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.220> micro<00:02:49.610> pulley<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:49.940> can<00:02:50.150> just<00:02:50.330> run

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
without a micro pulley you can just run

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.900 
without a micro pulley you can just run
it<00:02:50.540> through<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.410> through<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.130> carabiner

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
it through the through the carabiner

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.540 
it through the through the carabiner
but<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.990> advantage<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.860> if<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.250> really

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
but the advantage to this if you really

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.699 
but the advantage to this if you really
needed<00:02:56.090> if<00:02:56.270> you<00:02:56.390> had<00:02:56.600> somebody<00:02:56.930> that<00:02:57.260> didn't

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
needed if you had somebody that didn't

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.340 
needed if you had somebody that didn't
mind<00:02:57.920> climbing<00:02:58.400> slowly<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.300> didn't<00:03:00.170> have<00:03:00.320> a

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
mind climbing slowly and didn't have a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.070 
mind climbing slowly and didn't have a
lot<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.740> leg<00:03:00.980> strength<00:03:01.370> or<00:03:01.700> whatever<00:03:02.150> they<00:03:02.870> can

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
lot of leg strength or whatever they can

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.590 
lot of leg strength or whatever they can
use<00:03:03.290> this<00:03:03.560> system<00:03:04.130> now<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.340> with<00:03:04.700> a<00:03:04.730> 6<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.330> 1

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
use this system now that with a 6 to 1

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.890 
use this system now that with a 6 to 1
mechanical<00:03:06.590> advantage<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.370> in<00:03:07.670> my<00:03:08.330> case<00:03:08.390> with
