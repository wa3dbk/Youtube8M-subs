on<00:02:50.920> then<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:52.010> actually<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.430> to<00:02:52.550> cut<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.090> and

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
on then I actually have to cut this and

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.760 
on then I actually have to cut this and
cut<00:02:55.570> it<00:02:56.570> and<00:02:56.780> it's<00:02:56.900> going<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.110> require<00:02:57.320> once

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
cut it and it's going to require once

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.250 
cut it and it's going to require once
you<00:02:57.890> cut<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:59.150> start<00:02:59.450> retying<00:02:59.959> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
you cut this to start retying it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.310 
you cut this to start retying it
yourself<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.570> sure<00:03:02.870> how<00:03:02.989> that's<00:03:03.110> gonna

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
yourself I'm not sure how that's gonna

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.300 
yourself I'm not sure how that's gonna
deal<00:03:03.620> with<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.890> knots<00:03:04.160> of<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:06.680> fan<00:03:06.980> I'm

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
deal with the knots of this fan I'm

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.070 
deal with the knots of this fan I'm
trying<00:03:07.520> I'm<00:03:07.730> trying<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:08.120> see<00:03:08.360> if<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> seat<00:03:08.810> was

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.510 

gonna<00:03:12.080> see<00:03:12.380> where<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.680> seats<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.040> made<00:03:13.340> is

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
gonna see where the seats just made is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.380 
gonna see where the seats just made is
one<00:03:13.730> solid<00:03:14.120> piece

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
one solid piece

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.080 
one solid piece
I<00:03:14.630> guess<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.190> you're<00:03:19.310> gonna<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.610> cut<00:03:19.940> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
I guess so you're gonna have to cut it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.500 
I guess so you're gonna have to cut it
and<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:22.040> tie<00:03:22.250> it<00:03:22.310> back<00:03:22.610> up<00:03:22.910> to<00:03:23.150> fit<00:03:23.330> on

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
and then we tie it back up to fit on

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.620 
and then we tie it back up to fit on
your<00:03:23.660> stand<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:25.430> problem<00:03:25.790> you<00:03:25.880> got<00:03:25.970> run<00:03:26.239> into
