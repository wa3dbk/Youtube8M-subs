00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.320
 the president has nothing like it 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.170
 Today Dmitry Medvedev for the first time 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.540
 held such a massive press 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.820
 conference center innovation 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.190
 technology skolkovo allows 800 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.349
 journalists 300 were represented 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.900
 foreign media 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.650
 The meeting lasted 2 hours questions Dmitry 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.470
 Medvedev chose himself and asked him 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.939
 let's teach the president what the head replied 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.419
 states know them Danilkin floors 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.439
 Dmitry Medvedev was punctual press 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.769
 the conference began exactly at one o'clock sat 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.610
 its president myself without assistants i 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 ready to 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880
 get started 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.770
 but also information 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.740
 let's move on to chat nicely 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.690
 but Medvedev admitted that the first thing 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.860
 expected to hear a question about his participation in 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.830
 presidential election 12th year 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.660
 journalists will be seen fourth 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.100
 questions how long will persist 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.720
 intrigue certainly does not serve 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.350
 for yourself something to solve it 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.630
 finally ask questions 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.390
 this kind 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.240
 decision they should be made exactly in that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.380
 moment 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.930
 ripe for this all the prerequisites when 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.260
 will have 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 final political effect 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.120
 that is why 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.600
 I believe that in order to announce 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.150
 such decisions 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.830
 already choose a few 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 other formats 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.610
 than a press conference in this situation 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.330
 worse left to wait not much dmitry 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.430
 Medvedev does not exclude that there will be an operation on 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.000
 own political force in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.370
 case of participation in the presidential 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.570
 campaigns of you can 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.770
 the president 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.720
 create your political power 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.980
 I think that can 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.420
 another bad no 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.090
 can the president 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.810
 in our country to become a party member 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.939
 I have already said this recently, I believe that 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.660
 Most likely it will 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.620
 because most 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.410
 democracy 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.710
 It develops according to this scenario. 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.600
 relationship with Vladimir Putin 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.030
 the president called more than tandem 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 we have our relationship with 40 of my colleagues 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.440
 political partner Vladimir 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.079
 Putin 

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.540
 b h it's not just what is called 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.889
 tandem 

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.499
 it really 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.499
 relationship which 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:19.959
 more than twenty years 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.889
 we know each other very well 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.569
 feel 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.809
 we are really like-minded people 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:29.129
 and that there sometimes they talk about it 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.229
 but we have very close key approaches 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.369
 development issues of the country 

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:36.079
 but that doesn't mean we match the picture. 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.129
 everyone when Medvedev was asked a question 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:39.469
 situations around the speaker of the board 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.499
 Federation Sergei Mironov about what 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:44.309
 feedback took place known was not yet 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:46.319
 he has been working for a long time with me 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.409
 it seems ok 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.769
 but he represents a certain 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.349
 political force 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.379
 in the party fair russia and what 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.129
 Party United Russia have any 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.979
 there is nothing wrong with that 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.069
 on the contrary it is a reflection 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.219
 political competition here we are 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.249
 all for political competition we are all not 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:03.969
 want us to have one party which 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.119
 for everyone they decide 

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:06.979
 Here, please, not without 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.689
 traditional for press conferences 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.579
 first persons of the question Khodorkovsky 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.879
 please tell me is dangerous for 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.149
 society exit Khodorkovsky 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:16.149
 freedom 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.529
 so question 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.539
 the short answer from the box is absolutely 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.629
 no harm communication president 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.299
 reporters lasted more 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.049
 two hours 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.659
 there were no records part of the parade danilkin 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.010
 indirectly people
