the<00:01:15.240> bottom<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.780> shrunk<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the bottom there shrunk this is this is

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.249 
the bottom there shrunk this is this is
a<00:01:17.430> stance<00:01:17.670> sock<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.720> about<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> same

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a stance sock that's just about the same

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.160 
a stance sock that's just about the same
age<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> shrinkage<00:01:22.020> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
age and you can see the shrinkage is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
age and you can see the shrinkage is
actually<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.310> has<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> smaller

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
actually this actually has a smaller

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
actually this actually has a smaller
band<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> than<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.720> do<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
band on it than these do so the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.380 
band on it than these do so the
shrinkage<00:01:26.159> is<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.000> than<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.240> can

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
shrinkage is actually more than you can

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.310

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
have specific socks sides because they

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.770

definitely my left sock and the other

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.350 
definitely my left sock and the other
one<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.399> more<00:01:47.579> beat<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:47.909> was<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> right

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
one I was more beat up was the right

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389

sock<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.840> Skate<00:01:49.140> goofy<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.829> tends<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> get

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
sock at Skate goofy so that tends to get

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.280 
sock at Skate goofy so that tends to get
a<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.460> bit<00:01:50.640> more<00:01:50.850> friction<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.990> wore

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
