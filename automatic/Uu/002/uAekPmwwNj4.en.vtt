00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.950 
okay so I've got our zucchini here then
we<00:01:47.430> cook<00:01:47.640> down<00:01:47.759> until<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.210> was<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.630> tender

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
we cook down until it was just tender

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.190 
we cook down until it was just tender
I'm<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> remove<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.880> two-inch<00:01:51.360> top<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
I'm going to remove the two-inch top and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.389 
I'm going to remove the two-inch top and
bottom<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.649> then<00:01:53.180> just<00:01:54.180> slice<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:55.259> down

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
bottom and then just slice it right down

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.230 
bottom and then just slice it right down
the<00:01:56.399> center<00:01:57.020> now<00:01:58.189> sometimes<00:01:59.189> you'll<00:01:59.850> see<00:02:00.090> they

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
the center now sometimes you'll see they

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.170 
the center now sometimes you'll see they
have<00:02:00.479> quite<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> bit<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.500> seed<00:02:01.799> in<00:02:02.009> there<00:02:02.430> we

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
have quite a bit of seed in there we

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.139 
have quite a bit of seed in there we
don't<00:02:03.299> particularly<00:02:03.659> want<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.469> seeds<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:06.090> to

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
don't particularly want the seeds so to

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.819 
don't particularly want the seeds so to
scrape<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.020> I'm<00:02:07.170> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> spoon

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
scrape them out I'm going to use a spoon

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.510 
scrape them out I'm going to use a spoon
and

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
and

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.480 
and
kind<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.670> go<00:02:09.820> down<00:02:10.000> one<00:02:10.390> side<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.950> of<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
kind of go down one side of the of the

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.460 
kind of go down one side of the of the
seeds<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:13.030> come<00:02:13.450> out<00:02:13.600> pretty<00:02:13.810> easily<00:02:14.110> you're

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
seeds that come out pretty easily you're

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.010 
seeds that come out pretty easily you're
kind<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.710> cutting<00:02:15.010> in<00:02:15.190> and<00:02:15.660> through<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> little

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
kind of cutting in and through a little

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.740 
kind of cutting in and through a little
bit<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.430> then<00:02:18.430> flip<00:02:18.730> it<00:02:18.850> around<00:02:18.940> and<00:02:19.390> just<00:02:19.540> do

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
bit and then flip it around and just do

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.430 
bit and then flip it around and just do
the<00:02:19.870> other<00:02:20.020> side

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.520 

and<00:02:24.530> then<00:02:25.310> they<00:02:26.180> will<00:02:26.450> just<00:02:26.660> pop<00:02:26.960> out<00:02:27.200> now<00:02:27.470> I'm

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
and then they will just pop out now I'm

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.310 
and then they will just pop out now I'm
being<00:02:27.680> careful<00:02:28.040> not<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:29.090> go<00:02:29.390> through<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
being careful not to go through the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.430 
being careful not to go through the
bottom<00:02:30.710> of<00:02:30.890> a<00:02:31.040> zucchini<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:33.110> seeds

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
bottom of a zucchini the seeds

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.300 
bottom of a zucchini the seeds
themselves<00:02:33.980> I<00:02:34.730> don't<00:02:35.510> really<00:02:36.050> want<00:02:36.440> so<00:02:36.860> I'm

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
themselves I don't really want so I'm

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.610 
themselves I don't really want so I'm
just<00:02:37.460> going<00:02:37.580> to<00:02:37.700> take<00:02:37.850> those<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.380> toss<00:02:39.380> them

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
just going to take those and toss them

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.330 
just going to take those and toss them
off<00:02:40.420> if<00:02:41.420> if<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.350> were<00:02:42.470> no<00:02:42.620> seeds<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:43.070> there<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
off if if there were no seeds in there I

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.220 
off if if there were no seeds in there I
would<00:02:43.550> follow<00:02:43.730> this<00:02:43.910> exact<00:02:44.300> same<00:02:44.510> procedure<00:02:44.930> I

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
would follow this exact same procedure I

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.280 
would follow this exact same procedure I
would<00:02:45.920> just<00:02:46.100> be<00:02:46.220> taken<00:02:46.580> off<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.170> end<00:02:48.170> of<00:02:48.230> the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
would just be taken off the end of the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.000 
would just be taken off the end of the
