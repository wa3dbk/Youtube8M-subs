there's<00:00:04.880> a<00:00:04.940> lot<00:00:04.970> of<00:00:05.210> problems<00:00:05.660> on<00:00:05.900> these<00:00:06.200> about

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.650 
there's a lot of problems on these about

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.299 
there's a lot of problems on these about
the<00:00:06.920> shift<00:00:07.220> levers<00:00:07.759> and<00:00:08.409> them<00:00:09.409> messing<00:00:09.919> up<00:00:10.099> and

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
the shift levers and them messing up and

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.549 
the shift levers and them messing up and
most<00:00:10.879> of<00:00:11.030> the<00:00:11.089> time<00:00:11.329> it's<00:00:11.690> just<00:00:11.809> a<00:00:12.199> neutral

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
most of the time it's just a neutral

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.079 
most of the time it's just a neutral
safety<00:00:13.039> switch<00:00:13.249> on<00:00:13.400> the<00:00:13.459> side<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:13.820> trans

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:14.089 
safety switch on the side of the trans

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.599 
safety switch on the side of the trans
you<00:00:14.329> pop<00:00:14.659> it<00:00:14.779> off<00:00:14.959> with<00:00:15.230> two<00:00:15.949> bolts<00:00:16.129> and<00:00:16.369> take

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
you pop it off with two bolts and take

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.730 
you pop it off with two bolts and take
pry<00:00:16.789> bar<00:00:17.060> bust<00:00:17.929> it<00:00:18.080> off<00:00:18.170> put<00:00:18.349> a<00:00:18.380> new<00:00:18.470> one<00:00:18.560> on<00:00:18.679> and

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
pry bar bust it off put a new one on and

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.109 
pry bar bust it off put a new one on and
usually<00:00:19.070> it<00:00:19.279> works<00:00:19.400> fine<00:00:19.609> after<00:00:19.939> that

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
usually it works fine after that

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.370 
usually it works fine after that
but<00:00:21.019> when<00:00:21.830> you're<00:00:21.949> driving<00:00:22.160> these<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.050> all<00:00:24.050> of

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
but when you're driving these and all of

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
a sudden your shifter level or just

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.499 
a sudden your shifter level or just
starts<00:00:26.509> doing<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.189> and<00:00:28.189> you're<00:00:29.179> like<00:00:29.329> what

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
the just busted well come to find

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.660 
the just busted well come to find
out<00:00:32.230> it's<00:00:33.230> not<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:33.469> cable<00:00:33.949> that<00:00:34.100> connects<00:00:34.520> it

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
out it's not the cable that connects it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.950 
out it's not the cable that connects it
to<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:34.879> trans<00:00:35.239> there's<00:00:35.840> actually<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.350> a<00:00:36.860> tube

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
to the trans there's actually a a tube

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.400 
to the trans there's actually a a tube
right<00:00:38.960> here<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:40.670> too<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:41.930> can't<00:00:42.260> really

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
right here this too and you can't really

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.509 
right here this too and you can't really
see<00:00:42.530> down<00:00:43.190> there<00:00:43.579> you<00:00:44.390> might<00:00:44.600> be<00:00:44.719> able<00:00:44.899> to<00:00:44.989> it's

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
see down there you might be able to it's

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.750 
see down there you might be able to it's
snapped<00:00:46.519> in<00:00:46.820> half

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
snapped in half

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.049 
snapped in half
alright<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.500> then<00:00:51.500> take<00:00:51.800> it<00:00:51.980> out<00:00:52.129> with<00:00:52.820> the

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
alright and then take it out with the

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.509 
alright and then take it out with the
t30<00:00:53.840> Torx<00:00:54.320> bits<00:00:54.620> which<00:00:55.550> would<00:00:55.730> be<00:00:57.489> these<00:00:58.489> two

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
t30 Torx bits which would be these two

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.110 
t30 Torx bits which would be these two
right<00:00:59.149> here<00:00:59.890> and<00:01:00.890> we're<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.129> going<00:01:01.460> to<00:01:01.489> pop

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
right here and we're just going to pop

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.000 
right here and we're just going to pop
this<00:01:02.179> out<00:01:02.510> and<00:01:02.570> disconnected<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:03.469> overdrive

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
this out and disconnected the overdrive

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.790 
this out and disconnected the overdrive
already<00:01:08.020> and<00:01:09.940> see<00:01:10.940> what<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:11.210> does<00:01:11.240> but<00:01:12.230> before

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
already and see what it does but before

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.650 
already and see what it does but before
that<00:01:13.010> I<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:13.340> driving<00:01:13.550> it<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.150> I<00:01:14.300> knew<00:01:14.450> it<00:01:14.540> was

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
that I was driving it and I knew it was

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.850 
that I was driving it and I knew it was
having<00:01:14.960> issues<00:01:15.950> with<00:01:17.110> not<00:01:18.110> lining<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.560> go<00:01:18.650> into

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
having issues with not lining to go into

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.070 
having issues with not lining to go into
a<00:01:18.890> park<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:19.460> start<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.540> I<00:01:20.600> thought<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:20.870> was<00:01:20.960> my

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
a park and start and I thought it was my

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.690 
a park and start and I thought it was my
solenoid<00:01:21.500> on<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:21.680> fender<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.370> replaced

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
solenoid on the fender and I replaced

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.970 
solenoid on the fender and I replaced
that<00:01:22.790> too<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:24.050> wasn't<00:01:24.350> because<00:01:24.830> it<00:01:24.860> was

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
that too and it wasn't because it was

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.500 
that too and it wasn't because it was
like<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.220> go<00:01:25.370> too<00:01:25.430> but<00:01:25.820> it<00:01:26.000> wasn't<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.300> problem

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
like to go too but it wasn't the problem

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.990 
like to go too but it wasn't the problem
this<00:01:26.840> one<00:01:27.220> and<00:01:28.220> then<00:01:28.340> just<00:01:28.370> take<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:28.730> clamp

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
this one and then just take this clamp

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.720 
this one and then just take this clamp
off<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.540> then<00:01:29.780> also<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.650> what<00:01:31.310> makes<00:01:31.520> this

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:31.730 
off and then also that what makes this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.000 
off and then also that what makes this
happen<00:01:31.970> most<00:01:32.630> of<00:01:32.780> time<00:01:32.960> is<00:01:33.200> these<00:01:33.620> bushings

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
happen most of time is these bushings

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
happen most of time is these bushings
right<00:01:34.220> here<00:01:34.430> there's<00:01:34.610> two<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:34.850> them<00:01:34.970> right

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
right here there's two of them right

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.300 
right here there's two of them right
here<00:01:35.360> a<00:01:35.390> little<00:01:35.600> backside<00:01:36.200> down<00:01:36.380> there<00:01:36.650> they

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
here a little backside down there they

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.660
