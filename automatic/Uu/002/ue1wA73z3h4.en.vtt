00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.120 
i'll bump by hand but the transmission
ain't<00:04:29.110> slipping<00:04:29.530> so<00:04:29.740> it's<00:04:29.919> not<00:04:30.070> a

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
ain't slipping so it's not a

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.010 
ain't slipping so it's not a
transmission<00:04:30.820> problem<00:04:30.850> it's<00:04:31.479> just<00:04:31.690> as<00:04:31.810> dumb

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
transmission problem it's just as dumb

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.529 
transmission problem it's just as dumb
as<00:04:32.050> didn't<00:04:32.440> know<00:04:32.500> what<00:04:32.620> he<00:04:33.009> was<00:04:33.070> doing<00:04:33.490> when<00:04:34.479> he

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
as didn't know what he was doing when he

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.790 
as didn't know what he was doing when he
was<00:04:34.750> put<00:04:34.960> when<00:04:35.169> he<00:04:35.320> was<00:04:37.229> putting<00:04:38.229> that<00:04:38.380> filter

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
was put when he was putting that filter

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.390 
was put when he was putting that filter
on<00:04:38.949> this<00:04:39.100> transmission<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.889> anyway<00:04:42.190> that's

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
on this transmission so anyway that's

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.279 
on this transmission so anyway that's
that's<00:04:42.850> all<00:04:43.000> I've<00:04:43.180> got<00:04:43.360> to<00:04:43.389> do<00:04:43.630> it's<00:04:43.900> needing

that's all I've got to do it's needing

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:45.900
