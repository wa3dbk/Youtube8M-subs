hello my name is Benedict Timbo I work
on<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.240> University<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:09.990> lucerne<00:00:10.470> and<00:00:10.740> now<00:00:11.639> i

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
on the University of lucerne and now i

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.470 
on the University of lucerne and now i
show<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.150> what<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:13.490> accomplished<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:15.000> j

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
show you what I accomplished this the j

now show you the capabilities of the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.370 
now show you the capabilities of the
board<00:00:30.369> we<00:00:31.369> can<00:00:31.550> use<00:00:31.820> these<00:00:32.150> LEDs<00:00:32.720> also<00:00:33.230> as

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
board we can use these LEDs also as

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.700 
board we can use these LEDs also as
sensors<00:00:34.480> now<00:00:35.480> i'm<00:00:35.720> activating<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.320> function

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
sensors now i'm activating the function

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.650 
sensors now i'm activating the function
press<00:00:39.710> e<00:00:40.010> 7<00:00:42.040> now<00:00:43.040> the<00:00:43.100> board<00:00:43.580> does<00:00:44.330> not<00:00:44.360> a

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
press e 7 now the board does not a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
press e 7 now the board does not a
calibration<00:00:46.570> now<00:00:47.570> if<00:00:47.750> I<00:00:47.870> mean<00:00:48.080> with<00:00:48.530> some

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
calibration now if I mean with some

00:00:48.680 --> 00:01:14.430 
calibration now if I mean with some
finger<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.280> can<00:00:49.640> activate<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.449> LEDs

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.470 

you

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.120 

now<00:01:22.480> I<00:01:22.510> can<00:01:22.750> use<00:01:22.960> this<00:01:23.140> port<00:01:23.440> also<00:01:23.710> from

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
now I can use this port also from

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.880 
now I can use this port also from
transmitting<00:01:24.640> Delta<00:01:25.300> from<00:01:25.870> one<00:01:26.380> port<00:01:26.620> to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
transmitting Delta from one port to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.070 
transmitting Delta from one port to
another<00:01:26.980> board<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.150> this<00:01:31.330> is<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.510> same<00:01:31.810> work

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
another board so this is the same work

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.540 
another board so this is the same work
and<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:34.000> will<00:01:34.150> transmit<00:01:34.750> a<00:01:35.050> text<00:01:36.010> from<00:01:36.340> the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
and now I will transmit a text from the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.130 
and now I will transmit a text from the
12<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.120> odd<00:01:37.150> report<00:01:38.580> on<00:01:39.580> board<00:01:39.910> my<00:01:40.630> name<00:01:40.870> benny

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
12 the odd report on board my name benny

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.870 
12 the odd report on board my name benny
and<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.500> honor<00:01:42.100> board<00:01:42.370> the<00:01:43.090> text<00:01:43.540> magic<00:01:44.880> now

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
and the honor board the text magic now

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.780 
and the honor board the text magic now
i'm<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.240> to<00:01:46.390> transmit<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.380> text<00:01:47.890> metric<00:01:48.460> to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
i'm going to transmit the text metric to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:56.580 
i'm going to transmit the text metric to
the<00:01:48.940> other<00:01:49.030> board<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:51.220> this<00:01:51.370> i<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:55.180> on<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
the other board for this i go on the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.010 
the other board for this i go on the
arocs<00:01:56.950> mode<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.670> this<00:01:57.910> port<00:01:58.270> and<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.820> the<00:02:01.660> TX

transmission is indicated by this led

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.920 
transmission is indicated by this led
now<00:02:20.470> we<00:02:20.530> can<00:02:20.800> see<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.540> transition

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
now we can see that the transition

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.460 
now we can see that the transition
transmission<00:02:23.739> rate<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.220> speeding<00:02:25.150> up<00:02:25.239> now

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:37.620 

it's<00:02:29.470> finished<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:36.069> same<00:02:36.280> bored<00:02:36.580> same<00:02:37.180> text

this patch as a locker patch you can use

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
this patch as a locker patch you can use
this<00:02:57.440> for<00:02:58.160> example<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:59.030> lock<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.900> car<00:03:00.800> or<00:03:01.100> a

I<00:03:12.410> have<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.310> shake<00:03:13.550> it<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:14.660> create<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:15.380> random

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
I have to shake it to create a random

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:24.130 
I have to shake it to create a random
key<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:22.070> now<00:03:22.280> i<00:03:22.520> will<00:03:22.580> send<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.390> key<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.990> the

so this patch is locked and you can

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.080 
so this patch is locked and you can
often<00:04:06.490> do<00:04:06.760> with<00:04:06.940> it<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:08.290> unlock<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.910> we<00:04:09.910> need

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
often do with it to unlock it we need

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:22.900 
often do with it to unlock it we need
daughterboard<00:04:10.480> to<00:04:11.050> send<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.410> key<00:04:11.620> back

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.390 

so<00:04:23.510> here<00:04:24.020> we<00:04:24.260> are<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:24.620> transmission<00:04:24.950> mode

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
so here we are in the transmission mode

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.200 
so here we are in the transmission mode
to<00:04:25.880> send<00:04:26.120> the<00:04:26.240> key<00:04:26.420> back<00:04:27.190> now<00:04:28.190> here<00:04:28.640> you're

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
to send the key back now here you're

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:39.130
