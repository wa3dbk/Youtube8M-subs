00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.269
 Hello, I would like to tell you about 7 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.160
 installation of gas equipment at Renault 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:18.900
 logan 2 is installed on this car 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:23.430
 bercy company's equipment, you can 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.480
 here is the gearbox valve 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.900
 separately made from the gearbox 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.010
 gas filter and here are the injectors 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.320
 are in principle quite accessible 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.500
 shlanchik and go already input manifold 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 here is the control unit 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.140
 engine mounted on top of it 2 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
 gas equipment control unit then 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.739
 there is such a box 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.590
 plastic valve reference device 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.210
 filling valve is right here 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.190
 gas tank handle enough space for it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.570
 By the way, I thought the gun was there. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.030
 somehow will cling when you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680
 you take out insert but there is no place 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 enough 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.689
 with this problem there is no scales that of course in 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 Ideally, ideally, if you do not mind the bumper 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.220
 the best channel to put behind 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:19.110
 let's say under the bumper there or somewhere else 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.049
 why in the first you can drive up with any 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.360
 side of the column is not necessarily there damn 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.210
 starboard left side drive up 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:33.360
 there is still something here is not very convenient 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:37.409
 but it's not important that it is important here 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.659
 I have a can of spray 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.200
 asked to put 100 liters as 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.049
 we don't have to hold much for a week 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.619
 1200 requests were enough once 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:54.630
 it was possible to go there like this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:58.200
 plus minus here's a can here costs 75 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 75 liters not installed due to the fact 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.469
 that a 100 liter bottle to us for one 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 there was no moment and nowhere to take it 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.140
 It was and in general that's 75 liters 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.010
 live and rejoice here you come to the first 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.230
 wash and change it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.470
 Well, I do not know about that, they will not change me 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.140
 here there is another nuance 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.790
 it means multivalve puts it lovato 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.170
 I also do not mind the principle okay 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.360
 hoses that are around the bottle and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.910
 go away in the floor here here in this place yes 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.069
 I will get 100 liters here he will leave 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.739
 more will be yes he is exactly up to the rack he 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:42.840
 will block these holes and what else do I 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.329
 two holes have to be drilled 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.160
 somewhere here anywhere else where 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:52.019
 it is not clear and the car I'm exactly in 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.859
 this state got bent 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.290
 a rug like this 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:01.590
 attached right here here to this hose 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.170
 balloon is unclear why and how and in general 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.280
 the man who did ours 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.940
 inadequate 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:15.000
 this one this thing is all this incomprehensible 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:21.139
 why frau can't even explain 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.829
 how is located but obviously the guys 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:29.730
 not quite experienced installed in front 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:32.700
 it seems like more or less everything is fine well 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.450
 that's kind of more or less neat 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:39.150
 Well, I want to say something else 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:43.530
 nuances of installing gas 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.359
 equipment a lot in general if you 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.030
 want to put gas equipment 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.769
 I recommend you to refer in general to 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.950
 known some personalities read 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.720
 reviews look there think how 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.700
 better it puts it to really save 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.169
 money as a liter of gas costs 35 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.290
 rubles 95 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:06.599
 and by the way this car is only 95 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.000
 maybe x can be operated with 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:14.549
 about it even it seems like yes you see 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.739
 unleaded gasoline 95 98 something 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.750
 there is not below 95 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.489
 Do you know it at current prices 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.460
 gasoline is just not that expensive 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:29.449
 deadly 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:34.039
 but on gas it turns out to be in the area 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.660
 1910 1920 liter and she eats about 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.300
 Liter and a half more I'm right now 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.310
 I can not yet measure absolutely like 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.970
 that's exactly the cost is the most honest in 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.280
 I got around eight 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.509
 half my way up to 8 and a half 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.000
 turned 1 year 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:57.780
 race so serious 80 half 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.789
 liters per 100 kilometers that's the principle 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.949
 I am satisfied here except 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.830
 Of course spray so show more now 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:10.050
 straws a button I have then 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.590
 there is a button here which 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.479
 usually get here 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.900
 it means it's the most minimal 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.880
 car grade here usually 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:29.860
 there is a control lever mirrors 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:33.189
 then start the car yes that is 1 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:38.500
 machine started up now see now 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:40.030
 on goes automatically to gas here 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.280
 she is already working on gas green 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:45.129
 light bulb lit up like this it works 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.849
 petrol on a red light all 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:51.479
 understandable mileage is now 17 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:54.550
 thousand five hundred fifty six kilometers 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.060
 machine principle normally works on 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.509
 gas 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:04.000
 really like no problems such 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:08.379
 Technical we still have some not yet 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:13.319
 arose soon principle i 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:17.370
 pleased with a few exceptions here 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:17.370
 thank you all before the meeting
