 ranking version 128 gigabytes but true 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.410
 there is no hard disk on ssd disk which 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.370
 much faster not to say that this is so 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.650
 noticeable during operation opportunity 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.420
 upgrade your laptop 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.620
 most of its complexity ie update 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.500
 iron note to yourself 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.360
 as in the rating version for example to 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.910
 replace memory need to have special 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.819
 Aries skills are chopped version just 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.629
 unscrewed the lid and bend the memory 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.780
 price since the rat version is more expensive 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.719
 the usual antipina 200 euros really like 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.430
 not the screen version is much better but it 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:41.579
 does not mean that the normal version 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.379
 bad screen and in general 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.469
 coal sound performance is not 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:50.930
 very different for these reasons 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.930
