00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170

this and given that I know a lot of

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.510 
this and given that I know a lot of
people<00:02:20.350> are<00:02:20.620> really<00:02:20.650> looking<00:02:20.920> forward<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
people are really looking forward to the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
tournament and as it stands it's an

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.240 
tournament and as it stands it's an
ever-shifting<00:02:25.840> sort<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.710> thing<00:02:26.830> if<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.010> were<00:02:27.130> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
ever-shifting sort of thing if I were to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.010 
ever-shifting sort of thing if I were to
record<00:02:27.580> right<00:02:27.730> now<00:02:27.760> I<00:02:27.910> think<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:28.660> would<00:02:28.870> have

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
record right now I think I would have

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.140 
record right now I think I would have
six<00:02:29.500> people<00:02:29.890> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.070> tournament<00:02:30.550> or<00:02:30.760> six

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
six people in the tournament or six

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.540 
six people in the tournament or six
different<00:02:31.450> ships<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.290> even<00:02:32.950> considering

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
different ships that is even considering

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.160 
different ships that is even considering
the<00:02:33.790> one<00:02:33.940> person<00:02:34.120> would<00:02:34.300> have<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.480> from<00:02:34.990> their

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the one person would have to from their

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the one person would have to from their
fleet<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:38.260> were<00:02:38.380> took<00:02:38.560> recording<00:02:39.070> about

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
fleet and if I were took recording about

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.700 
fleet and if I were took recording about
5-6<00:02:40.000> hours<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.480> might<00:02:40.900> have<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> very<00:02:41.410> different

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
5-6 hours I might have a very different

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.670 
5-6 hours I might have a very different
array<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.190> ships<00:02:42.610> available<00:02:43.230> given<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
array of ships available given that I

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.570 
array of ships available given that I
think<00:02:45.070> we<00:02:45.190> need<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:45.760> go<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.300> a<00:02:46.330> more<00:02:47.580> steady

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
think we need to go to a more steady

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.420 
think we need to go to a more steady
more<00:02:49.000> stable<00:02:49.620> delivery<00:02:50.620> method<00:02:51.070> for<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.310> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
more stable delivery method for you to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.340 
more stable delivery method for you to
get<00:02:51.580> your<00:02:51.730> ships<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.270> meet<00:02:52.480> for<00:02:52.720> entry<00:02:53.320> into

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
get your ships to meet for entry into

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.190 
get your ships to meet for entry into
the<00:02:53.590> tournament<00:02:53.830> ideally<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.730> would<00:02:54.850> like

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
the tournament ideally I would like

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.520 
the tournament ideally I would like
between<00:02:56.200> 16<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.010> 32<00:02:57.400> what<00:02:57.610> that<00:02:57.850> is<00:02:58.030> 16<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:58.750> 32

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
between 16 and 32 what that is 16 or 32

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.820 
between 16 and 32 what that is 16 or 32
so<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.040> we've<00:03:00.160> got<00:03:00.340> full<00:03:00.760> brackets<00:03:01.830> ideally

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so that we've got full brackets ideally

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.490 
so that we've got full brackets ideally
32<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.640> would<00:03:04.270> like<00:03:04.450> quite<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:04.990> have<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> bit

32 I would like quite like to have a bit
of<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.650> longer<00:03:05.920> tournament<00:03:06.700> and<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.780> record<00:03:08.080> a

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
of a longer tournament and to record a

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.030 
of a longer tournament and to record a
longer<00:03:08.410> episode<00:03:08.740> though<00:03:08.890> obviously<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
longer episode though obviously the the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.470 
longer episode though obviously the the
disclaimer<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:12.250> if<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.490> got<00:03:12.610> too<00:03:12.910> long<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.330> would

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
disclaimer is if it got too long I would

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.590 
disclaimer is if it got too long I would
split<00:03:13.780> it<00:03:13.900> into<00:03:14.440> two<00:03:15.000> longer<00:03:16.000> episodes<00:03:16.150> rather

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
split it into two longer episodes rather

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.260 
split it into two longer episodes rather
than<00:03:16.750> one<00:03:16.960> really<00:03:17.530> long<00:03:17.710> episode<00:03:18.130> but<00:03:18.730> I<00:03:19.000> think

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
than one really long episode but I think

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.180 
than one really long episode but I think
32<00:03:19.570> is<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.870> good<00:03:20.080> number<00:03:20.260> it<00:03:20.680> will<00:03:20.830> give<00:03:20.980> us<00:03:21.010> a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
32 is a good number it will give us a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.890 
32 is a good number it will give us a
lot<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.520> stuff<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:21.940> look<00:03:21.970> at<00:03:22.180> my<00:03:22.330> wall<00:03:22.450> 32

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
lot of stuff to look at my wall 32

the way I think would be best for us to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.530 
the way I think would be best for us to
do<00:03:34.570> this<00:03:34.780> would<00:03:35.410> be<00:03:35.440> for<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:37.030> ships<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.450> be

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
do this would be for the ships to be

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.230 
do this would be for the ships to be
