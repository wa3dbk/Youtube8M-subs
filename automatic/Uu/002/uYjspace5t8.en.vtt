and<00:00:08.849> now<00:00:09.150> moving<00:00:09.330> on<00:00:10.670> these<00:00:11.670> are<00:00:12.530> paradox

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
and now moving on these are paradox

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.340 
and now moving on these are paradox
gates<00:00:13.830> which<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:15.000> serve<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.269> major<00:00:15.719> element<00:00:16.020> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
gates which do serve a major element of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
gates which do serve a major element of
importance<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.039> game<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.760> can't<00:00:18.029> talk

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
importance in the game but we can't talk

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.560 
importance in the game but we can't talk
about<00:00:18.390> exactly<00:00:19.109> what<00:00:19.350> they<00:00:19.529> do<00:00:19.590> yes<00:00:20.539> you<00:00:21.539> just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570

about exactly what they do yes you just
know<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.170> will<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.500> interacting<00:00:23.250> with

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
know that you will be interacting with

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.390 
know that you will be interacting with
them<00:00:23.580> very<00:00:24.269> much<00:00:24.740> so<00:00:25.740> now<00:00:25.859> i'm<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.250> enter

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
them very much so now i'm going to enter

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
them very much so now i'm going to enter
this<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.789> definitely<00:00:27.090> as<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.689> regular<00:00:28.380> battle

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
this one definitely as a regular battle

Ravager

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
Ravager
and<00:00:42.660> he's<00:00:42.870> got<00:00:42.990> his<00:00:43.050> gaze<00:00:43.440> at<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> bottom<00:00:44.130> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and he's got his gaze at the bottom the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.090 
and he's got his gaze at the bottom the
federal<00:00:44.880> linkage<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.650> as<00:00:46.650> soon<00:00:46.830> as<00:00:46.980> he's

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
federal linkage that as soon as he's

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.790 
federal linkage that as soon as he's
fully<00:00:47.340> synchronized<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.180> can<00:00:49.080> lock<00:00:49.290> his

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
fully synchronized I can lock his

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.100 
fully synchronized I can lock his
special<00:00:50.310> attack

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.790 

and<00:00:55.620> does<00:00:55.800> steal<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.250> lot<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.580> extra<00:00:57.030> damage

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
and does steal a lot of extra damage

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:10.520 
and does steal a lot of extra damage
in<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> very<00:00:59.190> quick<00:00:59.399> manner

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.050 

I<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> little<00:01:11.549> bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.670> camera

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
I also get a little bit of camera

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.719 
I also get a little bit of camera
movement<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.659> move<00:01:12.840> via<00:01:13.110> want<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.159> position

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
movement if I move via want to position

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:32.860 
movement if I move via want to position
to<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> better<00:01:15.270> angle<00:01:25.280> all<00:01:26.280> right

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.280 

now<00:01:34.090> tell<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.180> about<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.390> good<00:01:35.660> enough<00:01:35.930> battles

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
now tell you about a good enough battles

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.900 
now tell you about a good enough battles
i'm<00:01:36.710> going<00:01:36.890> to<00:01:36.950> go<00:01:37.070> ahead<00:01:37.100> and<00:01:37.340> start<00:01:37.670> trying

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
i'm going to go ahead and start trying

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.700 
i'm going to go ahead and start trying
to<00:01:38.120> skip<00:01:38.390> the<00:01:38.600> rest<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.960> them<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.320> i<00:01:39.410> can<00:01:39.560> show

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
to skip the rest of them that i can show

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.980 
to skip the rest of them that i can show
you<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.890> bit<00:01:40.070> more<00:01:40.100> of<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.490> extra<00:01:40.820> content

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.870 

now<00:01:45.560> we're<00:01:45.740> basically<00:01:46.070> coming<00:01:46.400> up<00:01:46.640> on<00:01:46.790> the

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
now we're basically coming up on the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.899 
now we're basically coming up on the
field<00:01:47.119> where<00:01:47.360> Atlas<00:01:47.840> is<00:01:48.079> and<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.790> where

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
field where Atlas is and this is where

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.069 
field where Atlas is and this is where
we're<00:01:50.090> going<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.270> be<00:01:50.390> presented<00:01:50.899> with<00:01:50.930> a

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
we're going to be presented with a

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:56.340 
we're going to be presented with a
choice<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.380> how<00:01:52.310> we<00:01:52.369> want<00:01:52.670> to<00:01:52.700> proceed

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.770 

he's<00:01:57.040> over<00:01:57.220> here

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.960 

obviously<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.890> lot<00:02:04.920> more<00:02:05.070> intimidating

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
obviously in a lot more intimidating

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.749 
obviously in a lot more intimidating
form<00:02:06.240> than<00:02:06.450> he<00:02:06.510> was<00:02:06.690> in<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.960> first<00:02:07.170> time<00:02:07.759> our

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
form than he was in the first time our

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.059 
form than he was in the first time our
choice<00:02:09.030> comes<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:09.750> fact<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
choice comes from the fact that now the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.030 
choice comes from the fact that now the
paradox<00:02:11.790> has<00:02:12.300> caused<00:02:13.020> this<00:02:13.319> device<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.709> come

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
paradox has caused this device to come

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.840 
paradox has caused this device to come
into<00:02:14.190> appearance<00:02:14.550> and<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:16.110> can<00:02:16.620> choose<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.280> hunt

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
into appearance and I can choose to hunt

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.479 
into appearance and I can choose to hunt
down<00:02:18.030> this<00:02:18.240> device<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:19.200> use<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.100> somehow

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
down this device and use it to somehow

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.720 
down this device and use it to somehow
weaken<00:02:21.030> atlas<00:02:21.450> or<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:22.319> can<00:02:22.860> just<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.190> gutsy<00:02:23.400> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
weaken atlas or I can just be gutsy and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.340 
weaken atlas or I can just be gutsy and
just<00:02:24.030> dive<00:02:24.239> right<00:02:24.270> into<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> battle<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.170> just

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
just dive right into the battle and just

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.260 
just dive right into the battle and just
try<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.560> muscle<00:02:25.770> them<00:02:26.040> out<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.060> very

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
try and muscle them out but it's a very

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.320 
try and muscle them out but it's a very
difficult<00:02:27.630> battle<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.650> as<00:02:29.220> plus<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.090> device

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
difficult battle and as plus the device

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.370 
difficult battle and as plus the device
is<00:02:30.480> pretty<00:02:30.720> cool<00:02:30.930> once<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.170> see<00:02:31.350> what

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
is pretty cool once you see what

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.680 
is pretty cool once you see what
actually<00:02:31.860> can<00:02:31.980> do<00:02:32.130> so<00:02:32.760> i'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.330> go<00:02:33.390> hunt

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
actually can do so i'm going to go hunt

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.130 
actually can do so i'm going to go hunt
down<00:02:33.720> that<00:02:33.870> device

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.320 

I'm<00:02:39.380> going<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.560> run<00:02:39.680> past<00:02:39.890> these<00:02:40.130> guys<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.700> can

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
I'm going to run past these guys I can

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.020 
I'm going to run past these guys I can
run<00:02:41.540> away<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.620> NPC's<00:02:43.220> that<00:02:43.640> are<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
run away and the NPC's that are on the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.449 
run away and the NPC's that are on the
field<00:02:44.180> with<00:02:44.360> their<00:02:44.540> machine<00:02:44.840> guns<00:02:45.190> if<00:02:46.190> they

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
field with their machine guns if they

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.760 
field with their machine guns if they
see<00:02:46.520> enemies<00:02:46.940> nearby<00:02:47.300> they<00:02:47.930> will<00:02:48.260> fight<00:02:48.590> them

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
see enemies nearby they will fight them

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.220 
see enemies nearby they will fight them
so<00:02:49.459> there<00:02:50.360> are<00:02:50.390> some<00:02:50.569> times<00:02:50.810> where<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.050> don't

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
so there are some times where you don't

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.140 
so there are some times where you don't
even<00:02:51.380> have<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.709> engage<00:02:51.980> in<00:02:52.370> any<00:02:52.640> battles<00:02:53.060> at

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
even have to engage in any battles at

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.940 
even have to engage in any battles at
all<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:56.050> there<00:02:57.050> we<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:57.230> NPCs<00:02:57.770> took

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
all and this is there we go NPCs took

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.740 
all and this is there we go NPCs took
care<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> battle<00:02:58.490> for<00:02:58.670> me<00:02:58.790> so<00:02:59.390> I<00:02:59.420> was<00:02:59.690> just

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
care of the battle for me so I was just

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.510 
care of the battle for me so I was just
about<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.560> close<00:03:00.830> to<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.130> during<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.370> battle

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
about that close to and during a battle

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.310 
about that close to and during a battle
with<00:03:01.790> d<00:03:01.970> buffs<00:03:02.209> because<00:03:02.570> i<00:03:02.660> didn't<00:03:02.959> start<00:03:03.170> two

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
with d buffs because i didn't start two

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.160 
with d buffs because i didn't start two

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
took care of it for me quick uses nose

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.979 
took care of it for me quick uses nose
twice<00:03:10.250> peterson<00:03:10.940> i'm<00:03:11.090> hoping<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.570> same<00:03:11.750> can

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
twice peterson i'm hoping the same can

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:13.930 
twice peterson i'm hoping the same can
happen<00:03:12.020> here<00:03:12.620> or<00:03:13.250> at<00:03:13.340> least<00:03:13.370> that<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.760> guy

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
happen here or at least that this guy

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.320 
happen here or at least that this guy
gets<00:03:14.209> away<00:03:14.420> from<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.640> looks<00:03:16.820> like<00:03:16.940> that's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
gets away from you it looks like that's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.540 
gets away from you it looks like that's
not<00:03:17.450> going<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.690> happen<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:18.620> now<00:03:18.830> because<00:03:19.430> i

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
not going to happen so now because i

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.880 
not going to happen so now because i
didn't<00:03:19.790> cite<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> mod<00:03:20.239> clock<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.720> time<00:03:20.900> now<00:03:21.860> I

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
didn't cite the mod clock in time now I

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.920 
didn't cite the mod clock in time now I
fight<00:03:22.250> these<00:03:22.400> guys<00:03:22.580> with<00:03:22.880> slow

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.539 

I'm<00:03:27.319> gonna<00:03:27.469> go<00:03:27.560> ahead<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:27.709> eat<00:03:27.859> my<00:03:28.010> feral<00:03:28.340> link

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
I'm gonna go ahead and eat my feral link

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.550 
I'm gonna go ahead and eat my feral link
again<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.209> bit<00:03:29.750> of<00:03:29.840> extra<00:03:30.049> damage

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.830 

dipping<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.680> there<00:03:37.890> in<00:03:38.069> so<00:03:38.580> they<00:03:38.730> die<00:03:38.940> insanely

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
dipping is there in so they die insanely

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.940 
dipping is there in so they die insanely
equally

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.210 

historic

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.200 

this<00:03:53.790> ends<00:03:54.030> now

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.690 

and<00:04:01.660> now<00:04:01.840> we're<00:04:02.050> coming<00:04:02.350> up<00:04:02.500> on<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.370> device

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
and now we're coming up on the device

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.810 
and now we're coming up on the device
itself

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.430 

good<00:04:11.820> if<00:04:12.240> it's<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:12.780> I<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:12.900> show<00:04:13.170> you<00:04:13.230> what

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
good if it's just so I can show you what

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.400 
good if it's just so I can show you what
the<00:04:13.530> device<00:04:13.770> does<00:04:14.040> basically<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:15.540> is<00:04:16.230> now

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
the device does basically it is now

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.790 
the device does basically it is now
pulled<00:04:16.920> at<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.220> entire<00:04:17.640> team<00:04:18.170> into<00:04:19.170> what<00:04:19.709> is

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
pulled at the entire team into what is

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.949 
pulled at the entire team into what is
called<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:20.100> temporal<00:04:20.550> rift<00:04:20.580> which<00:04:21.420> is<00:04:21.660> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
called a temporal rift which is a

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.560 
called a temporal rift which is a
anomaly<00:04:22.710> that<00:04:23.010> exists<00:04:23.610> in<00:04:23.700> the<00:04:23.790> paradigms<00:04:24.210> and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.760 

once<00:04:27.570> inside<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:28.050> temporal<00:04:28.410> rift<00:04:28.560> I'm

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
once inside the temporal rift I'm

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.470 
once inside the temporal rift I'm
presented<00:04:29.130> with<00:04:29.130> a<00:04:29.280> puzzle<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:30.000> I<00:04:30.060> have<00:04:30.300> to

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
presented with a puzzle that I have to

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480 
presented with a puzzle that I have to
solve<00:04:30.750> in<00:04:31.320> order<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.830> activate<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.370> device

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
solve in order to activate the device

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.900 
solve in order to activate the device
and<00:04:32.940> to<00:04:33.720> close<00:04:33.930> the<00:04:34.110> rift<00:04:34.290> in<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:35.490> case<00:04:35.700> this

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
and to close the rift in this case this

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.280 
and to close the rift in this case this
puzzle<00:04:36.390> I<00:04:36.600> have<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.680> collect<00:04:38.010> these<00:04:38.220> crystals

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
puzzle I have to collect these crystals

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.630 
puzzle I have to collect these crystals
and<00:04:40.290> I<00:04:40.380> have<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.560> collect<00:04:40.800> all<00:04:40.980> of<00:04:41.010> them<00:04:41.310> more

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
and I have to collect all of them more

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.610 
and I have to collect all of them more
embassy<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> exit<00:04:42.570> gate<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.900> truth<00:04:43.260> but

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
embassy to the exit gate the truth but

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.800 
embassy to the exit gate the truth but
as<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.010> can<00:04:44.100> see<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.640> tiles<00:04:45.030> disappear<00:04:45.600> the

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
as you can see the tiles disappear the

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:48.740 
as you can see the tiles disappear the
moment<00:04:45.840> I<00:04:46.140> step<00:04:46.380> off<00:04:46.530> of<00:04:46.740> them<00:04:46.920> so<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.540> to

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
moment I step off of them so I have to

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.030 
moment I step off of them so I have to
once<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.290> puzzles<00:04:49.590> get<00:04:49.710> a<00:04:49.740> little<00:04:49.950> more

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
once the puzzles get a little more

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.670 
once the puzzles get a little more
complicated<00:04:50.400> I<00:04:51.090> have<00:04:51.270> to<00:04:51.450> plan<00:04:51.750> my<00:04:51.990> route<00:04:52.230> so

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
complicated I have to plan my route so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.260 
complicated I have to plan my route so
that<00:04:52.710> I<00:04:52.890> can<00:04:52.950> collect<00:04:53.310> all<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:53.820> crystals<00:04:54.150> that

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
that I can collect all the crystals that

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.480 
that I can collect all the crystals that
still<00:04:54.600> have<00:04:54.750> an<00:04:54.870> exit<00:04:55.170> pack<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:56.130> they<00:04:56.220> start

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
still have an exit pack and they start

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.330 
still have an exit pack and they start
off<00:04:56.640> very<00:04:56.760> simple<00:04:57.480> as<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.660> tutorial<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.680> then

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
off very simple as a tutorial and then

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.800 
off very simple as a tutorial and then
eventually<00:04:59.460> they<00:04:59.880> get<00:05:00.000> a<00:05:00.030> little<00:05:00.480> bit<00:05:00.600> more

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
eventually they get a little bit more

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.040 
eventually they get a little bit more
complicated<00:05:02.450> where<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.570> have<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.870> actually

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
complicated where you have to actually

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.690 
complicated where you have to actually
maneuver<00:05:04.710> just<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:06.810> right<00:05:06.960> direction<00:05:07.700> in

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
maneuver just the right direction in

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.640 
maneuver just the right direction in
order<00:05:08.820> to<00:05:09.030> get<00:05:09.150> through<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:10.170> anomaly<00:05:10.350> has

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
order to get through the anomaly has

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.340 
order to get through the anomaly has
been<00:05:10.740> resolved<00:05:11.060> so<00:05:12.060> now<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.300> device<00:05:13.050> is<00:05:13.200> going

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
been resolved so now the device is going

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
to be activated and Atlas is going to be

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.090 
to be activated and Atlas is going to be
severely<00:05:15.960> weakened<00:05:17.390> and<00:05:18.650> then<00:05:19.650> here's<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.890> fun

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
severely weakened and then here's a fun

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.340 
severely weakened and then here's a fun
little<00:05:20.220> thing<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.760> the<00:05:20.850> Mughal<00:05:21.180> can<00:05:21.330> do<00:05:21.510> as

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
little thing that the Mughal can do as

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.020 
little thing that the Mughal can do as
you<00:05:22.470> can<00:05:22.560> see<00:05:22.710> there<00:05:22.920> it<00:05:23.310> looks<00:05:23.520> like<00:05:23.670> an<00:05:23.790> item

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
you can see there it looks like an item

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.430 
you can see there it looks like an item
box<00:05:24.240> but<00:05:24.870> I<00:05:25.140> can't<00:05:25.500> do<00:05:25.680> anything<00:05:25.860> with<00:05:26.460> it

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
box but I can't do anything with it

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.670 
box but I can't do anything with it
but<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.160> Mughal<00:05:28.460> detects<00:05:28.760> it's<00:05:28.940> there<00:05:29.200> so<00:05:30.200> I'm

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
but the Mughal detects it's there so I'm

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.090 
but the Mughal detects it's there so I'm
going<00:05:30.830> to<00:05:30.860> hit<00:05:31.010> our<00:05:31.250> one<00:05:31.490> with<00:05:31.850> it<00:05:31.970> BRB<00:05:32.570> on<00:05:33.170> the

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
going to hit our one with it BRB on the

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.930 
going to hit our one with it BRB on the
xbox<00:05:34.490> 360<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.270> using<00:05:36.200> those<00:05:36.290> magic<00:05:36.740> and<00:05:37.700> there

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
xbox 360 and using those magic and there

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.960 
xbox 360 and using those magic and there
it<00:05:38.030> is<00:05:38.350> Bujji<00:05:39.370> so<00:05:40.370> there's<00:05:40.550> gonna<00:05:40.640> be<00:05:40.730> a<00:05:40.790> lot<00:05:40.910> of

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
it is Bujji so there's gonna be a lot of

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.730 
it is Bujji so there's gonna be a lot of
hidden<00:05:41.210> items<00:05:41.660> throughout<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.170> maps<00:05:42.380> that

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
hidden items throughout the maps that

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.010 
hidden items throughout the maps that
you<00:05:43.580> will<00:05:43.700> have<00:05:43.790> to<00:05:43.940> use<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.240> Mughal<00:05:44.600> in<00:05:44.780> order

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
you will have to use the Mughal in order

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.020 
you will have to use the Mughal in order
to<00:05:45.170> find

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.270 

so<00:05:48.660> now<00:05:48.810> that<00:05:49.020> atlas<00:05:49.350> has<00:05:49.470> been<00:05:49.650> weakened<00:05:49.980> well

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 
so now that atlas has been weakened well

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.770 
so now that atlas has been weakened well
I'm<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.670> to<00:05:50.730> make<00:05:50.820> my<00:05:50.970> way<00:05:51.000> back<00:05:51.150> over<00:05:51.540> to

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
hands it and hopefully not have to buy

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
too many people in the main rival and

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.060
