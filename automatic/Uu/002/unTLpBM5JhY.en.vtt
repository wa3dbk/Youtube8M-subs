00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.699
 we are a computer generated city which is essential for 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:05.700
 get these proportions 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.720
 It is a city that is ideal but 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.689
 good in buildings have things added 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.399
 and it's a kind 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:15.399
 of strange reality 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.529
 Esteve I wanted to build a common cave 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.970
 an authentic caves 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.519
 and the thing and dantesca 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.470
 it's not that you can see it appear in a car where there is a laboratory an area of 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.469
 wardrobe and the laboratory of algete 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.870
 he what is important when it comes to building the cave 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.390
 and that it looked like stone 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.390
 but with architecture entity 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.390
 suggesting disaster 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 junÃ­n that before that aspect of the movies 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.650
 the fact that someone wrote an idea suddenly 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.560
 workshops 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.710
 fifty different artists working on 50 plots of it and if you 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.800
 you find a gigantic decoration 3 action 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.050
 the differences are some of the stars of the movie 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.570
 with so many effects of action in a movie so the scientist 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.080
 becomes a fundamental tool so that I can coordinate the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.680
 work especially by specialists 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.120
 that if I have to appear there cage and the car will hit haiti and so 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.310
 elaborate a kind of choreography now I think the only thing that is missing 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.840
 for melzer to come 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 that his margin in the city but bury me spread by internet in 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.220
 the Cuba of fidel 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.220
 they throw me from a helicopter 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.870
 Saturday 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.080
 Cristina of the times when she thinks about enjoying 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.080
 that's why I benzema 20 kilos of cocaine 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.430
 swing and cross 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.840
 such is so hard 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.510
 as it seems it is without a doubt 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.510
 and also you want a girl it was very difficult and you had to repeat a lot 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.200
 I never got it right and I had to apologize unrepeatable 18% 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.389
 millions will come more very well from peace 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.589
 phoenix 

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:15.739
 we had to tell us a lot about the movie helsinki 17 men of mechel 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.879
 I would like to say that my interest is why 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.839
 A) Yes 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.389
 p 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.689
 when we have time to perfect the scene it will be great 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.859
 but with so many special effects the truth is that you could only do one 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.189
 taking 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.859
 there were about three hours of preparations in each scene so if then the bayo 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:42.559
 and he said yes I think he's not kidding we could not do it from another 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:44.919
 shape 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.179
 it's over and chile 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:49.119
 by what must be done 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:52.119
 I've passed him in front of the 7 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.720
 he cut is the perfect person to direct a movie without 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.099
 because it is tolerant and fun is to create a very good environment 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.669
 makes people participate 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.889
 always speaks with all team members and this responsibility and makes 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.869
 everything is considered important 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:19.209
 whereupon everything is proud of what it does 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.360
 I need a relaxed and fun environment to work, let's beat 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.020
 I like that there is a very open dish harmony in the sense that everyone 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.819
 can do or suggestions 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.590
 what we were trying to do during the shooting day is to get something 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.190
 in a certain moment in the middle of all the effects that go 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.549
 beyond covering this day 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.349
 now 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.369
 we gave the car a more focused look on the physiognomy of a 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.969
 bat 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.859
 had some kind of ribs on the sides 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.989
 something that I really wanted 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.989
 because the ribs of bats are something very unique 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:17.239
 later and we added an interior lighting that if it gave the feeling 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.269
 that I was breathing 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.090
 the defensive gadgets were the most entertaining thing to do 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.780
 because it was fun to make any idea that could arise 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.050
 kevin rose began to elaborate some amazing prototypes milestones of 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.009
 they worked 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.099
 objects like the bat bolus that throws them and leaves the bad guys tied by the feet 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:38.729
 until the police arrive 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.729
 everything is designed to look like a pot 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.490
 hold on 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.490
 caused even a blowtorch that is happy couple 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.059
 there are Catalans of various titles 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:52.199
 we have the throwing batarang 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.199
 a high tech batarang 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:59.229
 mechanisms and actions 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.569
 ccoo we also have the batarang cannon that it carries in the arm 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:06.569
 and consists of a series of small battles 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.139
 robin gets some of the gadgets 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.389
 bullfighting such an avalanche and is done with the batmobile for some time 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.899
 but I think that over the years they will leave more junk 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.409
 Maybe yes 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.830
 if he behaves well 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.979
 who worked for a man who taught him to love to leave the cane 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:37.360
 I broke a lot of canes I was carrying a cane every hour at all hours 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.110
 I need tomÃ¡s towers 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.449
 lotus kerman and tomÃ¡s towers people came to my house and I already agreed but 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.430
 they would bend over and pass them over, taking it over was really fun when 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.430
 became part of the character that interests them 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.699
 I hope we have managed to recreate the experience 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.839
 to read those comics 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.949
 and the feeling you had 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:04.060
 when we approach the kiosk to buy the last number 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:08.449
 with a batman movie there's always a lot of speculation about 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.719
 and who will act and what role will play 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.719
 I had never been in a movie follows and it's exciting 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:18.430
 I remember when I saw the first batman but if this is true scare is 

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:19.970
 surprising that actually 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.970
 and now being part of that tradition is great 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.860
 before I started shooting I thought 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.860
 this is going to be the most difficult task of my life 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.360
 but I've never had so much fun 

00:06:35.059 --> 00:06:38.059
 the children had the Bataan croatian pact before them 

00:06:38.589 --> 00:06:39.589
 why 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:41.550
 Irati pour see 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.349
 your eyes and your total concentration but it does not matter because you have to follow them 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:47.699
 I was interested 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:49.439
 neither alive nor anything 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.889
 sortu the image 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.719
 people loved it 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:53.919
 that's clear 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:55.979
 has not stopped succeeding is a classic 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:56.430
 has resisted
