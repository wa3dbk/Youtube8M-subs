00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello how about friends of youtube health 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.639
 let the bow speak one 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.790
 I have here a thermal fuse of a 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.840
 microwave oven brand keith 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:19.720
 moore that was stirring a few days ago 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:24.189
 is damaged does not work as they can 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.220
 see this burned this has even the 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.199
 plastic burned here in the terminal and 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.410
 I will try to repair this fuse 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.870
 thermal already in the past I repaired 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.720
 some I do not know if this one can repair it 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.110
 but I'm going to try what I'm going to do 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:46.480
 it is first thoroughly clean the 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:51.360
 terminal and then I'm going to make a 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:55.260
 small this a little little hole 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.060
 to see if I can get it to work 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.450
 this 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.580
 thermal fuse 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.770
 then we are going to try it so that they look 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.310
 that to see that they do not work I have 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:09.720
 here a continuity tester with some 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 Christmas lights 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.500
 let's touch the terminals here 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.220
 and how can you see then the light is 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.340
 Christmas does not really turn on 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 I have here one that is good and then 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.700
 they are going to see the Christmas lights 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.700
 they light 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.420
 I think that if you can look at the background 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.030
 well then I will try to repair 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.030
 this thermal fuse 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.140
 I'm going to scrape here with a razor 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.140
 clean what burned 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.209
 d 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.260
 but here clean as much as possible 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.849
 and the burned of the plastic in the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.030
 terminal now by simple curiosity I'm going 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.189
 I'm going to try it, it's not going to be that 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.189
 the cleaning manages to work 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.320
 we're going to try it 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:33.230
 ok well it still does not work then I'm going 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.230
 I'm going to proceed to do a little hole 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 I regularly do it with a very 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.820
 thin but in this case the witch 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.180
 I broke up between I do not have then but 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.890
 I have here a tip solder type 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.150
 pretty thin needle and with this you 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.150
 I'm going to make a little hole 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.800
 ajn 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.870
 it's pretty hard 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.550
 the problem is that he is doing 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:31.180
 pretty cold and maybe that's the reason why 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.180
 which I can not get a hole made 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:42.750
 but I'm going to turn off the camera and then 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.750
 I teach when I make the little hole 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 I already managed to make a hole here now 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:54.300
 I'm going to put in here a pretty screwdriver 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.310
 delgadito and start 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.310
 make movements in the inside 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.850
 I do not know if they can see that suddenly 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:08.850
 and they lit the little lights 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.590
 today we are going to put another one thinner 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.979
 or not 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.580
 I want to get it off because 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.560
 with the rise of heat the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.139
 thermostat on the inside and 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.919
 I want to see if I can get it to take off and 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:43.919
 get activated 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:55.280
 as you can see 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.280
 I am already slowly achieving this 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.709
 that this possible thermal is activated 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.590
 it's a matter of a little patience I do not know if 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.420
 they can see that the lights are 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:13.560
 turning on 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.560
 dotted here 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:19.960
 the thing is what I want is to get that 

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:24.030
 is already activated this 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.030
 thermal fuse
