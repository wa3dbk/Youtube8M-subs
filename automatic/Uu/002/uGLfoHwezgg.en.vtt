00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
 Well here we have the famous socks of 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.200
 old lady that are the ones used to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.260
 cover something very nice called by grass 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.600
 called dolly and well what happens when 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.700
 you already wear more than three stockings 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 start fingers like what I do here and 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.360
 there is no where you have to do the 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.710
 true is the good thing I'm going to 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.240
 teach how to make 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.580
 there are stockings that came prepared that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 they bring in the tip or the heels 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.330
 means are those that come complete 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 well we are going to make a little trap what 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.410
 only thing that we are going to do is the curvita 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.680
 that we are going to take the account and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.680
 is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.280
 in this way we are going to remove the little tip 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.280
 at 2 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.010
 and I will teach the only thing that has to 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.129
 do is grab your client and they will 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.729
 take in this part of here he how wide 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.020
 of his from his foot the account that here 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.890
 it leaves more than a little more 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 tight not much because then then it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.630
 it's going to tighten up and it does not give 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.759
 mind that is here I'm worth I'm going to 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.159
 remove this bit from there and more or 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.990
 less so everyone has different the 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.090
 size is told a kid who had 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.950
 his foot give me chito if he had done 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.080
 to my measure because when it was not 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.160
 tight tight the only thing that is is like this already 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.039
 they cut the little circle is that the area 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.679
 I waved good here and I will 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:41.200
 take to the machine to sing here 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.800
 It would be and I will cut two pieces 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.800
 same 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.480
 do not leave Me 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.480
 our work 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.970
 minute relax 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.910
 because here we already have the measure 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 marked in our model the only thing that 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.649
 I'm going to do is this and cut two pieces 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.120
 same that obviously is for a 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.060
 only average but how am I going to fix it? 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.270
 three of them, I'm going to cut six pieces 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.270
 same 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.270
 but in the camera nothing else I'm going to show 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.270
 a 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.510
 name should be mentioned because the rules 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.560
 shut your eyes 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.560
 that is already 6 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.170
 but as we said nothing else I'm going to cope 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.550
 the first two so that they do not eat of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.410
 the battery right now they put it in the 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.750
 machine the only thing I'm going to do the 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.550
 rector I put the rectum like for things 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.810
 anything else 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.810
 next to the two of the little ones 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.440
 rick 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.370
 nothing more to see in the pieces 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.240
 because this machine that has the 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.700
 large machines has to be with 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.010
 zigzag that's why I'm using this 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.220
 I like the zig zag more than the one on the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.220
 side 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.160
 whenever I put things like that they carry 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.640
 elastic the first to the machine 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.640
 little 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.700
 product 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.120
 in other things in the apple patita to 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.250
 catania 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.230
 I do not know why else 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.400
 that cut the leftovers to stay 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.400
 with the pure bracelet 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.860
 and since the media is new, it already has 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.780
 marked here the edges those some of 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.380
 the two benches on one side although 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.090
 this is so can put in the middle for 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.280
 what is left or either here up or here 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.420
 down 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.340
 random 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.340
 stretching what little part s 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.450
 while little zig zag 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.710
 54 what I'm going to do is throw the average 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.620
 more than the elastic because the elastic 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.240
 we are talking about the average but the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.210
 mean we are already burned and as for 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.910
 fishing already stretched what is the average 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.729
 that the same distance as the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.300
 elastic 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.860
 then you will reach there is ok to 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.870
 know how much I 'm going to stretch 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.059
 it has to be the same size 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.610
 the measurement arrives elastic although already a 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.090
 Once I'm there I no longer put it on 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.220
 straight here 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.530
 personal right rest because they are 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.690
 working accept and pull very little 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.200
 because if I stretch then it's going to be very 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.570
 watery 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.160
 no more is for them to leave 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.320
 being the same machine to what I 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.270
 find in the machine work here not 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.370
 I'm stretching nothing more as I said 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.120
 pull out this elastic at the same size 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.120
 that the measure 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.440
 the transit 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.930
 we could leave it blue and it's not going to happen 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.270
 absolutely nothing but suddenly you can 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.060
 that will make the white shores 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.160
 below the average and then you will not see 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.410
 well that's why what you want to do since 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.600
 it looks like that look on that side you can not see it 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.540
 It looks bad if there is not one per little hill 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.060
 nothing will happen like that they can leave but 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.979
 as a precaution for safety is much 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.390
 better if you give it a second pass and you 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.400
 throws in a second fold 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.150
 he did not tempt me and they keep doing 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.150
 exactly the same 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:33.900
 because I only took out the battery but 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.280
 as we say nothing else is a matter of 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.280
 give him the second pass 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.800
 I'm hurrying because I already knew that I 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.139
 was going to reach and camera battery not 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.139
 I was ready for this tutorial 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:07:00.940
 a ready rivet 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:04.240
 since since the leftovers and here 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.449
 we already have the half list to get 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:09.009
 ok and that goes on and there will not be 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.690
 no problem that thing because the 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.819
 stockings they put the first here the 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.500
 second and the third here and already the average 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:16.030
 of sand more on the tips and the 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.220
 only one that will squeeze you in the middle of 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.810
 network and these three are not going to 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.759
 press and go more comfortable 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.250
 comfortable and they will endure all night 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.470
 so even without makeup because we 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.470
 we give ready for this yes
