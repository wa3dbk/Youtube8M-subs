the<00:00:37.500> orchid<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.399> will<00:00:38.520> extend<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:39.180> it

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the orchid and it will extend up it

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.450 
the orchid and it will extend up it
could<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.110> longer<00:00:40.379> or<00:00:40.620> shorter<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:41.250> just

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
could be longer or shorter it just

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.250 
could be longer or shorter it just
depends<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> orchid<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> thing<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
depends on the orchid but the thing is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.470 
depends on the orchid but the thing is
it<00:00:43.710> has<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> possibility<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:45.059> continue

it has the possibility to continue

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.959 
it has the possibility to continue
blooming<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.770> several<00:00:47.280> months<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> some

growth even if it already has some
blooms<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.550> an<00:00:56.670> example<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.510> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
blooms and I have an example here of a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
blooms and I have an example here of a
flower<00:00:58.020> spike<00:00:58.410> which<00:00:58.649> stopped<00:00:59.070> growing<00:00:59.399> at

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
flower spike which stopped growing at

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.840 
flower spike which stopped growing at
some<00:00:59.879> point<00:01:00.260> produce<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.530> flowers<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> then

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
some point produce this flowers and then

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
some point produce this flowers and then
it<00:01:03.180> started<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> grow<00:01:03.899> some<00:01:04.170> new<00:01:04.199> buds<00:01:04.710> once

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
it started to grow some new buds once

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.880 
it started to grow some new buds once
again<00:01:05.519> from<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> tip<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.810> spike<00:01:07.080> now<00:01:07.680> in

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
again from the tip of the spike now in

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.130 
again from the tip of the spike now in
this<00:01:08.100> case<00:01:08.400> obviously<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.299> don't<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.869> cut

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
this case obviously we don't have to cut

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
this case obviously we don't have to cut
anything<00:01:10.409> we<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> sit<00:01:11.820> back<00:01:11.850> and

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

enjoy the beautiful blooms this orchid

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.370 
enjoy the beautiful blooms this orchid
will<00:01:14.310> produce<00:01:14.490> further<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.180> now<00:01:16.020> there<00:01:16.229> are

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
will produce further on now there are

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.170 
will produce further on now there are
some<00:01:16.619> different<00:01:17.009> cases<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> which<00:01:17.939> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
some different cases in which the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.719 
some different cases in which the
flowers<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:19.049> start<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.530> fade<00:01:19.740> away<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
flowers will start to fade away and the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.730 
flowers will start to fade away and the
orchid<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.509> lose<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.900> its<00:01:22.080> flowers<00:01:22.500> but

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
orchid will lose all its flowers but

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.920 
orchid will lose all its flowers but
then<00:01:22.979> continue<00:01:23.640> growth<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.420> tip<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then continue growth from the tip of the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.230 
then continue growth from the tip of the
flower<00:01:25.140> spike<00:01:25.560> you'll<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.340> another<00:01:26.759> spray

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
flower spike you'll have another spray

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.719 
flower spike you'll have another spray
of<00:01:27.420> beautiful<00:01:27.930> blooms<00:01:28.229> in<00:01:28.409> no<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.920> again<00:01:29.490> in

of beautiful blooms in no time again in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
of beautiful blooms in no time again in
this<00:01:29.850> case<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.479> actually<00:01:30.689> have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.020> cut

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
this case we don't actually have to cut

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
this case we don't actually have to cut
anything<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.280> enjoy<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.820> new<00:01:32.970> blooms

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
that will sprout from the tip of this

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
that will sprout from the tip of this
flower<00:01:35.070> spike<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:36.540> not<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.900> only

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
flower spike but they're not the only

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.899 
flower spike but they're not the only
thing<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.619> orchid<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.070> produce<00:01:38.369> from<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> tip

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909

thing an orchid can produce from the tip
of<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.180> flower<00:01:39.390> spike<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.950> an

of the flower spike and I have here an

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
of the flower spike and I have here an
example<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.850> an<00:01:41.970> orchid<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.360> produced<00:01:42.869> a

small little plant lid called keiki
now<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.899> ke<00:01:46.170> needs<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> stay<00:01:47.009> attached<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
now this ke needs to stay attached to

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.219 
now this ke needs to stay attached to
the<00:01:47.670> mother<00:01:47.850> plant<00:01:48.210> until<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.810> will<00:01:48.990> produce

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
the mother plant until you will produce

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.889 
the mother plant until you will produce
a<00:01:49.590> root<00:01:49.860> system<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.340> its<00:01:50.490> own<00:01:50.700> which<00:01:51.450> will<00:01:51.659> take

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
a root system of its own which will take

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.230 
a root system of its own which will take
up<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.619> years<00:01:52.649> or<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.430> in<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.030> meantime

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
up to two years or so in the meantime

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
up to two years or so in the meantime
though<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> surprised<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.159> get

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
though you can have the surprised to get

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.940 
though you can have the surprised to get
a<00:01:56.369> flower<00:01:56.670> spike<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> cake<00:01:57.719> itself<00:01:58.290> so

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
a flower spike from the cake itself so

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
a flower spike from the cake itself so
in<00:01:59.040> conclusion<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> healthy

orchid and the tip of the flower spike
has<00:02:03.030> not<00:02:03.210> started<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.719> dry<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.290> can<00:02:04.320> just

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
has not started to dry you can just

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.709 
has not started to dry you can just
leave<00:02:04.920> them<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.399> get<00:02:05.790> some<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.180> buds<00:02:06.450> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
leave them and get some more buds and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.570 
leave them and get some more buds and
flowers<00:02:06.899> out<00:02:07.290> of<00:02:07.320> your<00:02:07.560> orchid<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.190> even

want to try to get another blooming from
your<00:02:21.330> Phalaenopsis<00:02:21.960> orchid<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.500> can<00:02:22.980> do

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
your Phalaenopsis orchid you can do

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.490 
your Phalaenopsis orchid you can do
something<00:02:23.700> so<00:02:24.300> if<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> soar<00:02:24.900> kid<00:02:25.140> wouldn't

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
something so if the soar kid wouldn't

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.320 
something so if the soar kid wouldn't
have<00:02:25.680> produced<00:02:26.130> any<00:02:26.340> more<00:02:26.520> flowers<00:02:26.910> from<00:02:27.150> the

have produced any more flowers from the
tip<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.050> would<00:02:28.560> cut<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.040> flower<00:02:29.310> spike

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
tip here I would cut this flower spike

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.020 
tip here I would cut this flower spike
just<00:02:30.300> above<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.110> final<00:02:31.650> note<00:02:31.950> before<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
just above the final note before the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.420 
just above the final note before the
flowers<00:02:33.420> started<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.110> appear<00:02:34.530> for<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.220> you

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
flowers started to appear for this you

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.550 
flowers started to appear for this you
would<00:02:35.550> need<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.820> sterilized<00:02:36.510> scissors<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.410> can

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
would need a sterilized scissors you can

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.100 
would need a sterilized scissors you can
use<00:02:37.740> alcohol<00:02:38.280> or<00:02:38.460> even<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.910> flame<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.450> cut

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
use alcohol or even a flame and cut

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.130 
use alcohol or even a flame and cut
about<00:02:40.350> one<00:02:40.500> centimeter<00:02:41.130> above<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.390> last<00:02:42.630> node

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
about one centimeter above the last node

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.890 
about one centimeter above the last node
you<00:02:43.410> see<00:02:43.650> here<00:02:44.010> now<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.850> some<00:02:45.120> cases<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you see here now in some cases the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440 
you see here now in some cases the
orchid<00:02:46.230> will<00:02:46.410> produce<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:47.010> side<00:02:47.310> shot<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:48.240> this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
orchid will produce a side shot but this

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.750 
orchid will produce a side shot but this
won't<00:02:48.750> happen<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.350> every<00:02:49.650> case<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.640> want

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
won't happen in every case if you want

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.430 
won't happen in every case if you want
to<00:02:50.910> give<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.750> your<00:02:51.930> orchid<00:02:52.320> is

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
to give it a go and your orchid is

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160 
to give it a go and your orchid is
healthy<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.370> cut<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.880> just<00:02:54.060> above<00:02:54.720> here

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
healthy you can cut it just above here

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.380 
healthy you can cut it just above here
if<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:56.250> orchid<00:02:56.550> decides<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.180> produce

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
if the orchid decides to produce

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.540 
if the orchid decides to produce
something<00:02:57.810> from<00:02:58.200> this<00:02:58.380> note<00:02:58.620> here<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.160> can<00:02:59.400> be

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
something from this note here it can be

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.699 
something from this note here it can be
either<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.940> flower<00:03:00.270> spike<00:03:00.690> which<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.140> most

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
either a flower spike which is most

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.830 
either a flower spike which is most
often<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.280> happens<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.690> also

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
often what happens but it can also

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.140 
often what happens but it can also
produce<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.590> little<00:03:04.920> keiki<00:03:05.520> which<00:03:05.940> will

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
produce a little keiki which will

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.090 
produce a little keiki which will
develop<00:03:06.420> similarly<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.680> one<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.040> I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
develop similarly to the one that I

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.490 
develop similarly to the one that I
showed<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.420> earlier<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.840> that<00:03:10.020> sprouted

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
showed you earlier the one that sprouted

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.520 
showed you earlier the one that sprouted
from<00:03:10.620> the<00:03:10.709> tip<00:03:11.010> of<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.400> flower<00:03:11.790> spike<00:03:12.150> here<00:03:12.530> so

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
from the tip of the flower spike here so

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.259 
from the tip of the flower spike here so
the<00:03:13.709> mother<00:03:13.890> plant<00:03:14.220> will<00:03:14.459> feed<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:14.880> keiki

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
the mother plant will feed the keiki

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.180 
the mother plant will feed the keiki
until<00:03:15.660> it<00:03:15.840> will<00:03:15.959> produce<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.440> root<00:03:16.650> system<00:03:16.860> of

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
until it will produce a root system of

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.220 
until it will produce a root system of
its<00:03:17.310> own<00:03:17.519> at<00:03:17.760> which<00:03:18.330> point<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.140> be

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
its own at which point it can be

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.380 
its own at which point it can be
separated<00:03:19.860> from<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.220> mother<00:03:20.340> plant<00:03:20.489> by

separated from the mother plant by

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.110 
separated from the mother plant by
cutting<00:03:21.870> the<00:03:21.989> flower<00:03:22.200> spike<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:23.580> below<00:03:23.940> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
cutting the flower spike right below the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.509

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
towards the base of the orchid you can

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.780 
towards the base of the orchid you can
actually<00:03:33.570> cut<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.290> flower<00:03:34.530> spike<00:03:34.950> as<00:03:35.160> close

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
actually cut this flower spike as close

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.270 
actually cut this flower spike as close
to<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> base<00:03:36.300> as<00:03:36.330> possible<00:03:36.709> how<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.769> cut<00:03:38.160> the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
to the base as possible how to cut the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.680 
to the base as possible how to cut the
flower<00:03:38.519> spike<00:03:38.940> will<00:03:39.150> actually<00:03:39.510> depend

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
flower spike will actually depend

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.140 
flower spike will actually depend
firstly<00:03:40.560> on<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.950> health<00:03:41.160> of<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.400> orchid<00:03:41.970> as

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
firstly on the health of the orchid as

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.690 
firstly on the health of the orchid as
well<00:03:42.690> as<00:03:42.840> your<00:03:43.019> personal<00:03:43.500> preference<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.580> if

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
well as your personal preference now if

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.820 
well as your personal preference now if
you<00:03:44.790> have<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.060> healthy<00:03:45.510> orchid<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.140> can<00:03:46.530> try<00:03:46.769> to

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
you have a healthy orchid you can try to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.470 
you have a healthy orchid you can try to
induce<00:03:47.310> another<00:03:47.550> blooming<00:03:48.180> on<00:03:48.330> your

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
induce another blooming on your

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.390 
induce another blooming on your
Phalaenopsis<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.470> most<00:03:49.709> probably<00:03:50.040> the

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
Phalaenopsis and most probably the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.100 
Phalaenopsis and most probably the
orchid<00:03:50.730> will<00:03:50.880> be<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.209> fine<00:03:51.450> but<00:03:51.750> if<00:03:51.870> you're

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
orchid will be just fine but if you're

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.740 
orchid will be just fine but if you're
dealing<00:03:52.380> with<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.739> very<00:03:53.000> dehydrated<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.150> sick

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
dealing with a very dehydrated and sick

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.290 
dealing with a very dehydrated and sick
orchid<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.470> would<00:03:56.070> suggest<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.880> cut<00:03:57.150> the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
orchid I would suggest you cut the

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.420 
orchid I would suggest you cut the
flower<00:03:57.510> spike<00:03:57.870> all<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.410> way<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.860> base<00:03:59.100> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
flower spike all the way to the base I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.970 
flower spike all the way to the base I
like<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.360> do<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:00.959> it<00:04:01.470> leaves<00:04:01.739> more

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
like to do this because it leaves more

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.220 
like to do this because it leaves more
energy<00:04:02.550> for<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.880> orchid<00:04:03.239> to<00:04:03.660> focus<00:04:04.080> on

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
energy for the orchid to focus on

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.789 
energy for the orchid to focus on
producing<00:04:04.739> new<00:04:05.010> roots<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.549> new<00:04:06.120> leaves<00:04:06.390> if

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
producing new roots and new leaves if

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.650 
producing new roots and new leaves if
the<00:04:07.799> flower<00:04:08.010> spike<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.640> sick<00:04:08.910> orchid<00:04:09.390> tries

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the flower spike on a sick orchid tries

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.020 
the flower spike on a sick orchid tries
to<00:04:09.900> produce<00:04:10.110> even<00:04:10.470> more<00:04:10.590> blooms<00:04:11.130> or<00:04:11.370> worse<00:04:11.700> a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
to produce even more blooms or worse a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.690 
to produce even more blooms or worse a
keiki<00:04:12.600> you're<00:04:13.200> gonna<00:04:13.470> have<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.739> very<00:04:14.070> energy

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
keiki you're gonna have a very energy

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.330 
keiki you're gonna have a very energy
depleted<00:04:15.060> orchid<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.870> possibly<00:04:16.770> it's<00:04:17.160> going

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
depleted orchid and possibly it's going

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.440 
depleted orchid and possibly it's going
to<00:04:17.400> be<00:04:17.520> dead<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:17.760> no<00:04:17.910> time

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
to be dead in no time

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.620 
to be dead in no time
so<00:04:19.290> if<00:04:19.380> your<00:04:19.560> orchid<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.250> Limpy<00:04:20.910> like<00:04:21.090> this<00:04:21.360> or

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
so if your orchid is Limpy like this or

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.810 
so if your orchid is Limpy like this or
it<00:04:21.810> doesn't<00:04:22.080> have<00:04:22.380> too<00:04:22.650> many<00:04:22.830> roots<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.370> would

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
it doesn't have too many roots I would

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.670 
it doesn't have too many roots I would
strongly<00:04:24.120> suggest<00:04:24.450> you<00:04:24.870> cut<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.440> flower

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
strongly suggest you cut the flower

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.040 
strongly suggest you cut the flower
spikes<00:04:26.070> even<00:04:26.610> if<00:04:26.820> they<00:04:26.970> still<00:04:27.330> have<00:04:27.570> flowers

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
spikes even if they still have flowers

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.200 
spikes even if they still have flowers
on<00:04:28.260> them<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.860> give<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.190> orchid<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.580> chance<00:04:29.880> to

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
on them to give the orchid a chance to

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.450 
on them to give the orchid a chance to
focus<00:04:30.420> energy<00:04:30.810> on<00:04:31.320> more<00:04:31.770> important<00:04:32.400> things

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
focus energy on more important things

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.880 
focus energy on more important things
next<00:04:33.420> season<00:04:33.900> or<00:04:34.020> when<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:34.470> orchid<00:04:34.770> is

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
next season or when the orchid is

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.470 
next season or when the orchid is
healthy<00:04:35.340> again<00:04:35.580> you're<00:04:36.000> going<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.270> have<00:04:36.450> a

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
healthy again you're going to have a

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.750 
healthy again you're going to have a
beautiful<00:04:37.080> display<00:04:37.290> of<00:04:37.440> flowers<00:04:37.920> once<00:04:38.160> again

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
beautiful display of flowers once again

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.390 
beautiful display of flowers once again
now<00:04:39.210> many<00:04:39.450> orchid<00:04:39.900> lovers<00:04:40.230> including<00:04:40.920> myself

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
now many orchid lovers including myself

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.790 
now many orchid lovers including myself
like<00:04:41.760> to<00:04:41.790> cut<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.390> flower<00:04:42.600> spike<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.440> base

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
like to cut the flower spike to the base

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.310 
like to cut the flower spike to the base
and<00:04:44.010> not<00:04:44.520> try<00:04:44.850> to<00:04:44.880> induce<00:04:45.390> another<00:04:45.630> side

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
and not try to induce another side

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.350 
and not try to induce another side
blooming<00:04:46.890> and<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.520> is<00:04:47.670> because<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.120> side

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
blooming and this is because the side

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.510 
blooming and this is because the side
blooms<00:04:48.840> don't<00:04:49.260> necessarily<00:04:49.710> look<00:04:49.890> as<00:04:50.100> good<00:04:50.340> as

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
blooms don't necessarily look as good as

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.120 
blooms don't necessarily look as good as
the<00:04:50.850> initial<00:04:51.300> blows<00:04:51.540> maybe<00:04:52.260> we'll<00:04:52.590> have<00:04:52.770> just

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
the initial blows maybe we'll have just

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.510 
the initial blows maybe we'll have just
a<00:04:53.280> few<00:04:53.310> flowers<00:04:53.910> maybe<00:04:54.330> they<00:04:54.570> will<00:04:54.690> be<00:04:54.900> tinier

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
a few flowers maybe they will be tinier

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.130 
a few flowers maybe they will be tinier
but<00:04:56.520> we<00:04:56.760> believe<00:04:57.120> that<00:04:57.420> by<00:04:57.600> cutting<00:04:57.900> the

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
but we believe that by cutting the

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.290 
but we believe that by cutting the
flower<00:04:58.350> spike<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:59.040> the<00:04:59.220> base<00:04:59.430> after<00:05:00.150> the

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
flower spike to the base after the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.970 
flower spike to the base after the
blooms<00:05:00.540> are<00:05:00.750> done<00:05:00.960> and<00:05:01.140> letting<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.650> orchid

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
blooms are done and letting the orchid

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.610 
blooms are done and letting the orchid

focus on healthy and vigorous growth

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.160 
focus on healthy and vigorous growth
will<00:05:05.010> produce<00:05:05.340> a<00:05:05.730> better<00:05:06.300> blooming<00:05:06.810> next

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
will produce a better blooming next

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.560 
will produce a better blooming next
