worse<00:01:31.110> overclocking<00:01:31.710> chip<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.240> start

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
worse overclocking chip so let's start

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
worse overclocking chip so let's start
by<00:01:33.720> having<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:34.200> at<00:01:34.409> what<00:01:34.560> kind<00:01:34.799> of<00:01:34.890> changed

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
by having a look at what kind of changed

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
by having a look at what kind of changed
is<00:01:35.460> they<00:01:35.670> they've<00:01:36.180> made<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.900> board<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
is they they've made to the board so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.039 
is they they've made to the board so
they're<00:01:38.100> saying<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.759> their<00:01:38.939> official<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.750> air

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
they're saying on their official an air

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
they're saying on their official an air
official<00:01:40.470> website<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.009> they've<00:01:41.400> used<00:01:41.430> two

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
official website that they've used two

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.889 
official website that they've used two
ounces<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> copper<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.899> their<00:01:43.049> PCBs<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.899> as

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
ounces of copper in their PCBs and as

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.100 
ounces of copper in their PCBs and as
well<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.259> solid<00:01:46.530> capacitors<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.780> MOSFET<00:01:48.780> was

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
well as solid capacitors and MOSFET was

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.749 
well as solid capacitors and MOSFET was
used<00:01:50.360> ferried<00:01:51.360> core<00:01:51.630> chokes<00:01:51.960> as<00:01:52.290> well<00:01:52.770> all

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
used ferried core chokes as well all

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.740 
used ferried core chokes as well all
sounds<00:01:54.270> nice<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:56.159> don't<00:01:56.729> see<00:01:56.909> any<00:01:57.149> thinning

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
sounds nice but I don't see any thinning

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.660 
sounds nice but I don't see any thinning
information<00:01:58.350> about<00:01:58.710> changes<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> power

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
information about changes to the power

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
information about changes to the power
face<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.450> assume<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.320> power<00:02:01.860> face<00:02:02.219> remains

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
face I assume that power face remains

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.150 
face I assume that power face remains
the<00:02:02.969> same<00:02:03.329> as<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.320> reference<00:02:04.469> design<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> yeah

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the same as the reference design so yeah

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.479 
the same as the reference design so yeah
that<00:02:09.149> kind<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.479> thing<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:10.379> will<00:02:10.739> probably<00:02:11.069> see

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that kind of thing we will probably see

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.510 
that kind of thing we will probably see
changed<00:02:12.000> in

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
changed in

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.150 
changed in
not<00:02:13.390> probably<00:02:13.780> but<00:02:14.020> definitely<00:02:14.470> changed<00:02:14.860> in

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
not probably but definitely changed in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
megahertz on memory so there you go that

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.760 
megahertz on memory so there you go that
was<00:03:30.880> quite<00:03:31.240> nice<00:03:31.450> and<00:03:31.780> interesting<00:03:32.140> to<00:03:32.590> work

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
was quite nice and interesting to work

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.220 
was quite nice and interesting to work
with<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:35.220> yeah<00:03:36.220> so<00:03:36.520> basically<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.870> it
