00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.250
 I started 6 years old so 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.079
 at the start fun in a gym school 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 g 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.379
 conceding a small club so suddenly 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.750
 I changed a lot because at each 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.239
 times I could not find what 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.370
 I was waiting I stayed nine seasons at 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.940
 toulouse so to the gymnastic momentum of 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
 joke 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.890
 then I did my training be2 ​​on 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.090
 the france pole of marseille 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.340
 so that's where I discovered a little 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.830
 at the level so I realized that this is what 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.660
 which interested me for reasons 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.120
 I moved to Bordeaux 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.610
 so there I was employed on villenave 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.900
 Ornon next to Bordeaux 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.970
 and there I developed the sector 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.550
 performance and 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.230
 try to put close conditions 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.490
 high level with schedules 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.460
 arranged and therefore following the departure 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.189
 of the Chinese couple here on 10 people m have 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.340
 contacted to tell me that they would have 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.820
 here is a job profile that I 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 looking 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.440
 me what I really like this is 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.360
 small compared to the detection it's 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.360
 the stars in the eyes the motivation 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.340
 we feel that really for her the gym 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.370
 it's a lot after even if there are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.260
 small physical qualities a lack of 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.330
 flexibility 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.610
 I think that it can work and 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.270
 I think the greatest qualities 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.530
 it's this desire and wanting to come all 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.460
 the days to train because it's 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.020
 still a sport that is very 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.240
 difficult and which requires an overtaking 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.730
 out of the ordinary compared to 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.440
 emotional sure whether it's the beam where 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.190
 the bars and habits of the schemes 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.050
 end 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.900
 unusual what a tale is 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.810
 completely different from other sports 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.690
 and I think 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:21.780
 motivation is the greatest of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.890
 qualities what they have a double project 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.660
 in principle they are almost all 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.580
 congratulated at school which facilitates us 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.050
 still relations with the school 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.110
 because we have known too much 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.099
 yes bah you're good to the gym and that's 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.180
 that you 're not good at school then 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.680
 that that the opposite 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.110
 most of them are congratulated she 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.269
 works excellently well really 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.819
 each quarter therefore advertises 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.980
 priority is school and in high school 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.750
 for their hobbies it's gymnastics 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.330
 hoping they reach the team 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.069
 of France we had five international 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.330
 this year so here it is to put them 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.400
 in France team this is the goal 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.450
 of a different pole a club is 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.730
 really put them in France team 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.349
 be it the team of france hopes 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.150
 was young or clips of France 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.190
 juniors and seniors down close to 100 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.190
 the insep so but less concerned
