00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.099
 so yes yes hello sir I was 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.059
 victim makes some sort of mistake 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.009
 police this summer and in the sense that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.509
 I was wrongly arrested and suddenly the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.600
 word wrongly and there is no 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.410
 wrongly control are reminded controls 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 setback against the Copts 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.250
 so I was checked on the 14th of July 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.449
 last one I happen to be in 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.670
 smoking a firecracker thrown into the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.960
 street and I was reproached for 14.8 on a 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 glitch in the street while it's tolerated 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.529
 seoul and no wait wait we're going 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.989
 cut short all the ideas received 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.649
 of a block there is no tolerance as to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.480
 the smoke 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.520
 that's what of course everything is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 then I do not know I have not 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.120
 to pour out a no but you have products 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.489
 toxic you consume it you're a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.680
 drug addict that is July 14 the day before 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.090
 of the capture of the clearing bastille 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.379
 no but that I agree well then 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 after when are you no longer 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.199
 okay because it was July 14th I 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.300
 tell you that I did not allow the 14 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.800
 July more than others 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.399
 so why do I have an article from 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 newspaper this article so here is the 14 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.400
 July what hangs from July 14 is the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.549
 only day where often tolerated in the 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.290
 petain street and those of artists 6th stage 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.939
 and so we agree but the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.500
 firecrackers that do so or firecrackers who 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 had made of cannabis resin 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.270

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.750
