00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 art when art art when 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.139
 at 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.290
 6 I want to be this list 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.239
 they found for the first time by a disease AIDS 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:24.460
 which were due to a virus and more particularly the Russian project he has 

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:27.659
 for the first time I asked myself the question of knowing this summer a virus 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.310
 we will try to answer this question 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.260
 no viruses 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.460
 today 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.580
 we consider the virus as a particular entity 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.430
 before going into the details of what can be a virus 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.470
 let's pause for a few moments on the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.370
 my virus 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.229
 the word virus comes from the Latin which 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:46.240
 if she means 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.489
 so from the outset we did not have a priori vis-Ã -vis the virus 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.500
 it is obvious that these biological entities 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 harmful negative poison 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.250
 so we assume that the virus is harmful 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.250
 let's try to go further in the definition 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.980
 the virus is today a particular entity 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.190
 why it's a particle 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.670
 they led the world to a year scale 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.299
 a virus aline sizes ranging from 500 to 1000 meters 1,400 meters 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.760
 so if we could have a logic if we could represent the 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.480
 virus 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.549
 for 100 th like a balloon 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.410
 of such as you see here 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.940
 the body the human body she would represent a country like twice 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.689
 France to send know not at all the same scale 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.080
 and what to say about this guy has not yet 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.240
 such as the human body% they do not see what we see the world 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.460
 he sees himself 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.080
 others want entity from him cells thousands of cells 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.760
 even billions of cells 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.230
 so we when we are going to define the virus are not defined with 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.710
 an approach 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.910
 2 humanizing energizing 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.850
 of this particular entity 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.760
 so going into the details 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.790
 a viral particle consists mainly of troy 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:59.980
 the elements 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.980
 proteins 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.970
 nucleic acids 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.129
 the country's country is for example 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.909
 from the dn 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.380
 or seed 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.239
 the nnc story of the bulls coming to pray the ribonucleic tales 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 and that some viruses also have lipids 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:27.590
 there is a very special structure 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.549
 we will say what is called the sim card 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.849
 the captive is a structure 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.789
 protein 

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:36.789
 climate protect 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.119
 the genetic heritage 

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:44.119
 it was not inside 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:48.069
 as I told you earlier, some viruses also have 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:50.849
 around 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.849
 envelope 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.309
 but not all 

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:57.299
 it's a blog is made up mostly of he says he 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.669
 protein guns 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.609
 so we see that it's an extremely simple entity of this garment 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.829
 it's something extremely simple 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.279
 the seco one has studied these particular entities 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.069
 we notice two things the first is that 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.049
 the virus but never exists alone they will exist 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.159
 community 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.809
 a virus such as I schematize here does not exist in nature 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.590
 his life in community besides known the country 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.079
 that's the first they have again 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.349
 the approaches 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.239
 the scientist on the virus 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.329
 The second conclusion is that with our technological tools we realize that 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.949
 this entity is totally inert there is no activity 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.159
 associated with the biological activity associated with these particular entities 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.040
 On the other hand 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.499
 when you put in the presence of a minibus 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.219
 with a cell 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:48.359
 likely to receive it and be infected by these viruses 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.409
 the virus to penetrate 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.600
 and will establish between them this viral entity and its constituents 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.050
 and the cellular entity and its constituents a whole dialogue 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.289
 in fact she was leaving embellished 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.549
 toner of phrases 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:04.949
 other head ration 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.169
 between these two entities 

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.449
 and for this show 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.839
 speech that will be established and the communication that will be established between 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.020
 these two entities 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.729
 should honor 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.120
 pathology 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.120
 no pathology 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.620
 so the pathology is not percent 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.439
 working to say the only way 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.620
 in e2 we will say the teaser 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.499
 arriving after this dialogue between them 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:38.430
 these duels the viruses 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.500
 so today we know that when the virus has entered the cell 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.489
 and when cellulite allows to multiply 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.479
 the vincent virus multiply 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.849
 and very generally in very particular areas 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.910
 of the conapp elder cell 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.910
 viral plants 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 so we see that the idea that the context is favorable 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.810
 the cell that allows multiplication 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.199
 there is expression of the potentialities of this virus 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.110
 to lead to the expression and finally sometimes not always 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.370
 to multiplication 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.789
 of this virus in a favorable context 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.129
 we can imagine the virus as a seed 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.289
 who will be able to express his potentialities and when 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.700
 planted and when the rose-cross one will have the acceptance of his 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.659
 potentialities that exist 

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:36.669
 in this viral particle 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.830
 today the virologist pushes a little further the definitions of virus 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.319
 because until today we considered entity 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.330
 viral and the definition of the virus 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
 by focusing only on this entity dirhams 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.009
 today there is growing agreement to think about a new definition 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.150
 of the virus 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.050
 who they who create 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.990
 both the particular entity 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.110
 and all its potentialities 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.080
 what can express them on the context is favorable 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.770
 we can see that they 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.960
 in this definition we did not 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.169
 a section 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.119
 who today inert 

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:14.869
 because our technological approaches do not allow us to test a 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:16.449
 particular activity 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.580
 having stolen 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.400
 totally going to say active dynamic 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.309
 which expresses all the potentialities of this inert flap 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.529
 to try one of the few entities 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:29.289
 on our biological planet 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:30.790
 at once 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.729
 a shutter according to various the fly 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:37.149
 extremely dynamic depending on the context in which it will position itself 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.490
 and as I said earlier in this context we will have 

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:44.309
 a pathology that will 

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.959
 to appear
