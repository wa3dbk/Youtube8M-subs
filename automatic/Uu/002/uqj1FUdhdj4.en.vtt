00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.450
 messenger without leaving the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.070
 the funniest gelatins came to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.520
 your smartphone to immerse yourself in a 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.610
 very, very addictive game 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.590
 we talk about jelly jamm a sticky game 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.900
 where you have to control you're 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.509
 slimy jellies of different shapes and 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.119
 colors in an infinite travel 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:28.170
 while you jump without stopping to avoid 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 to be drowned 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.460
 this relatively simple game just 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.410
 you leave high for your character 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.120
 jump right now mine is a snail but 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.440
 as his Latin image has adopted several 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.930
 forms can sometimes be a square or 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.520
 a television the difficulty of the game 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.660
 is to estimate the speed in what 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 the bridges for example these bridges 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.680
 something super fast some go slower 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.290
 and the issue is that if you get caught 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.390
 between the bridges or crushes you lose 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.190
 because the ink you eat the graphic are 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.200
 in 3-d they are not complex but good 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.250
 the game is friendly is fun and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.250
 scream crush it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.700
 If the photos are your thing then it is 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.700
 important that the candles as a whole 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.760
 professional and that is precisely what 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.160
 that boom brings you a fabulous editor that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.459
 gives you total creative control of all 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.770
 your photographs your tools 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.070
 Advanced editions allow you to modify 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.830
 the brightness contrast saturation control 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.410
 totally the coloration curve create 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.760
 custom filters and share them 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.760
 directly to your networks 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.690
 accompanied the sleepwalker to return 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.390
 assured his face in the fascinating game 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.090
 in 3d back to bed 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.540
 just sent to the voice subconscious 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.250
 and travel through a dream world 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.650
 completely surreal full of 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.650
 magical objects and dangerous obstacles 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.990
 now this game are tremendously hallucinated 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.910
 controls this strange creature that 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.530
 can walk on the walls or by 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.540
 ceilings I'm not sure which one is up 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.710
 which ones down and take that weird element 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.930
 for example like this fish that what 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.400
 you use as a table and you have to 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.620
 collect objects this I put it for 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.480
 collect the giant apple and to 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.740
 prevent the beast from waking up the voice 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 goal of the game is to carry aft 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.310
 up to your bed but there are a lot of 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.080
 elements that block its passage then 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.300
 for example I have here I have to take 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.740
 the apple to block the pipeline 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.040
 ventilation that is pushing bovine not 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.840
 let arrive to your bed 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.829
 then there are more advanced elements by 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.569
 example right now I'm putting in the 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.129
 apple and will go through a portal and 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.959
 this portal takes me to a part that 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.060
 is up and I have to put the fish 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.189
 so that it does not fall and there they see as 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.739
 vocal to traverse advance the time 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:50.170
 because this happens faster and ready two 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.689
 fenced uca more healthy and safe and are 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.930
 all levels that way is very 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.930
 good 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.420
 low
