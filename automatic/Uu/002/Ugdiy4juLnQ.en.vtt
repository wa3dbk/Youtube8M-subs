00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
take a look at the basic track

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.540 
take a look at the basic track
arrangement<00:01:40.170> there<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.410> a<00:01:40.500> short<00:01:40.890> piece<00:01:41.280> in

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
arrangement there is a short piece in

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.609 
arrangement there is a short piece in
the<00:01:41.640> middle<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.330> one<00:01:42.600> two<00:01:42.960> three<00:01:42.990> feet

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the middle it can be one two three feet

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.830 
the middle it can be one two three feet
and<00:01:43.830> then<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.430> are<00:01:44.460> larger<00:01:45.180> pieces<00:01:45.690> on

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
and then there are larger pieces on

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.770 
and then there are larger pieces on
either<00:01:46.320> end<00:01:46.650> and<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.550> will<00:01:47.729> depend<00:01:47.850> on<00:01:48.300> what

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
either end and this will depend on what

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
either end and this will depend on what

feet pieces of track but on the video we

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.560 
feet pieces of track but on the video we
used<00:01:55.710> obviously<00:01:55.890> much<00:01:56.310> longer<00:01:56.730> track<00:01:57.000> here's

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570

the time from coming off the end of the
track<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.730> next<00:02:42.000> thing<00:02:42.120> you're<00:02:42.209> going<00:02:42.360> to

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
track the next thing you're going to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.390 
track the next thing you're going to
need<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> good<00:02:43.049> power<00:02:43.380> supply<00:02:43.920> make<00:02:44.190> sure

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
need is a good power supply make sure

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.360 
need is a good power supply make sure
that<00:02:44.580> you<00:02:44.700> have<00:02:45.330> enough<00:02:45.989> amps<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.650> power<00:02:46.890> two

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
that you have enough amps to power two

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.789 
that you have enough amps to power two
engines<00:02:47.970> let's<00:02:48.810> take<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:48.989> look<00:02:49.200> at<00:02:49.290> how<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.470> set

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
engines let's take a look at how you set

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.650 
engines let's take a look at how you set
this<00:02:49.950> up<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.760> simple<00:02:51.090> drawing<00:02:51.360> we've

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
this up it's just a simple drawing we've

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.380 
this up it's just a simple drawing we've
got<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.590> inner<00:02:52.830> track<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.519> then<00:02:54.150> there<00:02:54.360> are

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
got the inner track and then there are

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.350 
got the inner track and then there are
two<00:02:54.750> outer<00:02:54.989> tracks<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.459> key<00:02:56.700> element<00:02:57.120> once

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
two outer tracks the key element once

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.880 
two outer tracks the key element once
again<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.900> whole<00:02:58.140> thing<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.799> you

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
again to this whole thing is that you

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.370 
again to this whole thing is that you
have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.370> have<00:02:59.580> insulated<00:03:00.239> rail<00:03:00.630> joiners<00:03:01.170> that

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
have to have insulated rail joiners that

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.780 
have to have insulated rail joiners that
will<00:03:01.500> stop<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:02.250> power

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
will stop the power

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.240 
will stop the power
from<00:03:03.329> the<00:03:03.450> two<00:03:03.659> outer<00:03:03.900> tracks<00:03:04.439> touching<00:03:05.129> each

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
from the two outer tracks touching each

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.190 
from the two outer tracks touching each
other<00:03:05.489> otherwise<00:03:05.969> you<00:03:06.180> will<00:03:06.299> get<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.450> short<00:03:06.780> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
other otherwise you will get a short you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.199 
other otherwise you will get a short you
could<00:03:07.349> damage<00:03:07.560> your<00:03:07.769> power<00:03:08.010> supply<00:03:08.310> put<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
could damage your power supply put the

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.119 
could damage your power supply put the
power<00:03:09.420> supply<00:03:09.870> into<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.349> mix<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.799> then<00:03:11.010> we're

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
power supply into the mix and then we're

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.069 
power supply into the mix and then we're
gonna<00:03:11.219> add<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.489> wiring<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.390> basically<00:03:12.810> what

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
gonna add the wiring and basically what

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.690 
gonna add the wiring and basically what
we're<00:03:13.200> gonna<00:03:13.260> do<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.709> take<00:03:13.859> a<00:03:13.920> red<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.459> a<00:03:14.519> black

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
we're gonna do is take a red and a black

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.599 
we're gonna do is take a red and a black
wire<00:03:14.969> have<00:03:15.719> it<00:03:15.870> go<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.200> power<00:03:16.379> supply<00:03:16.829> then

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
wire have it go to the power supply then

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.280 
wire have it go to the power supply then
we're<00:03:17.730> gonna<00:03:17.819> have<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> red<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.659> a<00:03:18.780> black<00:03:18.959> wire

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
we're gonna have a red and a black wire

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.160 
we're gonna have a red and a black wire
go<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.829> outside<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.909> other<00:03:21.120> track<00:03:21.569> but

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
go to the outside of the other track but

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.470 
go to the outside of the other track but
notice<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.829> black<00:03:23.099> wire<00:03:23.400> goes<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.180> red

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
notice the black wire goes to the red

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.690 
notice the black wire goes to the red
wire<00:03:24.720> of<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.140> other<00:03:25.290> track<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.159> red<00:03:26.459> wire

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
wire of the other track and the red wire

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.520 
wire of the other track and the red wire
goes<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.299> black<00:03:27.629> wire<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.290> other

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
goes to the black wire of the other

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.890 
goes to the black wire of the other
track<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:29.400> key<00:03:29.670> element<00:03:30.030> once<00:03:30.209> again<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:30.720> the

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
track the key element once again is the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.690 
track the key element once again is the
rail<00:03:31.200> joiners<00:03:31.709> that<00:03:31.889> will<00:03:32.010> keep<00:03:32.219> the<00:03:32.459> power

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
rail joiners that will keep the power

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.089 
rail joiners that will keep the power
from<00:03:33.359> shorting<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.349> two<00:03:34.500> outer<00:03:34.680> tracks

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
from shorting from the two outer tracks

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.920 
from shorting from the two outer tracks
and<00:03:35.430> if<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.970> look<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.420> you'll<00:03:36.599> see<00:03:36.810> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
and if you look here you'll see that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.110 
and if you look here you'll see that
we've<00:03:37.079> got<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.470> red<00:03:37.709> wire<00:03:37.920> from<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.400> outside

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
we've got a red wire from the outside

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.240 
we've got a red wire from the outside
track<00:03:39.359> on<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.629> right<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.439> black<00:03:40.769> wire<00:03:41.040> on

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
track on the right to a black wire on

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.119 
track on the right to a black wire on
the<00:03:41.489> outside<00:03:42.000> track<00:03:42.299> of<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> left<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:43.129> vice

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
the outside track of the left and vice

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.429 
the outside track of the left and vice
versa<00:03:44.549> this<00:03:45.239> is<00:03:45.450> how<00:03:45.599> you<00:03:45.659> get<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.200> power

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
versa this is how you get the power

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.000 
versa this is how you get the power
going<00:03:47.010> in<00:03:47.129> opposite<00:03:47.760> directions

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
going in opposite directions

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.649 
going in opposite directions
we<00:03:50.010> like<00:03:50.159> the<00:03:50.310> USA<00:03:50.639> power<00:03:50.879> supply<00:03:51.299> because<00:03:51.450> you

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:51.659 
we like the USA power supply because you

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.929 
we like the USA power supply because you
can<00:03:51.840> control<00:03:52.079> the<00:03:52.470> speed<00:03:52.680> as<00:03:53.220> well<00:03:53.579> as<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
can control the speed as well as the

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.789 
can control the speed as well as the
momentum<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.689> of<00:03:54.989> course<00:03:55.200> make<00:03:55.439> sure<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.680> get

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
momentum and of course make sure you get

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.830 
momentum and of course make sure you get
two<00:03:56.040> people<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> keep<00:03:56.639> track<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.239> your<00:03:57.389> results

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
two people to keep track of your results

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.589 
two people to keep track of your results
let's<00:03:58.709> take<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:58.919> look<00:03:59.129> at<00:03:59.280> our<00:03:59.400> samples<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.450> we

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
let's take a look at our samples that we

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.140 
let's take a look at our samples that we
did<00:04:00.989> to<00:04:01.530> test<00:04:01.859> this<00:04:02.069> concept<00:04:02.669> before<00:04:02.819> we

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
did to test this concept before we

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.699 
did to test this concept before we
actually<00:04:03.359> did<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.439> video<00:04:05.989> you<00:04:06.989> can<00:04:07.139> see<00:04:07.349> here

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
actually did the video you can see here

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.069 
actually did the video you can see here
that<00:04:07.739> thomas'<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.760> pulling<00:04:09.209> Percy<00:04:09.769> and<00:04:12.079> then

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
that thomas' is pulling Percy and then

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.229 
that thomas' is pulling Percy and then
we<00:04:13.260> used<00:04:13.620> multiple<00:04:13.889> camera<00:04:14.519> angles<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.030> give

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
we used multiple camera angles to give

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.390 
we used multiple camera angles to give
the<00:04:15.419> illusion<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:15.959> Thomas<00:04:16.829> was<00:04:17.010> going<00:04:17.039> in

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
the illusion that Thomas was going in

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.900 
the illusion that Thomas was going in
one<00:04:17.609> direction

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.140 

then<00:04:24.510> cut<00:04:24.780> back<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.290> main<00:04:25.590> shot<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:26.280> then

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
then cut back to the main shot and then
