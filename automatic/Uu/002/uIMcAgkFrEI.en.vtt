pickup<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:16.139> has<00:00:16.379> been<00:00:16.619> sitting<00:00:16.920> for

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
pickup it has been sitting for

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
pickup it has been sitting for
approximately<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> month<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.850> I'm<00:00:20.850> getting

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
approximately a month and I'm getting

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:33.020 
approximately a month and I'm getting
ready<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.510> start<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.430> here<00:00:23.430> we<00:00:23.460> go<00:00:31.730> not<00:00:32.730> bad

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
ready to start it so here we go not bad

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.080 
ready to start it so here we go not bad
you<00:00:33.870> can<00:00:33.989> see<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.760> amp<00:00:35.760> gauge<00:00:36.149> kind<00:00:36.750> of

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
you can see the amp gauge kind of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.650 
you can see the amp gauge kind of
batteries<00:00:39.090> taking<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> lot<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> juice

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
batteries taking a lot of juice

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.549 
batteries taking a lot of juice
it's<00:00:42.230> low

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 

the<00:00:49.949> charge<00:00:50.250> gauge<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.820> only<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.329> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the charge gauge is the only one that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
the charge gauge is the only one that
works<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.410> speedometer<00:00:52.620> all<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.430> other

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
works and the speedometer all the other

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.009 
works and the speedometer all the other
gauges<00:00:53.910> are<00:00:55.460> non-functional<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.820> think<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.600> is

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
gauges are non-functional I think it is

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.299 
gauges are non-functional I think it is
the<00:00:59.360> voltage<00:01:00.360> regulator<00:01:01.110> for<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> gauges

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
the voltage regulator for the gauges

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.060 
the voltage regulator for the gauges
itself<00:01:02.760> that's<00:01:03.149> broken<00:01:03.510> which<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> fairly

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
itself that's broken which is a fairly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.020 
itself that's broken which is a fairly
easy<00:01:05.280> fix

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
easy fix

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.280 
easy fix
I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.330> part<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:07.250> 48<00:01:08.250> dollars<00:01:09.290> but

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
I think the part is like 48 dollars but

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:22.969 
I think the part is like 48 dollars but
AM<00:01:10.860> radio<00:01:11.310> works

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.080 

that's<00:01:23.979> pretty<00:01:24.250> cool<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:27.070> heater<00:01:27.939> and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
that's pretty cool and the heater and

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.359 
that's pretty cool and the heater and

is there

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.169 
is there
it<00:01:32.200> probably<00:01:32.799> could<00:01:33.219> be<00:01:33.280> charged<00:01:33.909> and

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
it probably could be charged and

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.469 
it probably could be charged and
