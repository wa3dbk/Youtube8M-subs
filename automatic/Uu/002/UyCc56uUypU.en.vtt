00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.379 

and<00:04:45.629> we<00:04:45.810> live<00:04:45.960> in<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.139> classical

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.189 

and<00:04:49.539> then<00:04:49.689> we<00:04:49.870> die<00:04:50.050> and<00:04:51.210> we<00:04:52.210> go<00:04:52.360> back<00:04:52.539> to<00:04:53.110> the

and then we get a body again and they

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.690 
and then we get a body again and they
were<00:05:00.100> in<00:05:00.220> the<00:05:00.280> physical<00:05:00.730> world
