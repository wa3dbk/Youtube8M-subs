00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
half chance and then look at this what

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
half chance and then look at this what
the<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.350> falls<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> van<00:01:35.040> Persie<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.610> he

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the it falls to van Persie and he

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
the it falls to van Persie and he
makes<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.150> too<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:37.009> absolute<00:01:38.009> calamity<00:01:38.549> at

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
makes it too but absolute calamity at

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
looks like it's going to be a tough year

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
looks like it's going to be a tough year
for<00:01:41.759> those<00:01:42.000> lads<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.509> they<00:01:43.020> try<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> stay<00:01:43.799> in

them but if you can catch even get

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.340 
them but if you can catch even get
relegated<00:01:46.439> on<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.070> tried<00:01:47.340> to

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
relegated on this but they tried to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.170 
relegated on this but they tried to
yeah<00:01:48.860> look<00:01:49.070> at<00:01:49.189> that<00:01:49.220> defended<00:01:49.670> as<00:01:49.790> they<00:01:49.939> tried

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
yeah look at that defended as they tried

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.420 
yeah look at that defended as they tried
to<00:01:50.330> salvage<00:01:50.540> some<00:01:51.049> kind<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.320> points<00:01:52.009> there<00:01:52.189> but

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
to salvage some kind of points there but

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.510 
to salvage some kind of points there but
as<00:01:52.610> FIFA<00:01:53.479> loves<00:01:53.900> to<00:01:54.110> make<00:01:54.320> it<00:01:54.530> happen<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:55.220> in

the 45th minute it's so easy to score
especially<00:01:58.490> after<00:01:58.909> your<00:01:59.119> scoring<00:01:59.420> yourself

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
rap at the end to be quite frankly I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.820 
rap at the end to be quite frankly I
don't<00:02:17.060> think<00:02:17.390> you'd<00:02:18.020> expect<00:02:18.380> anything<00:02:18.620> else

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
don't think you'd expect anything else

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.530 
don't think you'd expect anything else
really<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.220> five<00:02:19.489> star<00:02:19.700> team<00:02:19.910> up<00:02:20.120> against<00:02:20.450> a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
really a five star team up against a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.300 
really a five star team up against a
three<00:02:20.780> star<00:02:21.050> team<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.739> should<00:02:22.010> be<00:02:22.130> winning

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
three star team you should be winning

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.890 
three star team you should be winning
but<00:02:22.519> they<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:22.730> get<00:02:23.030> another<00:02:23.360> chance<00:02:23.600> here<00:02:23.870> I

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
but they do get another chance here I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.690 
but they do get another chance here I
mean<00:02:24.080> if<00:02:24.260> they<00:02:24.319> played<00:02:25.069> their<00:02:25.220> cards<00:02:25.280> right

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
mean if they played their cards right

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.880 
mean if they played their cards right
they<00:02:25.790> could<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.030> been<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.380> two<00:02:27.380> goals<00:02:27.620> good

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
they could have been to two goals good

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.250 
they could have been to two goals good
and<00:02:28.190> they<00:02:29.000> almost<00:02:29.180> did<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.720> but<00:02:29.870> he<00:02:29.989> just

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
and they almost did that but he just

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.020 
and they almost did that but he just
couldn't<00:02:30.500> quite<00:02:30.860> curl<00:02:31.400> into<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.819> bottom

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
been pretty deadly and so far but he

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.970 
been pretty deadly and so far but he
misses<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:41.750> but<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:42.319> does<00:02:42.440> make<00:02:42.620> offer<00:02:42.830> it

with a good header I was pretty shocked

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.320 
with a good header I was pretty shocked
by<00:02:45.080> his<00:02:45.140> miss<00:02:45.470> but<00:02:45.769> for<00:02:46.549> some<00:02:46.700> reason<00:02:47.060> despite

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
by his miss but for some reason despite

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.660 
by his miss but for some reason despite
having<00:02:47.510> something<00:02:47.810> like<00:02:47.900> 66<00:02:48.620> heading<00:02:48.980> he's<00:02:49.610> a

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
having something like 66 heading he's a

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.370 
having something like 66 heading he's a
really<00:02:49.970> good<00:02:50.209> he's<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.810> good<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> air

I<00:02:51.410> mean<00:02:51.799> look<00:02:52.610> at<00:02:52.730> that<00:02:52.910> somehow<00:02:53.360> he<00:02:53.420> outjumped

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
I mean look at that somehow he outjumped

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.110 
I mean look at that somehow he outjumped
two<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.260> them<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:54.590> beats<00:02:55.070> a<00:02:55.190> man<00:02:55.370> on<00:02:55.519> the<00:02:55.640> line

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
two of them and beats a man on the line

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.600 
two of them and beats a man on the line
keeper<00:02:56.599> and<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:57.349> game<00:02:57.620> ends<00:02:57.799> for<00:02:58.099> now<00:02:58.250> so<00:02:58.489> it's

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
keeper and the game ends for now so it's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.729 
keeper and the game ends for now so it's
pretty<00:02:58.730> half<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.239> you<00:02:59.390> know<00:02:59.590> it's<00:03:00.590> a<00:03:00.620> good

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
pretty half of that you know it's a good

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.530 
pretty half of that you know it's a good
way<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:00.980> start<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.459> series<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.090> good<00:03:02.330> way

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
way to start the series and a good way

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
way to start the series and a good way
to<00:03:02.599> start<00:03:02.989> there<00:03:03.680> Luke<00:03:03.920> especially<00:03:04.519> again

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
by any stretch of the imagination for a

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.700 
by any stretch of the imagination for a
centre-back<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> Ox<00:05:16.020> just<00:05:16.290> speeds<00:05:16.560> away

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
centre-back but the Ox just speeds away

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.440 
centre-back but the Ox just speeds away
and<00:05:16.980> it's<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.160> really<00:05:17.400> nice<00:05:17.550> finishes<00:05:18.060> well<00:05:18.210> and

and it's a really nice finishes well and
then<00:05:18.990> in<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.320> 90th<00:05:19.740> minute<00:05:19.890> they<00:05:20.220> do<00:05:20.280> go<00:05:20.670> and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
then in the 90th minute they do go and

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.720 
then in the 90th minute they do go and
get<00:05:21.210> a<00:05:21.480> calm<00:05:22.340> compensation<00:05:23.340> goal<00:05:23.520> basically

sure if that guy was on and off but it
does<00:05:29.850> finish<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.300> anyway<00:05:30.390> but<00:05:31.260> we<00:05:31.350> do<00:05:31.500> win<00:05:31.770> the

budget<00:05:58.950> by<00:05:59.220> any<00:05:59.430> stretch<00:05:59.730> I<00:06:00.630> think<00:06:01.320> a

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
budget by any stretch I think a

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.760 
budget by any stretch I think a
reasonable<00:06:01.680> amount<00:06:02.040> will<00:06:02.340> be<00:06:02.370> about<00:06:03.770> 600,000

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
reasonable amount will be about 600,000

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.550 
reasonable amount will be about 600,000
so<00:06:05.550> we'll<00:06:05.730> just<00:06:05.940> put<00:06:06.480> it<00:06:06.570> around<00:06:06.660> there<00:06:06.900> 79

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
so we'll just put it around there 79

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.280 
so we'll just put it around there 79
