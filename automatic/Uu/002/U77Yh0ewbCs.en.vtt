00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:41.510 

I<00:00:38.960> think<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.050> stems<00:00:40.379> from<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.680> fact<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.340> way

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I think it stems from the fact the way

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.479 
I think it stems from the fact the way
it<00:00:41.940> looks<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.110> we're<00:00:43.500> so<00:00:43.649> image<00:00:43.950> based<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.399> our

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
it looks and we're so image based in our

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.630 
it looks and we're so image based in our
society<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.390> cool<00:00:45.690> they<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.460> drum<00:00:47.460> kit

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
society it's cool they have a a drum kit

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.979 
society it's cool they have a a drum kit
with<00:00:47.670> cymbals<00:00:48.120> nice<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.510> low<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.870> you're

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
with cymbals nice and low and you're

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
with cymbals nice and low and you're
just<00:00:49.170> thrashing<00:00:49.559> away<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.850> visual

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
just thrashing away and it's the visual

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.200 
just thrashing away and it's the visual
is<00:00:51.480> amazing<00:00:52.020> now<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> practicality<00:00:53.219> from<00:00:54.030> an

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
is amazing now the practicality from an

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.450 
is amazing now the practicality from an
engineering<00:00:54.719> standpoint<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:56.100> good<00:00:56.340> at

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
engineering standpoint is not good at

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.729 
engineering standpoint is not good at
all<00:00:56.550> because<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.360> you<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.989> tremendous

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
all because now you have a tremendous

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
all because now you have a tremendous
amount<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.010> bleed<00:00:59.539> picture<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.600> these<00:01:00.750> these

cymbals<00:01:01.559> were<00:01:01.649> lower<00:01:01.859> about<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> foot<00:01:02.850> you'd<00:01:03.329> be

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
cymbals were lower about a foot you'd be

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
cymbals were lower about a foot you'd be
getting<00:01:03.600> into<00:01:03.809> all<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> Tom<00:01:04.500> mics<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.040> the

ability to mix those individual tones

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.060 
ability to mix those individual tones
become<00:01:09.479> less<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> less<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.229> less<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
become less and less and less I'm going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
become less and less and less I'm going
to<00:01:11.130> demonstrate<00:01:11.280> right<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:11.760> though<00:01:11.939> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
to demonstrate right now though the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.410 
to demonstrate right now though the
ability<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:13.280> adjust<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.549> volume<00:01:14.970> your<00:01:15.180> limbs

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
ability to adjust the volume your limbs

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.719 
ability to adjust the volume your limbs
can<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.930> different<00:01:16.290> volumes<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.799> still<00:01:17.430> give

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
can do different volumes and still give

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.830 
can do different volumes and still give
you<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:19.020> same<00:01:19.290> kind<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> groove<00:01:19.890> but

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
you the the the same kind of groove but

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.760 
you the the the same kind of groove but
watch<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.200> gonna<00:01:22.320> I'm<00:01:22.470> gonna<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.740> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
watch this I'm gonna I'm gonna do a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
watch this I'm gonna I'm gonna do a
groove<00:01:23.159> where<00:01:23.369> I'm<00:01:23.460> thrashing<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.090> hat<00:01:24.299> at

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
groove where I'm thrashing the hat at

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.260 
groove where I'm thrashing the hat at
first<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.310> gonna<00:01:26.460> pull<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
first and then I'm gonna pull back the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.940 
first and then I'm gonna pull back the
intensity<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> hat<00:01:28.320> but<00:01:28.470> keep<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> rest

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
intensity of the hat but keep the rest

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
intensity of the hat but keep the rest
of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> intensity<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> snare<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.390> kick

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
of the intensity on the snare and kick

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
of the intensity on the snare and kick
the<00:01:30.840> same<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.619> see<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.130> sounds

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the same so let's see what it sounds

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:55.270 
the same so let's see what it sounds
like

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.550 

so<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.340> get<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> idea<00:01:56.660> it<00:01:57.660> still<00:01:58.260> gives<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
so you get the idea it still gives the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.490 
so you get the idea it still gives the
thrash<00:01:59.040> eNOS<00:01:59.630> and<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.930> gives<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.260> the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
thrash eNOS and that gives you the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.440 
thrash eNOS and that gives you the
engineer<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.980> ability<00:02:02.370> to<00:02:02.400> turn<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:02.940> up<00:02:03.180> or

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
engineer the ability to turn that up or

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.310 
engineer the ability to turn that up or
control<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:03.870> more<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> also<00:02:06.390> has<00:02:06.870> now<00:02:07.260> you

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
control it more and but also has now you

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.900 
control it more and but also has now you
have<00:02:07.530> way<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:07.950> control<00:02:08.100> sonically<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.790> your

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
have way more control sonically of your

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.030 
have way more control sonically of your
snare<00:02:09.119> drum<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.450> mix<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.990> like<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
snare drum in the mix so like that the

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.860 
snare drum in the mix so like that the
other<00:02:11.190> key<00:02:11.370> really<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:12.060> keep<00:02:12.720> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
other key really is to keep the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.510 
other key really is to keep the
intensity<00:02:13.350> going<00:02:13.740> over<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.950> groove<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
intensity going over the groove and the

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.370 
intensity going over the groove and the
for<00:02:14.760> momentum<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.510> snare<00:02:15.810> drum<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.080> kick

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
for momentum in a snare drum the kick

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.730 
for momentum in a snare drum the kick
keep<00:02:16.560> those<00:02:16.760> volumes<00:02:17.760> just<00:02:18.210> as<00:02:18.390> it's<00:02:19.170> punchy

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
keep those volumes just as it's punchy

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.070 
keep those volumes just as it's punchy
and<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> velocity<00:02:20.850> was<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.180> same<00:02:21.390> yet

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
and is in the velocity was the same yet

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.650 
and is in the velocity was the same yet
keep<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.250> crashes<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.850> perhaps<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
keep the the crashes and perhaps the the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.199 
keep the the crashes and perhaps the the
the<00:02:25.140> hat<00:02:25.410> more<00:02:25.770> most<00:02:26.400> likely<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> keep<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the hat more most likely to keep that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.280 
the hat more most likely to keep that
more<00:02:27.770> sedated<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.950> down<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.630> doesn't<00:02:30.990> but

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
more sedated and down so it doesn't but

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.570 
more sedated and down so it doesn't but
that<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.680> have<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.890> practice<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.430> one<00:02:32.520> of

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
that you have to practice it's one of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.620 
that you have to practice it's one of
those<00:02:32.700> things<00:02:32.940> where<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.240> have<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.450> learn<00:02:33.570> how

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
those things where you have to learn how

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.300 
those things where you have to learn how
to<00:02:33.750> do<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.410> because<00:02:34.860> there<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.100> natural

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
to do it and because there are natural

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.980 
to do it and because there are natural
inclination<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.330> have<00:02:36.450> fun<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.840> bash

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
inclination is just to have fun and bash

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.880 
inclination is just to have fun and bash
and<00:02:37.320> bash<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> match<00:02:37.709> which<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:38.010> great<00:02:38.600> but

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
and bash the match which is great but

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.960
