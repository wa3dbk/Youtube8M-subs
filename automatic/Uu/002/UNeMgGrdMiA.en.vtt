vegetables flowers and herbs that we set
up<00:00:12.150> this<00:00:12.360> year<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:14.210> hopefully<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.389> about<00:00:15.480> two

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
up this year and hopefully in about two

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.820 
up this year and hopefully in about two
minutes<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.049> can<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.320> can<00:00:16.529> go<00:00:16.650> through<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:18.830> we

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
minutes I can I can go through but we

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.880 
minutes I can I can go through but we
obviously<00:00:20.039> did<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:21.119> plastic<00:00:21.600> we<00:00:22.529> laid<00:00:22.710> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
obviously did the plastic we laid that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.839 
obviously did the plastic we laid that
ourselves<00:00:23.010> with<00:00:24.140> we<00:00:25.140> made<00:00:25.439> our<00:00:25.740> own<00:00:25.849> raised

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
ourselves with we made our own raised

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.160 
ourselves with we made our own raised
bed<00:00:27.150> shaper<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> then<00:00:29.300> we<00:00:30.300> used<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.779> Buckeye

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
bed shaper and then we used a Buckeye

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.979 
bed shaper and then we used a Buckeye
tractor<00:00:31.940> mulch<00:00:32.940> layer<00:00:33.180> plastic<00:00:33.630> mulch<00:00:33.750> layer

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
tractor mulch layer plastic mulch layer

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.209 
tractor mulch layer plastic mulch layer
we<00:00:34.230> used<00:00:36.020> the<00:00:37.020> gauge<00:00:37.469> or<00:00:37.739> thickness<00:00:37.950> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
we used the gauge or thickness of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.580 
we used the gauge or thickness of
plastic<00:00:39.059> that<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.239> use<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.840> adequate<00:00:40.290> its

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
plastic that we use is not adequate its

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.220 
plastic that we use is not adequate its
grass<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.399> actually<00:00:41.520> growing<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:42.120> it

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
grass is actually growing through it

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.549 
grass is actually growing through it
then<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.379> tried<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> lay<00:00:44.070> straw<00:00:45.059> thinking<00:00:45.570> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
then we tried to lay straw thinking that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.990 
then we tried to lay straw thinking that
it<00:00:46.920> would<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.340> best<00:00:47.460> thing<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.820> put<00:00:47.969> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it would be the best thing to put in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.529 
it would be the best thing to put in
between<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:50.399> keep<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> weeds<00:00:51.120> suppressed

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
between and to keep the weeds suppressed

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.220 
between and to keep the weeds suppressed
and<00:00:51.890> as<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.230> grass

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and as you can see from right here grass

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.500 
and as you can see from right here grass
is<00:00:55.559> growing<00:00:55.890> or<00:00:56.309> something's<00:00:57.000> growing<00:00:57.210> in

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
is growing or something's growing in

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.400 
is growing or something's growing in
between<00:00:57.600> unfortunately<00:00:58.760> uh<00:00:59.760> but<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.629> did<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
between unfortunately uh but we did I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.110 
between unfortunately uh but we did I
think<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> about<00:01:02.399> three<00:01:02.760> hundred<00:01:02.789> feet

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
think this is about three hundred feet

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.740 
think this is about three hundred feet
long<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.559> have<00:01:04.710> nine<00:01:05.180> rows<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.540> mulch

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
long and we have nine rows of mulch

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.010 
long and we have nine rows of mulch
plastic<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.710> then<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
plastic and then we have not in the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
plastic and then we have not in the
plastic<00:01:10.439> we<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:13.220> three<00:01:14.220> different<00:01:14.340> types<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
plastic we have three different types of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.590 
plastic we have three different types of
corn<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.140> field<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.830> sweet<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.520> then<00:01:18.060> two

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
corn to field and one sweet and then two

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.179 
corn to field and one sweet and then two
different<00:01:19.350> types<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.610> sunflowers<00:01:21.770> all<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
different types of sunflowers all that

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.800 
different types of sunflowers all that
is<00:01:23.400> not<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> plastic<00:01:24.210> we're<00:01:24.330> doing<00:01:24.570> four

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
is not in the plastic we're doing four

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
is summer squash crookneck I think then

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.849 
is summer squash crookneck I think then
we<00:03:15.989> also<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.680> like<00:03:16.889> just<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.400> cantaloupe

radishes are probably growing better

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.680 
radishes are probably growing better
than<00:03:21.090> anything<00:03:21.329> that<00:03:21.799> we<00:03:22.799> have<00:03:22.829> cauliflower

name of the place is escaping me but
they<00:05:58.419> I<00:05:59.009> guess<00:06:00.659> 80%<00:06:01.659> of<00:06:01.750> them<00:06:01.870> did<00:06:02.050> awesome<00:06:02.620> and

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
they I guess 80% of them did awesome and

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.450 
they I guess 80% of them did awesome and
they're<00:06:02.889> already<00:06:03.009> had<00:06:03.430> little<00:06:04.020> strawberries

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
they're already had little strawberries

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.309 
they're already had little strawberries
again<00:06:06.460> those<00:06:06.669> are<00:06:06.699> the<00:06:07.120> purple<00:06:07.930> Cherokee

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 
again those are the purple Cherokee

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:11.249 
again those are the purple Cherokee
right<00:06:08.560> there<00:06:08.740> are<00:06:09.310> supposed<00:06:09.669> to<00:06:09.729> be<00:06:10.259> Cherokee

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
right there are supposed to be Cherokee

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:15.629 
right there are supposed to be Cherokee
I<00:06:11.289> think<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:14.650> these<00:06:15.009> are<00:06:15.189> the<00:06:15.400> ugly

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:15.639 
I think and these are the ugly

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.779 
I think and these are the ugly
Brandywine<00:06:16.300> tomatoes<00:06:17.069> and<00:06:18.069> more

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
Brandywine tomatoes and more

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:22.619 
Brandywine tomatoes and more
strawberries<00:06:19.469> so<00:06:20.789> not<00:06:21.789> all<00:06:21.999> shown<00:06:22.300> here

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:22.629 
strawberries so not all shown here

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.820 
strawberries so not all shown here
because<00:06:22.779> we<00:06:23.080> still<00:06:23.110> have<00:06:23.349> stuff<00:06:23.469> in<00:06:23.710> trays<00:06:24.039> is

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
because we still have stuff in trays is

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.899 
because we still have stuff in trays is
that's<00:06:26.830> see<00:06:27.490> I<00:06:29.039> think<00:06:30.039> five<00:06:30.430> or<00:06:30.460> six<00:06:30.819> different

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:30.909 
that's see I think five or six different

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.510 
that's see I think five or six different
peppers<00:06:31.419> and<00:06:31.750> like<00:06:32.740> I<00:06:32.770> mentioned<00:06:32.919> before<00:06:33.099> we

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520
