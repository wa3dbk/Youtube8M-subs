00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
go down about a half an inch we won't

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.230 
go down about a half an inch we won't
stay<00:04:49.980> about<00:04:50.160> the<00:04:50.280> same<00:04:50.490> as<00:04:50.610> before<00:04:50.940> go<00:04:51.090> ahead

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
at a time after a couple tries we found

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.070 
at a time after a couple tries we found
out<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.340> this<00:04:56.460> particular<00:04:56.640> case<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:57.960> had

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
out in this particular case that we had

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.900 
out in this particular case that we had
two<00:04:58.260> links<00:04:58.530> left<00:04:58.740> over<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.220> in<00:04:59.520> front<00:04:59.730> of<00:04:59.850> the

typically the wheel wheel measurement

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.140 
typically the wheel wheel measurement
will<00:05:04.650> go<00:05:04.770> down<00:05:04.950> anywhere<00:05:05.310> from<00:05:05.490> one<00:05:05.790> into<00:05:06.030> one

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
will go down anywhere from one into one

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.110 
will go down anywhere from one into one
and<00:05:06.270> a<00:05:06.300> half<00:05:06.450> inches<00:05:07.520> at<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.700> point<00:05:08.910> looks

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
and a half inches at this point looks

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.580 
and a half inches at this point looks
like<00:05:09.210> everything's<00:05:09.570> working<00:05:10.140> like<00:05:10.170> it<00:05:10.380> should
