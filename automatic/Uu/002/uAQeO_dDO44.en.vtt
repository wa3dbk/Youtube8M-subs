00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
playing all the way around here's where

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
playing all the way around here's where
it<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.540> right<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:09.979> having<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> right

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it is right there having that right

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
it is right there having that right
there<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.820> bottom<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:13.170> great<00:01:13.650> because

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
there on the bottom is great because

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380 
there on the bottom is great because
that's<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> spread<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> sound<00:01:15.060> out<00:01:15.210> in

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that's going to spread the sound out in

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.719 
that's going to spread the sound out in
all<00:01:15.600> directions<00:01:15.780> rather<00:01:16.470> than<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.890> one<00:01:17.130> so

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
all directions rather than just one so

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.100 
all directions rather than just one so
you<00:01:17.790> get<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> better<00:01:18.270> all-around<00:01:18.509> sound

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you get a better all-around sound

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.749 
you get a better all-around sound
because<00:01:19.380> it's<00:01:19.530> reflecting<00:01:20.250> off<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.580> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
because it's reflecting off there the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
because it's reflecting off there the
bass<00:01:20.909> comes<00:01:21.180> out<00:01:21.360> real<00:01:21.810> nice<00:01:22.110> from<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:23.270> last
