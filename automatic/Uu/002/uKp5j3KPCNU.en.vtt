00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
thousand i have to two thousand i'm at

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
thousand i have to two thousand i'm at
the<00:01:12.360> last<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.780> checked<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:13.830> thousand

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the last I checked I was two thousand

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.240 
really does I'm skiing okay so
essentially<00:03:24.489> though<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:25.030> idea<00:03:25.389> with<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.780> is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.550 

there's<00:03:30.250> speculation<00:03:31.060> on<00:03:31.810> whether<00:03:32.260> or<00:03:32.410> not

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
there's speculation on whether or not

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.670 
there's speculation on whether or not
this<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.760> official<00:03:34.060> first<00:03:34.900> ghost<00:03:35.200> montage

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
this is the official first ghost montage

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.610 
this is the official first ghost montage

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
but let's be real any of the other ones

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.440 
but let's be real any of the other ones
that<00:03:38.950> people<00:03:39.130> say<00:03:39.489> oh<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.700> had<00:03:39.940> the<00:03:40.060> first<00:03:40.209> one

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.699 
you're taking and you know stuff that
isn't<00:04:03.970> even<00:04:04.120> real<00:04:04.989> you're<00:04:05.200> taking<00:04:05.410> stuff<00:04:05.560> that

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
isn't even real you're taking stuff that

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.370 
isn't even real you're taking stuff that
everyone<00:04:05.980> else<00:04:06.190> has<00:04:06.400> access<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.450> when<00:04:08.049> the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
everyone else has access to when the

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.770 
everyone else has access to when the
montage<00:04:08.950> that<00:04:09.220> me<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.400> Jehovah<00:04:09.849> created<00:04:10.329> that

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
montage that me and Jehovah created that

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.960 
montage that me and Jehovah created that
is<00:04:10.959> his<00:04:11.230> footage<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.889> is<00:04:12.010> my<00:04:12.250> editing<00:04:12.730> one

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
is his footage that is my editing one

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.129 
is his footage that is my editing one
hundred<00:04:13.209> percent<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:13.690> know<00:04:13.720> all<00:04:13.959> that<00:04:14.079> stuff

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
hundred percent you know all that stuff

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.219 
hundred percent you know all that stuff
and<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:16.239> yeah<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.510> think<00:04:16.630> that's<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.900> little<00:04:16.989> bit

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
and so yeah I think that's a little bit

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.509 
and so yeah I think that's a little bit
different<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:17.829> know<00:04:17.859> and<00:04:18.070> even<00:04:18.190> if<00:04:18.400> there

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
different and you know and even if there

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.129 
different and you know and even if there
was<00:04:18.700> another<00:04:19.180> one<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.450> there<00:04:19.479> let's<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.049> be

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139
