00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

I<00:00:00.120> think<00:00:00.450> Josh<00:00:00.659> Freeman<00:00:00.900> was<00:00:01.140> forced<00:00:01.439> on

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
I think Josh Freeman was forced on

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.619 
I think Josh Freeman was forced on
Leslie<00:00:01.920> Frazier<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:02.939> think<00:00:03.149> it's<00:00:03.240> not<00:00:03.389> fair

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
Leslie Frazier and I think it's not fair

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.090 
Leslie Frazier and I think it's not fair
to<00:00:03.750> him<00:00:03.870> that<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.230> coach<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.440> football<00:00:04.859> team

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
to him that the coach of football team

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.610 
to him that the coach of football team
out<00:00:05.279> there<00:00:05.310> under<00:00:06.029> those<00:00:06.180> conditions<00:00:06.420> he<00:00:07.170> was

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
out there under those conditions he was

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.330 
out there under those conditions he was
not<00:00:07.890> ready<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.790> play<00:00:09.380> all<00:00:10.380> right<00:00:10.590> they<00:00:10.889> did<00:00:11.130> not

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
not ready to play all right they did not

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.240 
not ready to play all right they did not
have<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.790> chance<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.660> win<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.500> football<00:00:14.190> game

have a chance to win that football game

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.120 
have a chance to win that football game

and<00:01:52.290> create<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> best<00:01:52.740> 53-man<00:01:53.490> roster<00:01:53.520> there

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and create the best 53-man roster there

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.109 
and create the best 53-man roster there
is<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> then<00:01:55.140> it's<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> Leslie<00:01:56.790> Frazier

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
is and then it's up to Leslie Frazier

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
is and then it's up to Leslie Frazier
and<00:01:57.630> his<00:01:57.810> coaching<00:01:58.200> staff<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.500> decide<00:01:59.070> when

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
and his coaching staff to decide when

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.609 
and his coaching staff to decide when
those<00:02:00.000> players<00:02:00.360> are<00:02:00.719> ready<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
those players are ready to play in a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.410 
those players are ready to play in a
game<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.100> how<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.610> should<00:02:02.670> be<00:02:02.939> used<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
game and how they should be used in the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
game and how they should be used in the
game<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.290> my<00:02:04.469> understanding<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:05.430> while

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
game so it's my understanding that while

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.479 
game so it's my understanding that while
Leslie<00:02:06.390> Frazier<00:02:06.659> went<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.530> Spielman<00:02:08.039> last

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
game that it was ultimately his

Josh Freeman's role in that game and how

would that have played had he said you

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.149 
would that have played had he said you
know<00:02:22.719> what<00:02:22.870> I<00:02:22.900> don't<00:02:23.079> think<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.500> guy's<00:02:23.680> ready

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
know what I don't think this guy's ready

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.990 
know what I don't think this guy's ready
I<00:02:24.189> I<00:02:24.939> assume<00:02:25.709> brings<00:02:26.709> him<00:02:26.859> in<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.250> assume<00:02:27.730> that

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
I I assume brings him in I assume that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.170 
I I assume brings him in I assume that
at<00:02:28.989> that<00:02:29.230> point<00:02:29.439> Rick<00:02:30.220> Spielman<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
at that point Rick Spielman and the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.339 
at that point Rick Spielman and the
ownership<00:02:31.569> would<00:02:31.750> have<00:02:31.870> supported<00:02:32.140> that

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
ownership would have supported that

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.170 
ownership would have supported that
decision<00:02:32.409> and<00:02:32.980> recognize<00:02:33.609> that<00:02:33.640> they<00:02:33.909> still

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
decision and recognize that they still

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.420 
decision and recognize that they still
had<00:02:34.359> 10<00:02:34.629> more<00:02:34.810> games<00:02:35.109> after<00:02:35.500> this<00:02:35.650> one<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
games with the quarterbacks that they

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.979

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
don't they effectively have to see what

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.250 
don't they effectively have to see what
he's<00:03:04.870> made<00:03:05.049> of

he's made of

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.470 
he's made of
well<00:03:05.379> eventually<00:03:05.919> and<00:03:06.129> and<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.639> think<00:03:06.909> going

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
well eventually and and I think going

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.360 
well eventually and and I think going
into<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.870> game<00:03:08.139> obviously<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:09.099> was<00:03:09.220> some

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
into this game obviously there was some

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.979 
into this game obviously there was some
practice<00:03:09.760> time<00:03:09.939> and<00:03:10.000> they<00:03:10.299> felt<00:03:10.510> like<00:03:10.720> Josh

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
practice time and they felt like Josh

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.500 
practice time and they felt like Josh
Freeman<00:03:11.260> would<00:03:12.189> be<00:03:12.340> able<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.669> run<00:03:12.909> a<00:03:12.970> limited

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
Freeman would be able to run a limited

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.750 
Freeman would be able to run a limited
offense<00:03:13.930> now<00:03:14.139> a<00:03:14.379> part<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:14.980> has<00:03:15.489> to<00:03:15.609> do

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
offense now a part of this has to do

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
offense now a part of this has to do
with<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.090> running<00:03:16.419> game<00:03:16.569> if<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.200> can't<00:03:17.409> run

with the running game if you can't run

the football

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.399 
the football
it<00:03:18.669> puts<00:03:18.879> way<00:03:19.180> too<00:03:19.239> much<00:03:19.599> pressure<00:03:19.870> on<00:03:20.049> Josh

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
it puts way too much pressure on Josh

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.069 
it puts way too much pressure on Josh

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
point out that I think from the minute

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.939 
point out that I think from the minute
they<00:05:02.550> signed<00:05:02.970> Josh<00:05:03.330> Freeman<00:05:03.630> it<00:05:04.229> was<00:05:04.380> clear

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
they signed Josh Freeman it was clear

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.980 
they signed Josh Freeman it was clear
they<00:05:05.370> were<00:05:05.490> gonna<00:05:05.669> play<00:05:05.940> him<00:05:06.120> because<00:05:06.479> they

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
they were gonna play him because they

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.719 
they were gonna play him because they
wanted<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.380> know<00:05:07.650> if<00:05:07.979> he<00:05:08.220> was<00:05:08.250> going<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> be<00:05:08.610> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
wanted to know if he was going to be the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.860 
wanted to know if he was going to be the
answer<00:05:09.000> at<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.210> end<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.449> seat<00:05:09.599> he's<00:05:09.720> only

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
answer at the end of the seat he's only

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.779 
answer at the end of the seat he's only
signed<00:05:10.199> through<00:05:10.409> this<00:05:10.530> season<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.069> so<00:05:11.639> they

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:11.789 
signed through this season and so they

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.040 
signed through this season and so they
have<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.120> know<00:05:12.150> at<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.479> end<00:05:12.509> of<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:12.780> season

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
have to know at the end of the season

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.990 
have to know at the end of the season
now<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.740> would<00:05:13.860> think<00:05:14.159> that<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.699> would<00:05:14.789> be<00:05:14.909> an

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
now you would think that it would be an

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.100 
now you would think that it would be an
important<00:05:15.360> enough<00:05:15.449> decision<00:05:15.900> that<00:05:16.020> they

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
important enough decision that they

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.450 
important enough decision that they
would<00:05:16.199> want<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.500> create<00:05:16.860> a<00:05:17.099> positive

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
would want to create a positive

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.360 
would want to create a positive
foundation<00:05:18.330> for<00:05:18.509> him<00:05:18.659> to<00:05:18.870> start<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.530> I<00:05:20.099> think

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
foundation for him to start and I think

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.100 
foundation for him to start and I think
that's<00:05:20.580> where<00:05:20.849> the<00:05:20.969> question<00:05:21.389> mark<00:05:21.630> is<00:05:21.840> now

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
that's where the question mark is now

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.140 
that's where the question mark is now
did<00:05:22.800> they<00:05:23.009> fail<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.370> create<00:05:23.759> that<00:05:24.090> opportunity

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
did they fail to create that opportunity

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.709 
did they fail to create that opportunity
for<00:05:24.810> him<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.139> succeed<00:05:25.319> last<00:05:25.860> night<00:05:26.099> and<00:05:26.280> now

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
for him to succeed last night and now

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.999 
for him to succeed last night and now
that<00:05:27.719> they've<00:05:27.840> compounded<00:05:28.500> that<00:05:28.530> because<00:05:28.860> now

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
that they've compounded that because now

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.320 
that they've compounded that because now
they've<00:05:29.159> got<00:05:29.280> a<00:05:29.310> short<00:05:29.580> weekend<00:05:30.000> what<00:05:30.180> do<00:05:30.240> you

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.879 
they've got a short weekend what do you
do<00:05:30.449> now<00:05:30.599> play<00:05:30.960> them<00:05:31.080> again<00:05:31.319> on<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.590> short<00:05:31.860> week
