00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.650
 hello my name is angel thousands and this time 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.650
 we will perform the simulation of a soft drink machine 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:12.809
 we are asked that when a coins inserted 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.619
 and be detected, this is maintained 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:16.689
 until 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.369
 c of the instruction 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.369
 sardÃ¡ a soda and the coin is saved 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.130
 that are not currency be returned 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
 and we do not have 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.159
 of those departures 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:32.410
 without those entries three annotated 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.310
 in this part 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.310
 and later explain in his process 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.960
 we have built our reach more 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.620
 in which we have started with a normally open vote is a census 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.590
 which is going 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.080
 when activated 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.240
 will send us 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.520
 activate our output pocero the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.560
 so that our currency 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.510
 yes stop 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 interlocking cain 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.090
 going to leave the nap is another one of the instruction 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.740
 when that exit or 0 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.570
 we will have 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.270
 the option to choose any of these buttons 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.190
 and one 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.700
 and 4 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.960
 which 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.330
 when activated 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.510
 they will send us 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510
 at the exit the soda that we have chosen 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.920
 the cola 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.050
 An example 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.900
 when pressed 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.700
 the exit 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.850
 it will active 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.320
 which we 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.010
 will send 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.580
 now that it comes out 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.110
 the cola 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.790
 which is the one we have chosen 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.440
 and simultaneously we will be activated 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.050
 the count exit 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.110
 that will send us to keep our currency 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.830
 i can no longer be returned 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.560
 and this is the same with 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.060
 the road just changes the button 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.829
 and our departure that also thinks brothel proposed that we have chosen 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.250
 now in parallel we have had 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.140
 we have placed each one 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.079
 of the departures 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:10.649
 which at 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.909
 will be registered to any of them 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.909
 we will be sent 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.119
 it is a way to go simplify and represent 

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.119
 what is consensus of the currency 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.029
 before your departure 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:28.839
 and finally we have 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.659
 what also when the 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:33.219
 exit spokesman 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.359
 which is how you have the currency if we press 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.859
 and 5 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.209
 our currency coin will be returned through this 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.209
 osiris exit 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:50.479
 the solid position will be activated 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.789
 and when activated at the beginning we have a normally closed contact which will be 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:57.789
 open 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.019
 free our currency 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.749
 it is in this way how our 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:04.290
 silvia majdalani 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.290
 this simulation 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 we will see now 

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:15.290
 if we had quoted insert the coin once 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:17.459
 who will be 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.129
 it stops 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.659
 it happens that we press 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
 if we want to be the first refresh we cross 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.519
 one 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.059
 the soda is not worth 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.059
 we have good 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:49.179
 the convulsed world assured 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.179
 it was second 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:57.089
 if we insert the coin that we drive 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.209
 and telecinco 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.299
 and we can no longer 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.029
 take out any process because in that currency 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 return ruslan 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.569
 once again 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.569
 if he has given us a drink and masters to return us to a 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:22.749
 and if not how good are one of them can start 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.719
 it is in this way how it works 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.529
 this machine 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:31.889
 Monday night
