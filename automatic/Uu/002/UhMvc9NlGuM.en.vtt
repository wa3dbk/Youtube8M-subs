 according to them super youtuber 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.129
 I am a rapper so I have a shaved head 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.430
 I have a big voice over 35 years so 

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:50.509
 no you want to say no 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 so here it was a little bit no 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.530
 body continues so want them to ask me 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.560
 non- compliant or so welcome really 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.449
 try testing for those who know 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.530
 not to test his homework to search 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.169
 stuff twice it makes me so 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.400
 I was doing it if I did that to you 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.740
 because just for the moment 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.229
 I do not have a clash video so like 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.340
 you see it as I have a lot of 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.280
 world I do not have much time to do 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.539
 a video so really of course task 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.210
 so that's why I'm doing this because 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.940
 at the same time I can talk to you 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.280
 of them are you talking about doing a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.690
 little video tell you that you reassure 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.370
 in quotation marks paquin and who believe 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.110
 that I stop the cook videos or whatever 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.400
 that's what I'm working on 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.719
 morning at night and when I get home 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.460
 really I'm slammed so I do not have the 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:32.379
 time of no time to make a video 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.029
 so 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.680
 so here is there will be a small thesis 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.629
 on this game which is called who is 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.029
 take bastion of the neck which is just in 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:44.150
 below so I'm going to do it very 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:45.620
 soon you will also have a small 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.930
 video that I'm doing on 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:49.909
 the new call of duty so on the xbox 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.379
 I actually bought the xbox one for 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.479
 those who do not know so that we are a 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.370
 saves already compared to facebook or 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.080
 maybe even twitter I bought myself 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.169
 a hd pvr so I'll be able to do some 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.960
 videos on it so I'm going 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.669
 everyone who sees the xbox fans 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.810
 excuse me for asking a friend like 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.400
 we can make a short video 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.569
 together with subscribers or whatever 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.949
 so it's with another tube 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:13.089
 hours too sua we will do 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.379
 normally projects together 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:17.360
 so that's what has to offer 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.969
 or even god there is soon gta5 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.800
 who goes out so I think I'm loose t he 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.120
 do a good thing delirious with the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.800
 subscribers who will be present then 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.469
 blow buddy if he buys it 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.539
 so here is add me it's el 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.150
 diablo who forgets so I would put it 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.219
 in the description the name gt or at worst 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.770
 you had it on my meal chain 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:38.569
 about and then so that was all 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.909
 it's just a little even small video 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:42.529
 video delirium so I hope that you 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.270
 will have pleased so I know it has nothing to 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:46.399
