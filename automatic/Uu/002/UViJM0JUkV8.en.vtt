00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello everyone today on my channel 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.540
 interesting video not so long ago on the channel 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.120
 there was a video of this wonderful knife 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.179
 Atkinson did not like him very much 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.000
 loved but unfortunately it happened 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.250
 what is the first time of course with me 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
 happens 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.580
 it turned out that she is not on the same screw of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 no knives for all 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.119
 anti-loosening agent 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.980
 so literally in the first days I sing 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.140
 deputy politicians on the second or third day you 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.120
 see that I lost the screw for integrity 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.309
 the design does not affect the very 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.100
 In fact, we know the knife Perry collected at 2 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.590
 on on two screws there are shirogorovyh 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.840
 models and nothing no pity here 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 about everything is the same but damn guys 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.550
 I seem to be an idealist and this is a hole 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.719
 it just annoys me that I am not there 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.100
 tried to pick 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.960
 I wrote kershaw they didn't give me anything 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 answered but I understand so not 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
 I just sent after a while 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.939
 I will receive a notice that it is time to go pick up 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.030
 package but the fact is that literally 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.490
 in two weeks I'm moving to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.460
 Russian Federation, we have a permanent place 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.930
 residence and unfortunately saw this 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 bolt i won't get mind so sad i 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.390
 I decided to play it safe and ordered myself 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.909
 the exact same legs and today I have it 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.840
 got exactly the same with everyone 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 cogs quite so it was in her day 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.390
 unscrew this screw stick in here this 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.130
 can sell minus 30 percent of it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.420
 cost well after sixty three 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.689
 sixty five dollars 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:50.850
 great knife steel 154 degrees as it were, 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.939
 super he really loved me these days 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.640
 cool knife but if you remember who 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.240
 watched the past video about specifically here 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 This model is there then I myself first 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.140
 said that I really want to try on myself 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.420
 blade because everywhere there is different data 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.760
 guys today I understand why everywhere 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.000
 different data i have here is this knife and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.959
 now I have this knife, I donâ€™t know 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.420
 do you see the camera on the top knife 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:32.560
 longer has a slightly different blade shape 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.030
 but at the same time the knife is about 2 times longer 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.340
 a millimeter in my copy means 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.090
 if you measure like this before the first 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.000
 ledge this here vershinka here I 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.790
 today at least in the workshop with a stangel well in 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.850
 general here let's go here so here 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.550
 us 8 and 25 825 you were me just moult 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.200
 not exactly the exact line 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:09.340
 office and shtangel now just 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:11.799
 I remember 825 then here we have 845 so 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.739
 here we are 2 millimeters longer 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:17.170
 well, there were dozens in general but it is not 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.040
 less now I actually understand 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.230
 why such a difference is everywhere in the data 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.489
 it seems that someone come across such a coma 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.989
 such plus there is still one difference in 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.049
 first on this specimen 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.930
 pay attention to very high quality 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.959
 done polishing up that almost 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.340
 then we do not see more 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.620
 processing up the trace processing here 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.470
 things are a little different here 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.130
 here let's show here damn well here 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.340
 the camera does not transmit but risks are visible here 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.850
 from 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.310
 grinder here's a little plus what this 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.000
 a wedge a little length and width you 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.690
 the same everything else is the same 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.190
 but here their tip is thinner than here 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.790
 because here well that's just 2 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.440
 a millimeter longer 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:18.810
 plus there is a moment pay attention to 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.590
 here it is a stupid place here on it 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.020
 here now look at the player show here 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.600
 Now you can see that under the car 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.870
 look at a little pad 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.120
 here it is here 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:41.520
 more 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:45.720
 let's try it so look what 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.570
 there and what's that on my copy 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.020
 Hermann is very narrow here she is 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.020
 shirsh 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:05:01.910
 but there is still a moment here that we are with you 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:08.010
 don't see this one 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:11.610
 descent descent huang flush with pad 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:15.860
 yes here it comes here then here we 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.040
 You see such a stupid plot 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.440
 blade 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.270
 so I think it seems to be 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.730
 if not the 2nd generation or something. 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.830
 different knives 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:31.380
 this knife is immediately visible on such more 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.030
 elongated than this one 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:37.169
 it seems due to the fact that in short with 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:40.620
 a big tum for this in venice and on 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:43.590
 in fact , now I have a dilemma which 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.590
 from on the same set it is clear that the 2nd 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:50.190
 I'm not going to leave here 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.950
 The dilemma is that the length of the cutting edge they have 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.200
 slightly different 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:57.930
 here again maybe I will do today 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.020
 such a moment I want to sharpen this knife 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:04.620
 a little bit of his reground to align 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:08.970
 supply and after that I will decide what 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.370
 of two knives to keep for this reason 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.360
 probably on this and everything here is 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:17.360
 video interesting observation that's about this 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.860
 model is now clear where 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:24.259
 information about different lengths is taken 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.990
 so how would I like to blow that here two 

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:30.500
 knife i have both knives folded 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:33.789
 condition of the wedge center so 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.789
 thank you all bye
