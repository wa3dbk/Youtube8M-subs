started off with just using the oil so

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.639 
started off with just using the oil so
it<00:00:49.140> looks<00:00:49.350> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.870> it's<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.350> thicker

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.520 
it looks like this and on it's a thicker
consistency<00:00:53.780> but<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> doesn't<00:00:55.379> weigh<00:00:55.469> your

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
consistency but it doesn't weigh your

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200

a little bit brittle you use this for
the<00:01:52.970> reconstructing<00:01:53.970> mask<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the reconstructing mask what I do is

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.069 
the reconstructing mask what I do is
that<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.680> ended<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:56.159> taking<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.840> mask

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that I ended up taking this this mask

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.410 
that I ended up taking this this mask
I'll<00:01:58.350> put<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.250> leave<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.670> 10-15

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
minutes and then I'll end it up end up

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.810 
minutes and then I'll end it up end up
putting<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.719> hydrating<00:02:04.380> mask<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.829> right

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
putting this hydrating mask on right

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.869 
putting this hydrating mask on right
after<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.320> always<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.819> to

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
after that because I always just know to

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.110 
after that because I always just know to
