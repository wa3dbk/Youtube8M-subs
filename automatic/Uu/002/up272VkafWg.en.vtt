00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
this free on Android because Google I

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.150 
this free on Android because Google I
think<00:00:15.140> because<00:00:15.410> but<00:00:15.560> Google<00:00:15.800> announced<00:00:15.950> that

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
think because but Google announced that

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.610 
think because but Google announced that
their<00:00:16.490> Google<00:00:16.850> Voice<00:00:16.970> commands<00:00:17.359> are<00:00:17.539> free<00:00:17.779> but

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:18.620 
their Google Voice commands are free but

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.930 
their Google Voice commands are free but
the<00:00:18.710> good<00:00:18.830> thing<00:00:18.860> about<00:00:19.039> this<00:00:19.310> is<00:00:19.550> that<00:00:19.700> this

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
the good thing about this is that this

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.510 
the good thing about this is that this
runs<00:00:20.270> on<00:00:20.510> Android<00:00:21.140> 2.0<00:00:21.770> on<00:00:22.070> up

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
runs on Android 2.0 on up

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.310 
runs on Android 2.0 on up
but<00:00:22.910> that<00:00:23.060> google<00:00:23.330> voice<00:00:23.450> commands<00:00:23.869> only<00:00:24.020> runs

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
but that google voice commands only runs

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.130 
but that google voice commands only runs
on<00:00:24.440> 2.2<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:25.310> I<00:00:25.340> don't<00:00:25.610> have<00:00:25.760> version<00:00:26.270> 2.2<00:00:26.780> so

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
on 2.2 so I don't have version 2.2 so

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.570 
on 2.2 so I don't have version 2.2 so
this<00:00:27.320> is<00:00:27.500> the<00:00:27.650> only<00:00:27.770> thing<00:00:27.949> that<00:00:28.100> I<00:00:28.160> can<00:00:28.369> run

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
this is the only thing that I can run

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.609 
this is the only thing that I can run
that<00:00:29.330> has<00:00:29.539> this<00:00:29.690> type<00:00:29.930> of<00:00:29.990> feature<00:00:30.230> set<00:00:30.590> and

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
that has this type of feature set and

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.589 
that has this type of feature set and
it's<00:00:30.890> a<00:00:31.070> really<00:00:31.550> really<00:00:31.699> good<00:00:32.090> app<00:00:32.270> so<00:00:32.449> let's

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
it's a really really good app so let's

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's a really really good app so let's
see<00:00:32.750> what<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:32.989> can<00:00:33.079> do

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
see what it can do

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.700 
see what it can do
so<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:35.450> install<00:00:35.899> it<00:00:35.989> from<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.170> market<00:00:36.530> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.510 
which I will end all right super dialer
works<00:01:47.030> pretty<00:01:47.240> well<00:01:47.689> for<00:01:48.259> calling<00:01:48.799> businesses

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
works pretty well for calling businesses

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520 
works pretty well for calling businesses
it<00:01:49.700> uses<00:01:50.119> your<00:01:50.149> geolocation<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.170> if<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:51.350> just

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
it uses your geolocation so if you just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.779 
it uses your geolocation so if you just
say<00:01:51.680> call<00:01:51.950> taxi<00:01:52.399> for<00:01:52.580> example<00:01:53.500> call<00:01:54.500> taxi<00:01:57.789> it's

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
say call taxi for example call taxi it's

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.999 
say call taxi for example call taxi it's
gonna<00:01:58.939> use<00:01:59.210> geolocation<00:01:59.509> to<00:02:00.229> look<00:02:00.409> up<00:02:00.590> taxis

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
gonna use geolocation to look up taxis

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.219 
gonna use geolocation to look up taxis
near<00:02:01.280> you<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:01.789> in<00:02:01.909> this<00:02:02.060> case<00:02:02.360> it<00:02:02.720> should<00:02:02.929> find

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
near you so in this case it should find

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.700 
near you so in this case it should find
taxis<00:02:03.679> in<00:02:03.829> Honolulu<00:02:04.340> and<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:04.909> you<00:02:05.090> go

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
taxis in Honolulu and there you go

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.600

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
very very cool you could even say for

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:11.830

back I don't think you want to do that
but<00:05:07.570> I'm<00:05:07.690> guessing<00:05:07.990> that's<00:05:08.230> why<00:05:08.470> this<00:05:08.530> feature

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
but I'm guessing that's why this feature

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.700 
but I'm guessing that's why this feature
was<00:05:09.040> built<00:05:09.280> so<00:05:09.820> if<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:10.960> look<00:05:11.110> at<00:05:11.230> the<00:05:11.320> options

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
was built so if you look at the options

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.710 
was built so if you look at the options
here<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.160> can<00:05:12.520> see<00:05:12.970> what<00:05:13.210> options<00:05:13.570> you<00:05:13.630> have
