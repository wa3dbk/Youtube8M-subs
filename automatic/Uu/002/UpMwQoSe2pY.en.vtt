00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:11.320
 From the last to the second child It is not the last love, it is by the time it dies 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:20.430
 The premise of making another voice again 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:27.060
 In other words, this love must end somewhere in the same way the two of the double starring 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 Koizumi first interviewed on the official site regarding the title of the penultimate love 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:36.000
 Quark is a word I often hear that the last love is still early for the last love but the last love 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.930
 Do you feel the possibility ? 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.420
 It's a kind of person of our age 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.460
 I dreamed 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:49.160
 It's not like it, but it feels like I'm thinking it will come, but I'll tell you the last love 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:53.989
 Is it such an image that you do not have confidence ? 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:58.309
 On the other hand Kiichi Nakai is I I honestly too much image is not young 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:02.900
 I wonder if I could have a better love when I died last 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.479
 Even if the voice is not bad now, there is something called an act of exploring more 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.150
 I think I'm supposed to do something 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.909
 I think that the voice is not everything because humans have wings 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.289
 I feel like it's supposed to be 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:24.569
 Well, even though the expected adult target love story 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:25.740
 But it was quite unexpected that Kazunichi Nagakura, who played by Nakai Kiichi, was a surprisingly middle-aged uncle 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.420
 I agree 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.930
 I was exhausted even know whether the society that the more a sense the world 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.410
 Familiar parent and child 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:51.220
 If you think that the atmosphere called Tada type name 1 meeting 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:51.920
 It would Tashi head really say pastry not in the mouth and Chiaki Yoshino to Kyoko Koizumi dressed 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.640
 The 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.380
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:03.920
 If you have not 's book there are any other means crawling to Darazu is to be up there 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.120
 Heisei approximately obtained have been was doing people who bring in the sense that so Ahha was delicious 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.270
 I agree 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 And, well Kyon Kyon Koizumi Kyoko 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:18.620
 It feels like you're going too ordinary aunt on the ground . 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.780
 It is a lonely Chamiko for the idol generation 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:25.390
 Then after all the dishes Ward's say that tobacco than anything 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.410
 No, oh 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.300
 It will not be, but from this image pass that I can not go to the bathroom probably 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.990
 Oh 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.950
 It only that Kyon today is that I physiology had a like a child does not come 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:40.200
 I had also seen while surprised a little kind of part I 49 Ah, which say such a thing 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.450
 I wonder if Naa and Chan 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.100
 To say that because collagen-life failure is there are people who come from the 30s as early as I in Well 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.180
 Yeah yeah 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:57.360
 It is also a symptom by the prisoner respectively 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:03.030
 That's why I suddenly feel nauseous, or in fact I have entered 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:08.670
 I Nde Symptom Onei in This is the man, not necessarily say only me woman 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:11.760
 But it 's not sick I guess it's OK I'm going to get along well 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.970
 It is difficult to say 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:20.370
 By the way there is nothing I can do late 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:28.040
 It is really good in the so-called industry at first glance to the young beard screenwriter 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:33.200
 It is so if you want you to raise it as soon as possible given the assumption that it will be reworked . 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.659
 It's a fight against time, so there's a director Yoshiaki Chiaki saying there 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 It is a cutter that the dust that was a producer is keenly aware I guess this is 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:48.030
 After the drama of playwright Okada MegumiKazu itself is possibly 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:51.880
 Or whether there is said to experience or had witnessed that kind of scene 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:57.520
 To me Oh Both are not you there Papapu 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.910
 There was also a line saying that it would be an adult that would not be so lonely 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.690
 Sky is Nee 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:08.820
 By the way, two of the double starring is about this 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:10.620
 Although Kyoko Koizumi is the person who came on the assumption the loneliness I people think I Do I wonder comfortable 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.810
 It does not go well 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.380
 There is also a more adult freedom put no good to feel the sadness and loneliness but got 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.900
 I will 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:23.710
 There are days when I can not live well because I'm tired of my body and mind 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.220
 Still adults work hard and work hard and laugh 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:32.289
 There is a working woman of such a real adult in the drama 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.550
 I myself do not even want to say to the contrary gone too stain to mind because they send such a daily dialogue 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:36.289
 There is 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.330
 In the sense that it does not want to admit the reality 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:45.830
 On the other hand, Nakai Kiichi may think of what an adult would be. 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:51.740
 I thought that people of my own age around now are very adults. 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.999
 For example, even a school teacher at that time was younger than me now, but it was a very adult 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.280
 I feel like 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:05:01.500
 But when I came to that year, I was completely grown up 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.550
 If not become an adult by going through the do's I I On the other hand year notice that there is no 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:10.290
 There is something like obsession that I should not do in my life 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.400
 Here is also a spicy and myself say to myself Datte do not go to be adult So bear 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.120
 I feel that there is a lot of pressure that I have to do something because I am an adult 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.300
 you know 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.069
 Social status there 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:24.039
 Rust occurs in that kind Datte many things that must be burdened with it or added 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:28.030
 Perhaps everyone will be happy 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:31.590
 It is likely to have a feeling of loneliness even if there is a loved one 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.590
 I feel that I understand well in that sense 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.240
 everyone 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:40.900
 If you are interested in the audience rating is 12.1 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:49.360
 The first time for the taste of honey from previous work is 101.6 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:52.820
 It seems that there is a fairly limited age group this time though it is a little up, but it works well 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.480
 If it happens, it will spread by word of mouth and course 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:00.950
 It seems to be able to reach the standard 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.450
 After all the idols who see our generation go out a lot are out there Mold j 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.630
 63 were also out 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:11.420
 I think I would like to see for a moment, though 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:16.780
 In any case, I would like to see from the end to the second child firmly from now on 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.780
 I think that I want to make a cannonball shell about every other week Yes
