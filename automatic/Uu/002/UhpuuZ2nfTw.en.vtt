00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
long my last one lasted me for about a

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.660 
long my last one lasted me for about a
year<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.900> used<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.200> every<00:03:55.500> single<00:03:55.680> day<00:03:55.980> so

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670

year and I used it every single day so
I'm<00:03:56.910> really<00:03:57.060> impressed<00:03:57.300> by<00:03:57.600> this<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:58.340> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
I'm really impressed by this and the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.150 
I'm really impressed by this and the
last<00:03:59.520> thing<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.450> a<00:04:00.480> perfume<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.470> I'm

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
last thing I have is a perfume and I'm

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.180 
last thing I have is a perfume and I'm
very<00:04:02.460> very<00:04:02.790> very<00:04:03.120> picky<00:04:03.390> with<00:04:03.870> my<00:04:03.930> smells<00:04:04.740> and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
very very very picky with my smells and

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.630 
very very very picky with my smells and
this<00:04:05.880> is<00:04:06.180> like<00:04:06.510> my<00:04:07.140> new<00:04:07.410> absolute<00:04:08.040> favorite

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
this is like my new absolute favorite

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.670 
this is like my new absolute favorite
spring<00:04:09.120> perfume<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:10.020> I've<00:04:10.230> never<00:04:10.350> tried<00:04:10.560> it

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
spring perfume and I've never tried it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.280 
spring perfume and I've never tried it
before<00:04:10.890> it's<00:04:11.640> by<00:04:11.820> a<00:04:12.060> company<00:04:12.090> called<00:04:12.450> Roger

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
before it's by a company called Roger

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.740 
before it's by a company called Roger
and<00:04:13.560> gallais<00:04:13.800> and<00:04:14.220> it's<00:04:14.910> called<00:04:15.180> flirty

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
and gallais and it's called flirty

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.620 
and gallais and it's called flirty
figure<00:04:16.080> and<00:04:16.350> it's<00:04:16.830> actually<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.630> fragrant

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
figure and it's actually a fragrant

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.320 
figure and it's actually a fragrant
water<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.350> not<00:04:19.500> the<00:04:19.650> perfume<00:04:20.130> which<00:04:21.000> is

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
water and not the perfume which is

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.550 
water and not the perfume which is
probably<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.750> reason<00:04:21.930> why<00:04:22.080> I<00:04:22.230> was<00:04:22.350> a<00:04:22.380> little

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
probably the reason why I was a little

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.110 
probably the reason why I was a little
bit<00:04:22.650> cheaper<00:04:22.890> than<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.130> perfume<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:23.730> 15

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
bit cheaper than a perfume it's 15

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.760
