00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.590
 Hello everyone in this video will show you the mod 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.820
 which will allow you to paint easily 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.910
 almost any mob and even player 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.030
 any color transparency all matters let's 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 consider everything as detailed as possible 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.829
 the first thing we look at is 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.440
 mega miracle colored wand spent from 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.250
 sticks and so here's a rainbow bag 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.370
 dust 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.059
 this bag can be found somewhere in your 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.010
 the world 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.399
 need to try but i think you 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.300
 do it right so 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.449
 a window opens and here we are creating 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.449
 miracles 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.649
 real miracles 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:06.830
 alpha here we have saturation as it were 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.830
 transparency is only longer invisible 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.820
 such power 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:21.479
 like this and add a little bit like that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:29.159
 so here is a good ghost now be 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.939

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.030
 blue 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.340
 here transparency is very very simple 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.610
 look very much further 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 little book little books homo little book 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.110
 Kraft because the book 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.470
