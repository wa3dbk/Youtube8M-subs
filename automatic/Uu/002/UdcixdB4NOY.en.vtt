one of the upgrades is the tags that hit
the<00:00:42.130> wall<00:00:42.310> projectiles<00:00:43.090> that<00:00:43.180> stick<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.510> the

wall<00:00:43.750> that<00:00:43.780> are<00:00:44.020> explosive<00:00:44.500> will<00:00:44.650> split<00:00:45.040> each

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
wall that are explosive will split each

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.800 
wall that are explosive will split each
one<00:00:45.610> of<00:00:45.640> them<00:00:45.880> will<00:00:46.060> have<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.240> explosive

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810

one of them will have a explosive
impulse<00:00:47.290> when<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.620> canvas<00:00:48.130> an<00:00:48.250> area<00:00:48.550> with

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
impulse when you canvas an area with

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.460 
impulse when you canvas an area with
those<00:00:48.940> you'll<00:00:49.450> see<00:00:49.600> bodies<00:00:49.870> flying<00:00:50.080> will<00:00:50.350> see

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
those you'll see bodies flying will see

those you'll see bodies flying will see
body<00:00:50.650> parts<00:00:51.010> fried<00:00:51.250> yeah<00:00:51.610> it's<00:00:52.239> a<00:00:52.450> it's<00:00:52.630> a<00:00:52.720> gore

the<00:00:58.690> marksman<00:00:59.170> with<00:00:59.350> goin<00:00:59.710> two<00:00:59.830> iron<00:00:59.860> sights

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.410 
the marksman with goin two iron sights
when<00:01:00.730> I<00:01:00.790> think<00:01:00.970> when<00:01:01.060> the<00:01:01.150> first<00:01:01.300> thing

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
when I think when the first thing

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.300 
when I think when the first thing
returning<00:01:02.110> players<00:01:02.320> from<00:01:02.470> resistance<00:01:03.130> two

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
returning players from resistance two

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.250 
returning players from resistance two
will<00:01:03.460> notice<00:01:03.760> is<00:01:04.000> that<00:01:04.030> you<00:01:04.809> don't<00:01:04.930> have<00:01:05.140> this

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
will notice is that you don't have this

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.290 
will notice is that you don't have this
the<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.830> scope<00:01:06.100> automatically<00:01:07.030> when<00:01:07.270> you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
the the scope automatically when you

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.360 
the the scope automatically when you
pull<00:01:07.540> it<00:01:07.660> up<00:01:07.780> it's<00:01:08.170> a<00:01:08.350> you<00:01:08.590> know<00:01:08.830> it's<00:01:09.040> an<00:01:09.130> iron

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
pull it up it's a you know it's an iron

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.070 
pull it up it's a you know it's an iron
sight<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:10.000> still<00:01:10.240> very<00:01:10.360> accurate<00:01:10.870> but<00:01:10.990> it's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
sight it's still very accurate but it's

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.390 
sight it's still very accurate but it's
a<00:01:11.140> little<00:01:11.410> bit<00:01:11.560> shorter<00:01:11.710> range<00:01:12.040> than<00:01:12.370> the

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
a little bit shorter range than the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.390 
a little bit shorter range than the
marksmen<00:01:13.210> in<00:01:13.540> resistance<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.470> secondary<00:01:15.070> fire

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
marksmen in resistance to secondary fire

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.010 
marksmen in resistance to secondary fire
is<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.760> little<00:01:15.970> bit<00:01:16.060> different<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:16.450> shoots<00:01:16.869> out

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
is a little bit different it shoots out

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.530 
is a little bit different it shoots out
a<00:01:17.260> little<00:01:17.860> miniature<00:01:18.310> pops<00:01:18.700> out<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.150> it'll

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
a little miniature pops out and it'll

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
a little miniature pops out and it'll
scan<00:01:19.780> around<00:01:19.960> for<00:01:20.260> enemies

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
scan around for enemies

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.370 
scan around for enemies
the<00:01:23.130> carbine<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> interesting<00:01:24.659> weapon<00:01:25.020> for

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the carbine was a interesting weapon for

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.380 
the carbine was a interesting weapon for
resistance<00:01:25.799> three<00:01:26.040> we<00:01:26.189> actually<00:01:26.220> said<00:01:27.060> we

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
resistance three we actually said we

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.760 
resistance three we actually said we
were<00:01:27.479> pulling<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> carbine<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:28.500> no

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
were pulling the carbine there's no

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
were pulling the carbine there's no
chance<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.280> carbine<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
chance to carbine is going to be in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.800 
chance to carbine is going to be in the
game<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:31.950> found<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.460> two<00:01:32.610> players<00:01:32.970> play<00:01:33.509> with

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
game we found it two players play with

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.749 
game we found it two players play with
the<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.229> exotic<00:01:34.350> weapons<00:01:34.979> tend<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.549> really

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the more exotic weapons tend to really

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.520 
the more exotic weapons tend to really
like<00:01:36.119> our<00:01:36.329> game<00:01:36.539> the<00:01:36.840> weapons<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
like our game the weapons are one of the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.539 
like our game the weapons are one of the
things<00:01:37.649> that<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.829> really<00:01:37.950> hang<00:01:38.220> our<00:01:38.340> hat<00:01:38.520> on

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
things that we really hang our hat on

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
things that we really hang our hat on
and<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.539> carbine<00:01:39.899> and<00:01:39.990> resistance

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
and I think the carbine and resistance

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.840 
and I think the carbine and resistance
wanted<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.429> weapon<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
wanted to it kind of weapon that you

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
wanted to it kind of weapon that you
could<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.450> wanted<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.960> play<00:01:43.350> through<00:01:43.560> both

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
could if you wanted to play through both

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.649 
could if you wanted to play through both
of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> game<00:01:44.429> just<00:01:44.670> using<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.509> first

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
of the game just using that at first

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
of the game just using that at first
we're<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:45.990> no<00:01:46.320> way<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> gun<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:46.979> making<00:01:47.429> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
we're like no way this gun is making it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.440 
we're like no way this gun is making it
we're<00:01:47.610> pulling<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:47.970> out<00:01:48.030> we're<00:01:48.299> going<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
we're pulling that out we're going to

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
we're pulling that out we're going to
make<00:01:48.659> them<00:01:48.840> play<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.049> our<00:01:49.409> exotic<00:01:49.829> weapons

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
make them play with our exotic weapons

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.069 
make them play with our exotic weapons
and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> went<00:01:51.179> back<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.420> forth<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.960> back

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
and then we went back and forth and back

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.109 
and then we went back and forth and back
and<00:01:52.110> forth<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.710> ultimately<00:01:53.070> we<00:01:53.250> got<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.030> back

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and forth and ultimately we got it back

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.550 
and forth and ultimately we got it back
in<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> game<00:01:54.539> it<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> difficult<00:01:55.080> difficult

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
in the game it was a difficult difficult

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.609 
in the game it was a difficult difficult
decision<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.250> whether<00:01:56.909> not<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> keep<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.420> or

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.590 

put<00:02:04.619> players<00:02:04.920> again<00:02:05.459> in<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.729> sort<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
put players again in that sort of a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.809 
put players again in that sort of a
context<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.289> just<00:02:07.830> wouldn't<00:02:08.310> make<00:02:08.459> sense

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
context that just wouldn't make sense

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.339 
context that just wouldn't make sense
and<00:02:09.090> most<00:02:09.269> other<00:02:09.479> shooters<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.049> that<00:02:10.229> we

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
and most other shooters but that we

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.600 
and most other shooters but that we
thought<00:02:10.590> yeah<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.099> going<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> really

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
thought yeah it's going to be a really

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.699 
thought yeah it's going to be a really
