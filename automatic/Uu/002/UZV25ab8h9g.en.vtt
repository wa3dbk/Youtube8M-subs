00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.560
 peggy 3 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.560
 Y 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.780
 good 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.320
 you 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.320
 you 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.539
 do not 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.980
 well I think it's a very good 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.350
 initiative because I believe that people 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.950
 especially here in europe he wanted 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 be able to play with teams from the Euroleague and 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.800
 I think it 's a nice initiative and for 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 we are a dream to see you reflected 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.610
 in a video game like I said I think 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.220
 that all of Europe has 2k games in 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.250
 house and what was missing was best 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.830
 include that not to the euroliga teams 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.560
 which is the best basketball in the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.560
 continent and I think almost a certain 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.580
 well I think that at this point 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.090
 you can prefer no rival 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.100
 all the teams are very strong and the 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.860
 BarÃ§a is a team that is always in 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.230
 the final was in recent years that 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.120
 It always makes things difficult for us and 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.860
 good is a classic is not a match 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.800
 especially when everyone likes 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.790
 play and that less assures us a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.790
 Spanish representative in the final 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.040
 yes yes I have tried enough 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 times 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.810
 and good for the moment in the virtual world 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.840
 I'm pretty good at it, let's hope that 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:55.650
 we can repeat and move to the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.000
 final if in the game if you can say that 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.800
 I was I want I was born in the world 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.800
 Virtual I was
