hey<00:00:00.539> guys<00:00:00.840> this<00:00:01.319> is<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.709> efficiency<00:00:02.280> Smurf

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
hey guys this is the efficiency Smurf

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.480 
hey guys this is the efficiency Smurf
again<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.899> will<00:00:04.170> be<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.319> short<00:00:04.440> tutorial<00:00:04.890> on

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
again this will be a short tutorial on

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.340 
again this will be a short tutorial on
how<00:00:05.819> production<00:00:06.359> times<00:00:06.600> of<00:00:06.839> resource

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
how production times of resource

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.129 
how production times of resource
collection<00:00:07.919> buildings<00:00:08.340> are<00:00:08.550> calculated<00:00:09.269> they

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
collection buildings are calculated they

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.440 
collection buildings are calculated they
differ<00:00:10.349> from<00:00:10.500> workshop<00:00:11.400> so<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.120> think<00:00:12.330> it's

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
differ from workshop so I think it's

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.900 
differ from workshop so I think it's
useful<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.900> discuss<00:00:13.440> it<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.889> bit<00:00:14.009> there<00:00:14.820> are

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
useful to discuss it for a bit there are

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.480 
useful to discuss it for a bit there are
three<00:00:15.330> different<00:00:16.139> categories<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:17.070> resource

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
three different categories for resource

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.370 
three different categories for resource
collection<00:00:17.970> buildings

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
collection buildings

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.010 
collection buildings
the<00:00:19.650> categories<00:00:20.130> are<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.820> follows<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.990> first

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the categories are as follows the first

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.730 
the categories are as follows the first
one<00:00:22.500> are<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.070> oars<00:00:23.400> and<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.930> include<00:00:25.289> copper

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
one are the oars and they include copper

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.720 
one are the oars and they include copper
iron<00:00:25.980> gold<00:00:26.400> etc<00:00:27.800> then<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.980> second<00:00:29.400> category

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
iron gold etc then the second category

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.240 
iron gold etc then the second category
is<00:00:29.970> wood<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.570> stone<00:00:31.140> which<00:00:31.470> includes<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
is wood and stone which includes the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.180 
is wood and stone which includes the
well<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.630> sorts<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.020> wood<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> stone<00:00:34.800> marble

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
well all sorts of wood and stone marble

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.600 
well all sorts of wood and stone marble
and<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:37.290> fur<00:00:37.620> category<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and and the fur category is the

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.560 
and and the fur category is the
farms<00:00:39.149> which<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.690> only<00:00:40.290> green<00:00:41.570> because

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
farms which is only green because

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.690 
farms which is only green because
resource<00:00:43.170> collectors<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.920> no<00:00:44.160> toilets

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
resource collectors have no toilets

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910 
resource collectors have no toilets
there<00:00:44.940> they<00:00:45.090> wear<00:00:45.270> diapers<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.410> don't

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
there they wear diapers they I don't

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.270 
there they wear diapers they I don't
know<00:00:47.100> which<00:00:47.489> one<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.730> two<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
know which one of two it is but there is

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.630 
know which one of two it is but there is
no<00:00:50.489> cleaning<00:00:51.000> or<00:00:51.149> preparation<00:00:51.690> time<00:00:52.430> let's<00:00:53.430> go

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
no cleaning or preparation time let's go

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.400 
no cleaning or preparation time let's go
through<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> calculations<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> all<00:00:55.020> three

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
through the calculations of all three

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
through the calculations of all three
different<00:00:55.620> categories<00:00:56.340> or<00:00:56.610> ORS<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.780> pretty

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
different categories or ORS it's pretty

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
different categories or ORS it's pretty
standard<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.520> base<00:00:59.789> production<00:01:00.329> dial

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
standard it's the base production dial

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.660 
standard it's the base production dial
of<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.719> building<00:01:01.079> plus<00:01:01.350> two<00:01:02.160> times<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of the building plus two times the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
of the building plus two times the
walking<00:01:03.030> distances<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.960> four<00:01:04.260> times

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
walking distances so it's not four times

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.990 
walking distances so it's not four times
like<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.949> workshops<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.270> it's<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.840> cool

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
like in workshops so it's pretty cool

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.690 
like in workshops so it's pretty cool
for<00:01:09.000> wood<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.710> for<00:01:10.710> all<00:01:10.830> kinds<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> woods<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
for wood and for all kinds of woods and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.910 
for wood and for all kinds of woods and
stone<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.390> following<00:01:12.780> calculation<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> used

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
stone the following calculation is used

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.120 
stone the following calculation is used
it's<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.909> base<00:01:15.570> production<00:01:16.140> times<00:01:16.380> plus<00:01:16.890> two

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's the base production times plus two

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
it's the base production times plus two
times<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.580> walking<00:01:17.939> distance<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.420> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
times the walking distance to the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.859 
times the walking distance to the
storehouse<00:01:19.549> plus<00:01:20.549> two<00:01:20.759> times<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.420> walking

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
storehouse plus two times the walking

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.160 
storehouse plus two times the walking
distance<00:01:22.229> from<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:23.340> workshop<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
distance from the workshop to the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.640 
distance from the workshop to the
resource<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:27.570> resource<00:01:27.990> collectors<00:01:28.470> will

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
resource the resource collectors will

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
resource the resource collectors will
also<00:01:29.009> enter<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.430> resource<00:01:30.060> from<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> bottom

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
also enter the resource from the bottom

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.280 
also enter the resource from the bottom
of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> resource<00:01:32.329> farms<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.540> weird<00:01:33.900> in<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
of the resource farms are weird in the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.319 
of the resource farms are weird in the
way<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> work<00:01:34.799> farm<00:01:35.490> fields<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.119> accessed

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
way to work farm fields can be accessed

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390 
way to work farm fields can be accessed
from<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> top<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> farm<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.070> from<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
from the top of the farm and from the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.069 
from the top of the farm and from the
bottom<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.909> farm<00:01:39.350> also<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.740> farm<00:01:41.040> gets<00:01:41.340> to

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
bottom of the farm also the farm gets to

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.469 
bottom of the farm also the farm gets to
two<00:01:43.100> seconds<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.189> extra<00:01:44.549> walking<00:01:44.820> distance

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
two seconds of extra walking distance

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.749 
two seconds of extra walking distance
from<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.590> buildings<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.579> adds

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
from and to the buildings so that adds

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.410 
from and to the buildings so that adds
four<00:01:48.060> seconds<00:01:48.540> every<00:01:48.750> time<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.909> might<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
four seconds every time this might be a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.710 
four seconds every time this might be a
balk<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.170> sure<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.280> maybe<00:01:53.939> it'll<00:01:54.240> fix<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
balk I'm not sure but maybe it'll fix it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.989 
balk I'm not sure but maybe it'll fix it
or<00:01:54.840> they<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.320> keep<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.799> favor

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
or they just keep it as favor

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.039 
or they just keep it as favor
the<00:01:57.539> calculation<00:01:58.350> looks<00:01:58.829> like<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.780> so<00:02:00.780> it's

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
the calculation looks like this so it's

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.870 
the calculation looks like this so it's
the<00:02:01.229> base<00:02:01.439> production<00:02:01.890> time<00:02:02.069> plus<00:02:02.399> two<00:02:02.609> times

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
the base production time plus two times

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.410 
the base production time plus two times
we're<00:02:03.090> walking<00:02:03.359> this<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.170> store<00:02:05.210> plus<00:02:06.210> two

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
we're walking this to the store plus two

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.609 
we're walking this to the store plus two
times<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.200> walking<00:02:07.500> distance<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.220> plus<00:02:08.789> four

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
times the walking distance or plus four

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
times the walking distance or plus four
so<00:02:10.619> it's<00:02:10.950> actually<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.030> same<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.900> wood

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
so it's actually the same as for wood

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.610 
so it's actually the same as for wood
but<00:02:13.379> it's<00:02:13.560> plus<00:02:13.799> four<00:02:14.450> I<00:02:15.450> hope<00:02:15.989> that<00:02:16.200> was<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> bit

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
but it's plus four I hope that was a bit

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.210 
but it's plus four I hope that was a bit

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
clearer and I will this was a bit

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.400 
clearer and I will this was a bit
