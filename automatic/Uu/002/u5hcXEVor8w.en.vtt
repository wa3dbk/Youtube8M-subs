coming along I wound up taking that

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.620 
coming along I wound up taking that
power<00:00:10.500> supply<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.309> had<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.759> cut<00:00:11.969> cord<00:00:12.330> and

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
power supply that had the cut cord and

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.730 
power supply that had the cut cord and
that<00:00:12.750> was<00:00:12.870> originally<00:00:13.440> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:14.540> x68000

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
that was originally in the x68000

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
that was originally in the x68000
workstation<00:00:16.740> expert<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.400> took<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.060> out<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
workstation expert I took that out and I

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.470 
workstation expert I took that out and I
moved<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.109> over<00:00:19.199> here<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.880> x68000<00:00:20.880> as<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
moved it over here to the x68000 as you

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
moved it over here to the x68000 as you
can<00:00:21.600> see<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.900> back<00:00:22.050> here<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.279> where

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
can see in the back here this is where

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.189 
can see in the back here this is where
the<00:00:23.550> cord<00:00:23.760> was<00:00:23.939> cut<00:00:24.090> out<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.840> wound<00:00:24.960> up

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the cord was cut out and I wound up

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.800 
the cord was cut out and I wound up
cutting<00:00:25.859> away<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.609> insides<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.689> i

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
cutting away at the insides here and i

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.109 
cutting away at the insides here and i
spliced<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.680> new<00:00:28.830> cord<00:00:29.160> so<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> has<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.880> new

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
spliced in a new cord so it has a new

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.580 
spliced in a new cord so it has a new
cable<00:00:30.330> running<00:00:30.660> through<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> back<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
cable running through the back there and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.400 
cable running through the back there and
that's<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.790> tied<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> power<00:00:33.690> supply<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that's all tied in to the power supply I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.700 
that's all tied in to the power supply I
got<00:00:34.980> another<00:00:35.460> power<00:00:35.820> supply<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
got another power supply and

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.260 
got another power supply and
unfortunately<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.829> don't<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.160> why<00:00:38.399> since<00:00:39.120> all

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
unfortunately I don't know why since all

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.639 
unfortunately I don't know why since all
these<00:00:39.390> things<00:00:39.629> are<00:00:39.750> set<00:00:39.960> up<00:00:40.079> basically<00:00:40.379> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
these things are set up basically the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.010 
these things are set up basically the
same<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.920> thought<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.520> wouldn't<00:00:41.730> fit<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
same I thought it wouldn't fit into the

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
same I thought it wouldn't fit into the
workstation<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.000> pick<00:00:45.149> it

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
workstation that I just want to pick it

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
workstation that I just want to pick it
up<00:00:45.329> but<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.570> didn't<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.960> fit<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.230> there<00:00:46.440> so

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
up but it didn't want to fit in there so

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
up but it didn't want to fit in there so
well<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.340> wound<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.850> switching<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.239> over

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
well so I wound up switching that over

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.020 
well so I wound up switching that over
here<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.930> expert<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> original

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
here to the expert just the original

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.389 
here to the expert just the original
expert<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.260> was<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.920> really

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
expert the one that was in the really

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.610 
expert the one that was in the really
rough<00:00:53.610> shape<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.149> as<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.170> see<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.440> power

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
rough shape but as you can see the power

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.319 
rough shape but as you can see the power
lights<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.579> just<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
lights on here and just as a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.209 
lights on here and just as a
demonstration<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:58.109> figured<00:00:58.410> I'd<00:00:58.559> turn<00:00:59.039> all

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
demonstration I figured I'd turn all

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
demonstration I figured I'd turn all
these<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.079> one<00:01:01.289> here

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
these on so as you can see this one here

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.399 
these on so as you can see this one here
has<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> power<00:01:02.070> light<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.019> so<00:01:04.019> does<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
has the power light on and so does the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.200 
has the power light on and so does the
HD<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.640> these<00:01:06.150> disks<00:01:06.930> are<00:01:07.140> ready<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.619> go<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.010> I

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.940 
wind up getting those other two discs
out<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.720> unfortunately<00:01:38.720> these<00:01:39.289> ones<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.740> the

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
out and unfortunately these ones are the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.690 
out and unfortunately these ones are the
San<00:01:40.520> Goku<00:01:40.720> games<00:01:41.720> but<00:01:42.470> if<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.189> look<00:01:43.369> here<00:01:43.549> it

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
San Goku games but if you look here it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.060 
San Goku games but if you look here it
says<00:01:43.850> a<00:01:44.090> and<00:01:44.390> C<00:01:44.659> so<00:01:45.080> it's<00:01:45.229> missing<00:01:45.530> B<00:01:45.740> which<00:01:46.039> is

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
says a and C so it's missing B which is

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.039 
says a and C so it's missing B which is
probably<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.520> system<00:01:46.939> discs<00:01:47.270> so<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.570> can't<00:01:47.869> use

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
probably the system discs so I can't use

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.950

through<00:02:10.369> these<00:02:10.519> things<00:02:10.759> in<00:02:10.910> action<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:11.360> can

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
through these things in action you can

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.229 
through these things in action you can
already<00:02:11.600> tell<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.700> HDX<00:02:13.700> were<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
already tell that the HDX were the

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.259 
already tell that the HDX were the
expert<00:02:14.690> here<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.110> working<00:02:15.530> turn<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.459> monitor

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
expert here is working turn the monitor

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.120 
expert here is working turn the monitor
I<00:02:17.299> got<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.690> monitor<00:02:18.200> cord<00:02:18.470> plugged<00:02:18.739> into<00:02:18.920> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
I got the monitor cord plugged into the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.220 
I got the monitor cord plugged into the
second<00:02:19.489> one<00:02:19.610> here<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:20.510> I'll<00:02:20.569> disconnect<00:02:20.900> this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
second one here so I'll disconnect this

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.660 
second one here so I'll disconnect this
one<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.930> back<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.859> end<00:02:28.100> you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
one and the back here what that end you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.160 
one and the back here what that end you
can<00:02:28.820> see<00:02:29.049> it's<00:02:30.049> in<00:02:30.109> the<00:02:30.230> BGM<00:02:30.650> testing<00:02:31.519> mode<00:02:32.170> you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
can see it's in the BGM testing mode you

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.199 
can see it's in the BGM testing mode you
can<00:02:33.230> change<00:02:33.739> all<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> different<00:02:34.310> sounds<00:02:35.090> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
can change all the different sounds and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.819 
can change all the different sounds and
just<00:02:35.420> let<00:02:35.600> it<00:02:35.690> run<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.350> I<00:02:36.380> figured<00:02:36.470> it'd<00:02:36.799> be

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
just let it run so I figured it'd be

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.640 
just let it run so I figured it'd be
some<00:02:37.160> good<00:02:37.280> background<00:02:37.519> music<00:02:38.109> but<00:02:39.109> we'll

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
some good background music but we'll

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.460 
some good background music but we'll
turn<00:02:39.769> this<00:02:39.980> one<00:02:40.160> down<00:02:40.220> here<00:02:41.260> turn<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.350> music

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
turn this one down here turn the music

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.550 
turn this one down here turn the music
down<00:02:43.120> switch<00:02:44.120> our<00:02:44.269> cable<00:02:44.570> over<00:02:44.810> here<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.260> the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
down switch our cable over here to the

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.140 
down switch our cable over here to the
the<00:02:46.190> recent<00:02:46.609> one<00:02:49.299> and<00:02:50.299> we'll<00:02:51.019> set<00:02:51.290> our<00:02:51.320> disks

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the recent one and we'll set our disks

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.789 
the recent one and we'll set our disks
and<00:02:53.150> what's<00:02:53.750> nice<00:02:53.900> about<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.290> kind<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.680> has

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:54.799 
and what's nice about this kind of has

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:56.530 
and what's nice about this kind of has
like<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.010> finger<00:02:55.579> slot<00:02:55.880> where<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.239> can<00:02:56.390> just

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
like a finger slot where you can just

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.819 
like a finger slot where you can just
kind<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.750> push<00:02:56.930> them<00:02:57.049> both<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.410> at<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.680> same

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
kind of push them both in at the same

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.090 
kind of push them both in at the same
time<00:02:58.040> in<00:02:58.310> some<00:02:58.910> cases<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.750> will<00:02:59.810> eject<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.500> but

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
time in some cases it will eject one but

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:09.240 
time in some cases it will eject one but
we'll<00:03:01.820> see<00:03:01.970> how<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.239> one<00:03:02.450> starts<00:03:03.109> up

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.100

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
the cable in the back here see it's

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.140 
the cable in the back here see it's
working<00:04:35.229> really<00:04:35.500> good<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:38.520> we'll<00:04:39.520> put<00:04:39.940> the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.690 

and<00:04:48.470> now<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:48.800> HD<00:04:49.340> says<00:04:49.690> insert<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.840> disc<00:04:51.050> so

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.290 

and<00:05:02.770> this<00:05:03.310> one<00:05:03.490> actually<00:05:03.610> takes<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.060> little<00:05:04.180> bit

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
and this one actually takes a little bit

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.300 
and this one actually takes a little bit
longer<00:05:04.510> because<00:05:04.780> it<00:05:05.080> is<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.410> HD<00:05:05.770> one<00:05:05.950> so<00:05:06.220> it

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
longer because it is the HD one so it

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.690 
longer because it is the HD one so it
says<00:05:06.490> equals<00:05:07.000> 0<00:05:07.180> which<00:05:07.750> means<00:05:07.780> let's<00:05:08.230> go<00:05:11.700> but

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
says equals 0 which means let's go but

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.430 
says equals 0 which means let's go but
you<00:05:13.000> can<00:05:13.150> see<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.540> HD<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:13.930> still<00:05:14.140> working

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
you can see that the HD is still working

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:24.540 
you can see that the HD is still working
great
