00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
plane them yet but just to when I test

plane them yet but just to when I test
it<00:05:13.390> out<00:05:13.560> wearing<00:05:14.560> them<00:05:14.770> around<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.820> house<00:05:16.090> I

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
it out wearing them around the house I

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.570 
it out wearing them around the house I
can<00:05:16.960> feel<00:05:17.410> that<00:05:17.770> there<00:05:18.010> was<00:05:18.039> a<00:05:18.160> bit<00:05:18.370> more

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
can feel that there was a bit more

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.150 
can feel that there was a bit more
cushioning<00:05:19.060> than<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:20.039> ROS<00:05:21.300> 1.0<00:05:22.650> in<00:05:23.650> terms<00:05:23.979> of

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
cushioning than the ROS 1.0 in terms of

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.779 
cushioning than the ROS 1.0 in terms of
fit<00:05:24.490> it's<00:05:24.789> not<00:05:25.150> as<00:05:25.810> snug<00:05:26.320> as<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.800> 1.0<00:05:27.760> but<00:05:29.789> the

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:30.789 
fit it's not as snug as the 1.0 but the

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.719 
fit it's not as snug as the 1.0 but the
Sprint<00:05:31.240> skin<00:05:31.479> really<00:05:31.720> allows<00:05:32.169> for<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:33.100> better

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
Sprint skin really allows for a better

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.770 
Sprint skin really allows for a better
molding<00:05:34.360> to<00:05:34.600> your<00:05:34.810> foot<00:05:35.229> so<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:36.400> snugness<00:05:37.330> is

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
molding to your foot so the snugness is

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.190 
molding to your foot so the snugness is
there<00:05:38.020> like<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.380> fit<00:05:38.979> is<00:05:39.250> there<00:05:39.700> not<00:05:40.630> as<00:05:40.840> snug

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
there like the fit is there not as snug

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.640 
there like the fit is there not as snug
as<00:05:41.680> the<00:05:41.860> 1.0<00:05:42.520> but<00:05:43.500> very<00:05:44.500> good<00:05:44.740> nonetheless<00:05:45.450> I

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
as the 1.0 but very good nonetheless I

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.500 
as the 1.0 but very good nonetheless I
look<00:05:47.650> forward<00:05:47.979> to<00:05:48.039> testing<00:05:48.789> these<00:05:48.910> out<00:05:49.180> on<00:05:49.360> the

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
look forward to testing these out on the
