00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
is you supposed to know what this is

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
is you supposed to know what this is
it's<00:00:12.540> an<00:00:12.660> SG<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:14.809> it's<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.929> standard<00:00:16.379> tuning

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
it's an SG and it's in standard tuning

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.640 
it's an SG and it's in standard tuning
which<00:00:16.980> means<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:18.090> strings<00:00:18.420> are<00:00:18.630> e<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.080> d<00:00:19.529> g<00:00:19.560> b<00:00:20.039> e

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
which means the strings are e a d g b e

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
which means the strings are e a d g b e
i'll<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.859> how<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> play<00:00:23.130> glycerine<00:00:24.019> the

i'll show you how to play glycerine the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.930 
i'll show you how to play glycerine the
whole<00:00:25.170> song<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.710> only<00:00:25.859> four<00:00:26.220> chords

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.110 

there<00:00:31.940> on<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.150> first<00:00:32.750> fret

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
there on the first fret

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.120 

then<00:00:36.120> on<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> third<00:00:36.600> fret

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
then on the third fret

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.840 
then on the third fret
but<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.060> the<00:00:39.180> fifth<00:00:39.450> fret<00:00:40.310> then<00:00:41.310> on<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.610> first

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
but on the fifth fret then on the first

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.020 
but on the fifth fret then on the first
again<00:00:42.830> when<00:00:43.830> you<00:00:43.920> cross<00:00:44.190> strings<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.730> between

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
again when you cross strings in between

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.170 
again when you cross strings in between
so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.510> first<00:00:45.930> chord<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:47.220> on<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> E<00:00:47.460> string

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.700 

then<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.900> string<00:00:52.200> up<00:00:52.380> to<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
then you go one string up to the a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.099 
then you go one string up to the a
string<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.940> play<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> third<00:00:54.450> fret

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
string to play the third fret

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:57.899 
string to play the third fret
and<00:00:56.589> you<00:00:56.679> stay<00:00:56.949> on<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.219> a-string<00:00:57.370> for<00:00:57.850> the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
and you stay on the a-string for the

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.990 
and you stay on the a-string for the
fifth<00:00:58.120> fret

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
fifth fret

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.509 
fifth fret
and<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.329> stay<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> eastern<00:01:01.199> again<00:01:01.530> and

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
and you stay on the eastern again and

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.960 
and you stay on the eastern again and
you<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.670> back<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> first

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
you go back to the first

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.240 
you go back to the first
and<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.720> starts<00:01:05.990> all<00:01:06.080> over<00:01:06.200> again<00:01:06.380> so<00:01:07.160> it

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
and then it starts all over again so it

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:26.420 
and then it starts all over again so it
looks<00:01:07.430> like<00:01:07.580> this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.570 

now<00:01:27.430> if<00:01:27.550> they<00:01:27.670> use<00:01:27.850> those<00:01:28.150> chords<00:01:28.950> for<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
now if they use those chords for the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.360 
now if they use those chords for the
verses<00:01:31.240> and<00:01:31.510> most<00:01:32.260> of<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.530> chorus<00:01:32.890> except<00:01:33.250> for

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
verses and most of the chorus except for

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.240 
verses and most of the chorus except for
the<00:01:33.430> part<00:01:33.640> where<00:01:33.670> he<00:01:33.790> says<00:01:34.090> glycerine<00:01:34.630> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the part where he says glycerine and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.250 
the part where he says glycerine and
that's<00:01:36.250> where<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.520> change<00:01:36.820> same<00:01:37.660> chords<00:01:38.080> but

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
that's where you change same chords but

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.320 
that's where you change same chords but
a<00:01:38.320> different<00:01:38.770> pattern<00:01:38.950> where<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.700> go<00:01:39.940> first

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
a different pattern where you go first

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.380 
a different pattern where you go first
fret<00:01:40.660> on<00:01:40.690> the<00:01:40.810> e-string

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.010 

and<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.740> go<00:01:44.890> third<00:01:45.370> fret<00:01:45.700> again<00:01:46.360> on<00:01:46.720> the

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
and then you go third fret again on the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.130 
and then you go third fret again on the
a<00:01:47.050> string<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:48.330> then<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.450> just<00:01:49.630> go<00:01:49.750> back<00:01:49.960> down

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
a string and then you just go back down

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.830 
a string and then you just go back down
to<00:01:50.290> one<00:01:50.500> on<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.740> a<00:01:50.770> string

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
to one on the a string

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:05.520 
to one on the a string
and<00:01:53.350> then<00:01:53.500> back<00:01:53.619> down<00:01:53.649> to<00:01:53.799> me<00:01:54.009> again<00:01:54.310> like<00:01:54.700> this

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.969 

so<00:02:07.060> if<00:02:08.060> you're<00:02:08.479> not<00:02:09.020> playing<00:02:09.289> bar<00:02:09.560> chords

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
so if you're not playing bar chords

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
so if you're not playing bar chords
which<00:02:10.280> you're<00:02:10.459> probably<00:02:10.670> not<00:02:10.880> at<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.120> point

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
which you're probably not at this point

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.610 
which you're probably not at this point
you<00:02:12.140> can<00:02:12.319> use<00:02:12.500> these<00:02:12.709> power<00:02:13.010> chords<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:15.530> if

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
you can use these power chords see if

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.380 
you can use these power chords see if
you<00:02:15.739> can<00:02:15.890> see<00:02:16.160> them<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> little<00:02:16.489> closer<00:02:16.700> where

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
you can see them a little closer where

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.760 
you can see them a little closer where
you're<00:02:17.480> just<00:02:17.569> putting<00:02:17.750> your<00:02:17.870> first<00:02:18.260> finger<00:02:18.650> on

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
you're just putting your first finger on

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.720 
you're just putting your first finger on
the<00:02:18.860> E<00:02:19.280> or<00:02:19.730> over<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.060> root<00:02:20.239> is<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:21.400> then<00:02:22.400> your

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the E or over the root is and then your

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.770 
the E or over the root is and then your
pinkie<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.420> ring<00:02:23.660> finger<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:26.420> this<00:02:26.630> so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
pinkie and ring finger like this so

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.150 
pinkie and ring finger like this so
you're<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.020> playing<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.530> bottom<00:02:27.920> three

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
you're just playing the bottom three

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.100 
you're just playing the bottom three
strings

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:41.970 

in<00:02:31.650> which<00:02:31.800> case<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.190> would<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.490> this

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.570 

same<00:02:42.670> handshape<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.420> different<00:02:43.690> places

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.550 

so<00:02:52.580> for<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.910> verses<00:02:53.330> you're<00:02:53.990> gonna<00:02:54.140> use<00:02:54.380> some

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
so for the verses you're gonna use some

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.730 
so for the verses you're gonna use some
palm-muting<00:02:55.160> if<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.610> use<00:02:55.820> palm-muting

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
palm-muting if you can use palm-muting

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.170 
palm-muting if you can use palm-muting
which<00:02:57.740> is<00:02:57.890> resting<00:02:58.580> this<00:02:58.700> part<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.060> your<00:02:59.120> hand

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
which is resting this part of your hand

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.400 
which is resting this part of your hand
near<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.110> bridge<00:03:00.350> so<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:00.980> sounds<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.550> this

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.600 

instead<00:03:06.410> of<00:03:06.560> this

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.180 

so<00:03:12.610> I'll<00:03:12.850> play<00:03:13.030> through<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:13.510> verses<00:03:14.190> I'll

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
so I'll play through the verses I'll

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.530 
so I'll play through the verses I'll
play<00:03:15.370> through<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:15.700> vert<00:03:15.880> that<00:03:16.180> our<00:03:16.300> first
