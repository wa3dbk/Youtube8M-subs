they<00:01:42.930> need<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.380> fit<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.829> so-called

system<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.210> think<00:01:48.720> about<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.619> do<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:50.040> two

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
system so think about it we do use two

system so think about it we do use two
points<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.970> week<00:01:51.360> pistol<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> an

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
points on a week pistol and an

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.260 
points on a week pistol and an

attachment where for the same price you

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600

can<00:01:54.420> use<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.869> wild<00:01:55.290> card<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.860> pick<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.340> extra

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
can use a wild card and pick an extra

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.179 
can use a wild card and pick an extra
perk<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.990> wouldn't<00:01:58.320> make<00:01:58.560> sense<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:59.040> do

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189

perk you it wouldn't make sense to do
that<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.759> I've<00:02:00.420> talked<00:02:00.659> about<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> balance<00:02:01.170> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that so I've talked about the balance of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590 
that so I've talked about the balance of
pistols<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> picked<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.969> on<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.240> channel

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
pistols and the picked in on my channel

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.810 
pistols and the picked in on my channel
before<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.229> i<00:02:04.500> put<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> joyous<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> guys<00:02:05.610> who

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
before so i put a joyous to the guys who

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.389 
before so i put a joyous to the guys who
initially<00:02:06.090> sub<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.689> me<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.079> tsg<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.099> may

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
initially sub to me from tsg as this may

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.699 
initially sub to me from tsg as this may
seem<00:02:08.459> quite<00:02:09.030> familiar<00:02:09.239> but<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.899> strongly

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
seem quite familiar but I strongly

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.240 
seem quite familiar but I strongly
believe<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:11.400> could<00:02:11.640> have<00:02:11.760> been<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.910> simple<00:02:12.420> fix

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
believe it could have been a simple fix

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.850 
believe it could have been a simple fix
peak<00:02:13.460> 10<00:02:13.730> system<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.390> obviously<00:02:15.110> a<00:02:15.380> step<00:02:15.740> in

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
peak 10 system is obviously a step in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.920 
peak 10 system is obviously a step in
the<00:02:15.890> right<00:02:16.070> direction<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.390> needed<00:02:17.630> a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
the right direction it just needed a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.740 
the right direction it just needed a
little<00:02:17.960> more<00:02:18.470> fault<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.010> mean<00:02:19.640> would<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.600> have

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
little more fault I mean would it have

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.690 
little more fault I mean would it have
been<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.140> difficult<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.130> make<00:02:22.310> different

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
been that difficult to make different

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.460 
been that difficult to make different
items<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.240> attachments<00:02:23.780> different<00:02:24.110> values

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
items and attachments different values

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.800 
items and attachments different values
could<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.460> pistol<00:02:25.880> have<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.210> been<00:02:26.390> made<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
could a pistol have not been made to the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.710 
could a pistol have not been made to the
value<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.290> that's<00:02:27.770> a<00:02:28.160> half<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.700> point<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.210> have

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
value of that's a half a point and have

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.900 
value of that's a half a point and have
attachments<00:02:30.350> for<00:02:30.470> pistols<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.920> only<00:02:31.340> half<00:02:31.760> a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
attachments for pistols that only half a

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.300 
attachments for pistols that only half a
point<00:02:32.060> each<00:02:32.300> also<00:02:32.570> this<00:02:33.470> would<00:02:33.650> make<00:02:33.800> pistols

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
point each also this would make pistols

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.520 
point each also this would make pistols
to<00:02:34.550> be<00:02:34.640> used<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.180> their<00:02:35.390> intended<00:02:35.750> purpose<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
to be used as their intended purpose and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.190 
to be used as their intended purpose and
that's<00:02:37.070> a<00:02:37.280> secondary<00:02:37.700> gun<00:02:37.970> I<00:02:38.180> should<00:02:38.900> not<00:02:39.080> be

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
that's a secondary gun I should not be

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.660 
that's a secondary gun I should not be
able<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.440> go<00:02:39.530> around<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.100> dominate<00:02:40.490> with

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
able to go around and dominate with

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.520 
able to go around and dominate with
secondary<00:02:41.090> weapon<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.900> community<00:02:42.380> would

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
secondary weapon the community would

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.230 
secondary weapon the community would
understand<00:02:43.100> that<00:02:43.340> as<00:02:43.490> these<00:02:43.760> are<00:02:43.940> less<00:02:44.090> in

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
understand that as these are less in

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.699 
understand that as these are less in
value<00:02:44.570> they<00:02:44.810> are<00:02:44.870> not<00:02:45.080> going<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.530> as

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
value they are not going to be as

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.770 
value they are not going to be as
powerful<00:02:46.070> would<00:02:46.940> pistol<00:02:47.300> still<00:02:47.540> have<00:02:47.630> been

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
powerful would pistol still have been

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
powerful would pistol still have been
picked<00:02:48.020> well<00:02:48.680> yeah<00:02:48.920> because<00:02:49.280> there<00:02:49.790> are<00:02:49.910> less

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
picked well yeah because there are less

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.880 
picked well yeah because there are less
in<00:02:50.270> point<00:02:50.510> value<00:02:50.810> it<00:02:51.020> still<00:02:51.320> gives<00:02:51.530> enough

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
in point value it still gives enough

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.740 
in point value it still gives enough
points<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.340> build<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.670> good<00:02:52.850> class<00:02:53.150> setup<00:02:53.570> and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
points to build a good class setup and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.600 
points to build a good class setup and
resorts<00:02:54.200> your<00:02:54.350> pistol<00:02:54.739> if<00:02:54.830> necessary<00:02:55.400> I

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
resorts your pistol if necessary I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.190 
resorts your pistol if necessary I
believe<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.600> would<00:02:56.750> have<00:02:56.840> worked<00:02:56.870> for

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
believe this would have worked for

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.949 
believe this would have worked for
attachments<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:57.980> lethal<00:02:58.550> to<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.840> example

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
attachments and lethal to for example

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.710 
attachments and lethal to for example
let's<00:03:00.920> say<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.130> reflex<00:03:01.760> sight<00:03:02.060> would<00:03:02.330> be<00:03:02.480> one

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
let's say a reflex sight would be one

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.380 
let's say a reflex sight would be one
point<00:03:03.050> quick-draw<00:03:03.709> would<00:03:03.860> be<00:03:04.010> one<00:03:04.520> point<00:03:04.820> but

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
point quick-draw would be one point but

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.630 
point quick-draw would be one point but
silence<00:03:05.900> are<00:03:06.080> very<00:03:06.590> popular<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.220> keeps<00:03:07.489> you

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
silence are very popular and keeps you

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.150 
silence are very popular and keeps you
very<00:03:07.670> stealthy<00:03:08.420> so<00:03:09.050> let's<00:03:09.290> say<00:03:09.560> will<00:03:10.010> make

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
very stealthy so let's say will make

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.490 
very stealthy so let's say will make
this<00:03:10.310> one<00:03:10.520> point<00:03:10.790> five<00:03:10.940> points<00:03:11.390> oh<00:03:11.540> you<00:03:12.380> know

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
this one point five points oh you know

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.290 
this one point five points oh you know
if<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.160> want<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:13.459> that<00:03:13.610> douchebag<00:03:14.150> who

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
if you want to be that douchebag who

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.210 
if you want to be that douchebag who
uses<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.660> target<00:03:15.110> finder<00:03:15.320> well<00:03:15.860> let's<00:03:16.040> make

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
uses a target finder well let's make

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.030 
uses a target finder well let's make
this<00:03:16.370> one<00:03:16.550> point<00:03:16.820> five<00:03:17.060> points<00:03:17.570> also<00:03:18.040> actually

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
this one point five points also actually

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.770 
this one point five points also actually
not<00:03:19.250> make<00:03:19.580> it<00:03:19.730> too<00:03:19.970> as<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.269> hate<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.630> that<00:03:20.660> much

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
not make it too as I hate it that much

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.320 
not make it too as I hate it that much

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
for the different perks I believe this

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.250 
for the different perks I believe this
could<00:04:22.880> have<00:04:23.000> worked<00:04:23.120> in<00:04:23.360> black<00:04:23.539> ops<00:04:23.690> 2<00:04:23.810> also

could have worked in black ops 2 also
but<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.770> mean<00:04:25.220> would<00:04:25.430> everyone<00:04:25.700> run<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.270> holy

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
but I mean would everyone run the holy

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.810 
but I mean would everyone run the holy
Trinity<00:04:27.260> if<00:04:27.500> they<00:04:27.710> were<00:04:27.770> more<00:04:28.220> value<00:04:28.639> than<00:04:28.669> the

Trinity if they were more value than the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
other perks probably not but I hope if

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.490 
other perks probably not but I hope if
