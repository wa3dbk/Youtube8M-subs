00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 we need is a high wall in front of the trowel plays in a very dark 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.670
 Scenario to 41 7 years out of fear Wenger is in a huge marriage before the murders 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.240
 Surrounded by their complete extinction wants this year &amp; Spa the game offers all 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.500
 For example, the elements of the traditional Fanta say it and place 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.130
 like 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.330
 but the action takes place in the distant future 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.990
 at arms artec IT we really have the license in our hearts source 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.440
 worked for a long time with the Games Workshop hammer drill before the credits 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.310
 Sensi because of this license exchanges want the English and violence right 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.310
 sore 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.960
 Today in our game they are sent on a small planet 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 an industrialized world there weapons are made for the war 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.210
 Uprooted York has surfaced to hold a titanic Titan in their hands 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 to get 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.660
 that is so wonderful 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.640
 The Titan are huge war machines made of metal wood whole cities 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.570
 If the local army could tackle it could count countless 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 Destroy Vallotton and they would be a real threat to the Empire of 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.720
 mankind 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.830
 Sven Schmid both versions Space Marines were initially normal people 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.610
 But we are promoting a rigorous training and physical transformation 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.150
 Almost as demigods often have new organs implanted on their bodies 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.650
 her strength will multiply as well as her resilience will occur 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.050
 the limitation to usable 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.580
 Captain Titus is the protagonist of this storey he is the main character he owns 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.290
 the ability to interpret the rules in their own way 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.120
 Other characters investor you however also have other views like 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.570
 these rules should be interpreted 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.030
 The main threats to Space Marian are the orchestras they are brutal 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.499
 animal and barbaric creatures 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.510
 OT place are just one of many peoples in the fiction we find them 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.430
 Particularly suitable as opponents for the Space Marines Space Marines are very 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:22.669
 Seriously very controlled York are pretty chaotic wild and violent 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:26.009
 So we have a good contrast heart 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:30.159
 and some of the place are like Chaman they have Sardinian powers as well 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.119
 since they are despite that, these little mean vassals and then there is 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.599
 nor does he resemble the services of Ishmael in size and mass he is in fact 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.969
 even bigger 3 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.989
 the list is he, there are other shadowy powers in the background 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:44.520
 farmers 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.000
 and Titus and the player have to face them when they spend the world 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.440
 Space Pavilion has an interesting aesthetic scenario 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.200
 Architecture with futuristic cockpit animals everything has critical proportions everything 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.710
 is huge this world has a certain beauty but there is also 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.850
 a lot of darkness death and destruction these contrasts create a canvas 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.769
 where we can paint 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.040
 it's just a huge science fiction television series Verso it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.680
 Not just my place invading a factory world is the story 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.150
 has much more depth there is unpredictable twist there 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.750
 Traitor the action is incredibly intense 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.300
 really everyone first time are the brand's mobile variety Blockmaster 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.240
 Entertainment market now we just know lying
