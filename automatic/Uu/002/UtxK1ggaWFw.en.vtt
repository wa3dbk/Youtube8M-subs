00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
interrupt ability then you can use

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.999

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
in-game sounds and animations but that's

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249

an add-on for this purpose I used in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.990 
an add-on for this purpose I used in

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.480 
used around you and how much time you
have<00:01:39.689> until<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.290> become<00:01:40.650> potential<00:01:41.189> threats

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
have until they become potential threats

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
have until they become potential threats
again<00:01:42.049> also<00:01:43.049> there<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.290> four<00:01:43.649> different<00:01:44.009> ways

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
again also there are four different ways

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.920 
again also there are four different ways
you<00:01:44.189> can<00:01:44.369> start<00:01:44.729> casting<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.240> spell<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.780> can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
you can start casting a spell you can

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
you can start casting a spell you can
jump<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.439> can<00:01:46.560> move

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
jump you can move

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.789 
jump you can move
can<00:01:47.399> escape<00:01:47.969> or<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.049> use<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> stop<00:01:49.530> casting

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
can escape or you can use a stop casting

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.609 
can escape or you can use a stop casting
macro<00:01:50.399> as<00:01:50.640> an<00:01:51.359> elemental<00:01:51.840> shaman<00:01:52.200> some<00:01:52.530> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
macro as an elemental shaman some of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.020 
macro as an elemental shaman some of
your<00:01:52.770> spell's<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.100> cancel<00:01:53.429> when<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.819> move

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
your spell's don't cancel when you move

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.029 
your spell's don't cancel when you move
like<00:01:54.299> lightning<00:01:54.509> bolt<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.710> you're<00:01:55.829> probably

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
like lightning bolt so you're probably

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.679 
like lightning bolt so you're probably
going<00:01:56.429> to<00:01:56.490> want<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> use<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> last<00:01:57.479> two

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
going to want to use one of the last two

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.840 
going to want to use one of the last two
options<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.439> personally<00:01:59.219> just<00:01:59.250> hit<00:01:59.549> escape

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
options I personally just hit escape

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.550 
options I personally just hit escape
when<00:02:00.179> fake<00:02:00.390> casting<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.959> lightning<00:02:01.350> bolt

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
when fake casting with lightning bolt

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
when fake casting with lightning bolt
and<00:02:01.850> there's<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:02.939> more<00:02:03.270> thing<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.840> would<00:02:03.959> like

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
and there's one more thing I would like

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.199 
and there's one more thing I would like
to<00:02:04.140> add<00:02:04.350> fake<00:02:04.859> casting<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.369> very<00:02:05.579> simple<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.060> do

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
to add fake casting is very simple to do

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.839 
to add fake casting is very simple to do
all<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.599> have<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.869> do<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.170> press<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:07.799> key<00:02:07.849> but

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
all you have to do is press one key but

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.150 
all you have to do is press one key but
unfortunately<00:02:09.170> it's<00:02:10.170> not<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.739> using<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
unfortunately it's not like using a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.339 
unfortunately it's not like using a
simple<00:02:11.430> spell<00:02:11.750> fooling<00:02:12.750> someone<00:02:13.170> isn't

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
simple spell fooling someone isn't

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.350 
simple spell fooling someone isn't
always<00:02:13.590> reliable<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.879> no<00:02:15.150> way<00:02:15.299> to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
always reliable there's no way to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.729 
always reliable there's no way to
predict<00:02:15.810> whether<00:02:15.989> someone's<00:02:16.500> going<00:02:16.709> to

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
predict whether someone's going to

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.490 
predict whether someone's going to
interrupt<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.489> or<00:02:17.700> not<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.420> why<00:02:18.780> as<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
interrupt you or not this is why as I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.289 
interrupt you or not this is why as I
said<00:02:19.560> before<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:20.400> need<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.579> learn<00:02:20.879> from<00:02:21.150> your

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299
