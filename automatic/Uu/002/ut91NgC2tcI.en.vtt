00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.570
 first of all that we will need to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.370
 You will need the dough for 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.510
 Amazon I did not even say I voted 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.030
 cut in size are you lose do it 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.570
 What you cut takes more or less 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.820
 half of it and cuts will cut according to 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 He's the second one of you here already. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.480

 cut will give but she will stay in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.350
 two parts 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.760
 then you'll need it 's like in 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 recipe like his 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.600
 You'll need something to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 It's very good being able to be serving. 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 like a rope with a speck here 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.900
 our canelone, so I'm 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 using creamy curd you can 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.140
 be using red sauce you cut 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 the white sauce 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 You may be using what you 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.560
 I preferred it, I'm nothing, okay, I'm 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.829
 saying is that there is a creamy catupiry 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.220
 so you'll get one of the most 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.439
 expected from the masses 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.520
 you will spend Christmas in our house 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.920
 Carbon endangered if I know what it is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.009
 of your preference and that being 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.979
 half coarse understood is to stay very 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:51.770
 very much that thing a water and sediments 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:57.090
 existing here the one slice of ham 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 As I said the recipe rondelli is not 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.270
 can be put first ham cheese 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.970
 ham perceives as a 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.800
 provided its process 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:15.510
 if canelone ok so now it's simple is 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.290
 only to donate just get it here 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.000

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.030
 creamy curd will remain a little 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.890
