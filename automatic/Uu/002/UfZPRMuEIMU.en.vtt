00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.650
 a friend speaks to them doctor octavio mancio 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.720
 chief of clinical pharmacology service of the general hospital of mexico 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.109
 mobile what we're going to review this medicine kinetic drug 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.449
 I thank wing 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.449
 National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Institute 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.840
 national medical education program has invited me to practice with 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.490
 before starting what are the pharmacokinetic aspects of medications I 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.430
 would like to talk about a fundamental issue that are the pharmaceutical forms 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.570
 and everything related to the pharmaceutical aspects 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 as you will remember 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 the pharmaceutical 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.250
 the ariake in relation to chemistry 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.270
 comply 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.300
 with medicine 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.250
 the pharmaceutical forms 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.720
 basically 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.830
 they are 1 is one of the characteristics 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.150
 define the medicines 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.190
 as you see 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.050
 This pharmaceutical form will allow me to administer the medication to 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.940
 produce telefeet practical cotera 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.420
 this pharmaceutical form will be conformed 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.500
 for the active principle 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.540
 i wolves additives beginners 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.220
 what will they allow me 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.740
 keep in this pharmaceutical form 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.779
 inside of them we find antioxidant coloring flavors 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.140
 how to be later 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.930
 they will allow 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.480
 that many patients 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.480
 fly handle the medicine 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.690
 as it is defined to the most erotic formation 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.920
 the pharmaceutical forms 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.960
 they are the mixture of 1 or more drugs 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.340
 with additives 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.470
 that presents characteristics and physical 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.099
 that they will allow us little will allow us 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.349
 manage 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.729
 by way of 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.740
 adequate dosage 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.920
 they will allow me to keep the medication especially 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.889
 in the primary reservoir 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:22.439
 And above all they will allow me 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.339
 know the bioavailability of the medicine 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:29.639
 all pharmaceutical form 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.650
 opel stopped pharmaceutical 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.419
 it must be previously evaluated 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.350
 through indy entity purity tests 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.579
 and because 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.109
 the latter is the lazio nothing intimately 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.289
 the therapeutic aspects 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:50.539
 of him drug or active substance 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:53.849
 the proof of identity basically consists of one hundred 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:55.839
 establish 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.990
 what the active principle 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.269
 It really is the substance that will make up the medicine 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.119
 about 15 years ago 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.379
 a laboratory wrongly 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.649
 at the time of packaging the medication 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:14.709
 proof of identity 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.989
 a fresh product on the market showed that the drug was a 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.309
 once a corticosteroid and two because only to do 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.579
 specific 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.769
 at the time of currency the boxes carries a name of a betablocker a program 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:34.869
 It is important that this proof of identity 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.869
 be on the ice during the process 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:40.779
 elaboration of the formula for 

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:46.159
 be sure peckel the medication that if you are still corresponds to the 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.339
 substance or active principle that made it ineffective 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.449
 the purity pen 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:55.280
 possibly not in these medicines are between 90 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.589
 95 percent purity 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.849
 versus the injectable solutions have up to almost 100% 

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:03.490
 they are accompanied by some 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.529
 accompanying substances but the idea is 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.499
 p the drug 

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:10.149
 ming be accompanied 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:15.199
 d the substances that do not see anything ap modify the crack response 

00:04:16.559 --> 00:04:18.609
 and finally the power 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.590
 basically has to do with the expiration date 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.990
 the expiration date 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.139
 will bring us to Israel the laboratory 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.610
 that until that date for example February 2011 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.139
 the medication has a 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:34.479
 power 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.449
 above 90 percent 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.539
 after that date 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.099
 the medicine starts to lose this icp potency and this is to say the 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.659
 pharmacological activity because storage conditions of optimal 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.819
 porter and america doctor or by patients 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.749
 they no longer guarantee me a power 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:54.839
 above 90
