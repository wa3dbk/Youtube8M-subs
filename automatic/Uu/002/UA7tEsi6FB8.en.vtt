00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:28.510 
switches which I assume what to tell you

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.510 
switches which I assume what to tell you
which<00:06:28.630> track<00:06:28.930> was<00:06:29.140> on<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.620> no<00:06:29.890> that's<00:06:30.280> where

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
which track was on and no that's where

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.400 
which track was on and no that's where
you<00:06:30.700> hit<00:06:30.910> all<00:06:31.060> your<00:06:31.210> little<00:06:31.419> transformers<00:06:32.320> oh

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
you hit all your little transformers oh

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.680 
you hit all your little transformers oh
I<00:06:32.470> see<00:06:32.860> it<00:06:33.100> takes<00:06:33.340> to<00:06:33.580> have<00:06:33.730> a<00:06:33.760> big<00:06:34.030> layout<00:06:34.419> you

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690 
I see it takes to have a big layout you

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.930 
I see it takes to have a big layout you
I<00:06:34.870> have<00:06:35.110> five<00:06:35.380> transformers<00:06:36.250> over<00:06:36.430> the<00:06:36.580> table

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
I have five transformers over the table

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.790 
I have five transformers over the table
the<00:06:37.330> kids<00:06:37.600> in<00:06:37.810> those<00:06:37.930> days<00:06:38.260> would<00:06:38.500> put<00:06:38.710> the

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
the kids in those days would put the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.800 
the kids in those days would put the
transformers<00:06:39.610> inside<00:06:40.060> of<00:06:40.240> the<00:06:40.330> power<00:06:40.540> house

transformers inside of the power house

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.870 
transformers inside of the power house
where<00:06:41.320> else<00:06:41.560> and<00:06:42.190> then<00:06:42.340> they'd<00:06:42.460> take<00:06:42.640> their

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 
where else and then they'd take their

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.150 
where else and then they'd take their
lead<00:06:43.090> lines<00:06:43.419> off<00:06:43.750> the<00:06:43.990> switches<00:06:44.470> what

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
lead lines off the switches what

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.950 
lead lines off the switches what
determines<00:06:45.790> now<00:06:45.970> you<00:06:46.030> gave<00:06:46.270> us<00:06:46.390> a<00:06:46.540> hint<00:06:46.750> here

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
determines now you gave us a hint here

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.230 
determines now you gave us a hint here
but<00:06:47.260> the<00:06:47.410> more<00:06:47.590> expensive<00:06:47.979> sets<00:06:48.490> back<00:06:48.970> then

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
but the more expensive sets back then

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.360 
but the more expensive sets back then
are<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:49.630> rarest<00:06:49.990> sets<00:06:50.350> now<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:50.620> hardest<00:06:51.160> ones

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
are the rarest sets now the hardest ones

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.490 
are the rarest sets now the hardest ones
to<00:06:51.460> find<00:06:51.820> well<00:06:52.240> and<00:06:52.419> some<00:06:52.720> of<00:06:52.870> the<00:06:52.960> cheapest

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.500 
to find well and some of the cheapest

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.010 
to find well and some of the cheapest
sets<00:06:53.740> back<00:06:54.100> then<00:06:54.460> are<00:06:54.790> some<00:06:55.630> of<00:06:55.780> the<00:06:55.840> hardest

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
sets back then are some of the hardest

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.870 
sets back then are some of the hardest
things<00:06:56.380> to<00:06:56.500> find<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.040> therefore<00:06:57.460> some<00:06:57.729> of<00:06:57.760> the

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
things to find and therefore some of the

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.180 
things to find and therefore some of the
most<00:06:58.060> expensive<00:06:58.510> is<00:06:58.930> antiques<00:06:59.530> and<00:06:59.950> that

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:00.190 
most expensive is antiques and that

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.130 
most expensive is antiques and that
turns<00:07:00.460> out<00:07:00.669> so<00:07:00.880> many<00:07:01.030> times<00:07:01.419> like<00:07:01.750> the

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
turns out so many times like the

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.780 
turns out so many times like the
hollered<00:07:02.560> company<00:07:03.040> that<00:07:03.190> invented<00:07:03.520> the

hollered company that invented the
