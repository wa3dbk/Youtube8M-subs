lifting weight you're working your
biceps<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:42.150> going<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.330> get<00:01:42.420> more

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
biceps the you're going to get more

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.510 
biceps the you're going to get more
blood<00:01:42.840> pumped<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.409> biceps<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.280> your

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
blood pumped to your biceps and your

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.280 
blood pumped to your biceps and your
arms<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.330> can<00:01:45.450> pump<00:01:45.630> out<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:45.990> reps

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
arms so that you can pump out more reps

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.469 
arms so that you can pump out more reps
and<00:01:46.890> by<00:01:47.040> pumping<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.490> more<00:01:47.670> reps<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.330> get

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and by pumping out more reps you can get

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.980 
and by pumping out more reps you can get
stronger<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:51.330> works<00:01:51.509> pretty<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
stronger so it works pretty much the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.750 
stronger so it works pretty much the
same<00:01:52.259> for<00:01:52.380> any<00:01:52.560> body<00:01:52.740> part

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
you've worked out you've noticed your

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.050 
you've worked out you've noticed your
friends<00:02:04.420> gotten<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.720> little<00:02:04.870> smaller<00:02:05.230> so<00:02:06.060> it

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
friends gotten a little smaller so it

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.730 
friends gotten a little smaller so it
happens<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.149> really<00:02:10.479> good

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
happens but this is a really good

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.380 
happens but this is a really good
probably<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.830> best<00:02:12.100> pre<00:02:12.550> workout<00:02:12.910> drink<00:02:12.940> i

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
probably the best pre workout drink i

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.480 
probably the best pre workout drink i
would<00:02:13.540> say<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.870> market<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.490> the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
would say on the market right now the

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.410 
would say on the market right now the
problem<00:02:15.700> is<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.210> sometimes<00:02:16.570> you'll<00:02:17.020> have<00:02:17.170> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
problem is that sometimes you'll have a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.150 
problem is that sometimes you'll have a
crash<00:02:19.420> effect<00:02:19.840> and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
crash effect and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.600 
crash effect and
I've<00:02:21.340> experienced<00:02:22.120> it<00:02:22.210> myself<00:02:22.300> before<00:02:23.040> if<00:02:24.040> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
I've experienced it myself before if you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.220 
I've experienced it myself before if you
take<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.060> on<00:02:25.300> an<00:02:25.390> empty<00:02:25.510> stomach<00:02:25.840> like<00:02:26.110> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
take this on an empty stomach like it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.080 
take this on an empty stomach like it
recommends<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:27.070> don't<00:02:27.640> really<00:02:27.760> know<00:02:27.940> what

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
recommends I don't really know what

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.190 
recommends I don't really know what
happens<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:28.600> I've<00:02:28.810> never<00:02:28.840> done<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
happens because I've never done that

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.660 
happens because I've never done that
before<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.710> think<00:02:29.890> that's<00:02:30.040> quite<00:02:30.190> stupid

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
before and I think that's quite stupid

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.820 
before and I think that's quite stupid
so<00:02:30.850> I<00:02:30.910> I<00:02:31.180> usually<00:02:31.570> take<00:02:31.720> this<00:02:31.900> after<00:02:32.590> I've<00:02:32.680> had

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
so I I usually take this after I've had

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.770 
so I I usually take this after I've had
a<00:02:32.860> meal<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.670> I'm<00:02:33.850> ready<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.090> work<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.450> i<00:02:34.510> take

a meal and I'm ready to work out i take

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.010 
a meal and I'm ready to work out i take

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
this 30 minutes before a workout and it

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.450 
this 30 minutes before a workout and it
gives<00:02:38.140> me<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.410> energy<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.740> about<00:02:38.920> 15<00:02:39.280> minutes

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
gives me the energy in about 15 minutes

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.550 
gives me the energy in about 15 minutes
and<00:02:39.700> it<00:02:40.360> stays<00:02:40.660> with<00:02:40.840> me<00:02:40.960> for<00:02:41.140> about<00:02:41.230> two<00:02:41.530> hours

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
and it stays with me for about two hours

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.420 
and it stays with me for about two hours
that<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.520> a<00:02:42.550> good<00:02:42.820> black<00:02:43.690> powder<00:02:43.960> take<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.560> bad

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
that is a good black powder take a bad

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.620 
that is a good black powder take a bad

effect<00:02:49.990> in<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.530> beginning<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:50.950> about<00:02:51.190> 20

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
effect in the beginning but about 20

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.620 
effect in the beginning but about 20
minutes<00:02:51.700> later<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:52.120> just<00:02:52.150> feel<00:02:52.450> terrible

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
minutes later you just feel terrible

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.750 
minutes later you just feel terrible
like<00:02:52.960> you're<00:02:53.110> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> puke<00:02:53.560> and<00:02:53.800> you<00:02:54.520> can't

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
like you're going to puke and you can't

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.390 
like you're going to puke and you can't
work<00:02:54.910> out<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.270> just<00:02:55.480> crash<00:02:55.860> I've<00:02:56.860> experienced

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
work out you just crash I've experienced

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.100 
work out you just crash I've experienced
both<00:02:57.550> before<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.210> a<00:02:58.600> lot<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.750> their<00:02:58.930> views

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
both before and a lot of their views

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
both before and a lot of their views
online<00:02:59.400> talk<00:03:00.400> about<00:03:00.670> both<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.680> I<00:03:02.680> think<00:03:02.740> this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
online talk about both and I think this

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.280 
online talk about both and I think this
is<00:03:03.190> kind<00:03:03.490> of<00:03:03.520> a<00:03:03.610> hit<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:03.880> miss<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:05.140> day

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
is kind of a hit or miss so one day

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.600 
is kind of a hit or miss so one day
it'll<00:03:05.470> be<00:03:05.590> great<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.070> next<00:03:06.310> day<00:03:06.400> will<00:03:06.520> be

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
it'll be great the next day will be

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.530 
it'll be great the next day will be
terrible<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:08.200> can't<00:03:08.440> really<00:03:09.120> fix<00:03:10.120> that<00:03:10.360> it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
terrible you can't really fix that it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.140 
terrible you can't really fix that it's
just<00:03:10.720> part<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.170> product<00:03:11.670> but<00:03:12.670> when<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.120> is

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
just part of the product but when it is

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.880 
just part of the product but when it is
good<00:03:13.570> which<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.050> about<00:03:14.200> fifty<00:03:14.500> percent<00:03:14.530> of<00:03:14.800> the

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
good which is about fifty percent of the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.120 
good which is about fifty percent of the
time<00:03:15.810> so<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:16.930> preparation<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.680> black<00:03:17.860> powder

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
time so the preparation for black powder

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.420 
time so the preparation for black powder
is<00:03:18.250> pretty<00:03:18.490> simple<00:03:18.730> mix<00:03:19.300> one<00:03:19.510> scoop<00:03:19.780> with

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
is pretty simple mix one scoop with

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.480 
is pretty simple mix one scoop with
about<00:03:21.430> eight<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:22.150> 12<00:03:22.420> ounces<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.840> water<00:03:23.050> I

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
about eight to 12 ounces of water I

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.340 
about eight to 12 ounces of water I
prefer<00:03:24.490> that<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.209> mix<00:03:25.510> it<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.840> don't<00:03:26.080> shake

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
prefer that you mix it and don't shake

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.080 
prefer that you mix it and don't shake
it<00:03:26.380> because<00:03:26.709> it's<00:03:26.890> carbonated<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.760> when<00:03:28.000> you

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
it because it's carbonated so when you

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.020 
it because it's carbonated so when you
shake<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.570> don't<00:03:28.840> get<00:03:28.959> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
shake it you don't get the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.630 
shake it you don't get the
nated<00:03:30.420> effect<00:03:30.690> but<00:03:31.500> when<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:31.980> stir<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.250> it

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
nated effect but when you stir it it

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.410 
nated effect but when you stir it it
gets<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.850> lot<00:03:32.970> bigger<00:03:33.240> than<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.450> expands<00:03:33.959> so

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
gets a lot bigger than it expands so

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.490 
gets a lot bigger than it expands so
another<00:03:36.420> thing<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.810> that<00:03:36.840> this<00:03:37.080> has<00:03:37.260> caffeine

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
another thing is that this has caffeine

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.720 
another thing is that this has caffeine
in<00:03:37.860> it

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.759 

I've<00:03:42.000> had<00:03:42.180> people<00:03:42.239> that<00:03:42.659> use<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.290> it's

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
I've had people that use it and it's

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:44.809 
I've had people that use it and it's
hard<00:03:43.950> for<00:03:43.980> them<00:03:44.129> to<00:03:44.159> go<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.310> sleep<00:03:44.580> after

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
hard for them to go to sleep after

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.570 
hard for them to go to sleep after
taking<00:03:45.330> this<00:03:45.510> I<00:03:45.750> took<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.860> I<00:03:47.190> was<00:03:47.370> able<00:03:47.430> to

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
taking this I took it and I was able to

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.280 
taking this I took it and I was able to
go<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.700> sleep<00:03:47.819> fine<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.420> i<00:03:48.450> did<00:03:48.720> wake<00:03:48.870> up<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.140> lot

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
go to sleep fine but i did wake up a lot

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.600

during the night and just kind of sit

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.000 
during the night and just kind of sit
there<00:03:50.760> for<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:50.970> while<00:03:51.090> so<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.860> caffeine<00:03:52.860> in

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
there for a while so that is caffeine in

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.610 
there for a while so that is caffeine in
here<00:03:53.220> so<00:03:53.940> let's<00:03:54.209> just<00:03:54.420> head<00:03:54.480> up

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.320 

it's<00:03:58.159> got<00:03:58.280> a<00:03:58.310> warning<00:03:58.519> label<00:03:58.730> here<00:03:59.120> because

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
it's got a warning label here because

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.509 
it's got a warning label here because
it's<00:03:59.480> pretty<00:03:59.720> strong<00:04:00.049> it<00:04:00.500> does<00:04:00.739> get<00:04:01.400> your

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
it's pretty strong it does get your

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.949 
it's pretty strong it does get your
heart<00:04:01.700> rate<00:04:01.849> up<00:04:01.879> really<00:04:02.150> high<00:04:02.330> because<00:04:02.720> you're

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
heart rate up really high because you're

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.780 
heart rate up really high because you're
pumping<00:04:03.290> out<00:04:03.379> so<00:04:03.739> much<00:04:03.890> reps<00:04:04.220> from

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
pumping out so much reps from

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.940 
pumping out so much reps from
the<00:04:06.360> energy<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.140> blood<00:04:07.349> pumping<00:04:07.530> that

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
the energy and the blood pumping that

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.289 
the energy and the blood pumping that
you<00:04:08.099> don't<00:04:08.250> really<00:04:08.370> realize<00:04:08.610> how<00:04:08.790> hard<00:04:09.180> you're

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
you don't really realize how hard you're

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.020 
you don't really realize how hard you're
pushing<00:04:09.329> yourselves<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.890> did<00:04:11.579> it<00:04:11.670> work<00:04:11.790> out<00:04:11.909> the

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
pushing yourselves I did it work out the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.580 
pushing yourselves I did it work out the
other<00:04:12.120> day<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.689> think<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.019> was<00:04:13.109> shoulders<00:04:13.409> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
other day I think it was shoulders and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.070 
other day I think it was shoulders and
arms

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
arms

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.660 
arms
and<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.770> know<00:04:15.890> I<00:04:15.920> was<00:04:16.040> just<00:04:16.280> going<00:04:16.459> real

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
and you know I was just going real

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.460 
and you know I was just going real
hardcore<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.299> didn't<00:04:17.570> realize<00:04:17.959> how

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
hardcore and I didn't realize how

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.930 
hardcore and I didn't realize how
hardcore<00:04:18.769> i<00:04:18.950> was<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:19.459> i<00:04:19.610> would<00:04:19.730> definitely

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
hardcore i was going i would definitely

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.930 
hardcore i was going i would definitely
recommend<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:20.450> take<00:04:20.630> this

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.480 

just<00:04:23.600> once<00:04:23.840> days<00:04:24.230> all<00:04:24.710> you<00:04:24.860> need<00:04:24.890> this<00:04:25.190> just

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
just once days all you need this just

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.550 
just once days all you need this just
pre<00:04:25.700> workout<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.960> don't<00:04:27.110> need<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.290> tell<00:04:27.470> you

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
pre workout you don't need to tell you

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.540 
pre workout you don't need to tell you
when<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.770> wake<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.280> or<00:04:28.460> anything

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
when you wake up or anything

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.780 
when you wake up or anything
because<00:04:30.560> it'll<00:04:31.560> be<00:04:31.590> like<00:04:31.890> Red<00:04:32.220> Bulls<00:04:32.460> this<00:04:32.640> is

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
because it'll be like Red Bulls this is

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.420 
because it'll be like Red Bulls this is
like<00:04:32.940> red<00:04:33.540> bull<00:04:33.750> and<00:04:34.020> monster<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:34.980> extreme

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
like red bull and monster to the extreme

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.250 
like red bull and monster to the extreme
basically<00:04:36.210> this<00:04:36.750> one<00:04:36.960> is<00:04:37.080> blue<00:04:37.260> raspberry<00:04:37.470> and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
basically this one is blue raspberry and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.500 
basically this one is blue raspberry and
it's<00:04:40.260> actually<00:04:40.620> probably<00:04:41.120> it's<00:04:42.120> pretty<00:04:42.300> good

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
it's actually probably it's pretty good

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.600 
it's actually probably it's pretty good
you<00:04:42.720> can<00:04:42.840> see<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.110> little<00:04:43.260> smoke<00:04:44.250> that<00:04:44.430> come

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
you can see the little smoke that come

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.860 
you can see the little smoke that come
out<00:04:44.730> because<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.060> like<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.360> carbonated

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
out because it's like that carbonated

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.970 
out because it's like that carbonated
stuff<00:04:46.080> I<00:04:46.230> was<00:04:46.350> talking<00:04:46.650> about

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
stuff I was talking about

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.439 
stuff I was talking about
and

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
and

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.030 
and
so<00:04:49.870> it<00:04:50.050> looks<00:04:50.229> like

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
so it looks like

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.880 
so it looks like
you<00:04:52.400> can<00:04:52.520> see<00:04:52.760> all<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.260> hippie<00:04:54.260> smoke<00:04:54.560> coming

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
you can see all the hippie smoke coming

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.060 
you can see all the hippie smoke coming
out

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
out

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.300 
out
so<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:57.690> smells

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
so it smells

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.290 
so it smells
actually<00:05:00.090> really<00:05:00.300> good

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
actually really good

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.589 
actually really good
and<00:05:01.979> one<00:05:02.979> scoop<00:05:03.250> is<00:05:03.430> about<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.789> much<00:05:04.000> not

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
and one scoop is about this much not

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:07.800 
and one scoop is about this much not
that<00:05:04.810> not<00:05:05.770> that<00:05:05.800> small<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:06.819> you<00:05:07.449> know<00:05:07.569> it's

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
that not that small but you know it's

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.100 
that not that small but you know it's
certainly<00:05:08.080> enough<00:05:08.729> he's<00:05:09.729> kind<00:05:09.909> of<00:05:10.030> big<00:05:10.210> but

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
certainly enough he's kind of big but

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.760 
certainly enough he's kind of big but
its<00:05:11.770> job<00:05:12.069> done<00:05:13.199> overall<00:05:14.199> I<00:05:14.379> would<00:05:14.500> recommend

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
its job done overall I would recommend

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.529 
its job done overall I would recommend
black<00:05:15.039> powder<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.699> people<00:05:15.940> I<00:05:16.000> work<00:05:16.180> out<00:05:16.330> with

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
black powder to people I work out with

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.409 
black powder to people I work out with
that's<00:05:17.199> good<00:05:17.379> product<00:05:17.770> only<00:05:18.190> bad<00:05:18.909> side<00:05:19.180> is

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
that's good product only bad side is

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.059 
that's good product only bad side is
that<00:05:19.629> you'll<00:05:20.259> have<00:05:20.409> a<00:05:20.440> hit<00:05:20.620> or<00:05:20.740> miss<00:05:20.770> sometimes

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
that you'll have a hit or miss sometimes

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.460 
that you'll have a hit or miss sometimes
depending<00:05:21.759> on<00:05:21.970> how<00:05:22.870> your<00:05:23.020> body<00:05:23.229> is<00:05:23.319> designed

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
depending on how your body is designed

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.260 
depending on how your body is designed
to<00:05:23.740> be<00:05:23.860> that<00:05:24.009> day<00:05:24.190> one<00:05:24.849> day<00:05:25.000> you'll<00:05:25.120> have<00:05:25.210> a

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
to be that day one day you'll have a

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.089 
to be that day one day you'll have a
great<00:05:25.449> workout<00:05:26.169> with<00:05:26.319> black<00:05:26.470> powder<00:05:26.650> the<00:05:26.860> next

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
great workout with black powder the next

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.040 
great workout with black powder the next
day<00:05:27.220> you'll<00:05:27.550> probably<00:05:28.270> miss<00:05:28.629> half<00:05:28.870> your

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
day you'll probably miss half your

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.790 
day you'll probably miss half your
workout<00:05:29.379> because<00:05:29.560> you<00:05:30.129> crashed<00:05:30.400> so<00:05:31.800> it's

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
workout because you crashed so it's

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.219 
workout because you crashed so it's
really<00:05:33.039> risky<00:05:33.699> but<00:05:34.210> it<00:05:34.509> certainly<00:05:34.690> pays<00:05:34.960> off

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:35.229 
really risky but it certainly pays off

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.500 
really risky but it certainly pays off
and<00:05:35.560> you<00:05:35.919> get

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
and you get

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.240 
and you get
and<00:05:36.750> you're<00:05:36.930> doing<00:05:37.230> pumping<00:05:37.680> out<00:05:37.770> extra<00:05:38.100> reps

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
and you're doing pumping out extra reps

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.760 
and you're doing pumping out extra reps
so<00:05:39.060> this<00:05:39.660> has<00:05:39.780> been<00:05:39.810> Lloyd<00:05:40.140> sterling<00:05:40.470> from<00:05:40.650> New
