00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
out my old camera that I used to film

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.750 
out my old camera that I used to film
with<00:05:25.530> and<00:05:25.860> this

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
with and this

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
with and this
is<00:05:26.850> a<00:05:27.210> sin<00:05:28.080> yo<00:05:28.340> exotique<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.820> it<00:05:30.180> looks<00:05:30.450> like

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
is a sin yo exotique and it looks like

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.470 
is a sin yo exotique and it looks like
this<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:31.860> guess<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.280> collect<00:05:32.610> before<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.120> logs

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.240 
this so I guess I collect before it logs
wheezing<00:05:34.050> or<00:05:34.170> something<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.800> don't<00:05:34.860> know<00:05:35.100> it
