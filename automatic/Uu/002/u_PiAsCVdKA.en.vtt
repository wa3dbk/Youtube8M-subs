it<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.700> cheap<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.210> mean<00:00:48.450> some<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.960> the

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
it was all so cheap I mean some of the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
it was all so cheap I mean some of the
more<00:00:50.820> expensive<00:00:51.059> phones<00:00:52.010> upwards<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
more expensive phones upwards of you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.950 
more expensive phones upwards of you
know<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> thousand<00:00:54.210> dollars<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.539> one<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
know a thousand dollars this one was a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.439 
know a thousand dollars this one was a
bit<00:00:55.199> around<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> five<00:00:55.800> hundred<00:00:56.100> dollar<00:00:56.250> mark

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.560 

so<00:01:00.449> basically<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.199> double<00:01:02.160> D<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.570> obviously

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
so basically like double D is obviously

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.719 
so basically like double D is obviously
this<00:01:03.780> whole<00:01:03.960> unit<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.559> its<00:01:04.739> most<00:01:05.519> likely

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
this whole unit here in its most likely

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.510 
this whole unit here in its most likely
touchscreen<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.320> double<00:01:07.590> din<00:01:07.710> unit<00:01:08.010> or
