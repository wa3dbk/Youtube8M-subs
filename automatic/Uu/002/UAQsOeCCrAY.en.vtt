now<00:00:45.219> I<00:00:45.250> want<00:00:45.550> to<00:00:45.579> discover<00:00:46.030> what<00:00:46.600> the<00:00:46.780> color<00:00:47.079> is

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
now I want to discover what the color is

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.709 
now I want to discover what the color is
for<00:00:47.620> this<00:00:47.739> very<00:00:48.010> strong<00:00:48.340> color<00:00:48.670> cast<00:00:49.030> so<00:00:49.629> I'm

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
for this very strong color cast so I'm

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:52.349 
for this very strong color cast so I'm
going<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:49.989> choose<00:00:50.230> filter<00:00:50.620> blur<00:00:51.399> average<00:00:52.149> from

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
going to choose filter blur average from

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.660 
going to choose filter blur average from
the<00:00:52.449> menu<00:00:52.780> which<00:00:53.289> will<00:00:53.320> average<00:00:53.980> all<00:00:54.219> of<00:00:54.579> the

the menu which will average all of the
pixel<00:00:55.000> values<00:00:55.359> together<00:00:55.539> to<00:00:56.230> create<00:00:56.469> a<00:00:56.590> single

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
pixel values together to create a single

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.630 
pixel values together to create a single
color<00:00:57.460> representing<00:00:58.390> our<00:00:58.539> color<00:00:58.870> cast

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
color representing our color cast

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.410 
color representing our color cast
obviously<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.670> don't<00:01:00.789> want<00:01:01.000> to<00:01:01.149> apply<00:01:01.359> this

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
obviously I don't want to apply this

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.689 
obviously I don't want to apply this

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
cause the background copy layer to only

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.460 
cause the background copy layer to only
affect<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.760> color<00:01:31.000> in<00:01:31.270> the<00:01:31.720> underlying<00:01:31.960> image

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
affect the color in the underlying image

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.000 
affect the color in the underlying image
as<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:34.090> can<00:01:34.450> see<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:35.050> has<00:01:35.260> offset<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.800> color

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
as you can see it has offset the color

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.070 
as you can see it has offset the color
cast<00:01:36.310> but<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:36.880> effect<00:01:37.210> is<00:01:37.300> a<00:01:37.360> bit<00:01:37.570> too<00:01:37.720> strong

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
cast but the effect is a bit too strong

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.950 
cast but the effect is a bit too strong
so<00:01:38.710> I'll<00:01:38.830> simply<00:01:39.040> reduce<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.790> opacity

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
so I'll simply reduce the opacity

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.930 
so I'll simply reduce the opacity
setting<00:01:40.960> until<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:41.740> find<00:01:42.160> a<00:01:42.400> more<00:01:42.580> appropriate

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
setting until I find a more appropriate

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.060 
setting until I find a more appropriate
value<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:43.780> offsets<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.530> color<00:01:44.740> cast

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
value that offsets the color cast

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.580 
value that offsets the color cast
allowing<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> original<00:01:46.630> colors<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.410> show

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
allowing the original colors to show

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.250 
allowing the original colors to show
through<00:01:48.010> I<00:01:48.190> can<00:01:49.030> then<00:01:49.150> continue<00:01:49.570> adjusting

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
through I can then continue adjusting

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.290 
through I can then continue adjusting
the<00:01:50.380> image<00:01:50.680> for<00:01:50.950> example<00:01:50.980> by<00:01:51.670> adding<00:01:51.910> a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
the image for example by adding a

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.660 
the image for example by adding a
hue/saturation<00:01:52.690> adjustment<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:54.490> will

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
hue/saturation adjustment that will

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.880 
hue/saturation adjustment that will
boost<00:01:54.940> the<00:01:55.240> colors<00:01:55.450> in<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:56.020> underlying<00:01:56.230> image

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
boost the colors in the underlying image

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.660 
boost the colors in the underlying image
to<00:01:57.400> produce<00:01:57.580> a<00:01:58.000> more<00:01:58.270> natural<00:01:58.840> result<00:01:59.020> in<00:01:59.670> this

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
to produce a more natural result in this

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.250 
to produce a more natural result in this
case<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:01.060> image<00:02:01.270> still<00:02:01.480> looks<00:02:01.660> a<00:02:01.780> little<00:02:01.900> flat

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
case the image still looks a little flat

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.080 
case the image still looks a little flat
but<00:02:02.530> that's<00:02:02.680> simply<00:02:03.040> because<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.850> very

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
but that's simply because it's a very

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.700 
but that's simply because it's a very
old<00:02:04.270> print<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:04.960> scanned<00:02:05.320> using<00:02:05.650> a

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
old print that was scanned using a

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.800 
old print that was scanned using a
flatbed<00:02:06.100> scanner<00:02:06.460> but<00:02:07.060> if<00:02:07.150> we<00:02:07.270> compare<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
flatbed scanner but if we compare the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.930 
flatbed scanner but if we compare the
original<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.920> result<00:02:09.250> we<00:02:09.369> ended<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.700> with

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
original to the result we ended up with

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.220 
original to the result we ended up with
you<00:02:10.390> can<00:02:10.569> see<00:02:10.750> we've<00:02:10.869> made<00:02:11.019> tremendous

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
you can see we've made tremendous

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.560 
you can see we've made tremendous
progress
