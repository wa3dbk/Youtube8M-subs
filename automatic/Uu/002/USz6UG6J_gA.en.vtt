event and to try to focus blame where it
needed<00:01:21.520> to<00:01:21.610> be<00:01:21.700> focused<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.360> try<00:01:22.509> to<00:01:22.570> avoid<00:01:22.960> it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
needed to be focused to try to avoid it

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.639 
needed to be focused to try to avoid it
happening<00:01:23.200> again

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
happening again

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.260 
happening again
so<00:01:24.369> he<00:01:24.430> did<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.580> number<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:24.910> projects<00:01:25.210> that

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
so he did a number of projects that

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.999 
so he did a number of projects that
related<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.840> earthquake<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.800> one

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
related to the earthquake this one

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.249 
related to the earthquake this one
straight<00:01:27.520> shown<00:01:28.060> in<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.270> Weka<00:01:28.479> projects<00:01:28.990> is

straight shown in this Weka projects is

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.590 
straight shown in this Weka projects is
a<00:01:29.350> very<00:01:29.890> particular<00:01:30.190> piece<00:01:30.490> it's<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.759> very<00:01:31.270> it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
a very particular piece it's a very it's

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.760 
a very particular piece it's a very it's
much<00:01:31.750> quieter<00:01:32.039> it's<00:01:33.039> much<00:01:33.280> more<00:01:34.770> monumental

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
much quieter it's much more monumental

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.710 
much quieter it's much more monumental
in<00:01:36.220> some<00:01:36.430> ways<00:01:36.610> than<00:01:36.940> these<00:01:37.180> other<00:01:37.330> projects

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
in some ways than these other projects

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.109 
in some ways than these other projects
is<00:01:37.840> much<00:01:38.020> less<00:01:38.229> overt<00:01:38.619> but<00:01:39.399> it's<00:01:39.580> certainly

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
is much less overt but it's certainly

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.330 
is much less overt but it's certainly
extremely<00:01:40.509> powerful<00:01:41.110> essentially<00:01:42.070> what<00:01:42.220> he

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
extremely powerful essentially what he

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.029 
extremely powerful essentially what he
did<00:01:42.550> was<00:01:42.820> to<00:01:43.080> recuperate<00:01:44.080> about<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:44.740> hundred

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039 
did was to recuperate about a hundred

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.820 
did was to recuperate about a hundred
tons<00:01:45.220> of<00:01:45.840> rebar<00:01:46.840> that<00:01:47.320> had<00:01:48.009> been<00:01:48.240> part<00:01:49.240> of<00:01:49.390> his

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
tons of rebar that had been part of his

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.980 
tons of rebar that had been part of his
his<00:01:50.830> destroyed<00:01:51.220> buildings<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:52.090> he<00:01:52.599> took

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
his destroyed buildings and he took

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.169 
his destroyed buildings and he took
these<00:01:53.170> twisted<00:01:53.950> and<00:01:54.130> gnarled<00:01:54.550> pieces<00:01:55.090> of

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
these twisted and gnarled pieces of

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.839 
these twisted and gnarled pieces of
metal<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.860> literally<00:01:56.860> with<00:01:57.369> his<00:01:57.490> studio

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
metal and literally with his studio

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.990 
metal and literally with his studio
worked<00:01:58.720> for<00:01:58.869> about<00:01:58.929> three<00:01:59.289> years<00:01:59.319> to<00:02:00.000> hammer

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
worked for about three years to hammer

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.999 
worked for about three years to hammer
them<00:02:01.149> out<00:02:01.270> to<00:02:01.660> make<00:02:01.750> them<00:02:01.929> straight<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.890> make

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
them out to make them straight to make

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.850 
them out to make them straight to make
what<00:02:03.220> was<00:02:03.369> wrong<00:02:03.910> right<00:02:04.300> so<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:05.560> metal

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
what was wrong right so the the metal

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.859 
what was wrong right so the the metal
from<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.099> buildings<00:02:06.490> as<00:02:06.700> if<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.509> has<00:02:07.630> almost

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
from the buildings as if it has almost

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.050 
from the buildings as if it has almost
become<00:02:08.069> become<00:02:09.069> earth<00:02:09.310> again<00:02:09.640> has<00:02:09.759> become<00:02:09.880> a

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
become become earth again has become a

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.850 
become become earth again has become a
landscape<00:02:10.569> with<00:02:10.720> a<00:02:10.750> rift<00:02:11.020> in<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:11.530> an

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
landscape with a rift in it and an

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430 
landscape with a rift in it and an
undulation<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> two<00:02:14.020> works<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.290> are

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
undulation so the two works that are

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.280 
undulation so the two works that are
shown<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:14.770> are<00:02:15.300> extremely<00:02:16.300> different<00:02:16.480> but

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
shown here are extremely different but

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.510 
shown here are extremely different but
they're<00:02:17.380> also<00:02:17.500> quite<00:02:18.459> closely<00:02:18.819> related<00:02:19.349> the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
they're also quite closely related the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.920 
they're also quite closely related the
campaign<00:02:21.520> really<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:22.060> way<00:02:22.750> were<00:02:22.900> made

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
campaign really that way were made

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.100 
campaign really that way were made
around<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.099> earthquake<00:02:24.610> was<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.750> sort

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
around the earthquake was the the sort

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
around the earthquake was the the sort
