basis<00:01:47.030> secondly<00:01:47.929> another<00:01:48.259> key<00:01:48.649> feature<00:01:48.890> is

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
basis secondly another key feature is

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.010 
basis secondly another key feature is
that<00:01:49.189> I<00:01:49.369> was<00:01:49.549> not<00:01:49.729> willing<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.240> compromise<00:01:50.569> on

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that I was not willing to compromise on

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.309 
that I was not willing to compromise on
is<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.859> zipper<00:01:52.369> at<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.789> back<00:01:53.179> or<00:01:53.509> at<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.079> side

is a zipper at the back or at the side

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.349 
is a zipper at the back or at the side

easier to get into but it will also

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.429 
easier to get into but it will also
conserve<00:01:59.090> them<00:01:59.450> because<00:02:00.020> you<00:02:00.109> won't<00:02:00.259> be
