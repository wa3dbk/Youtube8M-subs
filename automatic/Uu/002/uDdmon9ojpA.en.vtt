00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey guys in this tutorial we're going to

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.420 
hey guys in this tutorial we're going to
discuss<00:00:03.570> tart<00:00:03.899> charged<00:00:04.200> characters<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.980> how

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
discuss tart charged characters and how

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.940 
discuss tart charged characters and how
to<00:00:05.490> execute<00:00:05.850> their<00:00:06.150> moves<00:00:06.500> now<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.560> basic

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
to execute their moves now the basic

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.680 
to execute their moves now the basic
execution<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.730> charge<00:00:08.970> characters<00:00:09.450> moves

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
execution of a charge characters moves

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.580 
execution of a charge characters moves
are<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> hold<00:00:10.769> back<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.190> two<00:00:11.340> seconds<00:00:12.590> so

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
are to hold back for two seconds so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
are to hold back for two seconds so
press<00:00:13.799> forward<00:00:14.389> or<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.480> hold<00:00:15.630> down<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.080> two

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
press forward or to hold down for two

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.800 
press forward or to hold down for two
seconds<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.800> press<00:00:17.699> up<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> button<00:00:18.420> to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
seconds and press up in the button to

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.160 
seconds and press up in the button to
execute<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.289> move<00:00:19.820> do<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> once<00:00:21.210> more<00:00:21.510> so

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
execute the move do that once more so

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.689 
execute the move do that once more so
you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.380> see<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.650> thumbs<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.070> exactly<00:00:23.550> what

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you can see my thumbs and exactly what

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.700 
you can see my thumbs and exactly what
the<00:00:23.789> motion<00:00:24.119> looks<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.480> back<00:00:25.410> for<00:00:25.619> two

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the motion looks like back for two

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.900 
the motion looks like back for two
seconds<00:00:27.380> forward<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.529> punch<00:00:28.740> button<00:00:29.099> down

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
seconds forward in the punch button down

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.930 
seconds forward in the punch button down
for<00:00:30.090> two<00:00:30.210> seconds<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.189> gals<00:00:32.189> case<00:00:32.520> up<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for two seconds and gals case up in the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840 
for two seconds and gals case up in the
kick<00:00:33.090> button<00:00:33.469> now<00:00:34.469> that's<00:00:34.680> basic<00:00:35.250> charge<00:00:35.550> move

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
kick button now that's basic charge move

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
kick button now that's basic charge move
execution<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.320> what's<00:00:37.500> really<00:00:37.710> difficult

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
execution but what's really difficult

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.430 
execution but what's really difficult
about<00:00:38.489> charge<00:00:38.790> moves<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.440> actually

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
about charge moves is actually

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
about charge moves is actually
conducting<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> fight<00:00:41.430> while<00:00:42.059> you're<00:00:42.180> holding

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
conducting a fight while you're holding

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.319 
conducting a fight while you're holding
backwards<00:00:43.020> now<00:00:43.829> obviously<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:45.000> simply

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
backwards now obviously if you simply

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
backwards now obviously if you simply
hold<00:00:45.510> away<00:00:45.780> you'll<00:00:46.410> back<00:00:46.620> away<00:00:46.920> from<00:00:47.070> your

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
hold away you'll back away from your

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.310 
hold away you'll back away from your
opponent<00:00:47.300> giving<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> no<00:00:48.539> fight<00:00:48.809> advantage

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
opponent giving you no fight advantage

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
opponent giving you no fight advantage
aside<00:00:50.010> from<00:00:50.160> zoning<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> screen<00:00:50.969> with<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
aside from zoning the screen with a

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.380 
aside from zoning the screen with a
projectile<00:00:52.219> can't<00:00:53.219> do<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:54.059> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
projectile can't do much from here and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
projectile can't do much from here and
if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:54.989> hold<00:00:55.289> down<00:00:55.410> you're<00:00:56.340> essentially<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
if you hold down you're essentially is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.670 
if you hold down you're essentially is
sitting<00:00:57.270> duck<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> who's<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> walk

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
sitting duck and who's going to walk

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.110 
sitting duck and who's going to walk
towards<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> charge<00:00:59.370> character<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.850> they<00:00:59.969> see

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
towards the charge character if they see

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.740 
towards the charge character if they see
them<00:01:00.270> doing<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:01.280> again<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.489> likely<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
them doing that again not likely so the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.679 
them doing that again not likely so the
trick<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> learning<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> charge<00:01:04.860> character<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
trick to learning a charge character is

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.750 
trick to learning a charge character is
to<00:01:06.689> hold<00:01:07.020> back<00:01:07.380> while<00:01:07.979> doing<00:01:08.280> other<00:01:08.610> things

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
to hold back while doing other things

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.890 
to hold back while doing other things
and<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.960> soon<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> release<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> button

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
and as soon as you release that button

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.580 
and as soon as you release that button
you<00:01:12.900> get<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> thumb<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:14.210> behind<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
you get that thumb back behind you the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.880 
you get that thumb back behind you the
second<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.159> forward<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> execute<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.210> move

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
second is forward to execute the move

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.170 
second is forward to execute the move
here's<00:01:19.890> an<00:01:20.009> example<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> jump

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
here's an example I'm going to jump

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.040 
here's an example I'm going to jump
forward<00:01:21.390> I'll

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
forward I'll

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.710 
forward I'll
and<00:01:23.470> now<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:24.090> sonic<00:01:25.090> boom<00:01:25.240> comes<00:01:25.510> out

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
and now the sonic boom comes out

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.260 
and now the sonic boom comes out
immediately<00:01:25.960> after<00:01:26.620> by<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.520> same<00:01:27.760> token<00:01:27.790> when

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
immediately after by the same token when

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.380 
immediately after by the same token when
the<00:01:28.360> jump<00:01:28.630> towards<00:01:28.930> him<00:01:29.050> now<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.440> hold<00:01:30.040> down

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the jump towards him now and hold down

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.040 
the jump towards him now and hold down
and<00:01:31.390> back<00:01:32.020> diagonal<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:33.400> that<00:01:33.640> my<00:01:33.910> flash<00:01:34.780> kick

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
and back diagonal so that my flash kick

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.920 
and back diagonal so that my flash kick
is<00:01:35.200> charging<00:01:35.590> on<00:01:35.710> my<00:01:35.800> way<00:01:35.950> down<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.670> so<00:01:40.630> there

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
is charging on my way down and so there

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.840 
is charging on my way down and so there
I'm<00:01:41.020> able<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.320> execute<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:41.830> combo<00:01:42.250> because<00:01:42.610> I

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
I'm able to execute the combo because I

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.390 
I'm able to execute the combo because I
immediately<00:01:43.180> went<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.750> back<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.830> diagonal

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
immediately went to back down diagonal

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.090 
immediately went to back down diagonal
now<00:01:46.000> she'd<00:01:46.300> mention<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:47.410> you<00:01:47.650> can<00:01:47.830> crouch<00:01:48.070> in

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
now she'd mention that you can crouch in

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.220 
now she'd mention that you can crouch in
one<00:01:48.400> place<00:01:48.670> and<00:01:48.880> hold<00:01:49.030> back<00:01:49.270> now<00:01:49.510> diagonal<00:01:50.110> now

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
one place and hold back now diagonal now

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.170 
one place and hold back now diagonal now
I'm<00:01:50.350> simultaneously<00:01:51.250> charging<00:01:51.790> both<00:01:51.940> the

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
I'm simultaneously charging both the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.250 
I'm simultaneously charging both the
sonic<00:01:52.510> boom<00:01:52.690> and<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.650> flash<00:01:53.890> kick<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.990> this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
sonic boom and the flash kick so this

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.150 
sonic boom and the flash kick so this
allows<00:01:56.470> me<00:01:56.650> to<00:01:56.920> zone<00:01:57.670> him<00:01:57.940> in<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.150> corner

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
allows me to zone him in the corner

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.120 
allows me to zone him in the corner
while<00:02:00.160> doing<00:02:00.400> this<00:02:00.670> until<00:02:01.180> he<00:02:01.330> reacts<00:02:02.130> now

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
while doing this until he reacts now

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.620 
while doing this until he reacts now
because<00:02:03.430> of<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.610> nature<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.090> sonic<00:02:04.300> boom

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
because of the nature of the sonic boom

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.609
