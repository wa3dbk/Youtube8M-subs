moment<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:09.830> it's<00:02:10.459> a<00:02:10.550> question<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.120> how

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
moment it's it's a question of how

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
media and I think that's going to be one

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.009 
media and I think that's going to be one
of<00:02:15.860> the<00:02:15.950> eight<00:02:15.980> fields<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:16.790> areas<00:02:17.180> where

of the eight fields and areas where

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.930 
of the eight fields and areas where
there<00:02:18.170> is<00:02:18.260> still<00:02:18.530> going<00:02:18.799> to<00:02:18.920> be<00:02:19.010> employment

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
there is still going to be employment

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.630 
there is still going to be employment
opportunities<00:02:20.569> but<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.709> hasn't<00:02:21.890> only<00:02:22.130> changed

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
opportunities but it hasn't only changed

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.259 
opportunities but it hasn't only changed
the<00:02:23.269> face<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:24.549> traditional<00:02:25.549> television<00:02:25.849> and

the material you see on ITN in BBC but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.910 
the material you see on ITN in BBC but
it's<00:02:29.840> also<00:02:30.019> changing<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> way<00:02:30.769> of
