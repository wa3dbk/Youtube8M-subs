the old Corrado this Corrado is um still
green<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.900> not<00:00:43.080> green<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.500> gold<00:00:43.680> this

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
green but it's not green and gold this

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.280 
green but it's not green and gold this
one's<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.370> green<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.910> black<00:00:45.140> kind<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
one's like green and black kind of a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.860 
one's like green and black kind of a
look<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.470> it<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:47.339> is<00:00:47.519> the<00:00:47.640> 7.1<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.540> it's<00:00:48.690> got

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
look to it this is the 7.1 so it's got

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.180 
look to it this is the 7.1 so it's got
the<00:00:48.960> grace<00:00:49.230> poole<00:00:49.589> in<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the grace poole in it

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.000 
the grace poole in it
I<00:00:50.220> think<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.210> 5<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.780> has<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.080> like<00:00:52.559> ultra

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I think the 5 go on has a like ultra

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.360 
I think the 5 go on has a like ultra
black<00:00:53.309> spool<00:00:53.790> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.650> can't<00:00:55.650> even<00:00:55.799> -<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.100> think

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
black spool and I can't even - I think

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.880 
black spool and I can't even - I think
the<00:00:56.519> 6<00:00:57.000> 4<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.449> like<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.809> silver<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.379> but

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the 6 4 is like the silver in it but

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.060

fifty five eight pound 180 so if you
were<00:02:29.069> like<00:02:29.250> ultra<00:02:29.640> finesse<00:02:29.940> fishing<00:02:30.090> with

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
were like ultra finesse fishing with

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.270 
were like ultra finesse fishing with
this<00:02:30.480> really<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.990> begin<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.470> little<00:02:31.980> spool<00:02:32.250> on

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this really you begin a little spool on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.830 
this really you begin a little spool on
here

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.080 

three<00:02:35.799> pound<00:02:36.069> braid<00:02:36.310> 190<00:02:37.030> yards<00:02:37.180> 50<00:02:38.099> 129<00:02:39.099> 65<00:02:39.730> 80

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
three pound braid 190 yards 50 129 65 80

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.140 
three pound braid 190 yards 50 129 65 80
yards<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> basically<00:02:43.390> I<00:02:44.069> mean<00:02:45.069> sound<00:02:45.909> like<00:02:46.030> the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
yards so basically I mean sound like the

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.940 
yards so basically I mean sound like the
old<00:02:46.239> Corrado<00:02:46.629> I<00:02:46.750> know<00:02:46.900> that<00:02:47.170> ever<00:02:47.650> all<00:02:47.920> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
old Corrado I know that ever all the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.949 
old Corrado I know that ever all the
reels<00:02:48.280> kind<00:02:48.579> of<00:02:48.670> downgraded<00:02:49.359> one<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:49.810> what

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
reels kind of downgraded one for what

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.240 
reels kind of downgraded one for what
they<00:02:50.140> were<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:51.189> they<00:02:51.310> added<00:02:51.549> a<00:02:51.609> new<00:02:51.640> one<00:02:51.970> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250
