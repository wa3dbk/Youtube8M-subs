00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and then I just kept on getting killed

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.400 
and then I just kept on getting killed
it<00:00:38.579> wasn't<00:00:38.940> very<00:00:39.059> fun<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.629> me<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:40.260> then<00:00:40.379> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it wasn't very fun for me so then I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.979 
it wasn't very fun for me so then I
tried<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> again<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.360> then<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.840> know<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
tried it again and then you know I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
tried it again and then you know I
started<00:00:43.320> getting<00:00:43.559> used<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.280> then<00:00:44.910> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
started getting used to it and then I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.049 
started getting used to it and then I
played<00:00:46.079> two<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.710> two<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> started

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
played two on two and then it started

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
played two on two and then it started
getting<00:00:48.180> fun<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.230> surprised

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
getting fun but what it really surprised

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.459 
getting fun but what it really surprised
me<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.510> people<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.230> actually

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
me was that you can people can actually

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.189 
me was that you can people can actually
join<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.219> during<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.789> game<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.020> was

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
join in during the game and that was

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.299 
join in during the game and that was
kind<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> cool<00:00:55.680> because<00:00:55.710> I've<00:00:56.070> never<00:00:56.190> seen

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
kind of cool because I've never seen

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.189 
kind of cool because I've never seen
anything<00:00:56.640> like<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.940> before<00:00:57.120> I<00:00:57.660> thought<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
anything like that before I thought that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.959 
anything like that before I thought that
as<00:00:58.410> long<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.039> game's<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.670> other

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
as long as the game's going on other

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.279 
as long as the game's going on other
people<00:01:00.300> can't<00:01:00.480> join<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> can

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
people can't join it but you can

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
people can't join it but you can
actually<00:01:01.469> do<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.980> which<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.699> kind<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> cool

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
actually do that which is kind of cool

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.030 
actually do that which is kind of cool
because<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.780> people<00:01:04.110> join<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> more

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
because the more people join in the more

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
something up another time and although

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.350 
something up another time and although
winning<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> great<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.240> most

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
winning is great I think the most

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.910 
winning is great I think the most
important<00:02:03.810> thing<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.350> all<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.680> fun

important thing is that we all had fun

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.469 
important thing is that we all had fun
