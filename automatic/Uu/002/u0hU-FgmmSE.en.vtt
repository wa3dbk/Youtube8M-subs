now taking a small pencil brush I'm
going<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.660> use<00:00:53.780> half-baked

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.130 

I<00:01:02.149> am<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.300> putting<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.019> inner

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.640 

with<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> small<00:01:15.600> shader<00:01:15.900> brush<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.350> will<00:01:16.560> be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
with a small shader brush I will be

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.100 
with a small shader brush I will be
taking<00:01:16.830> smog

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.070 

and<00:01:21.640> I'll<00:01:22.640> be<00:01:22.790> applying<00:01:22.880> that<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.450> my<00:01:23.660> lid<00:01:23.870> area

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and I'll be applying that to my lid area

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:36.680 
and I'll be applying that to my lid area
only<00:01:24.470> not<00:01:24.890> going<00:01:25.190> above<00:01:25.430> my<00:01:25.670> crease

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:58.050 

carefully<00:01:37.690> blending<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.170> into<00:01:38.620> half-baked

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.400 

now<00:01:59.060> with<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.330> blending<00:01:59.780> brush<00:02:00.020> I'll<00:02:00.200> be

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
now with the blending brush I'll be

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.330 
now with the blending brush I'll be
taking<00:02:00.800> naked

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.550 

I'll<00:02:06.340> be<00:02:06.670> using<00:02:06.850> that<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.360> blend<00:02:07.659> out<00:02:07.840> smog<00:02:08.259> and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
I'll be using that to blend out smog and

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.469 
I'll be using that to blend out smog and
blend<00:02:08.830> it<00:02:08.950> into<00:02:09.069> my<00:02:09.280> crease<00:02:09.610> making<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.269> lot

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
blend it into my crease making it a lot

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:19.130 
blend it into my crease making it a lot
more<00:02:10.720> smooth

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.570 

taking<00:02:20.140> your<00:02:20.290> time<00:02:20.470> is<00:02:20.680> definitely<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.250> trick

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
taking your time is definitely the trick

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:29.380 
taking your time is definitely the trick
into<00:02:21.940> making<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.570> blend<00:02:22.900> really<00:02:23.110> well

again<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.610> small<00:02:34.849> shader<00:02:35.090> brush<00:02:35.180> I'll

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
again with the small shader brush I'll

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.650 
again with the small shader brush I'll
be<00:02:35.750> taking<00:02:36.140> dark<00:02:36.410> horse

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.560 

I<00:02:41.460> will<00:02:42.460> only<00:02:42.640> be<00:02:42.880> applying<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
I will only be applying that to the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.690 
I will only be applying that to the
outer<00:02:43.750> part<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.200> my<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.350> sort<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.130> creating<00:02:45.640> an

outer part of my I sort of creating an

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.450 
outer part of my I sort of creating an
outer<00:02:45.910> V<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:47.110> going<00:02:47.500> slightly<00:02:48.040> above<00:02:48.310> my

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
outer V but going slightly above my

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:59.270 
outer V but going slightly above my
crease<00:02:48.520> only

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.500

shimmer<00:03:44.700> my<00:03:44.940> eyes<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.480> I<00:03:45.900> felt<00:03:46.110> like<00:03:46.260> if<00:03:46.410> I

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560
