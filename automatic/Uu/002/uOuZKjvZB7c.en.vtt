00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
know challenge focusing on its ugly

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.609 
know challenge focusing on its ugly
either<00:01:14.549> easier<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.360> just<00:01:15.570> have<00:01:15.960> one<00:01:16.200> position

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
either easier to just have one position

either easier to just have one position
but<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:17.040> mean<00:01:17.900> when<00:01:18.900> they<00:01:18.990> teach<00:01:19.200> us<00:01:19.229> they<00:01:19.470> don't

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
but i mean when they teach us they don't

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.260 
but i mean when they teach us they don't
teach<00:01:19.770> us<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.280> position<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
teach us just one position we have to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.179 
teach us just one position we have to
know<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> whole<00:01:21.659> d-line<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.650> linebackers

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
know the whole d-line the linebackers
and<00:01:23.220> why<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.670> do<00:01:23.729> what<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.479> so

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and why they do what they do just so

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
and why they do what they do just so
because<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.290> makes<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> easier<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> know

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
fill positions when needed but what we

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.520 
fill positions when needed but what we
definitely<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.479> lot<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.020> decent<00:01:43.470> amount

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
definitely do have a lot a decent amount
