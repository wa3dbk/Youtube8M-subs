00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.750
 It's easy to get out. If you're in love with my back , I'm an older sister 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.710
 Thank you 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.520
 Were we saw of you was Hida's free loose the last round 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:17.840
 Yeah it I was glad that there Alto began to laugh 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.039
 Laughing while everyone is crying at that formed a circle Finally, in everyone relay has finished 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.880
 The laughter of Haruka Haruka is on TV 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 So I think that was me finally put the feelings are Brightness chan laughed because the first time I heard 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.390
 I'm glad I already 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 Certainly this is a refrigerated moon that I was happy too I got it and I said 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:41.930
 Talking in that other acoustic supervision and Nobunaga Shimazaki of high school there and I I already ne what bought channels all 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.930
 The most cat we care about 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.020
 Because it is a boo, it is true that the compatibility with what I keep and what will happen is true 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:05.180
 So Hey 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.950
 Large phone I'm Well simple rule of thumb I when that pekoe me from you were 2 microphone 1 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.360
 It is often said that the volume of the book 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.680
 So talk roughly even but is a rough-hewn I guess is 30 centimeters and say with a ruler 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.510
 30cm But the really it because we leave him 1m woven source one g 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.320
 About 4 away 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:27.000
 Yeah mixer's even in the state saw you I'm fliers are riding in voice volume is to be slightly 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.110
 Yes , close to the microphone in normal condition in bottom condition 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.630
 True and Atrai people are good and it 's like that 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:37.710
 Well, you can make enough sound with just these three guys. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.340
 so 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:49.359
 It is Haruka-kun who has never put out a volume . 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:54.250
 This is the trouble I've always had, and when I do something with 4 people or something like cherry blossoms, that much is that much 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:58.090
 In addition to the voice, which I think to be in the ordinary that it is good to be told me to insist Come 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.630
 Drowned out is to become that mean much-kun absence 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.330
 It's the last thing I learned, so I already turned Michael and the opposite 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.200
 Yes Yes 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.319
 This soup aims to get close to the microphone to the limit that is not pious 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:15.889
 Power in the voice through from by everyone, etc. 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:21.439
 I've been doing Tsu Arts to say Yari and A N'After all, more than anyone else Anna away ten ride 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:25.730
 That awkwardness of saying that I 'm passing through is true that the win of the world is really flying 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.460
 Everyone other is that in this case of in Tteyuu so 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:34.500
 air 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:37.470
 Care put a voice with you really body and soul to the place of there anyway participation made me 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.810
 Do not Deki retaken may not contain body 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:44.490
 True in those that also strange in the Tate cane does ship out with Japan version of the Well I'm Sorya likely 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.480
 Become a production in and we 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.620
 Maybe because I already have feelings 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.129
 One-year-old everyone won't bite, especially with this free show 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.260
 But 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:00.400
 Every time is so, but when it happens, I will go here 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.840
 If I re-record it separately , I still have a time when it feels like it's back and forth . 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.470
 I want everyone to go together 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:10.850
 It probably can and also a place that looks like just after the ride you carp I think logical 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:14.300
 But it is there where you say a lie I did not go so when the slugging direct certainly the last round 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.000
 I felt that feeling very much and then operated indirectly 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:22.910
 In me here really 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 Speaking I I was confident it a little and Sakura's say that and much more with the cherry tree 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.560
 But it's easy Oh Oh Oh from Ne said much 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:35.720
 I'm doing it while I'm doing it, but it's a monk or a monk or something like that 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:42.110
 Nobunaga that happened from that auto that happened well 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:46.020
 Go with the aim of what or future softening ya thing Tsu Oh Tsu N I I had Arenna 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:51.300
 About likely sleep Toka or there like that do when you say sell when you want to see 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:55.590
 Only I'd was the person who is many times before this scene is there without hesitation that that I Motchi outside 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:04:01.260
 Everyone went laughing and crying in front of Te Wa' to say san or exceed everyone left feeling 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:04.660
 Innovation microphone 1 in the properly one shot to pond and there nature from coming out among say 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.850
 Even if I heard it, I was able to hear the sound 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.710
 There is something 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:15.900
 So it was a total power Tteyuu accustomed barely softening team and Well then the eyes of so Iwatonbi 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:22.160
 I'm so happy I even have such episodes I was very happy and cut spring 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.160
 Is there When emotions richly become that way there masu Iori
