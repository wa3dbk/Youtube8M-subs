you<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:13.980> see<00:01:14.250> what's<00:01:14.490> happening<00:01:14.790> inside<00:01:14.910> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you to see what's happening inside the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.880 
you to see what's happening inside the
machine<00:01:20.510> here<00:01:21.510> we<00:01:21.630> have<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:22.140> concrete<00:01:22.590> weight

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
machine here we have the concrete weight

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.670 
machine here we have the concrete weight
which<00:01:23.610> helps<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:23.970> give<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.300> drum<00:01:24.570> inertia<00:01:25.230> so

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
which helps to give the drum inertia so

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
which helps to give the drum inertia so
there<00:01:25.800> isn't<00:01:26.010> too<00:01:26.160> much<00:01:26.280> movement<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:27.660> can

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
there isn't too much movement you can

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.260 
there isn't too much movement you can
see<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> two<00:01:28.320> suspension<00:01:29.010> Springs<00:01:29.430> which

which<00:01:35.760> help<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> control<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> movement<00:01:37.050> of

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
which help to control the movement of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.030 
which help to control the movement of
the<00:01:37.290> drum<00:01:37.560> now<00:01:39.350> if<00:01:40.350> you're<00:01:40.500> frequently

found<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.570> balanced<00:01:57.930> load<00:01:58.170> so<00:01:58.470> it's<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.830> into

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
found a balanced load so it's going into

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.240 
found a balanced load so it's going into
a<00:01:59.070> faster<00:01:59.670> spin<00:01:59.910> cycle<00:02:00.500> if<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:02.100> it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
a faster spin cycle if it doesn't it

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.430 
a faster spin cycle if it doesn't it
will<00:02:02.460> stop<00:02:02.820> start<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.660> work<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.140> slower

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
will stop start and work at a slower

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.010 
will stop start and work at a slower
speed<00:02:07.369> what<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.460> now<00:02:08.610> going<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.880> do<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.270> undo

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
speed what I'm now going to do is undo

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.320 
speed what I'm now going to do is undo

loose<00:02:14.580> weight<00:02:15.150> sounds<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:16.460> now<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.610> you're

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
loose weight sounds like now if you're

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.580 
loose weight sounds like now if you're
hearing<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.240> noise<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.900> your<00:02:19.020> machine<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
hearing that noise in your machine and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.260 
hearing that noise in your machine and
obviously<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.100> can<00:02:20.250> still<00:02:20.580> see<00:02:20.940> that<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
obviously you can still see that the

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.440 
obviously you can still see that the
drum<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.630> shaking<00:02:22.080> violently<00:02:23.120> this<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.270> easy

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
drum is shaking violently this is easy

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.480 
drum is shaking violently this is easy
to<00:02:24.630> fix<00:02:24.660> simply<00:02:25.560> tighten<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.310> these<00:02:26.580> nuts<00:02:26.880> here

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
to fix simply tighten up these nuts here

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.920 
to fix simply tighten up these nuts here
put<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.580> machine<00:02:29.850> into<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.090> spin<00:02:30.360> cycle<00:02:30.840> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
put the machine into the spin cycle and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.920 
put the machine into the spin cycle and
give<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.319> test<00:02:32.270> what<00:02:33.270> I'm<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.750> now

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
give it a test what I'm going to do now

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.590 
give it a test what I'm going to do now
is<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.290> put<00:02:34.319> three<00:02:34.800> towels<00:02:35.069> into<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.819> machine

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.830 

this<00:02:39.600> should<00:02:39.810> be<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.910> much<00:02:41.910> more<00:02:42.180> balanced<00:02:42.600> load

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
this should be a much more balanced load

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.680 
this should be a much more balanced load
and<00:02:43.140> easier<00:02:43.980> for<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.610> machine<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.120> deal<00:02:45.360> with

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.500 

now<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.740> machine<00:02:50.070> has<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> balanced<00:02:50.730> load<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
now that machine has a balanced load you

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.060 
now that machine has a balanced load you
can<00:02:51.540> hear<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.900> it's<00:02:52.050> spinning<00:02:52.500> much<00:02:52.740> more

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
can hear that it's spinning much more

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.310 
can hear that it's spinning much more
effectively<00:02:53.550> and<00:02:54.060> comes<00:02:54.300> up<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.630> spin<00:02:55.020> speed

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
effectively and comes up to a spin speed

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.980 
effectively and comes up to a spin speed
far<00:02:55.680> quicker<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.180> see<00:02:57.360> there<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.690> some

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
far quicker as you can see there is some

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.480 
far quicker as you can see there is some
movement<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.590> machine<00:02:58.950> but<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.340> is

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
movement in the machine but this is

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.620 
movement in the machine but this is
perfectly<00:03:00.000> normal

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
perfectly normal
