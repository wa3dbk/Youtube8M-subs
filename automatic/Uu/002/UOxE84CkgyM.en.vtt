00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
right now well I'm actually messing with

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.370 
right now well I'm actually messing with
mixed<00:00:10.320> light<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.090> see<00:00:12.330> my<00:00:12.809> face<00:00:13.049> here

mixed light so you can see my face here
is<00:00:13.590> well<00:00:14.040> exposed<00:00:14.490> light<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.210> can<00:00:15.240> see

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
is well exposed light and you can see

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.650 
is well exposed light and you can see
the<00:00:15.630> color<00:00:15.949> right<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> side<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:18.449> my

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
the color right here on the side in my

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.250 
the color right here on the side in my
shoulder

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
shoulder

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.400 
shoulder
a<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:20.130> bit<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.340> hair<00:00:20.580> light<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.410> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a little bit of hair light here is a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
a little bit of hair light here is a
different<00:00:22.740> color<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.189> bluish<00:00:23.550> tone<00:00:24.119> okay

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
different color it's a bluish tone okay

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.439 
different color it's a bluish tone okay
and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.320> background<00:00:25.910> behind<00:00:26.910> me<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.240> also

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and the background behind me is also

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.089 
and the background behind me is also
blue<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.250> using<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.760> tungsten<00:00:30.060> a

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
blue so what I'm using is a tungsten a

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
blue so what I'm using is a tungsten a
standard<00:00:32.099> incandescent<00:00:32.399> bulb<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.239> you'd

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
standard incandescent bulb that you'd

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.130 
standard incandescent bulb that you'd
find<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.750> your<00:00:33.809> household<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:35.340> rates<00:00:35.579> about

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
find in your household it rates about

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.510 
find in your household it rates about
right<00:00:37.140> now<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.320> think<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.680> dialed<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.190> around

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
right now I think it's dialed in around

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.549 
right now I think it's dialed in around
what's<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> tungsten<00:00:39.719> automatic

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
what's on the tungsten automatic

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.190 
what's on the tungsten automatic
tungsten<00:00:41.100> setting<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> camera<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:43.020> it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
tungsten setting of the camera so it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.720 
tungsten setting of the camera so it's
balanced<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.860> which<00:00:44.070> tends<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.430> be<00:00:44.520> an

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
balanced for that which tends to be an

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.930 
balanced for that which tends to be an
orangish<00:00:45.239> color<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.870> behind<00:00:46.829> me<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.219> an<00:00:47.610> LED

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
orangish color and behind me is an LED

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.680 
orangish color and behind me is an LED
light<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.780> are<00:00:49.110> 300<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.100> see<00:00:50.250> they're

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
light the are 300 you can see they're

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
light the are 300 you can see they're
about<00:00:51.690> 3/4<00:00:53.239> back<00:00:54.239> behind<00:00:54.660> me<00:00:55.020> they're<00:00:55.520> coming

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
about 3/4 back behind me they're coming

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.049 
about 3/4 back behind me they're coming
at<00:00:56.610> me<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.170> it<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.890> daylight<00:00:59.399> balanced<00:00:59.789> bulb

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
at me and it is a daylight balanced bulb

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.270 
at me and it is a daylight balanced bulb
which<00:01:00.510> tends<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.109> bluish<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> have

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
which tends to be bluish so if you have

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.060 
which tends to be bluish so if you have
a<00:01:02.309> tungsten<00:01:02.699> setting<00:01:03.149> on<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.239> camera

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
a tungsten setting on your camera

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.010 
a tungsten setting on your camera
the<00:01:05.070> daylight's<00:01:05.460> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> look<00:01:05.850> blue<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.420> if

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
the daylight's going to look blue and if

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080 
the daylight's going to look blue and if
you<00:01:07.110> had<00:01:07.320> daylight<00:01:08.189> in<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.460> used<00:01:08.640> tungsten

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you had daylight in your used tungsten

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
you had daylight in your used tungsten
it<00:01:09.750> would<00:01:09.869> look<00:01:09.960> orange<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.619> there<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.159> this

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
it would look orange back there so this

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.820 
it would look orange back there so this
has<00:01:12.119> kind<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.630> cool<00:01:12.930> look<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.740> think

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
has kind of a cool look to it I think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.859 
has kind of a cool look to it I think
has<00:01:14.340> more<00:01:14.610> as<00:01:14.880> kind<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.210> like<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> Hollywood

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
has more as kind of like a Hollywood

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.550 
has more as kind of like a Hollywood
feel<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.270> maybe<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.869> Michael<00:01:19.439> Bay

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
feel to it maybe it's just a Michael Bay

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.249 
feel to it maybe it's just a Michael Bay
blue<00:01:19.860> look<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:20.729> whatever<00:01:20.880> I<00:01:21.240> just<00:01:22.020> want

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
blue look to it but whatever I just want

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.350 
blue look to it but whatever I just want
to<00:01:22.320> play<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.740> mixed<00:01:23.369> lighting<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.180> we're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
to play with mixed lighting and so we're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
to play with mixed lighting and so we're
using<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.689> soft<00:01:24.930> diffused<00:01:25.439> light<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.430> which

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
using a soft diffused light here which

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.440 
using a soft diffused light here which
is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> tungsten<00:01:27.600> source<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.640> the<00:01:29.640> 3/4

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
is the tungsten source and the 3/4

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.219 
is the tungsten source and the 3/4
backlight<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:32.640> LED<00:01:33.540> which<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.900> daylight

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
backlight of the LED which is daylight

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.440 
backlight of the LED which is daylight
source<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.119> looks<00:01:36.390> like

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
source so this is what that looks like

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.719 
source so this is what that looks like
and<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.500> messing<00:01:38.189> around<00:01:38.250> testing

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and so I was just messing around testing

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
and so I was just messing around testing
that<00:01:39.000> out<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.420> seeing<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.799> like<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> look

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
that out and seeing how I like the look

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.690 
that out and seeing how I like the look
of<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.150> for<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> lighting<00:01:42.869> setup<00:01:43.049> right<00:01:43.770> camera

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
of it for a lighting setup right camera

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.880 
of it for a lighting setup right camera
come<00:01:45.149> around<00:01:45.299> next<00:01:45.479> time<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> watch<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.350> mess

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
come around next time and watch me mess

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.980 
come around next time and watch me mess
around<00:01:47.040> with<00:01:47.310> other<00:01:47.549> colors<00:01:48.329> lenses

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
