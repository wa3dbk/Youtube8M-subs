defensive<00:01:30.299> workrate<00:01:30.570> which<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> really

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
defensive workrate which is really

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.010 
defensive workrate which is really
really<00:01:31.680> nice<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.880> does<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.479> less<00:01:33.810> then

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
really nice and so does this less then

that defensive workrate it should work

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.730 
that defensive workrate it should work
nicely<00:01:38.130> but<00:01:38.939> again<00:01:39.329> they're<00:01:39.930> not<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> tallest

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
team pretty much so let's jump into some

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.610 
team pretty much so let's jump into some
gameplay<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.700> see<00:03:10.300> how<00:03:10.570> this<00:03:10.780> actually<00:03:11.050> plays

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
gameplay and see how this actually plays

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.390 
gameplay and see how this actually plays

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
in game so this is our first opponent

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.440 
in game so this is our first opponent
and<00:03:15.550> this<00:03:15.730> is<00:03:15.880> exactly<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.350> didn't<00:03:17.860> want<00:03:17.890> a

this<00:03:25.900> was<00:03:26.080> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.440> be<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.860> massive<00:03:27.520> massive

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
this was going to be a massive massive

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.690 
this was going to be a massive massive
struggle<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.110> we<00:03:29.590> are<00:03:29.709> already<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.100> gold<00:03:30.520> down

you the highlights the best bits just a
bit<00:03:35.290> gameplay<00:03:35.770> so<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.400> i<00:03:36.430> could<00:03:36.490> talk<00:03:36.790> about

bit gameplay so that i could talk about

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.210 
bit gameplay so that i could talk about
how<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.330> team<00:03:37.450> plays<00:03:37.990> what<00:03:38.590> players<00:03:38.950> i'd

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
how the team plays what players i'd

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.370 
how the team plays what players i'd
recommend<00:03:39.790> if<00:03:39.940> i'd<00:03:40.360> recommend<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.870> team<00:03:41.110> as<00:03:41.350> a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
recommend if i'd recommend the team as a

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.130 
recommend if i'd recommend the team as a
whole<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.550> best<00:03:42.850> way<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.750> actually

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
whole and the best way that actually

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.290 
whole and the best way that actually
makes<00:03:44.320> this<00:03:44.470> team<00:03:44.770> work<00:03:45.100> because<00:03:45.580> i<00:03:45.760> think<00:03:46.030> if

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
makes this team work because i think if

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.180 
makes this team work because i think if
you<00:03:46.330> play<00:03:46.540> someplace<00:03:46.840> else<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.739> T<00:03:47.980> will<00:03:48.160> be

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
you play someplace else this T will be

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.430 
you play someplace else this T will be
dreadful<00:03:48.850> for<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.150> like<00:03:49.440> absolutely

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
dreadful for you like absolutely

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.580 
dreadful for you like absolutely
dreadful<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:51.010> team<00:03:51.310> is<00:03:51.540> abysmal<00:03:52.540> in<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.440> air

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
dreadful this team is abysmal in the air

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.270 
dreadful this team is abysmal in the air
it's<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:54.130> bad<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:55.120> is<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.630> prime<00:03:56.290> example<00:03:56.560> and

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
it's so bad this is a prime example and

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.100 
it's so bad this is a prime example and
the<00:03:57.370> simple<00:03:57.820> reason<00:03:58.030> for<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.510> is<00:03:58.570> you've<00:03:59.080> just

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
the simple reason for it is you've just

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.729 
the simple reason for it is you've just
got<00:03:59.410> no<00:03:59.650> height<00:03:59.950> no<00:04:00.700> height<00:04:01.110> whatsoever<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.380> I

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
got no height no height whatsoever and I

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.560 
got no height no height whatsoever and I
managed<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.130> draw<00:04:03.400> that<00:04:03.430> game<00:04:03.850> we<00:04:04.239> going<00:04:04.420> to

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
managed to draw that game we going to

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.440 
managed to draw that game we going to
second<00:04:04.989> game<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.440> again<00:04:06.070> is<00:04:06.220> another<00:04:06.450> 433

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
second game and again is another 433

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.600 
second game and again is another 433
team<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:07.930> this<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:08.320> going<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.680> be<00:04:08.770> probably

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
team so this was going to be probably

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.540 
team so this was going to be probably
even<00:04:09.910> harder<00:04:10.510> because<00:04:10.989> his<00:04:11.410> team<00:04:11.709> is<00:04:12.190> actually

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 
even harder because his team is actually

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.729 
even harder because his team is actually
pretty<00:04:12.850> tall<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.959> was<00:04:14.410> going<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.650> be<00:04:14.709> a

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
pretty tall so it was going to be a

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.890 
pretty tall so it was going to be a
strong<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.130> let<00:04:15.250> me<00:04:15.340> talk<00:04:15.550> about<00:04:15.730> more<00:04:16.570> at<00:04:16.810> the

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
strong I let me talk about more at the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.740 
strong I let me talk about more at the
team<00:04:17.169> and<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.440> players<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.640> attack<00:04:19.030> was

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
team and the players the attack was

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.650 
team and the players the attack was
incredible<00:04:20.709> benites<00:04:21.489> maybe<00:04:21.820> not<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.300> much<00:04:22.330> but

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
incredible benites maybe not so much but

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.620 
incredible benites maybe not so much but

amazing this is an example what happens

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.180 
amazing this is an example what happens
when<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.520> have<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.700> caller<00:04:30.970> you<00:04:31.390> get<00:04:31.540> flattened

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
when you have a caller you get flattened

is actually really good I liked this
team<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> lot<00:04:55.270> but<00:04:55.450> in<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.750> air<00:04:55.930> it<00:04:56.290> just<00:04:56.920> lacked

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
team a lot but in the air it just lacked

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.300 
team a lot but in the air it just lacked
so<00:04:57.640> much<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.120> so<00:04:58.570> many<00:04:58.750> people<00:04:59.310> individual

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
so much and so many people individual

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.980 
so much and so many people individual
one<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.730> things<00:05:00.940> like<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.090> they<00:05:01.600> play<00:05:01.960> a

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
one and things like that they play a

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.680 
one and things like that they play a
very<00:05:02.260> crossing<00:05:03.190> style<00:05:03.520> of<00:05:03.730> play<00:05:03.940> and<00:05:04.240> that<00:05:04.450> is

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
very crossing style of play and that is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.440 
very crossing style of play and that is
going<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.500> absolutely<00:05:05.790> ruin<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:06.940> sometimes

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
going to absolutely ruin you sometimes

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:09.120 
going to absolutely ruin you sometimes
you<00:05:07.540> have<00:05:07.630> to<00:05:07.720> be<00:05:07.780> so<00:05:07.990> careful<00:05:08.260> with<00:05:09.040> the

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
you have to be so careful with the

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.040 
you have to be so careful with the
defense<00:05:09.520> because<00:05:09.910> it's<00:05:10.390> not<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.660> faster

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
defense because it's not the faster

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.530 
defense because it's not the faster
defense<00:05:11.410> in<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.620> world<00:05:11.830> it's<00:05:12.100> not<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:13.330> best

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
defense in the world it's not the best

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.110 
defense in the world it's not the best
in<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:13.930> air<00:05:14.080> at<00:05:14.350> all<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:15.370> you're<00:05:15.550> gonna<00:05:15.669> really

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
in the air at all so you're gonna really

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.690 
in the air at all so you're gonna really
have<00:05:16.480> to<00:05:16.510> concentrate<00:05:16.660> too<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:18.070> that's<00:05:18.490> why

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
have to concentrate too and that's why

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.820 
have to concentrate too and that's why
perhaps<00:05:18.940> I<00:05:19.360> can't<00:05:19.630> really<00:05:19.930> recommend<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.650> it's

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
perhaps I can't really recommend it it's

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.220 
perhaps I can't really recommend it it's
fun<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.520> is<00:05:21.850> very<00:05:22.120> interesting<00:05:22.660> and<00:05:22.750> it's

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
fun it is very interesting and it's

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.960 
fun it is very interesting and it's
great<00:05:23.440> fun<00:05:23.680> to<00:05:23.740> use<00:05:23.980> some<00:05:24.160> leaks<00:05:24.370> I<00:05:24.610> hadn't

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
great fun to use some leaks I hadn't

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.140 
great fun to use some leaks I hadn't
used<00:05:25.060> before<00:05:25.300> but<00:05:25.690> there<00:05:26.410> was<00:05:26.530> just<00:05:26.850> such<00:05:27.850> a

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
used before but there was just such a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.820 
used before but there was just such a
difficulty<00:05:28.900> when<00:05:29.020> it<00:05:29.140> came<00:05:29.260> to<00:05:29.410> cross<00:05:29.620> the

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
difficulty when it came to cross the

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.440 
difficulty when it came to cross the
corners<00:05:30.280> there<00:05:30.430> were<00:05:30.520> plays<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:31.000> here<00:05:31.150> I<00:05:31.180> found

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
corners there were plays in here I found

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.930 
corners there were plays in here I found
amazing<00:05:31.750> though<00:05:32.020> Fabian<00:05:32.890> Fabian<00:05:33.820> was

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:33.940 
amazing though Fabian Fabian was

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.520 
amazing though Fabian Fabian was
fantastic<00:05:34.630> his<00:05:34.750> passing<00:05:35.260> was<00:05:35.290> just

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
fantastic his passing was just

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.680 
fantastic his passing was just
incredible<00:05:35.979> again<00:05:36.370> you<00:05:36.910> just<00:05:36.940> see<00:05:37.270> the<00:05:37.300> caller

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
incredible again you just see the caller

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.350 
incredible again you just see the caller
goals<00:05:38.020> going<00:05:38.350> in<00:05:38.680> every<00:05:39.340> single<00:05:39.610> time<00:05:39.790> it's<00:05:40.150> so

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
goals going in every single time it's so

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.469 
goals going in every single time it's so
so<00:05:41.290> easy<00:05:41.650> for<00:05:42.040> them<00:05:42.160> to<00:05:42.220> scroll<00:05:42.940> from<00:05:43.120> a<00:05:43.240> corner

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
so easy for them to scroll from a corner

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.600 
so easy for them to scroll from a corner
it<00:05:43.750> really<00:05:44.169> is<00:05:44.260> there's<00:05:44.470> no<00:05:44.650> height<00:05:44.919> for<00:05:45.490> them

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
it really is there's no height for them

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.640 
it really is there's no height for them
to<00:05:45.729> compete<00:05:46.030> against<00:05:46.360> it's<00:05:46.510> crazy<00:05:46.780> but<00:05:47.110> direct

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
to compete against it's crazy but direct

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.330 
to compete against it's crazy but direct
through<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.310> middle<00:05:48.600> Quintero<00:05:49.600> is<00:05:50.340> amazing

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
through the middle Quintero is amazing

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.850 
through the middle Quintero is amazing
you<00:05:51.700> have<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.210> try<00:05:52.419> Quintero<00:05:53.080> and<00:05:53.350> the<00:05:53.650> third

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
you have to try Quintero and the third

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.310 
you have to try Quintero and the third
of<00:05:53.950> fun<00:05:54.100> buddy<00:05:54.280> test<00:05:54.520> is<00:05:54.669> not<00:05:55.150> bad<00:05:55.450> at<00:05:55.720> all<00:05:56.020> but

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
of fun buddy test is not bad at all but

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.350 
of fun buddy test is not bad at all but
as<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:56.590> can<00:05:56.680> see<00:05:56.890> the<00:05:57.460> defense<00:05:57.850> does<00:05:58.120> get

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
as you can see the defense does get

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.050 
as you can see the defense does get
outpaced<00:05:58.720> quite<00:05:59.050> easily<00:05:59.350> and<00:05:59.790> overall<00:06:00.790> I

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
outpaced quite easily and overall I

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.290 
outpaced quite easily and overall I
think<00:06:01.780> the<00:06:02.110> team<00:06:02.500> does<00:06:03.220> need<00:06:03.490> a<00:06:03.520> bit<00:06:03.940> of<00:06:04.000> work

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
think the team does need a bit of work

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.900 
think the team does need a bit of work
maybe<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:05.200> liga<00:06:05.800> MX<00:06:05.979> team<00:06:06.340> might<00:06:06.520> be<00:06:06.700> a<00:06:06.729> bit

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
maybe a liga MX team might be a bit

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.969 
maybe a liga MX team might be a bit
better<00:06:07.120> but<00:06:07.840> I<00:06:07.900> think<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.350> starting<00:06:08.620> place

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
better but I think the starting place

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.590 
better but I think the starting place
the<00:06:09.310> center<00:06:09.640> depends<00:06:09.910> amid<00:06:10.150> was<00:06:10.300> actually

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:10.600 
the center depends amid was actually

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.180 
the center depends amid was actually
really<00:06:10.900> really<00:06:11.110> good<00:06:11.260> on<00:06:11.410> the<00:06:11.500> goalkeeper<00:06:12.070> to

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
really really good on the goalkeeper to

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:14.430 
really really good on the goalkeeper to
be<00:06:12.280> fair<00:06:12.520> was<00:06:13.360> actually<00:06:13.750> quite<00:06:13.900> nice<00:06:14.169> so

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
be fair was actually quite nice so

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.560 
be fair was actually quite nice so
overall<00:06:14.979> I'm<00:06:15.340> gonna<00:06:15.640> give<00:06:15.820> it<00:06:15.850> a<00:06:15.910> six<00:06:16.210> now<00:06:16.419> that

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
overall I'm gonna give it a six now that

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.930 
overall I'm gonna give it a six now that
might<00:06:16.720> seem<00:06:16.930> harsh<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.590> did<00:06:18.160> have<00:06:18.370> fun<00:06:18.610> with<00:06:18.790> it

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:18.940 
might seem harsh I did have fun with it

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.940 
might seem harsh I did have fun with it
but<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.300> just<00:06:19.450> don't<00:06:19.990> think<00:06:20.229> it's<00:06:20.350> competitive

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:20.950 
but I just don't think it's competitive

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.680 
but I just don't think it's competitive
and<00:06:21.130> that's<00:06:21.280> what<00:06:21.400> I'm<00:06:21.490> basing<00:06:21.640> my<00:06:21.910> razor<00:06:22.210> on<00:06:22.510> I

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
and that's what I'm basing my razor on I

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.750 
and that's what I'm basing my razor on I
don't<00:06:23.200> think<00:06:23.470> it's<00:06:23.620> competitive<00:06:24.190> for

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
don't think it's competitive for

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.610 
don't think it's competitive for
Division<00:06:25.300> one<00:06:25.419> so<00:06:25.600> unfortunately<00:06:26.110> I'm<00:06:26.380> gonna

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
Division one so unfortunately I'm gonna

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.020 
Division one so unfortunately I'm gonna
give<00:06:26.800> it<00:06:26.830> a<00:06:26.890> six<00:06:27.100> but<00:06:27.370> thank<00:06:27.580> you<00:06:27.700> very<00:06:27.940> much
