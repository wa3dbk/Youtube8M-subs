00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
Falcon I've wired up for a fibroid up

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.890 
Falcon I've wired up for a fibroid up
rather<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.090> entire<00:00:12.450> couch<00:00:12.780> over<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.200> I

rather the entire couch over here I
started<00:00:15.900> doing<00:00:16.020> some<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.800> control<00:00:17.310> panel

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
started doing some on the control panel

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250 
started doing some on the control panel
and<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.090> don't<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.390> why<00:00:18.510> that's<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:19.109> so

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
and I don't know why that's going so

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
and I don't know why that's going so
excessively<00:00:19.859> blue<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:20.699> there<00:00:21.060> are<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
excessively blue right now there are a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.470 
excessively blue right now there are a
few<00:00:21.480> bit<00:00:21.689> blue<00:00:22.260> LEDs<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.980> there<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.480> haven't

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
few bit blue LEDs in there I haven't

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.179 
few bit blue LEDs in there I haven't
glued<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.869> back<00:00:25.050> side<00:00:25.320> down<00:00:25.529> yet<00:00:25.859> because

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
glued the back side down yet because

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.700 
glued the back side down yet because
I've<00:00:26.430> done<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:27.000> one<00:00:27.240> millimeter<00:00:27.720> point<00:00:28.109> 75

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I've done the one millimeter point 75

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.529 
I've done the one millimeter point 75
millimeter<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> now<00:00:29.699> I've<00:00:29.880> got<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.240> hit<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
millimeter and now I've got to hit the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.930 
millimeter and now I've got to hit the
point<00:00:30.840> five<00:00:31.140> millimeter<00:00:31.730> there's<00:00:32.730> going<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
point five millimeter there's going to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.720 
point five millimeter there's going to
be<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.030> lot<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.890> that<00:00:34.890> particular<00:00:35.250> wall

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
be a lot of that on that particular wall

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.889 
be a lot of that on that particular wall
there's<00:00:36.600> also<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.870> few<00:00:37.350> other<00:00:38.300> places<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.690> can

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
there's also a few other places I can

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.639 
there's also a few other places I can
throw<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.410> fiber<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:41.129> well<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.760> area

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
throw some fiber as well in that area

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
throw some fiber as well in that area
but<00:00:43.649> over<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.040> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.280> couch<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:46.730> get<00:00:47.730> good

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
but over here on the couch and get good

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.560 
but over here on the couch and get good
focus<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:50.629> that's<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:51.809> too<00:00:52.020> bad<00:00:53.449> so<00:00:54.449> that's

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
focus here that's not too bad so that's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.299 
focus here that's not too bad so that's
pretty<00:00:54.780> much<00:00:54.989> all<00:00:55.199> I'm<00:00:55.410> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.800> for<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
pretty much all I'm going to do for the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
pretty much all I'm going to do for the
lights<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.820> maybe<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:57.899> more<00:00:58.199> whites

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
lights here maybe one or two more whites

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
lights here maybe one or two more whites
in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.859> far<00:00:59.070> right<00:00:59.309> side<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.260> pretty

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
in the far right side but this is pretty

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.420 
in the far right side but this is pretty
much<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.820> no<00:01:03.120> other<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.510> really

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
much it there's no other way to really

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
much it there's no other way to really
react<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.820> wall<00:01:06.210> light<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.409> that's

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
react that wall light there so that's

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.359 
react that wall light there so that's
going<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> stay<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> way<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:10.280> over<00:01:11.280> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
going to stay the way that is over in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.859 
going to stay the way that is over in
this<00:01:11.520> area<00:01:12.560> I've<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.280> led<00:01:14.820> set<00:01:15.119> up<00:01:15.299> so

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
this area I've got this led set up so

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.600 
this area I've got this led set up so
this<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> get<00:01:16.710> hooded<00:01:17.040> like<00:01:17.369> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
this is going to get hooded like this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.350 
this is going to get hooded like this
one<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.939> this<00:01:20.939> should<00:01:21.119> light<00:01:21.330> up

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
one up here and this should light up

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
one up here and this should light up
this<00:01:21.990> entire<00:01:22.200> Bay<00:01:22.680> pretty<00:01:23.100> well<00:01:23.310> then<00:01:24.299> over<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
this entire Bay pretty well then over in

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.929 
this entire Bay pretty well then over in
this<00:01:24.810> corner<00:01:25.100> I'm<00:01:26.100> going<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.430> an<00:01:26.549> LED

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
this corner I'm going to have an LED

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
this corner I'm going to have an LED
hiding<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.479> plain<00:01:27.689> sight<00:01:27.810> I'm<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:28.979> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
hiding in plain sight I'm going to put a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
hiding in plain sight I'm going to put a
bit<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.490> roof<00:01:29.729> over<00:01:29.909> here<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.420> possibly

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
bit of a roof over here and possibly

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.039 
bit of a roof over here and possibly
some<00:01:31.049> pipes<00:01:31.320> going<00:01:31.740> across<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.340> around<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:33.049> may

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
some pipes going across and around I may

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
some pipes going across and around I may
do<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.290> front<00:01:34.740> cover<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.250> throw<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.000> light<00:01:36.180> onto

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
do a front cover to throw the light onto

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.480 
do a front cover to throw the light onto
the<00:01:36.600> floor<00:01:36.930> we'll<00:01:37.500> see<00:01:37.680> about<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.130 

that's<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> additional<00:01:42.390> lights<00:01:42.899> in

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that's it for the additional lights in

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.910 
that's it for the additional lights in
here<00:01:43.820> one<00:01:44.820> thing<00:01:45.000> i<00:01:45.119> should<00:01:45.180> note<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
here one thing i should note is that the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.899 
here one thing i should note is that the
flashing<00:01:47.909> RG<00:01:48.240> bees<00:01:48.450> are<00:01:48.689> working<00:01:49.079> now<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.909> get

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
flashing RG bees are working now and get

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.440 
flashing RG bees are working now and get
some<00:01:51.090> focus<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.140> go<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.700> I'll<00:01:54.000> explain

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
some focus there we go so I'll explain

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
some focus there we go so I'll explain
that<00:01:54.689> problem<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.380> basically<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.159> had

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that problem and basically I had

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.459 
that problem and basically I had
switched<00:01:56.729> up<00:01:56.969> at<00:01:57.149> some<00:01:57.360> point<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.840> an<00:01:57.960> AC<00:01:58.259> power

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
switched up at some point to an AC power

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.120 
switched up at some point to an AC power
supply<00:01:59.930> previously<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.020> turns<00:02:01.290> out<00:02:01.469> i<00:02:01.530> had<00:02:01.920> an

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
supply previously it turns out i had an

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.310 
supply previously it turns out i had an
AC<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.880> DC<00:02:02.909> converter<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:06.140> because<00:02:07.140> it's

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
AC to DC converter so because it's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.160 
AC to DC converter so because it's
alternating<00:02:07.619> current<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.729> LED<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.509> tricolor

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
alternating current the LED a tricolor

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.550 
alternating current the LED a tricolor
LED<00:02:10.709> doesn't<00:02:11.400> get<00:02:11.550> enough<00:02:11.819> power<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.750> initiate

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
LED doesn't get enough power to initiate

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.160 
LED doesn't get enough power to initiate
sequence<00:02:14.130> before<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:15.330> current<00:02:15.569> alternates

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
sequence before the current alternates

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.870 
sequence before the current alternates
so<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.739> to<00:02:16.890> use<00:02:17.040> direct<00:02:17.430> current<00:02:17.760> on

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
so you have to use direct current on

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.660 
so you have to use direct current on
those<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:19.260> I<00:02:19.290> was<00:02:19.470> rut<00:02:19.739> wired<00:02:20.010> this<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.520> up

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
those and I was rut wired this one up

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.510 
those and I was rut wired this one up
for<00:02:20.880> nine<00:02:21.060> volts<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:22.260> running<00:02:22.650> nine

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
for nine volts and that's running nine

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.000 
for nine volts and that's running nine
volts<00:02:23.940> ac<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.140> running<00:02:25.470> at<00:02:25.590> four<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
volts ac this is running at four and a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.809 
volts ac this is running at four and a
half<00:02:26.040> about<00:02:26.730> five<00:02:27.060> volts<00:02:27.510> DC<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:29.040> definitely<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
half about five volts DC so definitely a

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.479 
half about five volts DC so definitely a
big<00:02:29.970> difference<00:02:30.590> another<00:02:31.590> thing<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.160> learned

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
big difference another thing I learned

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.170 
big difference another thing I learned
about<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.090> LEDs<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:33.870> resistors<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.250> not

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
about the LEDs and resistors is that not

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.470 
about the LEDs and resistors is that not
only<00:02:36.360> will<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.690> resistor<00:02:37.290> reduce<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
only will a resistor reduce the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.410 
only will a resistor reduce the
luminosity<00:02:39.480> of<00:02:39.510> any<00:02:39.780> given<00:02:40.019> LED<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.790> will<00:02:42.120> also

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
luminosity of any given LED it will also

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
luminosity of any given LED it will also
reduce<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.410> amount<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.890> milla<00:02:44.160> amps<00:02:44.580> required

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
reduce the amount of milla amps required

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.150 
reduce the amount of milla amps required
to<00:02:46.440> feed<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.910> were<00:02:48.080> so<00:02:49.080> normally<00:02:49.980> these

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
to feed it as it were so normally these

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.430 
to feed it as it were so normally these
are<00:02:50.340> twenty<00:02:50.640> five<00:02:50.790> milliamps<00:02:51.180> each<00:02:51.630> five<00:02:52.170> puts

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
are twenty five milliamps each five puts

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.770 
are twenty five milliamps each five puts
a<00:02:52.650> huge<00:02:52.950> amount<00:02:53.220> of<00:02:53.310> resistor<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.940> them<00:02:54.120> they

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
a huge amount of resistor on them they

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.630 
a huge amount of resistor on them they
could<00:02:54.989> be<00:02:55.110> down<00:02:55.290> at<00:02:55.440> like<00:02:55.590> one<00:02:55.830> milliamp<00:02:56.160> in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
could be down at like one milliamp in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.059 
could be down at like one milliamp in
which<00:02:56.970> case<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.569> low<00:02:57.840> milliamp<00:02:58.200> power<00:02:58.620> supply

which case a low milliamp power supply

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.740 
which case a low milliamp power supply
is<00:02:59.130> perfect<00:02:59.730> for<00:02:59.910> these<00:03:00.030> I've<00:03:00.299> been<00:03:00.450> looking

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
is perfect for these I've been looking

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.979 
is perfect for these I've been looking
around<00:03:00.810> for<00:03:01.140> one<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.650> 2k<00:03:02.010> are<00:03:02.450> one<00:03:03.450> thousand

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
around for one and 2k are one thousand

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.140 
around for one and 2k are one thousand
and<00:03:04.319> eight<00:03:04.830> hundred<00:03:05.250> milliamp<00:03:05.580> power

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
and eight hundred milliamp power

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.360 
and eight hundred milliamp power
supplies<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.049> can<00:03:07.230> get<00:03:07.380> away<00:03:07.470> with<00:03:07.860> half<00:03:08.130> at

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
supplies but I can get away with half at

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:14.229 
supplies but I can get away with half at
if<00:03:08.640> I<00:03:08.760> go<00:03:08.940> with<00:03:08.970> DC<00:03:09.630> converters<00:03:10.260> so<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.410> a

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
if I go with DC converters so this is a

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.220 
if I go with DC converters so this is a
show<00:03:15.239> you<00:03:15.299> around<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.630> couple<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.080> other

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
show you around a couple of the other

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.789 
show you around a couple of the other
lights<00:03:16.500> here<00:03:18.049> this<00:03:19.049> will<00:03:19.200> be<00:03:19.320> the<00:03:19.470> complete

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
lights here this will be the complete

lights here this will be the complete
tour<00:03:20.160> I<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:21.030> paint<00:03:21.269> that<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.600> shroud<00:03:22.200> there

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
tour I have to paint that a shroud there

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.150 
tour I have to paint that a shroud there
on<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.890> white<00:03:23.160> light<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.500> detail<00:03:25.500> it<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.890> it

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
on that white light and detail it up it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
on that white light and detail it up it
really<00:03:26.670> fits<00:03:26.940> close<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.630> upper<00:03:27.900> hole<00:03:28.079> so<00:03:28.320> I

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
really fits close to the upper hole so I

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.880 
really fits close to the upper hole so I
can't<00:03:28.680> put<00:03:28.950> any<00:03:29.100> kind<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.489> grebe<00:03:29.700> Lee's<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.120> it

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
can't put any kind of grebe Lee's on it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.620 
can't put any kind of grebe Lee's on it
why<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:31.950> redspot<00:03:32.640> came<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.510> much

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
why this redspot came out so much

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.330 
why this redspot came out so much
brighter<00:03:33.870> than<00:03:34.140> the<00:03:34.200> others<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.859> haven't<00:03:35.130> quite

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
brighter than the others I haven't quite

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.250 
brighter than the others I haven't quite
figured<00:03:35.579> it<00:03:35.819> out<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.269> could<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> angle<00:03:37.109> or

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
figured it out it could be the angle or

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.670 
figured it out it could be the angle or
something<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.739> that<00:03:38.450> two<00:03:39.450> red<00:03:39.630> leds<00:03:40.140> for<00:03:40.170> the

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
something like that two red leds for the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.420 
something like that two red leds for the
door<00:03:41.000> indicating<00:03:42.000> don't<00:03:42.359> pass<00:03:46.130> over<00:03:47.130> here<00:03:47.310> I'm

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
door indicating don't pass over here I'm

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.430 
door indicating don't pass over here I'm
pretty<00:03:47.670> happy<00:03:47.880> with<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.299> I'm<00:03:48.569> like<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.139> said<00:03:49.410> I

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
pretty happy with this I'm like I said I

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.539 
pretty happy with this I'm like I said I
may<00:03:49.650> throw<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.950> few<00:03:50.160> more<00:03:50.340> white<00:03:50.639> LEDs<00:03:51.150> on<00:03:51.650> and<00:03:52.650> I

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
may throw a few more white LEDs on and I

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.400 
may throw a few more white LEDs on and I
can<00:03:53.790> even<00:03:53.880> hide<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.480> light<00:03:55.019> some<00:03:55.530> degree<00:03:57.410> so

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
can even hide this light some degree so

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.080 
can even hide this light some degree so
all<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.590> light<00:03:59.100> is<00:03:59.130> just<00:03:59.519> coming<00:03:59.730> from<00:03:59.910> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
all that light is just coming from the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.770 
all that light is just coming from the
couch<00:04:00.299> there<00:04:00.630> rather<00:04:00.900> than<00:04:01.139> this<00:04:01.410> wall<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:02.780> lot

of<00:04:03.900> work<00:04:04.049> to<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.319> over<00:04:04.440> here<00:04:04.560> i<00:04:04.829> am<00:04:05.160> going<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
of work to do over here i am going to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.250 
of work to do over here i am going to
try<00:04:05.639> and<00:04:05.730> put<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.150> white<00:04:06.359> panel<00:04:06.870> up<00:04:06.989> across

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
try and put the white panel up across

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.390 
try and put the white panel up across
here<00:04:07.709> and<00:04:07.829> light<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.030> up<00:04:10.069> over<00:04:11.069> here

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
here and light that up over here

here and light that up over here
everything's<00:04:11.910> pretty<00:04:12.150> much<00:04:12.239> done<00:04:12.660> i<00:04:12.690> think

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609 
everything's pretty much done i think

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:16.640 
everything's pretty much done i think
there's<00:04:14.609> a<00:04:14.760> fiber<00:04:15.420> optic<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:16.049> there<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.380> trim

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
there's a fiber optic in there to trim

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.409 
there's a fiber optic in there to trim
once<00:04:16.950> i<00:04:17.100> glue<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> back<00:04:17.639> side<00:04:17.940> of<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.209> wall

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
once i glue the back side of that wall

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.140 
once i glue the back side of that wall
probably<00:04:19.320> tomorrow<00:04:19.950> night<00:04:20.340> over<00:04:20.579> Christmas

probably tomorrow night over Christmas
and<00:04:22.669> over<00:04:23.669> here<00:04:24.000> this<00:04:24.510> may<00:04:24.750> get<00:04:24.960> some<00:04:25.169> kind<00:04:25.440> of

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and over here this may get some kind of

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.910 
and over here this may get some kind of
ceiling<00:04:25.979> going<00:04:26.280> on

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
ceiling going on

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.800 
ceiling going on
definitely<00:04:27.580> need<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.880> put<00:04:28.060> some<00:04:28.240> pipes<00:04:28.480> laying

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
definitely need to put some pipes laying

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.350 
definitely need to put some pipes laying
across<00:04:29.170> some<00:04:29.950> panels<00:04:30.370> and<00:04:30.670> other<00:04:30.820> crap<00:04:31.120> like

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
across some panels and other crap like

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.040 
across some panels and other crap like
that<00:04:32.310> I've<00:04:33.310> put<00:04:33.580> an<00:04:33.700> amber<00:04:34.030> LED<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.720> used<00:04:34.960> to

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
that I've put an amber LED this used to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.810 
that I've put an amber LED this used to
be<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:35.230> lot<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.560> fiber<00:04:35.740> optics<00:04:36.250> coming<00:04:36.670> out<00:04:36.790> of

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
be a lot of fiber optics coming out of

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.120 
be a lot of fiber optics coming out of
there<00:04:37.060> but<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.600> think<00:04:38.110> that's<00:04:38.290> an<00:04:38.440> amber<00:04:38.740> it

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
there but I think that's an amber it

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.160 
there but I think that's an amber it
could<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:39.460> read<00:04:39.730> we'll<00:04:40.480> see<00:04:40.660> when<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:40.840> light<00:04:41.140> it

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
could be read we'll see when I light it

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.530 
could be read we'll see when I light it
up<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.620> wire<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.830> in<00:04:42.160> so<00:04:42.940> there's<00:04:43.090> three<00:04:43.330> more

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
up and wire it in so there's three more

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.570 
up and wire it in so there's three more
LEDs<00:04:43.990> going<00:04:44.380> on<00:04:44.500> total<00:04:44.920> I'll<00:04:45.100> have<00:04:45.250> to<00:04:45.400> do<00:04:45.550> a

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
LEDs going on total I'll have to do a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.700 
LEDs going on total I'll have to do a
count<00:04:45.910> before<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.480> put<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.230> model<00:04:47.560> together

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
count before I put the model together

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.810 
count before I put the model together
and<00:04:49.050> I<00:04:50.050> guess<00:04:50.740> that's<00:04:50.920> it<00:04:51.220> for<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.610> lighting

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
and I guess that's it for the lighting

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.840 
and I guess that's it for the lighting
here<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:53.830> I'll<00:04:53.950> cover<00:04:54.220> some<00:04:54.460> more<00:04:54.610> on<00:04:54.730> the

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
here so I'll cover some more on the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.420 
here so I'll cover some more on the
bottom<00:04:55.180> side<00:04:55.360> if<00:04:55.600> needed<00:04:56.020> when<00:04:56.440> I<00:04:56.470> do<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.100> next

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
bottom side if needed when I do the next

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.980 
bottom side if needed when I do the next
installment<00:04:57.790> which<00:04:58.210> will<00:04:58.360> be<00:04:58.480> all<00:04:58.630> the<00:04:58.660> point

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
installment which will be all the point

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.330 
installment which will be all the point
five<00:04:59.230> millimeter<00:04:59.940> LEDs<00:05:00.940> and<00:05:01.980> i'll<00:05:02.980> have<00:05:03.190> the

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
five millimeter LEDs and i'll have the

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.580 
five millimeter LEDs and i'll have the
bottom<00:05:03.700> wired<00:05:03.910> in<00:05:04.180> so<00:05:04.570> we<00:05:04.960> can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.470> entire

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
bottom wired in so we can see the entire

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.820 
bottom wired in so we can see the entire
setup<00:05:06.570> so<00:05:07.570> that's<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.870> for<00:05:07.900> now<00:05:08.170> thanks<00:05:08.410> for

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
setup so that's it for now thanks for

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.150 
setup so that's it for now thanks for
watching<00:05:09.000> see<00:05:10.000> you
