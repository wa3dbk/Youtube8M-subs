three reasons first up the study shows

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.850 
three reasons first up the study shows
that<00:02:38.790> men<00:02:39.239> are<00:02:39.360> biologically<00:02:40.110> wired<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.680> help

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
that men are biologically wired to help

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
that men are biologically wired to help

second low testosterone levels help men

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.710 
second low testosterone levels help men
stay<00:02:46.980> monogamous<00:02:47.220> now<00:02:47.970> testosterone<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.630> a

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
stay monogamous now testosterone is a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.450 
stay monogamous now testosterone is a
great<00:02:49.140> hormone<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.650> brings<00:02:49.950> men<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.250> women

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
great hormone that brings men and women

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.310 
great hormone that brings men and women
together<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.390> also<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.840> hormone<00:02:52.200> that

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
together but it also is a hormone that

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.350 
together but it also is a hormone that
can<00:02:52.470> drive<00:02:52.650> them<00:02:52.890> apart<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:53.880> nature's

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
can drive them apart so this is nature's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.120 
can drive them apart so this is nature's
way<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.600> keeping<00:02:54.750> those<00:02:55.110> levels<00:02:55.470> lower<00:02:55.770> and

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
way of keeping those levels lower and

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.980 
way of keeping those levels lower and
keeping<00:02:56.400> dad<00:02:56.640> committed<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> family<00:02:57.780> and

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
keeping dad committed to the family and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.930 
keeping dad committed to the family and
third<00:02:58.350> lower<00:02:58.650> testosterone<00:02:58.890> reduces<00:02:59.850> the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
third lower testosterone reduces the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
third lower testosterone reduces the
risk<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.300> prostate<00:03:00.540> cancer<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.140> high

risk of prostate cancer and high

risk of prostate cancer and high
cholesterol<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.250> also<00:03:02.790> reduces<00:03:03.450> risk<00:03:03.720> taking

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
cholesterol and also reduces risk taking
