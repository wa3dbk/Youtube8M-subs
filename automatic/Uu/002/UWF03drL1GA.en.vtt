 we have it all 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.900
 it's the same and we're going 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.070
 very well 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.509
 and we enter 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.120
 for let's apply that all mind 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.060
 completely in minecraft 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 while I 'm talking about this is 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.039
 my first good video my channel is about 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.670
 of 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.230
 make videos of how to install modules 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.049
 for minecraft internet later 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:23.040
 I started doing series on motorcycles 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.960
 with the mod rhythms that I'm noticing 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.710
 in my videos 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:31.880
 and now let's see 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.490
 how will the solutions be other than 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.670
 you in michael 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.520
 options 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.849
 you work and you will not have all 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.370
 these options very well a few skies with 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.760
 detailed graphics where everything will look 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.360
 much more real or only fast for 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.010
 that minecraft rage them in the 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.860
 distance while more here in the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.150
 distance 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.720
 there is no that the marlins is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.780
 the less distance a quick anger 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.140
 with the fps while 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.780
 or do not put more fps is microsoft will walk 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.890
 very good pressing puts you very little very 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 deep medium slow 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.000
 in brigades 1 everyone knows for the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.930
 priority of the screen that you see 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:25.879
 clarito in the dark or dark 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:28.969
 and that would be all with the options of 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:33.000
 eardrums can also send us a 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:36.510
 couple of options that would be 3 1 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.680
 in the camera for having us back and 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.740
 to see us in front 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.230

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.830
