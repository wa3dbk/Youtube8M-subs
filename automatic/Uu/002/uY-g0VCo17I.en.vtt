machine and just the different features
and<00:00:15.960> what<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.500> has<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.650> offer

first<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.300> all<00:00:19.010> machines<00:00:20.010> were<00:00:20.340> created

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
first of all machines were created

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.040 
first of all machines were created
originally<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.680> two<00:00:23.039> intensive<00:00:23.519> purposes

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
originally for two intensive purposes

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.509 
originally for two intensive purposes
one<00:00:25.050> would<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.500> for<00:00:25.740> rehab<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.730> know<00:00:26.760> post-op

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
one would be for rehab you know post-op

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.790 
one would be for rehab you know post-op
rehabilitating<00:00:29.519> some<00:00:29.760> sort<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.000> injury<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
rehabilitating some sort of injury and

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.500 
rehabilitating some sort of injury and
isolating<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.890> muscle<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.850> bring<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.149> back<00:00:33.329> to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
isolating a muscle to bring it back to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.150

the<00:00:35.160> second<00:00:35.730> would<00:00:36.360> just<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.690> for

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
the second would just be for

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.130 
the second would just be for
bodybuilders<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.700> those<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.600> either<00:00:39.989> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
bodybuilders so if those if either of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.490 
bodybuilders so if those if either of
those<00:00:40.320> aren't<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> part<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.070> your<00:00:41.219> goal<00:00:41.430> path<00:00:41.760> or

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
those aren't a part of your goal path or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.470 
those aren't a part of your goal path or
any<00:00:43.500> part<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> your<00:00:44.010> workout<00:00:44.460> program<00:00:45.000> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
any part of your workout program you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.560 
any part of your workout program you
probably<00:00:45.809> shouldn't<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> machines

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
probably shouldn't be on the machines

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
probably shouldn't be on the machines
because<00:00:48.570> they're<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:48.960> do<00:00:49.079> more<00:00:49.289> harm<00:00:49.469> than

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
because they're gonna do more harm than

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
because they're gonna do more harm than
good<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.360> but<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.570> those<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.050> who<00:00:52.260> are

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
good to you but for those of you who are

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.880 
good to you but for those of you who are
rehabbing<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.610> knee<00:00:54.230> maybe<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.680> had

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
rehabbing a knee maybe you just had

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
rehabbing a knee maybe you just had
surgery<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.640> your<00:00:56.820> ACL<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.510> you're<00:00:58.260> a

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
surgery on your ACL or you're a

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.720 
surgery on your ACL or you're a
bodybuilder<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.100> trying<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> bulk<00:00:59.550> your

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
bodybuilder and trying to bulk your

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
bodybuilder and trying to bulk your
quads<00:01:00.320> leg<00:01:01.320> extension<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> great<00:01:02.219> exercise

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
quads leg extension is a great exercise

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.030 
quads leg extension is a great exercise
I<00:01:02.940> would<00:01:03.930> say<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> only<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.739> look<00:01:04.860> out

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
I would say the only thing to look out

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.100 
I would say the only thing to look out
for<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.850> terms<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.270> its<00:01:06.420> features<00:01:06.600> because<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
for in terms of its features because you

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.450 
for in terms of its features because you
can<00:01:07.409> adjust<00:01:08.180> that<00:01:09.180> angle<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.990> knee<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.560> how

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
can adjust that angle at the knee of how

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030 
can adjust that angle at the knee of how
far<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.510> knee<00:01:12.659> flexion<00:01:12.960> you're<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.560> so

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
far in to knee flexion you're going so

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.899 
far in to knee flexion you're going so
if<00:01:14.189> I'm<00:01:14.340> seated<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.409> can<00:01:16.409> adjust<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.310> starting

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
if I'm seated I can adjust that starting

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.480 
if I'm seated I can adjust that starting
point<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:19.110> lever<00:01:19.350> mechanism<00:01:19.560> of<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.310> leg

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
point on the lever mechanism of the leg

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
point on the lever mechanism of the leg
extension<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.200> start<00:01:22.439> with

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
extension so that I can start with

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
extension so that I can start with
extreme<00:01:23.100> flexion<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.420> through<00:01:24.659> my

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
extreme flexion and go through my

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.499 
extreme flexion and go through my
contraction<00:01:25.439> or<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.640> start<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.450> a

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
contraction or you can start at a

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.690 
contraction or you can start at a
slightly<00:01:27.900> higher<00:01:28.259> angle<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.460> through

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
slightly higher angle and go through

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.649 
slightly higher angle and go through
your<00:01:29.729> contraction<00:01:30.829> me<00:01:31.829> personally<00:01:32.659> just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
your contraction me personally just

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
your contraction me personally just
because<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.140> experience<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.820> physical

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
because of experience and what physical

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.450 
because of experience and what physical
therapists<00:01:36.780> are<00:01:36.990> teaching<00:01:37.890> their<00:01:38.009> clients<00:01:38.369> to

therapists are teaching their clients to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.390 
therapists are teaching their clients to
do<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.729> as<00:01:38.939> well<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.740> for<00:01:40.740> safety<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
do now as well is for safety and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.760 
do now as well is for safety and
integrity<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.909> your<00:01:42.119> knee<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:43.140> should<00:01:43.560> not

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
integrity of your knee you should not

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
integrity of your knee you should not
especially<00:01:44.340> when<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> really<00:01:45.240> high

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
especially when you have a really high

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
especially when you have a really high
load<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:45.960> high<00:01:46.079> resistance<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.250> you

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
load or high resistance so for you

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.219 
load or high resistance so for you
bodybuilders<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.780> shouldn't<00:01:49.140> be

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
bodybuilders out there you shouldn't be

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.490 
bodybuilders out there you shouldn't be
going<00:01:49.439> deep<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.570> extreme<00:01:51.570> knee<00:01:51.750> flexion<00:01:52.140> at

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
going deep into extreme knee flexion at

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.830 
going deep into extreme knee flexion at
the<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.310> applying<00:01:53.880> force<00:01:54.329> from<00:01:54.570> there

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the start and applying force from there

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
the start and applying force from there
because<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> shearing<00:01:56.490> angle<00:01:56.850> on<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
because of the shearing angle on the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.069 
because of the shearing angle on the
knee<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:59.030> better<00:02:00.030> starting<00:02:00.509> position<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
knee so a better starting position is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.499 
knee so a better starting position is
for<00:02:01.320> safety<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> won't<00:02:03.210> blow<00:02:03.390> out

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
for safety and so you won't blow out

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
for safety and so you won't blow out
your<00:02:03.540> knee<00:02:03.840> during<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.469> leg<00:02:05.040> extension

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
your knee during a leg extension

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.649 
your knee during a leg extension
exercise<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> lot<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.299> weight<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
exercise with a lot of weight is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.490 
exercise with a lot of weight is
starting<00:02:07.500> slightly<00:02:08.250> above<00:02:08.720> 90<00:02:09.720> degrees<00:02:10.110> and
