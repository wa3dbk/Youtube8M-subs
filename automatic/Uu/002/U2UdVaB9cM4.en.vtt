what do we need to do to make asparagus

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.140 
what do we need to do to make asparagus
and<00:00:25.350> an<00:00:25.410> assistant<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.400> successful

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and an assistant that's a successful

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.540 
and an assistant that's a successful
crop<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:28.170> time<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.740> year<00:00:28.920> what's<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.400> that's

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
crop at time of year what's what that's

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.970 
crop at time of year what's what that's
probably<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> most<00:00:30.150> important<00:00:30.570> thing<00:00:30.720> okay

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
probably the most important thing okay

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
probably the most important thing okay
you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.250> plant<00:00:32.550> your<00:00:32.640> asparagus<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.690> usually

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can plant your asparagus and usually

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
you can plant your asparagus and usually
it's<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.170> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.469> bare<00:00:34.649> root<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.160> this

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's going to be bare root like this

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's going to be bare root like this
okay<00:00:36.030> in<00:00:38.149> somewhere<00:00:39.149> between<00:00:39.590> April<00:00:40.590> 15th<00:00:41.010> and

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
okay in somewhere between April 15th and

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.520 
okay in somewhere between April 15th and
May<00:00:41.370> 50<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> spring<00:00:42.570> crop<00:00:42.809> yes<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.410> is

May 50 so it is a spring crop yes it is
a<00:00:43.559> spring<00:00:43.950> crop<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.489> again<00:00:45.390> usually<00:00:45.690> you're

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
a spring crop and again usually you're

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
a spring crop and again usually you're
going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> get<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.289> bare<00:00:46.530> root<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.190> easy

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
going to get a bare root like this easy

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.819 
going to get a bare root like this easy
to<00:00:47.700> find<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.329> most<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.050> garden<00:00:49.379> centers

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to find in most of the garden centers

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
to make sure that the roots are not

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.569 
to make sure that the roots are not
going<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.840> way<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.410> bad<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.340> that

it that way okay and what about

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.179 
it that way okay and what about
varieties<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> lot<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.920> choices

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
varieties do we have a lot of choices

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.660 
varieties do we have a lot of choices
out<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.549> sure<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.590> well<00:01:17.220> first<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> all

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
out there sure we have well first of all

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.179 
out there sure we have well first of all
you<00:01:17.820> want<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.210> try<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.869> choose<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> male

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you want to try and choose a male

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.210 
you want to try and choose a male
variety<00:01:20.460> rather<00:01:21.240> than<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> female<00:01:21.780> variety

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
variety rather than a female variety

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.859 
variety rather than a female variety
because<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> female<00:01:23.729> variety<00:01:24.000> produces

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
because the female variety produces

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
because the female variety produces
fruit<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.860> takes<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> lot<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.520> energy<00:01:26.909> out

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
fruit and that takes a lot of energy out

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
fruit and that takes a lot of energy out
of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> plant<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.860> could<00:01:29.100> be<00:01:29.189> using<00:01:29.369> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of the plant and it could be using that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
of the plant and it could be using that
for<00:01:29.670> spear<00:01:30.090> production<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> males<00:01:31.079> tend

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
for spear production so the males tend

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.890 
for spear production so the males tend
to<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:32.040> productive<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.509> fruit<00:01:33.750> is

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
to be more productive and the fruit is

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
to be more productive and the fruit is
the<00:01:34.049> pretty<00:01:34.259> red<00:01:34.500> berries<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.220> sometimes

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the pretty red berries that we sometimes

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
see in floral arrangements so we don't

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.800

then what do we need to do to make it

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.740 
then what do we need to do to make it
work<00:02:26.530> well<00:02:27.099> we<00:02:27.400> have<00:02:27.730> dug<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.000> trench<00:02:28.239> here

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
work well we have dug a trench here

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.949 
work well we have dug a trench here
right<00:02:29.140> about<00:02:29.680> six<00:02:30.069> inches<00:02:30.459> deep<00:02:30.730> they<00:02:31.629> used<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
right about six inches deep they used to

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.420 
right about six inches deep they used to
recommend<00:02:32.319> about<00:02:32.769> eight<00:02:33.010> inches<00:02:33.370> deep

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
recommend about eight inches deep

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.100 
recommend about eight inches deep
however<00:02:33.970> they<00:02:34.360> found<00:02:34.569> that<00:02:34.750> it's<00:02:34.900> more

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
however they found that it's more

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.020 
however they found that it's more
productive<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.799> way<00:02:36.010> okay<00:02:36.489> that's<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.760> site

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
productive this way okay that's the site

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.059 
productive this way okay that's the site
to<00:02:37.239> be<00:02:37.269> in<00:02:37.480> full<00:02:37.690> Sun<00:02:37.989> at<00:02:38.170> least<00:02:38.379> six<00:02:38.650> hours<00:02:39.040> a

in you want to make sure to spread out

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.069 
in you want to make sure to spread out
the<00:02:45.730> roots<00:02:46.019> put<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:47.650> little<00:02:47.829> tips<00:02:48.190> right

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
the roots put the the little tips right

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.690 
the roots put the the little tips right
and<00:02:50.099> they<00:02:51.099> should<00:02:51.130> be<00:02:51.610> about<00:02:52.390> 18<00:02:53.290> inches<00:02:53.590> apart

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
and they should be about 18 inches apart

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.920 
and they should be about 18 inches apart
so<00:02:54.880> in<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.060> trench<00:02:55.329> like<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.690> you're<00:02:55.900> only

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
so in a trench like this you're only

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.530 
so in a trench like this you're only
gonna<00:02:56.140> get<00:02:56.380> two<00:02:56.829> plants<00:02:57.099> right<00:02:57.549> okay<00:02:58.390> I'm

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
gonna get two plants right okay I'm

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.690 
gonna get two plants right okay I'm
gonna<00:02:58.629> start<00:02:58.900> filling<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.440> in<00:02:59.530> how<00:02:59.799> much<00:03:00.370> am<00:03:00.610> I

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
gonna start filling it in how much am I

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.460 
gonna start filling it in how much am I
feeling<00:03:00.970> it<00:03:01.180> in<00:03:01.299> gradually<00:03:02.110> or<00:03:02.290> am<00:03:02.379> I<00:03:02.440> just

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
feeling it in gradually or am I just

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.490 
feeling it in gradually or am I just
going<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:03.239> know<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.450> old<00:03:04.599> recommendation

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
going to know the old recommendation

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.979 
going to know the old recommendation
used<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.890> be<00:03:06.040> that<00:03:06.430> you<00:03:06.760> fill<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.420> gradually

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
used to be that you fill it in gradually

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.830 
used to be that you fill it in gradually
however<00:03:08.349> new<00:03:08.890> research<00:03:08.920> has<00:03:09.400> shown<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.569> you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
however new research has shown that you

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.390 
however new research has shown that you
really<00:03:11.079> don't<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.890> that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
really don't have to do that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.020 
really don't have to do that
and<00:03:12.579> as<00:03:13.180> far<00:03:13.510> as<00:03:13.890> fertilizing<00:03:14.890> goes<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.519> have

likes<00:03:36.940> plenty<00:03:37.450> of<00:03:37.660> both<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.560> here<00:03:39.099> we<00:03:39.250> don't

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
likes plenty of both so here we don't

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.430 
likes plenty of both so here we don't
have<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.760> worry<00:03:39.970> about<00:03:40.120> that<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:40.660> also<00:03:40.840> likes<00:03:41.260> a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
have to worry about that it also likes a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.650 
have to worry about that it also likes a
pH<00:03:41.769> between<00:03:42.269> six<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.660> six<00:03:43.959> point<00:03:44.290> eight<00:03:44.440> so<00:03:45.660> we

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
pH between six and six point eight so we

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.559 
pH between six and six point eight so we
might<00:03:46.930> be<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.169> little<00:03:47.290> alkaline<00:03:48.069> here<00:03:48.510> so<00:03:49.510> you

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
might be a little alkaline here so you

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.800 
might be a little alkaline here so you
might<00:03:49.959> have<00:03:50.169> to<00:03:50.410> add<00:03:50.560> some<00:03:50.849> iron<00:03:51.849> sulfate<00:03:52.480> if

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
might have to add some iron sulfate if

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.490 
might have to add some iron sulfate if
it's<00:03:53.049> if<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.470> pH<00:03:54.190> is<00:03:54.400> excessive<00:03:55.000> up<00:03:55.989> north<00:03:56.349> you

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
it's if the pH is excessive up north you

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.430 
it's if the pH is excessive up north you
have<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.980> opposite<00:03:57.549> problem<00:03:57.609> right<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:58.930> you

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
have the opposite problem right so you

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.440 
have the opposite problem right so you
should<00:03:59.650> get<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.799> soil<00:04:00.040> test<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.790> find<00:04:00.970> out<00:04:01.269> what

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
should get a soil test to find out what

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.089 
should get a soil test to find out what
you<00:04:01.599> need<00:04:01.780> and<00:04:01.900> you<00:04:01.959> do<00:04:02.139> need<00:04:02.290> some<00:04:02.680> nitrogen

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
you need and you do need some nitrogen

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.909 
you need and you do need some nitrogen
at<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.700> okay<00:04:04.000> do<00:04:04.299> I<00:04:04.359> bury<00:04:04.630> that<00:04:04.870> yes<00:04:05.590> you<00:04:05.769> do

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
but next year the asparagus should come

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.909 
but next year the asparagus should come
up<00:04:18.419> about<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.479> time<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.959> forsythia<00:04:20.530> starts

up about the time the forsythia starts
okay<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:23.080> can<00:04:23.469> harvest<00:04:23.860> that<00:04:24.370> first<00:04:24.700> year

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
okay and you can harvest that first year

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.660 
okay and you can harvest that first year
okay<00:04:25.300> only<00:04:26.020> for<00:04:26.440> about<00:04:26.530> three<00:04:26.919> weeks<00:04:26.950> and<00:04:27.430> you

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
okay only for about three weeks and you

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.580 
okay only for about three weeks and you
want<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.880> make<00:04:28.000> sure<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.960> start<00:04:29.350> doing

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
want to make sure that you start doing

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.530 
want to make sure that you start doing
it<00:04:29.800> when<00:04:30.070> they're<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.700> little<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.180> bigger<00:04:31.300> than

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
it when they're a little bit bigger than

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.270 
it when they're a little bit bigger than
pencil<00:04:31.930> size<00:04:32.140> okay

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
pencil size okay

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.600 
pencil size okay
the<00:04:33.640> next<00:04:33.910> year<00:04:34.210> however<00:04:34.570> your<00:04:35.370> harvest<00:04:36.370> date

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
the next year however your harvest date

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.700 
the next year however your harvest date
is<00:04:36.850> going<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.300> increase<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.110> four<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.440> six

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
is going to increase to four to six

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.620 
is going to increase to four to six
weeks<00:04:38.980> and<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.580> year<00:04:39.730> after<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.450> third

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
weeks and the year after that the third

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.020 
weeks and the year after that the third
year<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:41.500> might<00:04:41.770> be<00:04:41.920> six<00:04:42.160> to<00:04:42.310> eight<00:04:42.460> weeks<00:04:42.760> so

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
year it might be six to eight weeks so

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.250 
year it might be six to eight weeks so
each<00:04:43.180> year<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.450> little<00:04:43.720> bit<00:04:43.840> longer

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
each year a little bit longer

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.640 
each year a little bit longer
exactly<00:04:44.920> more<00:04:45.160> crop<00:04:45.430> than<00:04:45.700> -<00:04:45.910> okay<00:04:46.810> and<00:04:47.080> and<00:04:47.410> so

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
exactly more crop than - okay and and so

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.220 
exactly more crop than - okay and and so
we're<00:04:48.100> harvesting<00:04:48.310> more<00:04:49.090> each<00:04:49.210> year

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.230 
we're harvesting more each year

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.100 
we're harvesting more each year
what<00:04:50.890> about<00:04:50.980> weed<00:04:51.280> control<00:04:51.690> well<00:04:52.690> there's<00:04:53.050> a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
what about weed control well there's a

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.950 
what about weed control well there's a
myth<00:04:53.440> yes<00:04:54.010> there<00:04:54.340> is<00:04:54.760> there's<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.630> myth<00:04:55.930> that

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
myth yes there is there's a myth that

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.560 
myth yes there is there's a myth that
you<00:04:56.230> should<00:04:56.560> use<00:04:56.800> salt<00:04:57.280> yeah<00:04:57.850> on<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.270> soil

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
you should use salt yeah on the soil

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.740 
you should use salt yeah on the soil
around<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.080> blade<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.770> while<00:05:00.760> asparagus<00:05:01.360> is

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
around the blade and while asparagus is

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.500 
around the blade and while asparagus is
salt<00:05:02.020> tolerant<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.950> soil<00:05:03.220> is<00:05:03.460> not<00:05:03.490> no<00:05:03.940> it's

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
salt tolerant the soil is not no it's

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.320 
salt tolerant the soil is not no it's
bad<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:05.140> is<00:05:05.410> and<00:05:05.770> it<00:05:06.100> actually<00:05:06.340> ruins<00:05:07.030> the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
bad it is and it actually ruins the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.960 
bad it is and it actually ruins the
structure<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.050> soil<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:08.620> no<00:05:08.740> salt<00:05:08.980> no<00:05:09.220> salt

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
structure of the soil so no salt no salt

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.740 
structure of the soil so no salt no salt
mulch<00:05:10.750> mulch<00:05:11.110> would<00:05:11.830> be<00:05:11.950> great

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
mulch mulch would be great

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.960 
mulch mulch would be great

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
pulling them out the second year you can

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.380 
pulling them out the second year you can
use<00:05:19.510> a<00:05:19.540> pre-emergent<00:05:20.290> weed<00:05:20.560> control<00:05:20.890> if<00:05:21.550> if

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
use a pre-emergent weed control if if

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.720 
use a pre-emergent weed control if if
need<00:05:23.050> be<00:05:23.080> don't<00:05:23.680> destroy<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.130> soil<00:05:24.340> with<00:05:24.550> salt
