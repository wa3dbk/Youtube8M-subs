to use the lights so for the next couple
of<00:00:38.700> episodes<00:00:38.790> we're<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> talk<00:00:39.809> about

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
of episodes we're going to talk about

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.690 
of episodes we're going to talk about
the<00:00:40.140> differences<00:00:40.559> between<00:00:40.620> types<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.489> lights

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the differences between types of lights

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000 
the differences between types of lights
and<00:00:41.940> try<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> help<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> figure<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.320> what

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
and try to help you figure out what

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
and try to help you figure out what
would<00:00:44.129> be<00:00:44.190> most<00:00:44.579> appropriate<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.770> now

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
would be most appropriate for you now

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.590 
would be most appropriate for you now
the<00:00:46.829> first<00:00:47.070> light<00:00:47.309> I'm<00:00:47.550> gonna<00:00:47.730> talk<00:00:47.969> about<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
the first light I'm gonna talk about is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.560 
the first light I'm gonna talk about is
fluorescent<00:00:49.640> fluorescent<00:00:50.640> lights<00:00:51.210> are<00:00:51.510> a

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
fluorescent fluorescent lights are a

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
fluorescent fluorescent lights are a
really<00:00:52.199> solid<00:00:52.410> option<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.250> many<00:00:53.340> occasions

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
really solid option for many occasions

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660 
really solid option for many occasions
they<00:00:54.690> give<00:00:54.840> off<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> very<00:00:55.289> soft<00:00:55.649> even<00:00:56.100> light

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
they give off a very soft even light

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.910 
they give off a very soft even light
that<00:00:56.969> reduces<00:00:57.449> shadows<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> basically<00:00:58.649> makes

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
that reduces shadows and basically makes

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.250 
that reduces shadows and basically makes
your<00:00:58.980> subjects<00:00:59.430> look<00:00:59.640> good<00:00:59.969> they're<00:01:00.960> also<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
your subjects look good they're also a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
your subjects look good they're also a
very<00:01:01.350> white<00:01:01.800> light<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:02.579> actually

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
very white light they're actually

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
very white light they're actually
daylight<00:01:03.300> balanced<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.260> other<00:01:04.530> forms<00:01:04.860> of

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
daylight balanced so other forms of

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.800 
daylight balanced so other forms of
light<00:01:05.250> like<00:01:05.580> halogen<00:01:06.119> lights<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.540> instance

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
light like halogen lights for instance

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
light like halogen lights for instance
have<00:01:07.439> a<00:01:07.470> much<00:01:07.650> lower<00:01:07.920> color<00:01:08.310> temperature<00:01:08.820> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
have a much lower color temperature so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
have a much lower color temperature so
when<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.479> mix<00:01:09.600> sunlight<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> halogen<00:01:10.530> light

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
when you mix sunlight and halogen light

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
when you mix sunlight and halogen light
in<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.220> shot<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.790> can<00:01:12.060> give<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.270> image

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
in the same shot it can give your image

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.440 
in the same shot it can give your image
a<00:01:12.810> kind<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.350> weird<00:01:13.590> tint<00:01:14.240> but<00:01:15.240> since

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
a kind of a weird tint but since

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.820 
a kind of a weird tint but since
fluorescent<00:01:15.930> lights<00:01:16.080> are<00:01:16.229> already<00:01:16.350> daylight

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
fluorescent lights are already daylight

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
fluorescent lights are already daylight
balanced<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:17.820> means<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.330> same

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
balanced which means they have the same

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.840 
balanced which means they have the same
color<00:01:18.750> temperature<00:01:19.259> as<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> Sun<00:01:19.740> they<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.759> be

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
color temperature as the Sun they can be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
color temperature as the Sun they can be
used<00:01:21.060> outside<00:01:21.540> without<00:01:21.780> any<00:01:22.110> problems

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
used outside without any problems

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.770 
used outside without any problems
so<00:01:23.400> fluorescent<00:01:23.970> lights<00:01:24.119> give<00:01:24.360> off<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> very

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
so fluorescent lights give off a very

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.289 
so fluorescent lights give off a very
nice<00:01:25.080> light<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.610> drawbacks<00:01:26.850> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
nice light but one of the drawbacks to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
nice light but one of the drawbacks to
them<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.259> aren't<00:01:28.409> very<00:01:28.650> powerful

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
them is that they aren't very powerful

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.940 
them is that they aren't very powerful
in<00:01:29.909> fluorescent<00:01:30.509> lights<00:01:30.720> light<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.799> generated

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
in fluorescent lights light is generated

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
in fluorescent lights light is generated
by<00:01:32.400> individual<00:01:33.090> bulbs<00:01:33.450> each<00:01:34.350> giving<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.860> 300

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
by individual bulbs each giving off 300

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.149 
by individual bulbs each giving off 300
watts<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.880> incandescent<00:01:36.329> light<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.040> get

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
watts of incandescent light so to get

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:38.840 
watts of incandescent light so to get
more<00:01:38.340> wattage

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
more wattage

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.399 
more wattage
you<00:01:39.210> need<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> light<00:01:39.840> head<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> has

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you need to have a light head that has

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.920 
you need to have a light head that has
multiple<00:01:40.890> banks<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.549> it<00:01:42.329> also<00:01:42.479> means<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
multiple banks on it it also means that

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.749 
multiple banks on it it also means that
there's<00:01:43.320> no<00:01:43.439> dimmer<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> lights<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.670> if

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
there's no dimmer on the lights so if

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.520 
there's no dimmer on the lights so if
you<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.090> turn<00:01:45.240> down<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.720> light<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:46.500> have

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you need to turn down the light you have

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
you need to turn down the light you have
to<00:01:46.740> switch<00:01:46.979> off<00:01:47.130> individual<00:01:47.850> bulbs<00:01:48.470> however

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to switch off individual bulbs however

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
to switch off individual bulbs however
one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.610> nice<00:01:50.820> things<00:01:51.180> about

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
one of the really nice things about
