 a the bm will manifest that there is an energy to the proteins of the milk of 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.430
 cow that gives the milk formula 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 that are used from birth to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.659
 beyond one or two years 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:33.489
 because it manifests some alteration in its digestive system fundamentally 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.580
 how can it be vomiting could 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.449
 but it can also manifest 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.620
 some rash 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.920
 a type urticaria by type eczema that would be atopic dermatitis 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.789
 that is to say that in principle 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.010
 know that you have an alteration that could be related to the taking of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.139
 Milk formula cow's milk any of the milk powders for 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.990
 babies 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.160
 that has just recently introduced 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.680
 what is typical in allergy is the fact that the child who has 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.990
 taken breastfeeding three four months 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.439
 and then you start with bottles of milk formula min from 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:13.940
 cow 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.330
 then those symptoms appear that we have commented 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.790
 to ensure it 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.120
 yesterday analytical elements 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.320
 the immunoglobulins that go to react with those proteins the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.940
 milk 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.950
 who will be 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.680
 present and elevated in the blood of the child suspected of allergy 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.710
 cutaneous public works 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.710
 chopping the boot of the extract of the different proteins of the milk 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.719
 on the skin 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.560
 and will cause a no 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.870
 a bomb 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.080
 option nader directly 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.999
 with that 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.330
 we can ensure 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.630
 which the child suffers from an allergy to cow's milk 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
 I have been a child to prove it more reliably 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.509
 suspect of that problem is that it has not taken it for a long time 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.300
 it would be reintroduced 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.880
 controlling him in the hospital 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.149
 the verse reacts again a similar father way 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.459
 alak was 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.180
 min the reason for suspected allergy and symptoms appear again 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 how could the rash be vomiting and so on
