00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.649 
newer model this one allows you to use
the<00:01:52.770> sonic<00:01:53.490> therapy<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> light<00:01:54.420> therapy

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the sonic therapy and the light therapy

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.830 
the sonic therapy and the light therapy
all<00:01:55.079> at<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> same<00:01:55.649> time<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> have

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
all at the same time the one that I have

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.260 
all at the same time the one that I have
at<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.469> beach<00:01:58.649> hat<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.100> less<00:01:59.579> expensive<00:01:59.759> I

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
at the beach hat is less expensive I

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.810 
at the beach hat is less expensive I
think<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.659> probably<00:02:01.020> 80<00:02:01.680> 90<00:02:02.280> dollar<00:02:02.490> range

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
think it's probably 80 90 dollar range

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.539 
think it's probably 80 90 dollar range
but<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.229> use<00:02:04.500> each<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.159> settings

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
but you have to use each of the settings

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.010 
but you have to use each of the settings
separately<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.360> takes<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.689> little<00:02:06.840> longer

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
separately so it takes a little longer

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380 
separately so it takes a little longer
to<00:02:07.350> use<00:02:07.560> when<00:02:08.310> I'm<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.670> beach<00:02:08.759> at<00:02:08.970> I<00:02:09.119> have

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
to use when I'm at the beach at I have

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.780 
to use when I'm at the beach at I have
more<00:02:09.569> time<00:02:09.810> when<00:02:10.200> I'm<00:02:10.349> here<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.920> less<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
more time when I'm here I have less so I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.410 
more time when I'm here I have less so I
went<00:02:12.000> ahead<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.270> got<00:02:12.599> this<00:02:12.900> one

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
went ahead and got this one

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.610 
went ahead and got this one
that<00:02:13.599> does<00:02:13.810> allow<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.349> use<00:02:14.380> that

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
that does allow you to use that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.520 
that does allow you to use that
ultrasonic<00:02:15.490> setting<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.840> light<00:02:17.050> setting

there<00:04:06.880> say<00:04:07.180> a<00:04:07.359> year<00:04:07.660> from<00:04:07.870> now<00:04:07.930> i<00:04:08.230> did<00:04:08.560> see<00:04:08.799> some

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
there say a year from now i did see some

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.559 
there say a year from now i did see some
that<00:04:09.280> i<00:04:09.310> had<00:04:09.609> that<00:04:09.850> are<00:04:10.000> no<00:04:10.120> longer<00:04:10.359> available

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
that i had that are no longer available

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.590 
that i had that are no longer available
and<00:04:11.109> that<00:04:11.139> leads<00:04:11.590> me<00:04:11.799> to<00:04:12.250> believe<00:04:12.280> that<00:04:12.910> she

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
and that leads me to believe that she

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.569 
and that leads me to believe that she
creates<00:04:13.989> new<00:04:14.200> product<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.829> lets<00:04:15.069> the<00:04:15.280> old
