people do for baked potatoes these are a
lot<00:00:37.500> smaller<00:00:37.739> than<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.160> ones<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.460> normally<00:00:38.820> use

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
lot smaller than the ones I normally use

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.139 
lot smaller than the ones I normally use
but<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.550> it's<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:41.730> could<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
but you know it's what I could get

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.850 
but you know it's what I could get
within<00:00:42.600> driving<00:00:42.809> distance<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.680> what<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
within driving distance so that's what I

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.029 
within driving distance so that's what I
used<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> basic<00:00:44.940> idea<00:00:45.059> here<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.039> soak

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
used so the basic idea here is to soak

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.590

the<00:00:47.190> potatoes<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.820> brine<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> little

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.730 

so<00:01:28.770> calls<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.220> two<00:01:29.370> quarts<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:30.740> the

water around here sucks pretty bad so is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the salt in the water which takes a few

the salt in the water which takes a few
minutes<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> probably<00:01:55.140> helps<00:01:55.680> if<00:01:55.830> it's<00:01:55.979> warm

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
minutes and probably helps if it's warm

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.830 
minutes and probably helps if it's warm
before<00:01:58.800> I<00:01:59.009> throw<00:01:59.280> them<00:01:59.400> in<00:01:59.490> normally<00:01:59.910> I<00:01:59.940> cut

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
before I throw them in normally I cut

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
before I throw them in normally I cut
off<00:02:00.990> any<00:02:01.200> bad<00:02:01.440> bits<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.979> find<00:02:02.250> or<00:02:02.580> any<00:02:03.060> eyes

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
off any bad bits that I find or any eyes

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.430 
off any bad bits that I find or any eyes
that<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:03.630> sprouting<00:02:04.050> but<00:02:04.170> these<00:02:04.320> ones

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
that are sprouting but these ones

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.810 
that are sprouting but these ones
actually<00:02:04.860> you're<00:02:05.009> looking<00:02:05.220> pretty<00:02:05.580> good

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
actually you're looking pretty good

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020 
actually you're looking pretty good
maybe<00:02:06.360> it's<00:02:07.020> water<00:02:07.290> too<00:02:07.619> okay<00:02:08.550> that's

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
maybe it's water too okay that's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.690 
maybe it's water too okay that's
completely<00:02:09.509> dissolved<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.350> it's<00:02:11.340> time<00:02:11.520> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
completely dissolved so it's time to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.180 
completely dissolved so it's time to
toss<00:02:11.850> these<00:02:12.150> bad<00:02:12.330> boys<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.130 

well<00:02:19.940> let's<00:02:20.180> say<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.480> recipe<00:02:20.810> calls<00:02:21.050> for

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
well let's say the recipe calls for

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.990 
well let's say the recipe calls for
about<00:02:21.410> four<00:02:21.680> hours<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:22.130> brining<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:22.700> stay

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
about four hours of brining so stay

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.530 
about four hours of brining so stay
tuned

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
tuned

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.620 
tuned
okay<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.380> I've<00:02:24.830> brined<00:02:25.700> them<00:02:25.880> for<00:02:26.030> four<00:02:26.240> hours

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
okay so I've brined them for four hours

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:36.040 
okay so I've brined them for four hours

that they're nice and coated okay so for

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.760

the<00:02:40.550> dry<00:02:40.730> rub

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the dry rub

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.290 
the dry rub

make<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> lot<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.780> different<00:02:51.080> flavors<00:02:51.430> all<00:02:52.430> of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
make a lot of different flavors all of

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.610 
make a lot of different flavors all of
them<00:02:52.730> are<00:02:52.820> pretty<00:02:53.000> good<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:54.110> only<00:02:54.290> thing<00:02:54.500> I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
them are pretty good the only thing I

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.960 
them are pretty good the only thing I
would<00:02:54.680> recommend<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:55.310> make<00:02:55.520> sure<00:02:55.550> that<00:02:55.700> all

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
would recommend is make sure that all

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.680 
would recommend is make sure that all
your<00:02:56.000> guests<00:02:56.930> are<00:02:57.920> down<00:02:58.190> with<00:02:58.460> the<00:02:58.690> spiciness

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
your guests are down with the spiciness

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.330 
your guests are down with the spiciness
because<00:03:00.080> some<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.440> gets<00:03:00.740> pretty<00:03:00.950> spicy

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
because some of it gets pretty spicy

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.780 
because some of it gets pretty spicy
this<00:03:01.490> one's<00:03:01.700> pretty<00:03:01.970> mild

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:19.770 

apply<00:03:10.620> literally<00:03:18.330> okay<00:03:19.330> this<00:03:19.540> is<00:03:19.690> the

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
apply literally okay this is the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:38.850 
apply literally okay this is the
barbecue

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.230 

you<00:03:39.860> could<00:03:40.040> do<00:03:40.130> this<00:03:40.310> either<00:03:40.460> way<00:03:40.670> over<00:03:40.910> direct

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
you could do this either way over direct

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.720 
you could do this either way over direct
heater<00:03:41.480> over<00:03:42.050> indirect<00:03:42.500> heat<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.980> have<00:03:43.340> found

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
heater over indirect heat I have found

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.890 
heater over indirect heat I have found
over<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:45.050> years<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:46.180> direct<00:03:47.180> heat<00:03:47.300> can<00:03:47.720> lead

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
over the years that direct heat can lead

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.620 
over the years that direct heat can lead
to<00:03:48.080> burned<00:03:48.350> potato<00:03:49.280> skin<00:03:49.640> so<00:03:49.910> I'll<00:03:50.240> use<00:03:50.480> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
to burned potato skin so I'll use the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:57.160 
to burned potato skin so I'll use the
plates<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:51.080> are<00:03:51.230> here<00:03:55.540> just<00:03:56.540> let<00:03:56.750> this<00:03:56.930> get

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
plates that are here just let this get

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:05.320 
plates that are here just let this get
up<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.440> heat

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.990 

all<00:04:06.330> right<00:04:06.510> at<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.050> 30<00:04:07.500> minute<00:04:07.860> mark<00:04:08.000> it's

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
all right at the 30 minute mark it's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:16.460 
all right at the 30 minute mark it's
time<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.390> turn<00:04:09.600> them<00:04:09.720> over<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:15.260> think<00:04:16.260> it's

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
time to turn them over I think it's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:26.990 
time to turn them over I think it's
about<00:04:16.709> time<00:04:17.010> to<00:04:17.220> take<00:04:17.640> them<00:04:17.850> off

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.480 

so<00:04:27.600> a<00:04:27.630> baked<00:04:27.900> potato<00:04:28.080> is<00:04:28.560> supposedly<00:04:29.190> done

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
so a baked potato is supposedly done

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.280 
so a baked potato is supposedly done
when<00:04:29.700> it<00:04:29.790> has<00:04:29.970> an<00:04:30.150> internal<00:04:30.480> temperature<00:04:31.080> of

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
when it has an internal temperature of

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:43.540 
when it has an internal temperature of
210<00:04:32.130> degrees<00:04:33.090> Fahrenheit<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:38.480> that's<00:04:40.370> 208

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:05:00.280 

that's<00:04:47.090> 206<00:04:50.600> 209<00:04:55.250> 206<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.700> a<00:04:56.880> close<00:04:57.180> enough

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:27.730 

see<00:05:01.290> my<00:05:01.530> white<00:05:01.980> pepper<00:05:05.600> some<00:05:06.600> chives

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.490 

yes<00:05:28.740> that's<00:05:29.249> good
