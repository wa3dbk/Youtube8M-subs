00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
million and I simultaneously had this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.420 
million and I simultaneously had this
desire<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.650> continue<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.860> parent<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.340> that

desire to continue to parent and that

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.929 
desire to continue to parent and that
feeling<00:01:23.909> was<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.630> call<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.700> yayas<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
feeling was that I call it the yayas the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
feeling was that I call it the yayas the
baby<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.259> had<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.860> feeling<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
baby is I really had that feeling the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.100 
baby is I really had that feeling the
same<00:01:29.759> feeling<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.210> did<00:01:30.390> when<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> wanted<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> give

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
same feeling I did when I wanted to give

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.940 
same feeling I did when I wanted to give
birth<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:32.159> have<00:01:32.729> more<00:01:32.939> children<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> that's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
birth to have more children so that's

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.370 
birth to have more children so that's
how<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.130> ended<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.700> deciding<00:01:36.000> how<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.930> adopt

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
how we ended up deciding how to adopt

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.760 
how we ended up deciding how to adopt
and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.049> had<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.350> feeling<00:01:40.619> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and then we still had that feeling that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.050 
and then we still had that feeling that
gut<00:01:41.040> feeling<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.759> think<00:01:42.770> um<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
gut feeling and I think um it was a

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.460 
gut feeling and I think um it was a
passion<00:01:45.600> there<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> something<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
passion there was just something that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.370 
passion there was just something that
sort<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.100> came<00:01:47.549> into<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:47.850> lives<00:01:48.140> which<00:01:49.140> was

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
sort of came into our lives which was

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.370 
sort of came into our lives which was
this<00:01:49.649> love<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.220> passion<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:51.110> orphans<00:01:52.110> for
