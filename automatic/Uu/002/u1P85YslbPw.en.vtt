00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.330 
fog light over here which is simply held
on<00:02:42.160> by<00:02:43.160> one<00:02:43.430> screw<00:02:43.640> here<00:02:44.000> on<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.240> inner<00:02:44.360> edge

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
on by one screw here on the inner edge

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.370 
on by one screw here on the inner edge
just<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.610> ahead<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.940> remove<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:48.260> it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
just go ahead and remove that and it

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.270 
just go ahead and remove that and it
just<00:02:48.560> pulls<00:02:49.520> right<00:02:49.760> out

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.670

the reason you remove that covers to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.970 
the reason you remove that covers to
gain<00:02:58.830> a<00:02:58.860> little<00:02:59.130> bit<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.310> access<00:02:59.960> to

which is we are going to have to drill a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.120 
which is we are going to have to drill a
little<00:03:07.319> hole<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.650> about<00:03:08.220> 5/16<00:03:10.010> it's<00:03:11.010> going

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
little hole here about 5/16 it's going

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.100 
little hole here about 5/16 it's going
to<00:03:11.190> be<00:03:11.280> 5<00:03:11.640> inches<00:03:11.670> in<00:03:12.030> from<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:13.099> lip<00:03:14.099> of<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
to be 5 inches in from the lip of the

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.370 
to be 5 inches in from the lip of the
bumper<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.920> and<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.099> half<00:03:17.130> inches<00:03:17.730> up

bumper here and one and a half inches up

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.600 
bumper here and one and a half inches up
so<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.530> puts<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.830> right<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.430> hole

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
so that puts it right there and the hole

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.440 
so that puts it right there and the hole
is<00:03:20.850> already<00:03:21.120> drilled<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:22.290> your<00:03:22.620> splitter

once you have that placed reach around

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.970 
once you have that placed reach around
to<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.569> backside<00:03:36.170> install<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.470> fender

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
to the backside install the fender

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:54.660 
to the backside install the fender
washer<00:03:39.650> followed<00:03:40.650> by<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.069> 8<00:03:41.790> millimeter<00:03:42.180> nut

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.760 

same<00:03:55.390> thing

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
same thing

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.270 
same thing
with<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.160> bottom<00:03:57.520> here<00:03:58.920> thunder<00:03:59.920> washer

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
with the bottom here thunder washer

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:18.349 
with the bottom here thunder washer
first<00:04:03.420> followed<00:04:04.420> by<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.600> 8<00:04:04.840> millimeter<00:04:05.290> nut

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.339 

okay<00:04:19.079> now<00:04:19.259> these<00:04:19.650> brats<00:04:20.009> um<00:04:20.840> one<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
okay now these brats um one of the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.179 
okay now these brats um one of the
screws<00:04:22.770> is<00:04:23.069> regular<00:04:23.819> rotation<00:04:25.189> spinning

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:26.189 
screws is regular rotation spinning

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.520 
screws is regular rotation spinning
clockwise<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:27.389> opposite<00:04:27.870> side<00:04:28.110> would<00:04:28.379> be

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
clockwise the opposite side would be

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.550 
clockwise the opposite side would be
opposite<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.460> spend<00:04:29.729> in<00:04:29.819> counter<00:04:30.090> clockwise

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
opposite you spend in counter clockwise

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.200 
opposite you spend in counter clockwise
so<00:04:31.560> once<00:04:31.889> you've<00:04:32.009> got<00:04:32.129> that<00:04:32.669> figured<00:04:33.090> out

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
so once you've got that figured out

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.390 
so once you've got that figured out
which<00:04:33.419> one<00:04:33.569> goes<00:04:33.719> up<00:04:33.960> whichever<00:04:34.830> way<00:04:35.039> you<00:04:35.099> spin

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
which one goes up whichever way you spin

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.129 
which one goes up whichever way you spin
it<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:36.120> go<00:04:36.240> ahead<00:04:36.389> and<00:04:36.509> adjust<00:04:36.599> it<00:04:36.960> wherever

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
it just go ahead and adjust it wherever

it's<00:04:46.379> pretty<00:04:46.409> much<00:04:46.650> going<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.860> be<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.069> exact

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
it's pretty much going to be the exact

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.700 
it's pretty much going to be the exact
same<00:04:47.430> thing<00:04:47.669> to<00:04:47.969> take<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.509> your<00:04:48.750> fog<00:04:49.469> light

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
grill all these holes are pretty much

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.709 
grill all these holes are pretty much
punched<00:05:07.529> out<00:05:07.649> unlike<00:05:08.159> this<00:05:08.429> set<00:05:08.669> where<00:05:08.909> the

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
punched out unlike this set where the

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:11.359 
punched out unlike this set where the
inner<00:05:09.899> edge<00:05:10.109> is<00:05:10.319> solid<00:05:10.829> that's<00:05:11.009> why<00:05:11.159> you<00:05:11.249> have

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:11.369 
inner edge is solid that's why you have

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:14.779 
inner edge is solid that's why you have
to<00:05:11.459> drill<00:05:11.609> the<00:05:11.759> hole<00:05:11.969> so<00:05:12.929> on<00:05:13.169> this<00:05:13.349> side<00:05:13.789> you

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
to drill the hole so on this side you

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.189 
to drill the hole so on this side you
will<00:05:14.819> have<00:05:14.969> to<00:05:15.269> use<00:05:15.299> two<00:05:16.019> washers<00:05:17.659> on<00:05:18.659> my<00:05:18.899> chest

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
will have to use two washers on my chest

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:22.969 
will have to use two washers on my chest
and<00:05:19.409> rod<00:05:21.199> this<00:05:22.199> one's<00:05:22.409> going<00:05:22.499> to<00:05:22.559> be<00:05:22.679> the<00:05:22.709> same

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
and rod this one's going to be the same

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:24.649 
and rod this one's going to be the same
thing<00:05:23.249> as<00:05:23.399> the<00:05:23.519> other<00:05:23.549> side<00:05:23.879> five<00:05:24.239> inches<00:05:24.599> in

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
thing as the other side five inches in

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:29.539 
thing as the other side five inches in
one<00:05:25.439> and<00:05:25.589> a<00:05:25.619> half<00:05:25.799> inches<00:05:26.129> up<00:05:27.889> now<00:05:28.889> like<00:05:29.129> I<00:05:29.249> said

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:29.549 
one and a half inches up now like I said

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:30.979 
one and a half inches up now like I said
the<00:05:29.699> only<00:05:29.789> difference<00:05:30.239> is<00:05:30.419> that<00:05:30.449> on<00:05:30.689> this<00:05:30.869> one

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:30.989 
the only difference is that on this one

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:33.999 
the only difference is that on this one
we're<00:05:31.079> going<00:05:31.169> to<00:05:31.229> use<00:05:31.289> two<00:05:31.559> washers<00:05:32.299> one<00:05:33.299> on

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
we're going to use two washers one on

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:41.180 
we're going to use two washers one on
each<00:05:35.009> side<00:05:35.309> of<00:05:35.339> the<00:05:35.429> grill

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190
