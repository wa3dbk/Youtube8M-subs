it's<00:02:47.670> something<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.420> noticed<00:02:49.050> now<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010

it's something that I noticed now on the
other<00:02:50.160> hand<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.700> character<00:02:51.090> dynamics<00:02:51.600> in

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
this episode were in my opinion so far

this episode were in my opinion so far
the<00:02:53.850> best<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.299> the<00:02:54.420> series<00:02:54.630> yang<00:02:55.620> was<00:02:56.100> paired

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the best in the series yang was paired

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220 
the best in the series yang was paired
with<00:02:56.519> Blake<00:02:56.819> not<00:02:57.120> much<00:02:57.299> of<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> surprise<00:02:57.600> there

and in that short time we get to see

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.570 
and in that short time we get to see
that<00:03:01.200> they'll<00:03:01.470> be<00:03:01.530> good<00:03:01.799> partners<00:03:02.069> because

Ruby<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.420> she<00:03:45.600> didn't<00:03:45.840> say<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.109> in<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.350> way<00:03:46.380> that

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
Ruby but she didn't say it in a way that

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.770 
Ruby but she didn't say it in a way that
was<00:03:46.890> like<00:03:47.100> oh<00:03:47.310> man<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.880> messed<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.269> my<00:03:48.420> attack

was like oh man you messed up my attack
which<00:03:49.200> is<00:03:49.380> probably<00:03:49.799> what<00:03:50.130> someone<00:03:50.519> would

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
which is probably what someone would

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.640 
which is probably what someone would
expect<00:03:51.239> from<00:03:51.420> ice<00:03:51.750> at<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.230> point<00:03:52.470> in<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
expect from ice at this point in the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.949 
expect from ice at this point in the
story<00:03:52.709> what<00:03:53.310> she<00:03:53.459> says<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.180> could<00:03:54.870> have

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
story what she says is I could have

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.500 
story what she says is I could have
killed<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.440> which<00:03:56.100> does<00:03:56.549> show<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:56.940> Weiss

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
killed you which does show that Weiss

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.870 
killed you which does show that Weiss
isn't<00:03:58.140> as<00:03:58.290> heartless<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:58.859> these<00:03:59.609> episodes

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880

everyone expected this to be a scene
where<00:04:17.070> Ruby<00:04:17.400> kicks<00:04:17.639> all<00:04:17.820> kinds<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.239> ass<00:04:18.359> and

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
where Ruby kicks all kinds of ass and

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.529 
where Ruby kicks all kinds of ass and
earns<00:04:18.780> Weiss's<00:04:19.260> respect<00:04:19.680> but<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.459> wasn't<00:04:20.940> ruby

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
earns Weiss's respect but it wasn't ruby

was<00:04:21.570> reckless<00:04:22.080> and<00:04:22.200> put<00:04:22.440> herself<00:04:22.620> in<00:04:22.979> weisen

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
was reckless and put herself in weisen

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460 
was reckless and put herself in weisen
danger<00:04:23.789> until<00:04:24.030> Weiss<00:04:24.450> got<00:04:24.690> both<00:04:25.050> of<00:04:25.229> them<00:04:25.320> out

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
danger until Weiss got both of them out

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.930 
danger until Weiss got both of them out
of<00:04:25.500> there<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:25.890> personally<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.340> think<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.760> was

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
of there and personally I think that was

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.520 
of there and personally I think that was
great<00:04:27.330> way<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.540> see<00:04:27.750> character<00:04:28.170> development

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
great way to see character development

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.230 
great way to see character development
from<00:04:28.830> both<00:04:29.100> of<00:04:29.130> them<00:04:29.370> they<00:04:29.910> could<00:04:30.060> have<00:04:30.090> gone

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
from both of them they could have gone

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.790 
from both of them they could have gone
with<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.420> predictable<00:04:30.900> route<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.350> have<00:04:31.590> this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
with a predictable route and have this

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.830 
with a predictable route and have this
be<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.130> scene<00:04:32.310> where<00:04:32.580> Weiss<00:04:33.030> sees<00:04:33.540> what

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
be the scene where Weiss sees what

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.770 
be the scene where Weiss sees what
Ruby's<00:04:34.260> capable<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.890> but<00:04:35.340> instead<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.540> is

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
Ruby's capable of but instead this is

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.110 
Ruby's capable of but instead this is
scene<00:04:36.960> where<00:04:37.200> we<00:04:37.320> see<00:04:37.590> why<00:04:37.980> these<00:04:38.040> two<00:04:38.760> will

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
scene where we see why these two will

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.000 
scene where we see why these two will
make<00:04:39.390> a<00:04:39.420> good<00:04:39.690> team<00:04:39.930> in<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.200> future<00:04:40.560> because

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
make a good team in the future because

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.650 
make a good team in the future because
they<00:04:41.400> both<00:04:41.730> have<00:04:42.000> something<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.480> learn<00:04:42.600> from

did<00:05:39.270> feel<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.510> little<00:05:39.750> bit<00:05:39.900> padded<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:40.470> my

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
did feel a little bit padded in my

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.190 
did feel a little bit padded in my
opinion<00:05:40.860> but<00:05:41.070> that's<00:05:41.310> a<00:05:41.490> pretty<00:05:42.210> minor<00:05:42.780> flaw

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
opinion but that's a pretty minor flaw

in<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.770> grand<00:05:43.980> scope<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.340> things<00:05:44.460> definitely

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
in the grand scope of things definitely

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.690 
in the grand scope of things definitely
