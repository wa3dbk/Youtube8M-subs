00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 be all friends welcome to this 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.629
 special chapter of tutorials where 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 We will explain accurately how 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.780
 fuck to make the 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 supercampeones or what their tricks say 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.790
 through the playstation 2 emulator 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 in the pc obviously many have 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.940
 wondered the same thing through facebook 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 through youtube in the 3 videos that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.630
 I have available on the channel so 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.200
 let's do it immediately 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 answer all your doubts let's 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.630
 to the browser and here we can find a 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.010
 through this video that I went up was the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.079
 first video in fact that about the channel 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.470
 where I left 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.880
 YouTube career 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 the captain tsubasa in the supercampeones 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.310
 playstation2 random gameplay 1 for word 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.380
 here in the description in detail I left 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.070
 a link and it's the game Captain Tsubasa 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.820
 more emulator 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 what is a mediafire link in which 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 we explain we will leave this 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.050
 this virtual folder was not internet 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.400
 with all the necessary files for 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.250
 to be able to walk our order 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.619
 well here we have the emulator which is the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.509
 captain surface emulator dot rack and the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.420
 game is divided into four parts point 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.680
 raid also that is an iso of 1.2 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.530
 it came and more or less 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.530
 so let's download the emulate 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.000
 download and download the moral here 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 but I already have all the files 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.430
 available I know that it is not necessary 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.010
 do this at this time and you what 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.230
 they have to download 11 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.880
 depending on your internet connection they are going to 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.530
 see how long it takes to download but 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.930
 it should not be so much that file weighs 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 100 mega around heavy mode 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.190
 thirty six megabytes and the last file 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.490
 when I wait, I think those 170 mega 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.300
 the door also approximately so 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.650
 we go to the folder where we have the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.060
 records 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.150
 Well here I will show you that they are the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.280
 same that bryant knew simulated with the 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.890
 four parts so we're going to 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.750
 unzip this 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.560
 and we reflect right click extract 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.660
 there they wanted the event range and the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.760
 foundation of the right to bring someone 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.630
 then it takes a little longer 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.500
 because it weighs a few points and you go 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.890
 Once I know 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.960
 it compresses the fire 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 we erase this thing that they already serve us 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.470
 view and we're going to 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:38.370
 times x2 and we open this executable that 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.370
 is the psc x2 script r 446 00 points 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 and this is executed we will minimize it and 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.930
 this also obviously the link of the 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.300
 the files will also leave 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.160
 this in the description description of 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.020
 this video we go to cd dvd 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.290
 we select the iso and we are looking for 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:01.420
 and in looking we are going to choose the captain 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.459
 tsubasa together iso 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.690
 here we will see that it is selected and 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.840
 is Captain Tsubasa 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.540
 and the other is necessary is to verify the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.680
 plugin selector and god that by 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.989
 example the one that I know is the video 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.640
 configured in this way so if 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.439
 they want what they can change can choose 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.439
 other options actually have direct 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:25.330
 but it does not work well enough for me 

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:27.130
 the games 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.860
 especially those who ask for their step that is 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.540
 the one that was showing at this moment 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.190
 so we're not going to do anything here here 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.500
 they can pass the video to review well 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.880
 the configuration and the path too 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.430
 obviously you have to configure the 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.580
 keys we go to pack 1 and here 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.850
 we have to go to mind I have the 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.970
 control of these 360 ​​configured my pc 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:54.960
 so you have to configure the keys 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:01.530
 top left right down l1 l2 l3 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.530
 but also the e3 r1 r2 r3 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.989
 top left right down 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.470
 up forgiveness top left right 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:18.989
 down 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.989
 square triangles x circle 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:27.320
 select this and when we configure everything 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.320
 we give you to accept 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.650
 well obviously here they have to 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.240
 verify good if you do not have to see 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.400
 make the configuration with key 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.020
 obviously I have the pad so 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.560
 we are all 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.650
 and we are going to start them 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.770
 complete and start loading as if 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.870
 out a domestic playstation 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.729
 physically on your desk at your desk 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.729
 and playstation 2 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.500
 and move everything that is doing it 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.449
 what's loading is cool 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.809
 in real time 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:07.590
 and we go quickly and here are the 

00:05:03.809 --> 00:05:10.050
 super mushrooms or better said captain 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.150
 tsubasa in japanese so boys 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.159
 this has been the tutorial I hope that you 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.610
 has become clearer how they have to 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:16.610
 do what 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.520
 I hope that game is to your liking to me 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.710
 I really like the game in fact 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.389
 I played three times it was never again 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.389
 I hope to do it in a more time but 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.010
 I want to continue with the games that we are 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.530
 in these moments either playstation 4 and 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.419
 all those things so it's not all right 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.190
 in a next video I do not know when we will go 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.820
 the other tutorial so we're not 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.820
 watching yourself take care
