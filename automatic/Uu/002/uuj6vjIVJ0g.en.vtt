why shouldn't gaming be part of it and
this<00:05:37.699> is<00:05:37.819> our<00:05:37.940> way<00:05:38.120> of<00:05:38.800> molding<00:05:39.800> it<00:05:39.889> all

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
this is our way of molding it all

together<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.910> games<00:05:41.150> were<00:05:41.330> developing<00:05:41.780> now

together the games were developing now
we're<00:05:42.199> sort<00:05:42.410> of<00:05:42.470> really<00:05:42.949> just<00:05:42.979> touching<00:05:43.580> the

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
we're sort of really just touching the
