00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
or maybe it was the second episode I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.190

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
it was a very powerful character not

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.240 
it was a very powerful character not
only<00:05:10.220> in<00:05:10.880> his<00:05:11.240> actual<00:05:11.630> physical<00:05:12.410> strength<00:05:13.010> but

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
only in his actual physical strength but

also<00:05:13.750> emotionally<00:05:14.750> as<00:05:14.900> well<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.620> now<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:15.890> bet

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
also emotionally as well so now I bet
