this is the inside kind of paper and the
silica<00:01:21.039> pack<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.689> that's<00:01:23.020> pretty<00:01:23.469> much

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:24.209 
silica pack but that's pretty much

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:26.550

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
minimal flex in this section and they

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.169 
minimal flex in this section and they
have<00:02:07.749> it<00:02:07.869> look<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.050> carbon<00:02:08.530> fiber<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.099> I

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
have it look like carbon fiber but I

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.670 
have it look like carbon fiber but I
pretty<00:02:10.390> sure<00:02:10.569> that's<00:02:10.719> not<00:02:10.869> carbon-fiber<00:02:11.469> it

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
pretty sure that's not carbon-fiber it

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.030 
pretty sure that's not carbon-fiber it
looks<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.219> it's<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:13.079> like<00:02:14.079> a<00:02:14.109> print<00:02:14.469> and<00:02:14.799> then

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
looks like it's a like a print and then

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.599 
looks like it's a like a print and then
they<00:02:15.219> put<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:15.579> on<00:02:15.760> top<00:02:15.969> of<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.299> TPU<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
they put it on top of the TPU so I

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.039 
they put it on top of the TPU so I
believe<00:02:21.609> this<00:02:21.730> is<00:02:21.790> 3m<00:02:22.269> right<00:02:22.480> here<00:02:22.689> as<00:02:22.810> well

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
believe this is 3m right here as well

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.319 
believe this is 3m right here as well
basically<00:02:23.859> they<00:02:24.280> fit<00:02:24.489> true<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.700> size<00:02:24.790> they

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
basically they fit true to size they

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.629 
basically they fit true to size they
actually<00:02:25.900> feel<00:02:26.170> very<00:02:26.560> nice<00:02:26.799> on<00:02:27.010> feet<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:29.639> this

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:30.639 
actually feel very nice on feet and this

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:33.360 
actually feel very nice on feet and this
one<00:02:30.819> has<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.409> liner<00:02:32.409> inside<00:02:32.859> like<00:02:33.129> an<00:02:33.250> inner

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
one has a liner inside like an inner

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.360 
one has a liner inside like an inner
boot<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.150> then<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.260> midsole<00:02:35.680> a<00:02:35.950> nothing

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
boot and then the midsole a nothing

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.330 
boot and then the midsole a nothing
midsole<00:02:36.639> but<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.879> insole<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.680> insole<00:02:39.069> on<00:02:39.219> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
midsole but the insole the insole on the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.000 
midsole but the insole the insole on the
villain<00:02:39.670> looks<00:02:39.879> like<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.920> it's<00:02:41.920> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
villain looks like this it's a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.509 
villain looks like this it's a
perforated<00:02:42.639> polyurethane<00:02:43.919> sock<00:02:44.919> liner<00:02:45.220> and

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
perforated polyurethane sock liner and

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:47.190 
perforated polyurethane sock liner and
then<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.000> has<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:46.810> bit<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.019> extra

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
then it has a little bit of extra

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.750 
then it has a little bit of extra
cushion<00:02:47.650> right<00:02:47.799> here<00:02:48.099> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.790> heel<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:51.099> both

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
cushion right here in the heel and both

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.640 
cushion right here in the heel and both
of<00:02:51.790> these<00:02:52.030> came<00:02:52.389> with<00:02:52.720> these<00:02:53.709> cards

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
of these came with these cards

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.280 
of these came with these cards
and<00:02:56.650> these<00:02:57.430> basically<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:58.359> describe<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
and these basically just describe the

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.220 
and these basically just describe the
bounce<00:02:59.919> and<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.669> cushion<00:03:01.150> technology<00:03:01.989> that

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
bounce and the cushion technology that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.339 
bounce and the cushion technology that
they<00:03:02.379> use<00:03:02.579> within<00:03:03.579> their<00:03:04.209> products<00:03:04.810> missiles

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
they use within their products missiles

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.409 
they use within their products missiles
so<00:03:05.980> right<00:03:06.219> here<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.459> can<00:03:06.519> see<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.000> cushion

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
so right here you can see the cushion

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.780 
so right here you can see the cushion
that<00:03:07.569> is<00:03:08.500> an<00:03:08.620> injected<00:03:09.099> foam<00:03:09.310> that's<00:03:09.609> in

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
that is an injected foam that's in

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.940 
that is an injected foam that's in
strategically<00:03:10.450> placed<00:03:10.719> areas<00:03:11.139> for<00:03:11.500> impact

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
strategically placed areas for impact

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.979 
strategically placed areas for impact
absorption<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.760> then<00:03:13.209> they<00:03:13.359> have<00:03:13.569> what's

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
absorption and then they have what's

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.890 
absorption and then they have what's
called<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.379> bounce<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:15.159> that<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.359> the<00:03:16.629> entire

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
called the bounce and that is the entire

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.530 
called the bounce and that is the entire
midsole<00:03:17.400> structure<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.729> it's<00:03:18.909> a<00:03:19.060> specific

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
midsole structure so it's a specific

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.990 
midsole structure so it's a specific
type<00:03:19.690> of<00:03:19.840> foam<00:03:20.019> that<00:03:20.049> they<00:03:20.260> use<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.760> supposed

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
type of foam that they use it's supposed

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.960 
type of foam that they use it's supposed
to<00:03:22.090> bounce<00:03:22.239> back<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:23.400> this<00:03:24.400> is<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.699> traction

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
to bounce back and this is the traction

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.629 
to bounce back and this is the traction
here<00:03:25.269> the<00:03:25.479> rubber<00:03:25.810> by<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.349> way<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.769> super

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
here the rubber by the way is super

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.679 
here the rubber by the way is super
super<00:03:28.540> grippy<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.849> stuff<00:03:31.090> is<00:03:31.209> very<00:03:31.359> soft

00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:31.689 
super grippy this stuff is very soft

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:34.020 
super grippy this stuff is very soft
this<00:03:31.900> particular<00:03:32.439> model<00:03:32.620> here<00:03:32.949> this<00:03:33.790> one's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
this particular model here this one's

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.110 
this particular model here this one's
nice<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.449> flexible<00:03:35.669> with<00:03:36.669> all<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.849> flex

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
nice and flexible with all the flex

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.569 
nice and flexible with all the flex
grooves<00:03:37.299> there<00:03:37.599> this<00:03:37.780> is<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:37.989> foam<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.310> that's

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
grooves there this is the foam so that's

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.179 
grooves there this is the foam so that's
something<00:03:40.389> that<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.659> actually<00:03:41.079> do<00:03:41.500> like<00:03:41.769> in<00:03:42.069> a

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
something that I actually do like in a

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.710 
something that I actually do like in a
performance<00:03:42.459> shoe<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.819> like<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.120> lot<00:03:43.329> of<00:03:43.419> flex

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
performance shoe I like a lot of flex

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.990 
performance shoe I like a lot of flex
and<00:03:43.959> forefoot<00:03:44.530> don't<00:03:45.159> like<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.430> angst<00:03:45.669> me<00:03:45.790> too

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
and forefoot don't like it angst me too

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.969 
and forefoot don't like it angst me too
stiff<00:03:46.299> this<00:03:47.079> one's<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.349> little<00:03:47.470> more<00:03:47.590> stiff

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
stiff this one's a little more stiff

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:50.879 
stiff this one's a little more stiff
because<00:03:48.129> it's<00:03:48.400> a<00:03:48.489> solid<00:03:48.849> rubber<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:50.500> flex

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
because it's a solid rubber the flex

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.330 
because it's a solid rubber the flex
grooves<00:03:51.069> are<00:03:51.340> basically<00:03:51.759> you<00:03:52.449> know<00:03:52.569> the

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
grooves are basically you know the

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.569 
grooves are basically you know the
missing<00:03:54.340> rubber<00:03:54.819> pieces<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.889> is<00:03:57.189> the

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
missing rubber pieces but this is the

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.460 
missing rubber pieces but this is the
turning<00:03:58.090> point<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.509> believe<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.930> is<00:03:58.989> one<00:03:59.290> by

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
turning point I believe this is one by

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.569 
turning point I believe this is one by
Evan<00:03:59.829> Turner<00:04:00.659> that's<00:04:01.659> this<00:04:01.810> number<00:04:02.109> here<00:04:02.579> and

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
Evan Turner that's this number here and

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.300 
Evan Turner that's this number here and
then<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.479> logo<00:04:04.840> is<00:04:05.049> also<00:04:05.349> says<00:04:05.560> turning<00:04:06.040> point

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
then the logo is also says turning point

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.330 
then the logo is also says turning point
on<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.639> tongue<00:04:06.819> and<00:04:07.709> this<00:04:08.709> is<00:04:08.859> more<00:04:09.069> of<00:04:09.159> like<00:04:09.310> a

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
on the tongue and this is more of like a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.399 
on the tongue and this is more of like a
Haraki<00:04:09.909> looking<00:04:10.540> shoe<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.709> there<00:04:11.859> is<00:04:12.009> no
