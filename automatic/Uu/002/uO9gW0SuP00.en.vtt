00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello everyone in this new video I'm going 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.010
 to teach these types of lenses to 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.630
 smartphones that seem more 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.450
 universal of what they say they are 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.360
 because in many places they sell it as 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.190
 that are only for iphone but in 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.490
 actually serve for many others 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:26.590
 smartphones and can even serve to 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.439
 an ipod or the one with the galaxy not that I have 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:34.780
 it also serves and well now 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.859
 I'm going to show you how to put it in the ipod and 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.870
 good that you also know that you can 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.539
 put for example if you have a computer 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.280
 in the popkomm you can also put 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.899
 although I do not give much use 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.030
 good the way they are put is with 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 these rings 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.980
 but is that if you focus the camera 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.750
 these rings like this are removed 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:00.580
 white paper and you can 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.250
 paste easily and then how are they 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.740
 magnetic 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.860
 this would stay like this 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.100
 and it would look as fisheye this 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.549
 is the fish eye and this is the white 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 angle 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.360
 but that also has macro silo 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.360
 unscrew moss 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.530
 this is the part that makes the white and 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.920
 go this is the macro that is much more 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.920
 small 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.110
 and that you do not see 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.500
 well then for example 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.380
 we have this this here that is already a 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.380
 little unhooked 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.040
 we just removed this white paper 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.780
 here we have the ring is 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.069
 we take the iPad and if you look at the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.450
 crystal is a little curved and also 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:19.099
 we have the ipod microphone then 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.690
 you have to be careful in iphones and 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.700
 on the other smartphones it does not matter 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.340
 because the microphone will never be there 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.690
 but set yourself just in case and also with 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:32.870
 the flash and do not interrupt 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.870
 then we paste it as much 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.860
 stable that we can 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880
 for example 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:48.730
 although it seems that it is deviated in 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.730
 that's how it is much more 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.470
 it's much more horizontal let's say 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.320
 and then when it is put on the lens 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.680
 it's not on one side and you see a lot 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.680
 best 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.159
 He tells fisheye 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.890
 and the same with the macro and the white and 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:29.220
 go but not if you have an iphone or a 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.980
 galaxy not two a galaxy s3 or any 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.459
 smartphone so what do you what 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.840
 would take advantage and put it in that and then 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.709
 we can also remove this blue paper 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:44.690
 good a paper or plastic but if not no 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.690
 It also matters 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.050
 and now I will show you the teenager and 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.849
 another thing else I bought this from 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.150
 here and the white angle that is placed 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.030
 right now on ebay but I recommend 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.970
 that you buy it in the end even if 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.290
 separately because maybe if you 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.569
 you look good we can get more 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.730
 economic and although it takes longer to come 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:15.900
 we make sure you come because on ebay 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.769
 well we have to trust but good 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.199
 you can go through everything 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.340
 and I'll put the link in the description 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:27.300
 of the video for 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.460
 and the extreme so you can buy it 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.590
 now without connection signal 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.860
 right now if you notice we are seeing 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.210
 this laptop keyboard from the s 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.960
 until the j then now we will put the y 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.960
 the physio 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.990
 if it is well centered because we can see 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.259
 all the keyboard and even a little more 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:57.440
 around here and a little more around here though 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:01.590
 this is not as reality as 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.810
 we can see these are these keys 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.689
 good for you to see everything that expands 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.760
 that is pretty good 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:11.620
 now 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.620
 with the white tiger 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:26.689
 we see that from that the j now we spend 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.899
 from the main bloc to the l more or 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:33.879
 less so to take pictures with the 

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:33.879
 same quality pretty good 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.439
 with the macro position as you can see everything 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.809
 very blurry and instead of with the keys 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.929
 which is also appreciated let's do it 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:47.990
 with the lens that yes I think that it 

00:05:44.929 --> 00:05:50.949
 will appreciate better as you see as you 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.949
 we are moving closer or further away 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.320
 there we can find the point where 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.260
 see better 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.460
 and we can see 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.460
 how good it looks 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.550
 close up 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.800
 and for example 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.759
 one byte year 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.180
 and good 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:29.060
 this has been all here 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:31.700
 I have taught you the three types of 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.020
 of graduation in the broken ones that can be 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:38.030
 do with these three lenses and that 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.680
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.680
 in the next video bye bye
