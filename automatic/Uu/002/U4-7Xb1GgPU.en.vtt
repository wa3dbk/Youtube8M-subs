 anime 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.950

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.350
 we usually used to see in some 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.080
 tin cans i found it a merchant 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.950
 shopping center you can say so 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 chain store hippo there it is sold in 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.470
 open sale I read on the forum that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.880
 since April fifth, I do not know in ordinary 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.159
 stores could not find 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.369
 because how would it be produced only 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.189
 in two factories one plant is the United States and the other 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.270
 plant in Europe is the second plant it 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 Coca-Cola plant and now in 2013 in 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.770
 Russia this drink began to appear a 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.500
 here in Belarus did not find it and here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.170
 finally finally i will try it but 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.079
 Dr. Peper most who drank but it would 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.000
 cool you or whatever his name was 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.040
 drank especially by the way here look 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.140
 look at Godâ€™s little notebook 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.810
 a little bit a little gate 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.689
 steiner god's notepad when i was looking 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.820
 where does this doctor pepper used in 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.740
 the end of the opening she is there such a drain 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.360
 let it so pitifully so 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.950

 crazy well I will go on to go yet 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.520
 forty minutes and still go to the stop here 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.740
 so here we are at the stop of the Comintern 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.510
 if for example someone goes from the station 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.850
 the best option is to go here before 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.550
 at least you can get there by 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.820
 get on the seventeenth bus he himself 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:38.489

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.320
 same month okay so 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.080
