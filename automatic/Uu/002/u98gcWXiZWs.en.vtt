00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 take when I go back to bed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.480

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.230

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.480

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.699
 so to football directly through to is much 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.720
 festival but it and I am me 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
 card is raining and that will remain one 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.510
 day rain so that is really a no go 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 I have already given away my tickets to 2 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.590
 And if they are friends they always do anyway 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.120
 no tickets yet that saves again 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 but so what for today my schedule 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.550
 now is that i am on my blog today 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.140
 go to work 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.680
 I still answer my emails campaign 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.450
 write write articles and then have 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.800
 I also have some time left for myself 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 but it will be no busy Sunday 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.610
 I think I find quite nice today 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 to do in most work today or too 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.160
 so I went to the week too 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.039
 press events can go or to other 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.750
 appointments that I say but not in it 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.370
 weekend can do 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 so that is kind of the meaning for that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 today i'm going now first and take a shower 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
 was because it is only yesterday 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.019
 it is then my own curl 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.479
 what's in it kind of 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.909
 slammed and collapsed 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.110
 so I'm going to do that first and then me 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 can I click my team works the way I do 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 just said 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.560
 for the people who made my previous video 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.759

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 updates and I tell about my 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.000
 new website name and my new name 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 from youtube 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.590
 because there is beauty so it will be mine 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 brand brushes and there I tell about my 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.560
 new upload time so if you have that video 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.150
 have not seen yet you have to take a look 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.860
 because if you really can not 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.290
 why not watch my videos online later 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.420
 and what will happen to him completely 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 so check it out 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.540
 so it's my last video from 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.430
 last Friday 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 I have just prepared some moss with 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.560
 the star back and we are here also watch 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.640
 profane neil your yogurt is this before 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.700
 cottage cheese and yogurt 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.229
 and I'm just gonna eat that now 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.560
 I think because I am a villain 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 to work so I think that is possible 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.409
 I just got out of the shower and I 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.030
 have got 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.549
 its washed and it a little bit 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.840
 happens it is now very fluffy and 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.670
 a little cruiser 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.799
 curled stroke what we have bit vague 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.259
 but I have to be able to go further than that 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.549
 the couple put it through and then me 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.890
 finish him or I already have one 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:15.560
 foundation on mascara and eyebrow 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.299
 done and it's sitting and you still need a bus 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.650
 is the so I thought I am going to product first 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.180
 take pictures of that blush before me 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.590
 start using it at all 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.599
 and then the color is not immediately evening 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.410
 you can also immediately see how it stands in 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.170
 the video 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.459
 and then I can also take pictures of my 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.769
 face is what it looks like on my 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.110
 face in so it goes home on this one 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.370
 blouses for equality smart because I know 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.470
 not whether the river is already online as 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.870
 you see this video 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.650
 it's about the fries pussy fever thing 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.430
 blush and this is in the color 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.900
 watch kimmie ken 030 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.269

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.670
 cute that awarded you is in it 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.280
 in the blues itself, so let's go 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.420
 now photograph and then apply on 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.099
 my face and then see how this me 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.989
 my state look like the fire looks out the 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.510
 an arm i just made him swatch photos 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.889
 and so so that I can soon on 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.690
 My blog posts go 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.090
 but how wide is this it is a bit 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.160
 a pink color with a very cool one 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.660
 undertones and with yes when it tends to be one 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.579
 bit to plan but on the camera or you 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.079
 really to more pink 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.510
 but this is really a very beautiful color and 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.400
 the pigmentation is really super so me 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.870
 again you have with my new extinguishing i have 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.819
 the bus immediately applied to my cheeks 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.310
 and this is what it looks like in the package 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.680
 so a little red flower like color 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.329
 and how long have you been sitting out so long i have one 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.620
 very subtle but I think 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:32.780
 the effect is very nice for one 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.359
 everyday makeup look and I love myself 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.190
 really like those cool blouses that are warm 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.919
 I never existed so maybe during 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.690
 the way I am, but now I say 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.919
 but when I turn a little paler I think 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 it will look very nice if i have one 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.400
 kind of yes picking or pinkish 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.260
 applying blush 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.209

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.410

 the can also be nicely combined with one 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.750
 high-waisted jeans for example and then 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.210

 product photo finally what they look like 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.090
 I have a bit with the exposure 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.650
 played and so contrast and brightness 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:08.180
 because it was quite dark 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.000
 finally in the bedroom outside 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.200
 I mean raining in my office room 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.200

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.090
 how it is editing and if so ingredient 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.960

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.280
 I am very pleased with Morocco 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.419
 real so if you don't know that yet 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.099
 you definitely give it a try because it 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.090
 it all smells so good it makes me 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.430
 its really very soft 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.380
 so eh yes this is probably one of them 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.240
 the reasons why people shine and shine 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.789
 your question will speed it up 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:42.800
 between this is my secret it is already again
