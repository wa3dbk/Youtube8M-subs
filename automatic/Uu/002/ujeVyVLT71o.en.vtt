hey Internet I'm John and today I wanted
to<00:00:02.399> share<00:00:02.550> with<00:00:02.639> you<00:00:02.879> an<00:00:03.149> idea<00:00:03.510> that<00:00:03.720> I<00:00:03.750> had<00:00:03.840> for

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
to share with you an idea that I had for

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.889 
to share with you an idea that I had for
the<00:00:04.259> next<00:00:04.500> extinction<00:00:05.220> map<00:00:05.460> so<00:00:05.910> extinction

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
the next extinction map so extinction

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
the next extinction map so extinction
has<00:00:06.930> piqued<00:00:07.259> my<00:00:07.350> interest<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.040> lately<00:00:08.250> and

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
has piqued my interest as of lately and

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790 
has piqued my interest as of lately and
I<00:00:08.940> feel<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.420> game-mode<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:09.929> has<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:10.410> great

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
I feel this game-mode it has some great

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.330 
I feel this game-mode it has some great
potential<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.719> got<00:00:12.960> me<00:00:13.139> thinking<00:00:13.340> what

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
potential and this got me thinking what

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.919 
potential and this got me thinking what
if<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.610> next<00:00:14.790> map<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.389> play<00:00:15.630> in

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
if the next map that we play in

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.250 
if the next map that we play in
extinction<00:00:16.350> takes<00:00:17.100> place<00:00:17.400> in<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.730> submarine

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
extinction takes place in a submarine

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.590 
extinction takes place in a submarine
underwater<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.910> imagine<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
underwater so imagine this the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.029 
underwater so imagine this the
transplants<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.320> were<00:00:22.470> performed<00:00:22.949> on

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
transplants that were performed on

transplants that were performed on
Samantha<00:00:23.460> cross<00:00:23.699> went<00:00:24.060> horribly<00:00:24.720> wrong<00:00:24.840> she

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
Samantha cross went horribly wrong she

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980 
Samantha cross went horribly wrong she
is<00:00:25.769> now<00:00:25.949> half<00:00:26.220> cryptic<00:00:26.670> half<00:00:27.240> human<00:00:27.630> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
cryptic side of her was much stronger

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.910 
cryptic side of her was much stronger
than<00:00:30.390> expected<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.199> she<00:00:31.410> was<00:00:31.529> able<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.769> break

you<00:01:07.110> may<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.590> need<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.920> spray<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.430> pray<00:01:08.490> if

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
you may just need to spray and pray if

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the submarine you're going to start to

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
the submarine you're going to start to
see<00:01:13.200> aquatic<00:01:14.040> seekers<00:01:14.520> crawling<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
so as you fight these seekers you're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.200 
so as you fight these seekers you're
going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.710> need<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.009> open<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.580> hatch<00:01:23.880> to

get you inside the submarine out to open
this<00:01:26.100> hatch<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.759> you're<00:01:26.850> gonna<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.210> do

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

this hatch but you're gonna have to do
is<00:01:27.570> lay<00:01:27.840> down<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.350> explosive<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
is lay down this explosive but the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.590 
is lay down this explosive but the
explosive<00:01:29.729> takes<00:01:29.939> time<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> wait

how the drill would work on previous
extinction<00:01:38.250> maps<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:38.759> once<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.659> make<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
extinction maps now once you make it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.210 
extinction maps now once you make it
through<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> sub<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.860> start<00:01:41.130> to

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
through the sub you're gonna start to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
through the sub you're gonna start to
see<00:01:41.369> regular<00:01:41.850> aliens<00:01:42.390> except<00:01:42.810> these<00:01:43.290> aliens

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
see regular aliens except these aliens

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.340 
see regular aliens except these aliens
can<00:01:44.100> regenerate<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.909> smaller<00:01:45.390> aliens<00:01:46.079> once

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
can regenerate into smaller aliens once

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.609 
can regenerate into smaller aliens once
you<00:01:46.530> kill<00:01:46.770> them<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.399> may<00:01:47.970> kill<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.479> hunter<00:01:48.990> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
you kill them so I may kill a hunter but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
you kill them so I may kill a hunter but
then<00:01:49.920> once<00:01:50.220> he's<00:01:50.430> dead<00:01:50.759> what<00:01:51.240> you're<00:01:51.360> gonna

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
then once he's dead what you're gonna

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.870 
then once he's dead what you're gonna
see<00:01:51.780> our<00:01:52.049> smaller<00:01:52.470> hunters<00:01:52.950> crawl<00:01:53.369> out<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.729> his

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
see our smaller hunters crawl out of his

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.179 
see our smaller hunters crawl out of his
body<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.360> once<00:01:54.720> they're<00:01:55.020> dead<00:01:55.200> even<00:01:55.799> smaller

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
body and once they're dead even smaller

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
body and once they're dead even smaller
hunters<00:01:57.000> are<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> crawl<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.689> their

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
hunters are going to crawl out of their

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.899 
hunters are going to crawl out of their
body<00:01:58.170> now<00:01:58.439> eventually<00:01:59.340> there<00:01:59.490> will<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.700> no

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
body now eventually there will be no

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.030 
body now eventually there will be no
more<00:02:00.119> hunters<00:02:00.689> but<00:02:01.350> that's<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.799> basic

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
more hunters but that's the basic

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.100 
more hunters but that's the basic
premise<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.820> Halley's<00:02:03.390> aliens<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:03.930> going<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
premise for Halley's aliens are going to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.990 
premise for Halley's aliens are going to
work<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> almost<00:02:04.500> every<00:02:04.950> alien<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.549> this<00:02:05.790> map

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
work in almost every alien on this map

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.910 
work in almost every alien on this map
will<00:02:06.149> work<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.689> keep<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> mind<00:02:07.560> there

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
will work like this keep in mind there

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.260 
will work like this keep in mind there
won't<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.369> any<00:02:08.640> giant<00:02:09.149> aliens<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:10.110> say<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.770> run

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
won't be any giant aliens like say a run

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.670 
won't be any giant aliens like say a run
because<00:02:11.600> i<00:02:11.690> feel<00:02:11.870> as<00:02:11.990> though<00:02:12.020> in<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.320> submarine

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
because i feel as though in a submarine

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.070 
because i feel as though in a submarine
they're<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.160> too<00:02:13.430> big<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> way<00:02:14.900> this

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
they're a little too big so the way this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.360 
they're a little too big so the way this
game<00:02:15.320> mode<00:02:15.500> will<00:02:15.680> work<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.040> you're<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.310> to

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
game mode will work is you're going to

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.520 
game mode will work is you're going to
travel<00:02:16.790> from<00:02:17.000> room<00:02:17.360> to<00:02:17.570> room<00:02:17.600> till<00:02:18.170> you<00:02:18.320> reach

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
travel from room to room till you reach

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.160 
travel from room to room till you reach
the<00:02:18.800> surgery<00:02:19.340> room<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.000> thing<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.270> each<00:02:20.660> room

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
the surgery room the thing is each room

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.560 
the surgery room the thing is each room
has<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.710> door<00:02:21.740> that<00:02:22.250> you<00:02:22.310> must<00:02:22.550> bust<00:02:22.880> open<00:02:23.150> in

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
has a door that you must bust open in

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.240 
has a door that you must bust open in
order<00:02:23.930> to<00:02:24.080> get<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.440> necks<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.100> these

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
order to get to the necks and these

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:26.980 
order to get to the necks and these
doors<00:02:25.550> will<00:02:25.730> get<00:02:25.880> progressively<00:02:26.390> longer<00:02:26.660> to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
doors will get progressively longer to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.570 
doors will get progressively longer to
open<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.770> way<00:02:27.890> you<00:02:27.950> would<00:02:28.130> open<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.430> door

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
open the way you would open the door

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.070 
open the way you would open the door
similar<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.180> open<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.600> hatch<00:02:29.810> you're

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
similar to how you open a hatch you're

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.810 
similar to how you open a hatch you're
basically<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:30.560> gonna<00:02:30.980> put<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.430> detonator

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
basically just gonna put the detonator

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.090 
basically just gonna put the detonator
on<00:02:32.060> it<00:02:32.240> wait<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.990> to<00:02:33.050> charge<00:02:33.320> up<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.770> then

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
on it wait for it to charge up and then

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.650 
on it wait for it to charge up and then
detonate<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.910> then<00:02:35.120> from<00:02:35.300> there<00:02:35.360> you<00:02:35.510> can

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
detonate and then from there you can

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.540 
detonate and then from there you can
move<00:02:35.930> room<00:02:36.290> to<00:02:36.500> room<00:02:36.650> that<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:36.980> a<00:02:37.010> few<00:02:37.250> thing<00:02:37.400> to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
move room to room that is a few thing to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.340 
move room to room that is a few thing to
note<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:37.850> these<00:02:38.180> rooms<00:02:38.450> there's<00:02:39.050> going<00:02:39.230> to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
note about these rooms there's going to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.860 
note about these rooms there's going to
be<00:02:39.380> pipes<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.790> gonna<00:02:40.910> be<00:02:40.970> very<00:02:41.300> tight<00:02:41.660> so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
be pipes and it's gonna be very tight so

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
be pipes and it's gonna be very tight so
sometimes<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.440> may<00:02:42.560> need<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.830> duck<00:02:43.040> under

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
sometimes you may need to duck under

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.950 
sometimes you may need to duck under
something<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.910> may<00:02:44.030> need<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.300> jump<00:02:44.630> over

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
something you may need to jump over

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.350 
something you may need to jump over
something<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.620> there's<00:02:46.550> also<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:47.180> to<00:02:47.240> be<00:02:47.300> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
something and there's also going to be a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.060 
something and there's also going to be a
lot<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.570> close<00:02:47.780> quarter<00:02:48.050> combat<00:02:48.140> which<00:02:48.800> may

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
lot of close quarter combat which may

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.650 
lot of close quarter combat which may
get<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:49.490> tricky<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.030> once<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.390> start

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
get a little tricky you once you start

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.540 
get a little tricky you once you start
dealing<00:02:50.810> with<00:02:51.020> those<00:02:51.260> smaller<00:02:51.770> hunters<00:02:52.310> and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
dealing with those smaller hunters and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.070 
dealing with those smaller hunters and
then<00:02:53.090> there<00:02:53.300> will<00:02:53.360> also<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.690> of<00:02:53.870> course

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
then there will also be of course

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.020 
then there will also be of course
smaller<00:02:54.350> scorpions<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.280> seekers<00:02:55.850> that

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
smaller scorpions and seekers that

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.160 
smaller scorpions and seekers that
you're<00:02:56.150> also<00:02:56.300> gonna<00:02:56.510> have<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.840> be<00:02:56.930> fighting

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you're also gonna have to be fighting

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.660 
you're also gonna have to be fighting
now<00:02:57.500> another<00:02:58.190> thing<00:02:58.280> that<00:02:58.520> will<00:02:58.610> be

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
now another thing that will be

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:59.650 
now another thing that will be
interesting<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:59.150> you're<00:02:59.240> going<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> see<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.510> lot

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
interesting is you're going to see a lot

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.330 
interesting is you're going to see a lot
of<00:02:59.690> dead<00:02:59.870> bodies<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.320> this<00:03:00.560> map<00:03:00.770> from<00:03:01.070> where

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
of dead bodies on this map from where

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.940 
of dead bodies on this map from where
the<00:03:01.910> critics<00:03:02.420> had<00:03:02.630> previously<00:03:03.290> killed<00:03:03.650> those

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
the critics had previously killed those

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.500 
the critics had previously killed those
who<00:03:04.130> were<00:03:04.250> on<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.520> ship<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.940> sometimes<00:03:05.330> you

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.520 
random junk that was on one side of the
room<00:04:34.220> is<00:04:34.430> now<00:04:35.030> gonna<00:04:35.270> slide<00:04:35.720> over<00:04:36.229> to<00:04:36.259> the

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
room is now gonna slide over to the

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.499 
room is now gonna slide over to the
other<00:04:36.710> side<00:04:37.070> of<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.340> room<00:04:37.610> water<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.419> gonna

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:38.509 
other side of the room water is gonna

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:41.020 
other side of the room water is gonna
start<00:04:38.840> leaking<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.650> you're<00:04:40.550> sort<00:04:40.910> of

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
start leaking in and you're sort of

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.700 
start leaking in and you're sort of
gonna<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.300> pulled<00:04:41.630> down<00:04:41.810> almost<00:04:42.350> like<00:04:42.620> the

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
gonna be pulled down almost like the

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.800 
gonna be pulled down almost like the
zibbet<00:04:42.949> of<00:04:43.039> gravity<00:04:43.430> and<00:04:43.460> then<00:04:43.820> heads<00:04:44.539> water

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
zibbet of gravity and then heads water

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.420 
zibbet of gravity and then heads water
enters<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.560> map<00:04:45.800> you're<00:04:46.100> going<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.280> move

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
enters the map you're going to move

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.420 
enters the map you're going to move
progressively<00:04:46.699> slower<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.870> slower<00:04:48.430> so

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
progressively slower and slower so

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.999 
progressively slower and slower so
basically<00:04:50.389> what<00:04:50.539> happened<00:04:50.960> was<00:04:51.020> your<00:04:51.650> ship

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.009 
basically what happened was your ship

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:54.340 
basically what happened was your ship
had<00:04:52.280> ran<00:04:52.610> into<00:04:53.060> the<00:04:53.210> area<00:04:53.630> where<00:04:53.840> the<00:04:53.960> ark<00:04:54.259> was

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
had ran into the area where the ark was

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.960 
had ran into the area where the ark was
located<00:04:55.220> because<00:04:55.400> there<00:04:55.699> was<00:04:55.820> nobody

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
located because there was nobody

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.300 
located because there was nobody
piloting<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.750> submarine<00:04:57.349> you<00:04:57.860> just<00:04:58.099> sort<00:04:58.220> of

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
piloting the submarine you just sort of

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.180 
piloting the submarine you just sort of
crashed<00:04:58.699> into<00:04:59.090> a<00:04:59.360> wall<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.620> now<00:05:00.740> water<00:05:01.009> is

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
crashed into a wall so now water is

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.740 
crashed into a wall so now water is
entering<00:05:01.310> the<00:05:01.729> ship<00:05:01.940> and<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.210> need<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.479> escape

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
entering the ship and you need to escape

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.379 
entering the ship and you need to escape
before<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.349> sinks<00:05:03.650> so<00:05:03.979> this<00:05:04.520> is<00:05:04.789> where<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.270> are

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
before it sinks so this is where you are

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.240 
before it sinks so this is where you are
put<00:05:05.599> on<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.930> clock<00:05:06.259> you<00:05:06.590> need<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.830> get<00:05:06.979> out<00:05:07.220> of

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
put on the clock you need to get out of

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.730 
put on the clock you need to get out of
the<00:05:07.430> ship<00:05:07.699> before<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:08.660> is<00:05:08.780> entirely<00:05:09.110> filled<00:05:09.530> up

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
the ship before it is entirely filled up

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.460 
the ship before it is entirely filled up
with<00:05:09.889> water<00:05:09.949> and<00:05:10.780> otherwise<00:05:11.780> your<00:05:12.080> whole<00:05:12.259> team

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
with water and otherwise your whole team

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.469 
with water and otherwise your whole team
will<00:05:12.680> drown<00:05:12.979> now<00:05:13.220> like<00:05:13.370> I<00:05:13.520> mentioned<00:05:13.759> the

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
will drown now like I mentioned the

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.689 
will drown now like I mentioned the
built<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.530> going<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:15.770> be<00:05:15.889> tilted<00:05:16.340> so<00:05:16.550> you're

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
built is going to be tilted so you're

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.279 
built is going to be tilted so you're
going<00:05:16.789> to<00:05:16.849> be<00:05:16.970> sliding<00:05:17.389> down<00:05:17.630> and<00:05:17.990> you're<00:05:18.110> also

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
going to be sliding down and you're also

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.290 
going to be sliding down and you're also
going<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.740> be<00:05:18.919> in<00:05:19.160> water<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.759> that<00:05:19.849> water<00:05:19.910> will

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
going to be in water and that water will

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.480 
going to be in water and that water will
continue<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.780> rise<00:05:20.960> and<00:05:21.289> at<00:05:21.380> one<00:05:21.560> point<00:05:21.590> there

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
continue to rise and at one point there

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.279 
continue to rise and at one point there
most<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.240> your<00:05:23.360> body<00:05:23.539> will<00:05:23.750> be<00:05:23.840> covered<00:05:24.199> in

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
most of your body will be covered in

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:25.510 
most of your body will be covered in
water<00:05:24.500> and<00:05:24.740> you're<00:05:24.889> gonna<00:05:25.009> have<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.400> be

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
water and you're gonna have to be

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.029 
water and you're gonna have to be
swimming<00:05:26.030> so<00:05:26.500> recommend<00:05:27.500> you<00:05:27.650> get<00:05:27.830> out<00:05:27.949> of

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 
swimming so recommend you get out of

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:29.620 
swimming so recommend you get out of
there<00:05:28.160> as<00:05:28.250> fast<00:05:28.310> as<00:05:28.639> possible<00:05:28.849> you<00:05:29.240> may<00:05:29.419> want

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
there as fast as possible you may want

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.779 
there as fast as possible you may want

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
to use something like a medikit so that

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.390 
to use something like a medikit so that
you<00:05:31.849> can<00:05:31.970> speed<00:05:32.300> up<00:05:32.330> your<00:05:32.720> running<00:05:33.229> speed<00:05:33.400> one

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
you can speed up your running speed one

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.830 
you can speed up your running speed one
thing<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.669> note<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:34.909> that<00:05:35.090> you're<00:05:35.330> still<00:05:35.360> going

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
thing to note is that you're still going

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.149 
thing to note is that you're still going
to<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:35.990> fighting<00:05:36.169> aliens<00:05:36.500> but<00:05:36.949> the<00:05:37.039> thing

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:37.159 
to be fighting aliens but the thing

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:38.200 
to be fighting aliens but the thing
about<00:05:37.190> these<00:05:37.400> aliens<00:05:37.789> is<00:05:37.940> that<00:05:38.060> they've

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
about these aliens is that they've

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.909 
about these aliens is that they've
adapted<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.810> their<00:05:39.020> environment<00:05:39.560> so<00:05:39.650> they<00:05:39.680> are

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
adapted to their environment so they are

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:41.860 
adapted to their environment so they are
now<00:05:40.039> able<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.520> swim<00:05:41.000> if<00:05:41.539> you<00:05:41.659> can<00:05:41.780> imagine

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
now able to swim if you can imagine

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.689 
now able to swim if you can imagine
they're<00:05:42.289> almost<00:05:42.500> like<00:05:42.770> piranhas<00:05:43.400> where<00:05:43.580> you

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
they're almost like piranhas where you

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.310 
they're almost like piranhas where you
may<00:05:43.849> see<00:05:43.909> them<00:05:44.210> coming<00:05:44.479> at<00:05:44.690> you<00:05:44.840> in<00:05:44.990> the<00:05:45.020> water

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
may see them coming at you in the water

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.170 
may see them coming at you in the water
and<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:45.860> better<00:05:46.099> take<00:05:46.400> them<00:05:46.580> out<00:05:46.729> quickly<00:05:46.909> or

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
and you better take them out quickly or

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.879 
and you better take them out quickly or
they're<00:05:47.330> just<00:05:47.360> gonna<00:05:47.599> chomp<00:05:48.080> at<00:05:48.320> your<00:05:48.470> legs<00:05:48.680> if

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
they're just gonna chomp at your legs if

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.469 
they're just gonna chomp at your legs if
they<00:05:49.010> chomp<00:05:49.280> at<00:05:49.430> your<00:05:49.550> legs<00:05:49.760> you're<00:05:50.330> then

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
they chomp at your legs you're then

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.290 
they chomp at your legs you're then
gonna<00:05:50.659> go<00:05:50.990> into<00:05:51.860> you're<00:05:52.490> gonna<00:05:52.610> crouch<00:05:52.970> and

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
gonna go into you're gonna crouch and

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.330 
gonna go into you're gonna crouch and
then<00:05:53.659> you'd<00:05:53.870> go<00:05:54.080> into<00:05:54.289> prone<00:05:54.830> if<00:05:55.070> you<00:05:55.190> are<00:05:55.310> a

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
then you'd go into prone if you are a

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.710 
then you'd go into prone if you are a
bit<00:05:55.520> a<00:05:55.550> second<00:05:56.060> time<00:05:56.180> and<00:05:56.240> of<00:05:56.449> course<00:05:56.630> you're

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
bit a second time and of course you're

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.210 
bit a second time and of course you're
gonna<00:05:56.810> just<00:05:57.020> go<00:05:57.199> slower<00:05:57.500> and<00:05:57.800> that's<00:05:58.009> gonna

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
gonna just go slower and that's gonna

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.490 
gonna just go slower and that's gonna
slow<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.550> down<00:05:58.909> they<00:05:59.570> won't<00:05:59.780> kill<00:06:00.050> you<00:06:00.320> but

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
slow you down they won't kill you but

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.680 
slow you down they won't kill you but
you're<00:06:00.919> gonna<00:06:01.099> have<00:06:01.190> to<00:06:01.430> go<00:06:01.729> slower<00:06:02.150> and<00:06:02.509> then

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
you're gonna have to go slower and then
