00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.500
 hello you tube friends talk to them exec sae l ex ex this is my first video 

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:19.169
 and I'm going to talk about the massive disappearance of anime on the TV 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.189
 which is something that really fucks us 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.429
 Well, it seems that the television whores are doing everything 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.119
 possible for not going unanimously 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.009
 OK lets start 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.019
 the anime in my native Mexico begins to popularize from the 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.290
 eighties with series for children like jedi candy candy 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.050
 astroboy 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:37.700
 meteor 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.600
 sandy bel etc. 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.260
 from then on a large list of animes was issued by the main 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.170
 channels clear channel 5 and since the mid-nineties Aztec 7 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.220
 It should be noted that Aztec 7 became famous precisely from its creation 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.550
 in 1995 for the transmission of many anime series 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.790
 both channels began to gain more popularity in the nineties when 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.040
 they began to transmit better series like for example 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.420
 dragon goal 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.290
 and do not run away 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.450
 knights of the zodiac ralph marra 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 sailor moon etcetera series that were definitely very good 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.490
 On the other hand, cable channels such as locomotion also started to boom 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.380
 that began to broadcast a program almost 100% anime 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.799
 that with the passage of time would become a channel that would mark 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.970
 time 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.170
 At the beginning of the 2000s there were still good series on open TV as 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 pokémon sakura karkak tours 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.510
 digimon among others seemed that we could enjoy quietly the 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:36.630
 anime 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.729
 but that was precisely the year when the anime remodeling began 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.360
 reason 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.510
 many and many civil and religious organizations began to allege 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.310
 that these series had violent and sexual content and this was an evil 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.549
 example for viewers who were mostly children 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.630
 since companies like bimbo supported the catholic church and were an impeller 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 primordial so that the output of this series will materialize 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.869
 due to the influences they had with television contracts 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.190
 this was radically observed in Aztec 7 in the early 2000s with 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.480
 total elimination of the anime and in channel 5 would happen little by little happening the in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.870
 morning schedules this channel to a step some animes until 2007 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.870
 where the vast majority of anime was eliminated that giving as last things 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.050
 good its wide being released that year with a lot of censorship and in schedule of the 1 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.709
 pm and naruto 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.680
 all this also to include many gringas series and others made in mexico 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760
 some that were very bad and very unsuccessful 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:35.939
 this was in Mexico 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.569
 but maybe they will realize what similar things happened in their 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.529
 respective countries 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.689
 and then they started with the cable channels in channels like fox kits that 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.040
 would turn into jetix 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.320
 there they passed a block called anime invasion that survived until 2006 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.760
 when it was eliminated to include disney series although some were aired 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.000
 a missing the block although already in 2009 all disappeared with the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.950
 renamed jetix to disney and I am today they do not pass on 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.469
 digimon data escualidismo king 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.700
 also how to forget detonate and what went through cartoon network that started 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:11.519
 transmitting 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:16.650
 already in the hours of 5 to 7 pm in 2002 and later in 2004 the parents and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.860
 organizations came out with the same blowjob as with channel 5 and sent them to 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.430
 schedule from 12 to 3 in the morning more or less 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 I remember when I got to see a few times in 2006 until it disappeared today 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.209
 even though you had to unveil to see it 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.749
 they passed series like 

00:03:31.749 --> 00:03:36.600
 a danwing and do not run to kauko and vigo the 2002 supercampeons 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.460
 sakura wars and some specials like animatrix 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.190
 dragon movies goal etcetera until some even I do not remember their 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.330
 name was a guy hurt at least an alternative to see me but in 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.090
 end today that the children of his whore and mother network cartoon sima have expressed 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.249
 no longer have an interest in broadcast anime sons of bitches 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.269
 well that they stay with their mediocre series 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.489
 This stupid and that only fussed in the brain to children today 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.489
 no longer pass of bakugan and pokémon as in channel 5 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:07.880
 and to say of anime erda I mean animax 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.300
 that we all know what happened to be a channel dreamed by all that 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.980
 transmitted anime 24 hours an asshole channel + 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.650
 full of shit from series from the United States and movies that for that already 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.199
 there are many channels but there is no other 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.629
 all thanks to the whore bitch prostitute of Claudia Bermudez 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.339
 who has said that animax will stop broadcasting anime entirely from 

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:29.999
 March 2011 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:34.889
 if incredibly it is called animax and they will not emit unanimously hahaha but it is not 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.099
 worry as it will happen as animax hacr yhca that stopped issuing on 31 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.239
 October 2010 for low audience since they did the same as animax 

00:04:43.239 --> 00:04:44.590
 latin america hahaha 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.979
 poor assholes 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.719
 they did not realize that it was the only channel we had left where 

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:53.760
 we could enjoy anime chingones and that was the key to his reality mox 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.840
 but we'll see how long they last from now on 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.409
 I consider this to be something completely unfair since I think that 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.210
 after japan and the Asian area Latin America is one of the regions 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.830
 where there is more demand for anime and instead 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.219
 even though you want to no longer me mothers anime 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:14.919
 better in other countries like the united states that despite not being a country 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.900
 where there is a lot of demand for anime as Latin America 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.800
 has the luxury of having channels like the anime network 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.990
 funimation chenel 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.990
 apart from animax that there is still transmitting to nimes 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.780
 religious and civil associations as well as parents complain that 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.650
 the contents are not suitable for children more than anything because of the violence 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.280
 but anyway children are always exposed to violent content 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.740
 anywhere from the videogames that the same parents assholes are 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.250
 they buy even the movies that they transmit for not passing anime 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.300
 or perhaps that child no older than 13 years has not seen horror movies hat 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.689
 of war with explicit and real violence 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:52.360
 what an eye 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.919
 I do not criticize movies or videogames 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.930
 aside no one will deny that most anime series are containing 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.409
 violence even if they have content made and 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.439
 usually leave a positive message to carry a thematic derived from values 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.479
 for example 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.520
 in dragon bol we can frequently see values ​​like friendship 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.060
 the sacrifice 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:11.969
 the compassion 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.369
 solidarity and so on 

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:18.069
 or also for example rosario plus tampa yesterday that even though it is 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.009
 unanimously done and 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.000
 the main message is the value of respect and friendship that prevail 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:27.150
 Although the series deals with issues such as discrimination but of course 

00:06:27.149 --> 00:06:30.949
 to show that the values ​​of love and friendship prevail above all 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.229
 I know that after all, what does it matter if they happen to me or not on television? 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.569
 after all there is the internet or you can buy the homework thing that 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:41.539
 it turns out maybe even more comfortable 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.289
 but what a chingon it would be to turn on the TV and watch the series that you like as in 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.279
 Japan where the anime is a thing of every day 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.369
 I also know that there are many reasons why we will not ever get in 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:56.599
 channel 5 or cartoon network in primetime since it is true that they are channels 

00:06:56.599 --> 00:06:58.050
 dedicated for children 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.240
 but for example in channel 5 the works could be transmitted as if they were 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.889
 movies or under some special block in any channel under any 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.369
 content warning 

00:07:07.369 --> 00:07:11.939
 they could also create some channel that although they will not pass 100% anime will pass 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:16.189
 good series and if you want accompanied by other American series for adults 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:17.569
 as ugly americans 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:18.749
 South Park 

00:07:18.749 --> 00:07:21.300
 and something like locomotion in its beginnings 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.819
 with that I would settle 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:25.169
 but good that today is difficult 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.919
 I hope that someday they find a good alternative that leaves us happy 

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:29.770
 to all 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.349
 and that they understand that if the audience cares 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:36.180
 the transmission of animals will make a chingo grow any channel 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.060
 for example we all know that in Tibi everything but music happens and instead of 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:44.280
 keep going those fucking fucking reality shows better than anime will pass and your 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.009
 Raiting would rise through the skies as they do in Tibi Europe 

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:49.229
 or else of loss 

00:07:49.229 --> 00:07:53.059
 which locomotion returns or falls to the anime network in Latin America 

00:07:53.059 --> 00:07:57.479
 xtf issste xp to finish I want to thank all those who raise the 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:01.639
 series to the internet or have online channels dedicated to anime like geox 

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.099
 who is at liberty to have scored com 

00:08:04.099 --> 00:08:05.809
 I recommend it 

00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:09.849
 thank you very much because if it were not for you and we would be well fucked 

00:08:10.659 --> 00:08:11.830
 thanks for watching 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:15.240
 can subscribe or comment greetings to all
