I<00:02:41.690> think<00:02:42.110> the<00:02:42.260> solo<00:02:42.530> he<00:02:42.769> plays<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.159> chorus

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
I think the solo he plays the chorus

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.080 
I think the solo he plays the chorus
eight<00:02:43.670> times<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.319> then<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.409> chorus<00:02:45.769> is<00:02:46.090> again

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
eight times and then the chorus is again

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.460 
eight times and then the chorus is again
