00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.080

even<00:03:00.350> if<00:03:00.560> you<00:03:00.739> can't<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.280> vitamin<00:03:01.820> it's

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
even if you can't that vitamin it's

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.580 
even if you can't that vitamin it's
really<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:02.660> going<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:02.930> do<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.080> much<00:03:03.410> effect

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
really not going to do that much effect

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.280 
really not going to do that much effect
in<00:03:03.920> your<00:03:04.070> body<00:03:04.310> and<00:03:04.610> I<00:03:05.360> think<00:03:05.600> what<00:03:05.750> happens<00:03:06.170> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
in your body and I think what happens is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.800 
in your body and I think what happens is
that<00:03:06.350> when<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:06.950> don't<00:03:07.190> eat<00:03:07.510> nutritious<00:03:08.510> foods

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
that when we don't eat nutritious foods

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.110 
that when we don't eat nutritious foods
that's<00:03:09.200> why<00:03:09.350> we<00:03:09.500> over<00:03:09.860> consume<00:03:10.340> food<00:03:10.640> because

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
that's why we over consume food because

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.030 
that's why we over consume food because
well<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.780> nutrients<00:03:12.410> aren't<00:03:12.739> really

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
well the nutrients aren't really

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.039 
well the nutrients aren't really
reaching<00:03:13.549> ourselves<00:03:14.450> you're<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.750> getting

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
reaching ourselves you're not getting

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.380 
reaching ourselves you're not getting
into<00:03:15.620> our<00:03:15.650> body<00:03:16.220> so<00:03:16.820> therefore<00:03:17.030> we're<00:03:17.360> going

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
into our body so therefore we're going

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.940 
into our body so therefore we're going
to<00:03:17.540> be<00:03:17.630> hungry<00:03:17.780> all<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.140> time<00:03:18.260> you're<00:03:18.709> eating

changing the chemistry and cowl and it

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.800 
changing the chemistry and cowl and it
really<00:03:46.430> does<00:03:46.640> some<00:03:46.850> harmful<00:03:47.150> effects<00:03:47.600> your

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810

information<00:03:50.210> to<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> body<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:51.410> actually

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
information to the body this actually

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:56.170 
information to the body this actually
has<00:03:52.070> more<00:03:53.350> omega-3s<00:03:54.350> than<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.880> conventional

has more omega-3s than the conventional

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.630 
has more omega-3s than the conventional
one<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.900> mean<00:03:57.050> I'm<00:03:57.170> sorry<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.650> break<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.400> you

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
harder it is going to be to lose fast to

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.990 
harder it is going to be to lose fast to
gain<00:04:09.290> muscle<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:10.040> do<00:04:10.460> any<00:04:10.640> of<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:10.850> stuff

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
gain muscle to do any of that stuff

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.060
