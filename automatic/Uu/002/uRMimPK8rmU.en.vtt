00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.969
 Welcome to surf 12 today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.770
 I would like to anthony 4150 with 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.460
 the amd fx 6,300 and 6,350 processors 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.470
 to compare 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.900
 all three of these have a very typus 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
 Similar pricing and that is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.820
 also the reason for this comparison test 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.269
 the effect 6350 costs the most 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.840
 then comes the referee 4150 and as 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.000
 last the fag 6300 which less than 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.710
 the cheerful costs to find out 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.449
 which processes are the better choice 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.680
 is let's look at the 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.680
 benchmarking results 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:38.070
 so good the internet giant 4150 beats 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 in things video rendering right 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.620
 Well 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.630
 yet when it comes to 3d rendering and old 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.220
 comes in or as well as video in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.370
 Encoding are the amd fx 6,300 and 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:52.020
 6.350 technically much better games 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.150
 is that a tie, so to speak 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.460
 there are the games where the effects Buss 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.270
 bring more power and also exactly 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.620
 the other way 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.050
 However, the difference in performance 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.920
 not so big but all-encompassing 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.320
 I would say that the fx 6,300 and 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 6,350 processes here at the gaming the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.360
 winners are at power consumption wm 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.250
 intel cpu of course it's lower though 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.790
 It is not an extremely big one either 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.830
 difference 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.930
 it just depends on how much more 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.880
 which one tolerates the choice falls 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 one between these typus not exactly 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.890
 easily have the effects of courage as well 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.260
 a freely selectable multiplier where 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.390
 the jury has a locked what 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.520
 means that you can not overclock 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 By doing over the day you did the 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.130
 possibility to continue the performance 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.230
 increase 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.750
 So yes, all processors bring that way 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 their advantages and disadvantages 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.890
 but if you ask me are the 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.049
 flexible in this case a bit 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.390
 Better that they are cheaper too 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.709
 I mean the effect 6300 it cheaper 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.690
 but if you think of the price 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.540
 leistungsverhÃ¤ltnis be emanating 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.260
 in my opinion the fag 6350 the 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.420
 best choice 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.340
 Nevertheless, the choice in the end is not yours 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.959
 mine which decides which of these 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.700
 circus is the winner 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.110
 I hope I could somehow with you 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.209
 help this video 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.040
 Thanks for watching do not forget
