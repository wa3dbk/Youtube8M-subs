00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.379
 hello everyone welcome to my channel or 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:07.299
 I distract a video that is inside the 

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.860
 danger section of fashion and it's going to 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.629
 try on colors according to how 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.780
 we combine the colors we can get 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.400
 different results besides that it be 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.199
 a sickle and cala d'or because the colors 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.810
 combine very well or make it a disaster 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.910
 we can also adapt them to different 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.130
 occasions if you want to know how to combine 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.730
 colors and what to do with all of them this 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.730
 is your video 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.230
 white is one of the wildcard colors 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.760
 that will combine well with almost everything 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.160
 but what you have to avoid is to combine it 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.989
 with other tones that are claritos like 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.449
 they can be light yellows 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.520
 clear and very careful also with the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.290
 beige and we want to wear a total outfit 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.360
 how cool are we going to see that the garments 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.879
 white are the same shade of white 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.530
 we can never combine a white garment 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.150
 with again because it's going to give the 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.260
 feeling that you learn beige is 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.200
 dirty here I have some white clothes 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.180
 And for what 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.710
 see what I told you the white with 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:07.950
 the beige this is a white blazer and this 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.950
 it's a beige shirt as you can see the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 unite it gives the feeling that the shirt 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.050
 it's dirty it looks with that certain color 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 yellow that we do not want to get the 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.650
 white not combine with other colors 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.990
 clear but combines with everyone else 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.390
 another of the star fashion colors 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.760
 is black as you all know black 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.410
 is synonymous with elegance and combined with 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.750
 white let's get an outfit 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.630
 perfect for any occasion in the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.460
 that requires a little more class or 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.850
 to go more arranged you can get 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.680
 total looks of this same color 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.619
 perfect and I would always play with the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.300
 introduction of details such as can be 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.890
 this fuchsia hat 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.170
 come talk about this chubby but 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.759
 any garment that stands out on the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.259
 black when combining black no 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.720
 we are going to have problems because it combines 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.880
 with almost everything with what I would have 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.399
 a little more care is to 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.320
 combine it with brown personally I think 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.010
 that with him a dark brown does not feel 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.680
 nothing good but if it's a light brown 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.030
 if for example these shoes that are 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.470
 browns clarito 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 I would wear them with this dress 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.820
 black but as I said with the 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 black you are not going to have problems besides 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.450
 Another advantage of black is that it thins 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.190
 At least it gives that effect for a long time 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.380
 black that we put ourselves we are not going to 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.060
 reduce three or four kilos simply 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.190
 that is going to give that optical effect that 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.720
 we are thinner and stylize the brown 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.980
 It is not another of the most used colors 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.360
 but with this you have to have a little 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.070
 more careful and it's a little bit more 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.990
 difficult when it comes to always combining 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.060
 let's adapt for the same color range 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.850
 going from a dark brown to a 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.460
 beige tone and we can also choose as 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.020
 by dark green green colors 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.360
 military like this shirt can be 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.550
 black if we are talking about a brown 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.280
 clearly if we can combine a brown 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.680
 dark with a shirt that is a tone 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.680
 lighter pulling here I have gone 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.110
 one of the colors that we will see the most 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.330
 together with the previous ones is going to be the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.610
 blue is very difficult to fail with blue 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.870
 It will look good with all colors 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.769
 brown green red black whites 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.930
 any color 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.310
 we have always thought that black and 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.890
 white are the most colors 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.260
 recurrent and the most used but not 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.450
 see how blue I think it is in the 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.450
 what else can we see the classic 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.230
 example of that we go with many jeans 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.360
 daily and it's super easy to combine 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.769
 anything with jeans one of the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.360
 key points that I want to give with this 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.549
 video is that almost all colors go 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.340
 to look good with everyone but we have to 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:38.680
 be very aware and look very much at 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
 what tone of the range we choose let's 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.670
 serve for all occasions from 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.829
 something more arranged as these can be 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.280
 pants mixed with black until the 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:51.340
 most used jeans as much as a color 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.900
 clearly as the darkest this is the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.489
 point of inflection of the video and starting 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.750
 from here harder colors of 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.970
 to combine 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.670
 it may turn out to be a bit difficult color 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.110
 although I think that this season we have 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.150
 seen that the military green that is a 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.490
 darker green is very easy to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.350
 combine and we're always going to hit 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.950
 when we are going to combine it with blacks 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:14.560
 gray blue garnets and even with 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.450
 green browns more clarito 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.180
 they are already much more difficult to 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.620
 combine and those tones would go more like 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.540
 those neutral colors like they can be 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.370
 white black or gray with gray always 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.010
 it will look good the best example of 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.930
 combine it with brown are the garments of 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.260
 camouflage these colors that are more 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.780
 difficult we are never going to make a total 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.640
 look with those colors I mean that 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.650
 I will not go between the green one is 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.480
 the turn of red and pink these two 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.370
 I will include them in the 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.740
 same sack since they will combine well 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.120
 with the same tones this color will be 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.820
 more striking and we will use it 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.310
 whenever we want to give another touch to the 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.530
 outfit bring attention with that garment 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.480
 the best thing is to give the protagonism with 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.510
 the colors that go best are with the 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:01.240
 black gray and white and with some 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.360
 jeans is going to be a perfect binomial 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.190
 we can not go whole red rose 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.539
 not mix colors as 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.340
 example that so I did not offer him the 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.259
 brown to do an outfit with different 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.270
 tonalities instead the red rose 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:19.080
 it does not allow it and we can not mix it 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.080
 among them the rose merge a garnet 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.410
 do not even think about yellow for 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.940
 much that we like and we love in 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.710
 Summer when she is very dark 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.180
 you need moderation to call the 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.160
 attention more than any of the ones I've 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.900
 spoken before and it's also very 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.389
 grateful and it looks great if it's a 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.860
 mustard tone how it will be this jersey 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.290
 me the combination that I like the most is 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.210
 with dark blue blue and if it's going to be a 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:44.979
 yellow more songs or will it be with 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.330
 white or gray or black although we already know 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:47.860
 that this will always look good with 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.310
 almost everything but it can also be very 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:53.229
 pretty with green greens the purple or with 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.660
 blue is one of the greatest dangers of 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.580
 the colors is to abuse their way more 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.500
 striking as are the colors fluorine or 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.210
 neon is was one of the tendencies of the 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.400
 last spring summer and I think that 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.530
 this year will continue to be 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.790
 be as striking tones as he said 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.190
 before with yellow you have to have 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.740
 much moderation with them the key to 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:14.580
 these colors is to use only one 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.520
 garment of this color we can not get 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.190
 thousand things of fluorine colors by much 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:22.960
 Enchant us please some people 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.210
 he does it but it really is that he does not 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.100
 is absolutely nothing well is better 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.880
 focus all the attention on one point 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.370
 our 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.680
 and take us as if we were a tree 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.080
 Christmas this shirt we put on 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.060
 some jeans and there is no greater difficulty is 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.310
 which is super easy to combine are 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.040
 colors that will stand out a lot and 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:44.440
 they look good with neutral tones as this 

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.030
 It has been all girls and boys many 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.920
 thank you very much for seeing me if you have 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.960
 Any doubt something that we have left 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.210
 Of course I also have to ask 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.490
 clarify that I did not study anything about 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.310
 I mean these ideas that I am giving you 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:59.710
 you know from my little head what I see what 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.600
 that I like maybe some of 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.280
 you may think that one of the 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.130
 colors that I said there is nothing good 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.750
 with one of those that I have named but 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.730
 that can be very good with another 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.680
 that also write it down here I hope 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.140

 of dangers of fashion remember that here 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.920
 down can you tell me all our 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.210
 dangers that you think there are if 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.040
 you liked the video I do not even have 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.230
