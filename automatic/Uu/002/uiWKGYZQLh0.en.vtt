00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.520
 well everyone's and yes these potatoes 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.220
 my faith we will meet for once 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.900
 team death match on the map 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.689
 suddenly and you'll see that this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.019
 part there was really impressive 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.369
 in 42 launches the part 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.859
 I would like to tell you purpose when you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.940
 do about my concept you 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.250
 I understand it's been a month since I 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.190
 do not have for this video on I have 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.670
 totally stopped actually because I 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.739
 did not have too many videos on offer and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.969
 especially in addition I did not have time 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.170
 to really devote him so that's it 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.590
 but to do well this part 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.079
 I had to show it to you 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.570
 it's my best part that I have 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.859
 never made by not attracting and who you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.799
 go see it's very rare to see a 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.070
 score also high in black matter 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.159
 you will see that it is then I will 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.170
 start the video 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.780
 so it's on this myth keeping does not have 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:21.210
 been normal by dollar strong and I 'm going 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.170
 comment all this we know is that the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 second time actually that I look at it 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.720
 and even sometimes I was impressed the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 May 6 I had a lot of luck 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 know how much I took my class 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.659
 comments donate and then I limited myself 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
 I'll change what I do to him 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.330
 rock with the moment stage or 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 quiet 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.630
 so i have marathon project the bumper 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.140
 frau bullets and that's more than I have 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.870
 first thing vest by bullet in their 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.120
 camp and aim solid so the first 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.100
 quietly especially that I launched 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.450
 usually here a push to January 5th 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.860
 so here you still have luck she 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 to one who is camped there on the ground 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.970
 ask why but not to freeze 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.540
 not my life next to me 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.650
 without seeing me say or luck via 3g on 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.810
 a lot of luck they had no 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.530
 blow the sight you said lachance 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.850
 chayrigues finally cyrus is at the listened 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.730
 connection in this is not even me the

 dyed and pc although it was not me 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.050
 So I have four titles on 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.200
 five that my team at this task with 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.330
 good normal face kills 2 taiana I 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.300
 said since the two youngest 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.350
 valve was not enough so refused to 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.620
 to follow 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 you have so these movies in these beasts loggia 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.680
 pitch and I take my time to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.120
 reload have already you see that 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.420
 start very hard i'm doing so kiel to me 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:53.510
 all alone on the nine standing places 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.590
 so lucky to miss a guy 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.600
 here we do not know why he defies the 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.610
 room from time to time there I saw 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.200
 a point no I turn around I wait I 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.320
 lets pass in fact he must have seen 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.310
 the other a crypt points 60 years old I 'm going 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.050
 let go in the few ones so 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:14.610
 I have no time to let go of that already 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.360
 damn 9 and then 10 this one did 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.820
 frankly a lot of luck says it's 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.900
 to see it's not someone I'm 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.930
 go back and there I see they have 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.350
 strafed with sophie japan and to buy 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.489
 already 11 out of 15 out of 15 that I would be ashamed 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.700
 of me alone is in unison too 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.650
 so here I was hiding my dogs are going 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.280
 start doing a hell of a job again and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.560
 look already at tattoo 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.840
 this next Monday, June 7th at noon with the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.310
 yes I think damascus especially here 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.620
 we never know pulled over so I want 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.819
 not happen what 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.380
 and then on this map it's true that we 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.940
 do not make a lot of facts 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.080
 with the wii wheel and in practice on 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.330
 this note there but hey I do not despair 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.170
 I tell myself that I would not do anything 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.890
 on the bench or two but it ends up paying 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.890
 here 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.450
 no we do not kill so that's it 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.860
 already three years later then I have trouble 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:27.540
 either 4 it's going to be the fifth is 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.490
 normally it'll be the last 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:37.440
 No, I do not even have good enough 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.000
 that's it I see the point that is 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.300
 right next to me on my right I'm 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.090
 picks up the cnl got the upper hand but he 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.590
 so here's every time I put double 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.620
 dose 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.300
 I do not know if anyone saw the movie 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.620
 zombieland 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.250
 this is one of the double dose rules 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.990
 must ensure this moment so 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.840
 usually with a nice sum that 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.050
 So often walkers but do 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.460
 often draws from them as I wait 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.010
 not even to see if I won dead I 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.070
 am very proud I stop when a king 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.080
 who bites so 23h I killed three 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.280
 days by on a series with the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.260
 Blackbird easier these scholarships 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.870
 18 gaps mounted no I see someone 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.620
 already folded I told myself hey well he's going 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.620
 do its job 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:26.810
 so I'm going to have a drink seven years 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.100
 who turns his back or double two 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.140
 where I hide it as much as possible 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.090
 recharge people who are lucky you 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.800
 see that frankly since the 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.430
 beginning there was no difficulty 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.200
 no fatim there I see happen he's drinking 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.300
 his words and hervÃ© are there I tell him 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.730
 good ah but he moratorium and this 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.870
 that's a dirty affair 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.730
 and that's the science making the request 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.330
 of bottom that pulls aside there is no 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:55.040
 touched once you told him 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:58.200
 the song so I have three killed 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:06:00.419
 two wrestlers if still dogs I 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.880
 choose my dream i may be doing 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.930
 the dogs twice I have our video in 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.270
 do I am twice the dogs but 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.430
 these two packages I will put the link in 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.070
 this video and frankly it was 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.650
 hallucinatory 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.860
 and there you still dogs life but I 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.490
 I will not stop there 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.930
 I continue my small massacre I find 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.090
 also betrayed me on the ground she is 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.330
 a line of more 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.599
 I have a little trouble lifting 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.219
 thank you my bulletproof vest pro a little 

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:32.500
 I see they come back I do not want 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:36.090
 to confront me face to face always 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:41.050
 more risky I see it with the a71 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:43.870
 quiet he wants that's how these 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:48.340
 areas but that's making me too 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:52.150
 affected and then my dogs for a good 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.580
 work they will help you and you 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.409
 see there that on bottom left and has 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.969
 practically how do you see there I 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:07:00.210
 did not know to hide myself I wanted I 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:05.500
 you - you will actually have to do 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:10.210
 still mount my stats and see 7 me 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:13.750
 seemed the most crowded at 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:16.659
 kill that's over and I'm finishing on a 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.909
 score 52 killed to god what is really 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.409
 hallucinating hair of parents in matter 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.110
 speaking politics it's impossible 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:25.930
 to have such a score to see if the 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.860
 quakes that are on purpose but there and have 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:31.240
 so there's the bonnet dog yum 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.789
 and so I left a little bit 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:38.370
 actually because it was for 

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:40.770
 actually show but suddenly I dropped 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.449
 many victims 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.219
 that's my personal record 52 killed 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:48.250
 borrowing matter team this is 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:51.759
 frankly even though rationing two 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:53.349
 times his sleeves good on this I hope 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:55.180
 you will have enjoyed playing but I do not 

00:07:53.349 --> 00:07:57.699
 not put the video link that 

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.199
 I said there twice the dogs in 

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:01.199
 part is highly
