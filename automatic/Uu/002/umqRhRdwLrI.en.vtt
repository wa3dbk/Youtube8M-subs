airbags not going to play we tried the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.340 
airbags not going to play we tried the
demo<00:01:23.070> six<00:01:23.640> times<00:01:23.939> when<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> engine<00:01:25.080> shut<00:01:25.320> off

demo six times when the engine shut off
the<00:01:26.009> Cobalt<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.790> harder<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.240> control<00:01:28.159> alright

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the Cobalt was harder to control alright

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.100 
the Cobalt was harder to control alright
there<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.430> goes<00:01:32.329> now<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.360> could<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.750> around<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
there it goes now I could go around the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.260 
there it goes now I could go around the
cones<00:01:34.520> but<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> knew<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.060> was<00:01:36.210> coming

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
cones but I knew that it was coming

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.569

what's<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> worst-case<00:01:37.650> scenario<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.430> with

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
what's the worst-case scenario here with

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:39.830 
what's the worst-case scenario here with
this<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.150> car<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> fact<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this with this car and the fact that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.999 
this with this car and the fact that
they're<00:01:40.079> still<00:01:40.170> out<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.619> road

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
they're still out on the road

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.770 
they're still out on the road
well<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.490> worst-case<00:01:41.820> scenario<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.630> know

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
well the worst-case scenario is you know

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710 
well the worst-case scenario is you know
when<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.049> happens<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.250> lose<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.390> ability

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
when this happens you lose the ability

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.600 
when this happens you lose the ability
to<00:01:45.750> actually<00:01:45.960> steer<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.590> car<00:01:46.770> very<00:01:46.979> well<00:01:47.189> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to actually steer the car very well you

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.370 
to actually steer the car very well you
could<00:01:47.850> lose<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> ability<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.659> stop<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
could lose the ability to stop the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
could lose the ability to stop the
vehicle<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.700> were<00:01:50.820> highly<00:01:51.149> distracted

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
vehicle and you were highly distracted

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.800 
vehicle and you were highly distracted
at<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.439> time<00:01:52.740> along<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
at that time along with that you have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
at that time along with that you have
the<00:01:55.079> airbags<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.560> shut<00:01:55.710> off<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.119> very

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the airbags or shut off so it's very

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.569 
the airbags or shut off so it's very
easy<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.110> how<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.530> ax<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.829> could<00:01:58.920> happen<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
easy to see how an ax it could happen it

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.710 
easy to see how an ax it could happen it
could<00:01:59.640> be<00:01:59.790> very<00:01:59.969> tragic

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
could be very tragic

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.780 
could be very tragic
