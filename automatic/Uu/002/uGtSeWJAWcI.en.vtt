current version of the driver that you
have<00:02:43.599> right<00:02:43.780> now<00:02:43.989> and<00:02:44.260> when<00:02:45.129> a<00:02:45.160> new<00:02:45.430> driver<00:02:46.090> was

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
have right now and when a new driver was

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.210 
have right now and when a new driver was
released<00:02:46.750> for<00:02:47.079> that<00:02:47.230> particular<00:02:47.440> piece<00:02:48.010> of

outdated<00:02:51.609> drivers<00:02:51.819> let's<00:02:52.480> look<00:02:52.630> at<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
outdated drivers let's look at the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.800 
outdated drivers let's look at the
overview<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.590> actually<00:02:54.280> have<00:02:54.609> 23<00:02:55.239> drivers<00:02:55.630> that

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
overview I actually have 23 drivers that

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.050

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.020 
are out of date and 101 up-to-date
drivers<00:02:58.450> so<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.260> obviously<00:02:59.889> do<00:03:00.459> need<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.730> update

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030

it<00:03:31.090> found<00:03:31.299> I<00:03:31.630> mean<00:03:32.290> look<00:03:32.319> at<00:03:32.500> this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
it found I mean look at this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.700 
it found I mean look at this
this<00:03:34.000> particular<00:03:34.210> piece<00:03:34.660> of<00:03:34.840> hardware<00:03:35.200> the

this particular piece of hardware the
current<00:03:36.100> version<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.430> driver<00:03:36.760> i<00:03:36.880> have<00:03:37.270> was

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
current version the driver i have was

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.280 
current version the driver i have was
from<00:03:38.490> 2006<00:03:39.490> they<00:03:40.390> have<00:03:40.600> a<00:03:40.630> version<00:03:40.960> of<00:03:41.170> the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
from 2006 they have a version of the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.100 
from 2006 they have a version of the
driver<00:03:41.560> from<00:03:41.980> 2009<00:03:42.760> can<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.570> imagine<00:03:43.840> the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
driver from 2009 can you imagine the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.920 
driver from 2009 can you imagine the
updates<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.680> have<00:03:44.800> been<00:03:45.130> made<00:03:45.340> since<00:03:46.000> 2006

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.230 
updates that have been made since 2006
and<00:03:47.080> 2009<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:48.010> mean<00:03:48.550> they<00:03:48.670> could<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.880> found<00:03:48.970> a

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
and 2009 I mean they could have found a

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.760 
and 2009 I mean they could have found a
lot<00:03:49.420> of<00:03:49.540> things<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.990> will<00:03:50.440> tweak<00:03:50.740> my

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
lot of things that will tweak my

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.310 
lot of things that will tweak my
hardware<00:03:51.340> make<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.970> run<00:03:52.090> faster<00:03:52.200> there<00:03:53.200> could

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
hardware make it run faster there could

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.110 
hardware make it run faster there could
have<00:03:53.350> been<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.590> security<00:03:53.950> loophole<00:03:54.490> you<00:03:55.000> know

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
have been a security loophole you know

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.640 
have been a security loophole you know
it<00:03:55.180> can<00:03:55.300> be<00:03:55.330> causing<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.900> lot<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.110> problems<00:03:56.560> of

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it can be causing a lot of problems of

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.290 
it can be causing a lot of problems of
my<00:03:56.740> computer<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.760> would<00:03:57.940> have<00:03:58.030> never<00:03:58.150> known

my computer and I would have never known

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.360 
my computer and I would have never known
because<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.590> know<00:03:59.709> these<00:03:59.920> hardware

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
because you know these hardware

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.340 
because you know these hardware
manufacturers<00:04:01.000> they<00:04:01.209> don't<00:04:01.450> make<00:04:01.570> it<00:04:01.630> easy<00:04:02.020> to
