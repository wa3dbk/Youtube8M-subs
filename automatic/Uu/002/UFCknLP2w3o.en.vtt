00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.600 

that<00:05:15.600> is<00:05:15.810> d<00:05:16.050> bud<00:05:16.530> oh<00:05:16.830> yeah<00:05:17.490> I<00:05:19.220> think<00:05:20.220> it's<00:05:20.430> hard

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that is d bud oh yeah I think it's hard

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.420 
that is d bud oh yeah I think it's hard
to<00:05:20.760> come<00:05:20.880> back<00:05:21.060> from<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.390> way<00:05:21.600> yeah<00:05:22.080> it<00:05:22.200> is

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
to come back from this way yeah it is

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.620 
to come back from this way yeah it is
right<00:05:23.430> at<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.580> end<00:05:23.790> those<00:05:23.940> ice<00:05:24.150> chunks<00:05:24.540> are

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
right at the end those ice chunks are

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.990 
right at the end those ice chunks are
pretty<00:05:24.810> tough<00:05:25.580> coming<00:05:26.580> this<00:05:26.760> way<00:05:26.940> is

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
pretty tough coming this way is

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.220 
pretty tough coming this way is
definitely<00:05:27.330> harder<00:05:27.570> because<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.900> wants<00:05:28.140> to

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
definitely harder because it wants to

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.990 
definitely harder because it wants to
kick<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.740> way<00:05:28.920> which<00:05:29.550> gets<00:05:29.760> you<00:05:29.850> out<00:05:29.880> of

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
kick you that way which gets you out of

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.850 
kick you that way which gets you out of
that<00:05:30.150> one<00:05:30.420> rock<00:05:30.690> would<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.200> like<00:05:31.500> it<00:05:31.650> was<00:05:31.740> that

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
that one rock would you like it was that

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.980 
that one rock would you like it was that
knee<00:05:32.070> because<00:05:32.610> I<00:05:32.790> guess<00:05:33.210> there's<00:05:33.420> ice<00:05:33.630> in<00:05:33.660> all

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
knee because I guess there's ice in all
