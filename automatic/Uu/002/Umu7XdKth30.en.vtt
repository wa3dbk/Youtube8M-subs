playing it so i'm not very good at it

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:29.340 
playing it so i'm not very good at it
let's<00:00:11.639> go<00:00:11.759> ahead<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.059> get<00:00:12.420> into<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> game

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.650 

how<00:00:30.350> many<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.860> used<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.250> break<00:00:31.490> well<00:00:31.760> while

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
how many of you used to break well while

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.360 
how many of you used to break well while
playing<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.230> game<00:00:33.410> because<00:00:33.560> I<00:00:33.830> don't<00:00:34.040> tend

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
playing this game because I don't tend

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.850 
playing this game because I don't tend
to<00:00:34.520> use<00:00:34.670> it<00:00:34.820> that<00:00:34.970> much<00:00:35.030> I<00:00:35.690> just<00:00:36.290> find<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:36.620> kind

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
to use it that much I just find it kind

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.630 
to use it that much I just find it kind
of<00:00:36.980> slows<00:00:37.309> you<00:00:37.460> down<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:39.010> tried<00:00:40.010> not<00:00:40.190> to<00:00:40.400> use<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
of slows you down I tried not to use the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.049 
of slows you down I tried not to use the
break<00:00:40.820> I<00:00:40.940> should<00:00:41.120> say<00:00:45.250> but<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.280> do<00:00:46.400> find<00:00:46.970> myself

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
break I should say but I do find myself

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:58.310 
break I should say but I do find myself
always<00:00:47.780> trying<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:49.160> like<00:00:49.690> get<00:00:50.690> right<00:00:51.440> up<00:00:51.650> front

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.710 

I<00:00:58.410> see<00:00:59.400> them<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> camera<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.150> I'm<00:01:00.270> looking<00:01:00.570> up

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
I see them on camera and I'm looking up

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.070 
I see them on camera and I'm looking up
so<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> don't<00:01:01.320> expect<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.920> my<00:01:02.070> best<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.550> here

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
so I don't expect to do my best on here

so I don't expect to do my best on here
maybe<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> shouldn't<00:01:04.440> be<00:01:04.530> looking<00:01:04.620> at<00:01:04.800> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
maybe I shouldn't be looking at the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:16.980 
maybe I shouldn't be looking at the
camera<00:01:06.290> okay

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.219
