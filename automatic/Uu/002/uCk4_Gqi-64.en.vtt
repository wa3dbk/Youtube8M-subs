00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.830
 good as you can see the crabs are 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 live is really a merit that kiko 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.030
 I live it better but to know it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.370
 live we have to do it in cold water is 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.279
 say submerged in cold water and little 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.550
 As soon as they are cooked, we throw the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.550
 laurel 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.340
 and while it is cooking good now we have 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.020
 to explain them as you do if the 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.050
 you have good sea ​​water would be 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.720
 about 60 grams per 60 50 grams 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.550
 per liter of water there are even people every 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.710
 cellar give them a little more salt 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.420
 because it says that sea water does not arrive 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.860
 to have enough salt for it to be 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.160
 good the king crab but good we 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.020
 traditionally we do it like this we throw 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.290
 the crabs and we wait for the water 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.089
 boil once it boils what we do 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.090
 is to wait for these painters who weigh 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.220
 kilo and a half we expect more or less 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.660
 thirteen fourteen minutes if they thought two 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.670
 kilos then we would give two or three 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.440
 minutes more and yes weighed kilo 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.009
 we will go down a little bit in what is the 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.110
 good time as you see is boiling 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.780
 right now is when we have to tell 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.479
 the 13 minutes and then remove them from 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.900
 fire good as it is said my land this 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.430
 ferva horn then let's turn it off 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.650
 and we're going to empty the water and we're going to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 take them out of the water to let them 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.910
 cool at least 20 or 30 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 minutes before starting to prepare 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.150
 the first one first of all I'm going to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 explain the difference between male and 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.110
 female who is her sex as you see sex 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.220
 of the male this is a male is like a 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.830
 triangle plus and bras instead the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.760
 Sex of the females is more rounded 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 bigger the first thing we do is 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.650
 get sex out 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.259
 these two parts that you have here and 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.580
 we started to cut the legs two legs 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.770
 just twist a little bit because 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.840
 if not the rector and we say that here we go 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.890
 maybe a little more meat inside 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.940
 that we are interested in being inside 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.620
 then better to twist the now we're going 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.790
 to open what is the shell that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.130
 he usually knows around here it's simple 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.120
 you just grab the shell strips 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.510
 from the top part and here it is here 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.890
 we have the shell and now this 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.700
 we have around here do not eat this is what 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.700
 we also withdraw 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.180
 well the female has what are some 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.180
 red roe 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.890
 here the corals we call ourselves and 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 this is the case of the case also les 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.780
 we clean these tablets for what 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.450
 are these seeds and fix this that 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.849
 you see here is that I was about to 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.700
 changing the shell is creating another 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.849
 inside drawer we break this part of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.849
 here 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.960
 and this part we present here and 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.970
 directly 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.970
 although we leave it for the end 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.630
 this we put here 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:39.490
 and now we start to break the toques with 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:41.110
 a hammer is hit and I'm going to 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.390
 prepare what is the car we are going to 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.790
 leave it clean to keep giving 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:51.030
 all these things that you have on one side 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:56.550
 we take away what are your mouths too 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.840
 if we keep cleaning all these are 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.380
 drinks that you have around here are going 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.010
 removing is left limpito limpito for 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.930
 than the diners because they simply 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.100
 devote to eat what is seafood 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:13.500
 then for now comes the trick of 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.150
 each one me for example we what 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.859
 we do is share it in four for 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.299
 make it easier to eat well with a 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.780
 large knife knife is cut 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:31.139
 to the half 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:34.639
 and now we take and destroy 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:39.590
 placing here like this in this way 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.590
 we know and we are placing them 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.170
 text 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.460
 and it really is something very rich they are what 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.280
 are the roe the coral what you 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.110
 We call it is a delight is 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.850
 the richest of the spider crab specifically 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.040
 of the accent of the female this is male no 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.560
 it's good, we have them ready for 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.330
 eat the female on one side as you see 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.080
 you appreciate these orange colors that are 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:09.389
 their corals and on the one hand the males 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.870
 tell you that everyone knows different 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.150
 especially in this part the legs more or 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.620
 less are its flavor is similar there are people 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.650
 which says that the differences I 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.020
 personally not but this part is 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.750
 totally different its flavor as it is 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.780
 it seems that also in its color if the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.190
 spider crab this is the part of the male if 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.870
 red is already like a bread like 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.690
 floor you want and that is full full 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.820
 does not have this liquid is a whole mass 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.250
 dense of this color and this texture 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.140
 simply with a spoon or 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.470
 the ultra cental or directly you 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.470
 you eat it 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.530
 and this is a pure delight 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.640
