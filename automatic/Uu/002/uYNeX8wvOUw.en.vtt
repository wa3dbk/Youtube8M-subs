meters<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.529> water<00:00:20.750> first<00:00:21.750> we<00:00:21.900> need<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.320> length

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
meters of water first we need a a length

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.030 

and<00:00:29.160> then<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.939> tie<00:00:30.710> nice<00:00:31.710> heavy

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
and then to that we tie nice heavy

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:44.690 
and then to that we tie nice heavy
swivel<00:00:41.239> and<00:00:42.239> roughly<00:00:43.050> 300<00:00:43.530> millimeters<00:00:43.980> from

swivel and roughly 300 millimeters from

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000 
swivel and roughly 300 millimeters from
the<00:00:44.879> swivel<00:00:45.210> down<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.440> start<00:00:46.739> our<00:00:46.860> first

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the swivel down we start our first

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.750 
the swivel down we start our first
dropper<00:00:47.870> make<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> little<00:00:49.079> loop<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> I'll<00:00:50.610> run

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
dropper make a little loop and I'll run

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.760 
dropper make a little loop and I'll run
through<00:00:50.940> knots<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.989> another<00:00:52.260> segment<00:00:52.530> you'll

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
through knots in another segment you'll

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
through knots in another segment you'll
see<00:00:52.949> exactly<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.430> these<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.760> done<00:00:57.140> okay<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
see exactly how these are done okay and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.060 
see exactly how these are done okay and
keep<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> loops<00:00:58.949> nice<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.430> short<00:01:00.920> run<00:01:01.920> down

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
keep the loops nice and short run down

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.990 
keep the loops nice and short run down
about<00:01:02.219> another<00:01:02.340> 300<00:01:02.730> mil<00:01:03.470> -<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.680> -<00:01:05.000> another

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
about another 300 mil - there - another

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.980 
about another 300 mil - there - another
little<00:01:06.450> loop

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.930 

again<00:01:13.990> nice<00:01:14.440> and<00:01:14.500> short<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.430> just<00:01:15.460> prevents

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
again nice and short it just prevents

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.399 
again nice and short it just prevents
the<00:01:16.150> loop<00:01:16.330> twisting<00:01:16.869> around<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> main<00:01:17.380> line

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
the loop twisting around the main line

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.340 
the loop twisting around the main line
it<00:01:17.890> sort<00:01:18.580> of<00:01:18.610> sits<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.060> loop<00:01:19.750> out<00:01:19.930> and<00:01:20.140> away

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
it sort of sits the loop out and away

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.149 
it sort of sits the loop out and away
from<00:01:20.409> the<00:01:20.740> main<00:01:20.890> line<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.700> then<00:01:22.330> on<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.630> end

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:48.260 

we<00:01:27.159> do<00:01:27.280> another<00:01:27.460> loop<00:01:27.750> same<00:01:28.750> thing<00:01:28.960> same<00:01:29.259> knot

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.850 

like<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:51.210> okay<00:01:52.210> that<00:01:52.390> allows<00:01:52.630> us<00:01:52.660> to<00:01:52.870> loop<00:01:53.620> our

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
like so okay that allows us to loop our

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.180 
like so okay that allows us to loop our
lid<00:01:54.070> on<00:01:54.120> the<00:01:55.120> beauty<00:01:55.420> of<00:01:55.510> having<00:01:55.630> a<00:01:55.950> loop<00:01:56.950> not

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
lid on the beauty of having a loop not

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.660 
lid on the beauty of having a loop not
to<00:01:57.940> put<00:01:58.180> your<00:01:58.750> sinkers<00:01:59.140> on<00:01:59.320> is<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:00.520> can

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
to put your sinkers on is that you can

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.300 
to put your sinkers on is that you can
easily<00:02:00.850> change<00:02:01.450> your<00:02:02.260> sinkers<00:02:02.650> by<00:02:02.830> taking<00:02:03.190> the

knot undone right if you want to fish a
lighter<00:02:06.730> led<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.150> can<00:02:08.190> fish<00:02:09.190> on<00:02:09.340> those<00:02:09.490> days

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
lighter led you can fish on those days

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.370 
lighter led you can fish on those days
where<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.060> get<00:02:10.180> light<00:02:10.630> winds<00:02:10.900> and<00:02:11.140> very

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
where you get light winds and very

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.720 
where you get light winds and very
little<00:02:11.620> current<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:12.160> might<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.430> able<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.640> go

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
little current you might be able to go

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.610 
little current you might be able to go
down<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:12.940> half<00:02:13.240> that<00:02:13.270> size<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.590> I

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
down to half that size the one I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.890 
down to half that size the one I
commonly<00:02:15.070> uses<00:02:15.490> about<00:02:15.670> 10<00:02:15.970> ounce<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:16.840> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
commonly uses about 10 ounce but if you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
commonly uses about 10 ounce but if you
can<00:02:17.020> get<00:02:17.110> away<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:17.440> a<00:02:17.500> lot<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.770> one<00:02:17.860> that

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
can get away with a lot of one that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.190 
can get away with a lot of one that
makes<00:02:18.130> your<00:02:18.250> fishing<00:02:18.610> more<00:02:18.820> enjoyable<00:02:19.200> so

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
makes your fishing more enjoyable so

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.310 
makes your fishing more enjoyable so
that<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.380> find<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.010> the<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.760> circle<00:02:22.090> hooks

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
that I find that the the circle hooks

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.480 
that I find that the the circle hooks
for<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:23.440> style<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.830> fishing<00:02:23.980> work<00:02:24.250> really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
for this style of fishing work really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.610 
for this style of fishing work really
well<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:27.550> they<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.970> loop<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.360> as<00:02:28.510> well<00:02:28.720> again

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
well and they just loop on as well again

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.560 
well and they just loop on as well again
making<00:02:30.340> it<00:02:30.490> easy<00:02:30.670> if<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.910> want<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.120> change<00:02:31.330> the

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
making it easy if you want to change the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.440 
making it easy if you want to change the
smaller<00:02:31.870> hooks<00:02:32.880> depending<00:02:33.880> on<00:02:33.970> what<00:02:34.150> species

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
smaller hooks depending on what species

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.380 
smaller hooks depending on what species
of<00:02:34.750> fish<00:02:35.190> you're<00:02:36.190> finding<00:02:36.550> on<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.760> day<00:02:39.390> okay

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
of fish you're finding on the day okay

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.160 
of fish you're finding on the day okay
so<00:02:40.450> there<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.780> have<00:02:40.870> it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
so there you have it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.380 
so there you have it
