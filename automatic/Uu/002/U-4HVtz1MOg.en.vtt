00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
there and give it some curve what I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
there and give it some curve what I
forgot<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.550> but<00:00:32.870> we<00:00:33.870> gave<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.230> bit

the<00:02:15.709> pins<00:02:15.980> bounce<00:02:16.670> get<00:02:17.330> still<00:02:17.600> sometimes

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the pins bounce get still sometimes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.080 
the pins bounce get still sometimes
bounce<00:02:18.290> off<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.709> walls<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.250> get<00:02:19.790> some<00:02:19.970> of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
bounce off the walls and get some of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.910 
bounce off the walls and get some of
those<00:02:20.150> other<00:02:20.270> pins<00:02:20.950> lets<00:02:21.950> up<00:02:22.160> too<00:02:22.340> far

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.110 

and<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:28.190> have<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.490> put<00:02:28.640> curve<00:02:28.880> on<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and you don't have to put curve on the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.430 
and you don't have to put curve on the
ball<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:29.300> could<00:02:29.540> just<00:02:29.750> make<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.900> was<00:02:30.140> straight

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
ball you could just make it was straight

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320 
ball you could just make it was straight
but<00:02:30.650> I'm<00:02:31.340> trying<00:02:31.610> to<00:02:31.730> experiment<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.240> little

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
but I'm trying to experiment a little

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:43.840 
but I'm trying to experiment a little
bit

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.440 

no<00:02:44.480> curve

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
no curve

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.270 
no curve
just<00:02:46.810> straight<00:02:47.140> down<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:48.190> middle<00:02:48.220> there

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:02.660 

there<00:02:52.280> you<00:02:52.459> go

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.520 

I'm<00:03:03.209> assuming<00:03:03.690> you're<00:03:03.810> seeing<00:03:04.170> that<00:03:04.349> little

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
I'm assuming you're seeing that little

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.630 
I'm assuming you're seeing that little
pit<00:03:04.890> little<00:03:05.640> ball<00:03:05.819> icon<00:03:06.030> that<00:03:06.450> goes<00:03:06.690> down<00:03:07.640> down

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
pit little ball icon that goes down down

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.690 
pit little ball icon that goes down down
there<00:03:11.330> last<00:03:12.330> time<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.630> didn't<00:03:13.280> what<00:03:14.280> didn't<00:03:14.610> go

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
there last time I didn't what didn't go

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.100 
there last time I didn't what didn't go
down<00:03:14.819> far<00:03:15.120> enough<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.540> time<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.780> went<00:03:15.959> down

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
down far enough this time I went down

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.530 
down far enough this time I went down
too<00:03:16.349> far<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:17.520> real<00:03:17.670> touchy<00:03:17.940> to<00:03:18.239> where<00:03:18.360> you

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
too far it's real touchy to where you

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.790 
too far it's real touchy to where you
need<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:21.470> just<00:03:22.470> going<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.739> a

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
need to do this I just going to a

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.320 
need to do this I just going to a
straight<00:03:23.190> hopefully<00:03:23.640> everything<00:03:23.880> bounces

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
straight hopefully everything bounces

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.110 
straight hopefully everything bounces
around

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
oh yeah see everything bounced around

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.250 
oh yeah see everything bounced around

estoy I want to do and I will admit I
have<00:03:41.260> not<00:03:41.440> been<00:03:41.560> playing<00:03:41.860> this<00:03:42.010> game<00:03:42.069> really

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
have not been playing this game really

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.240 
have not been playing this game really
really<00:03:43.150> long<00:03:45.690> actually<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.750> just<00:03:46.780> learned<00:03:47.049> this

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.819 

this<00:03:51.250> curve<00:03:51.549> technique<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.440> last<00:03:53.590> time

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
this curve technique just the last time

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.580 
this curve technique just the last time
I<00:03:53.950> played<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.459> was<00:03:55.329> just<00:03:55.629> experimenting<00:03:56.079> couple

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
I played I was just experimenting couple

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.740 
I played I was just experimenting couple
minutes<00:03:56.799> ago<00:03:57.010> and<00:03:57.250> got<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.269> way<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.420> wanted

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
minutes ago and got it the way I wanted

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:19.710 
minutes ago and got it the way I wanted
it

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.449 

I<00:04:19.810> think<00:04:20.530> I<00:04:20.620> could<00:04:20.799> probably<00:04:20.980> do<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> little<00:04:21.340> bit

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
I think I could probably do a little bit

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.970 
I think I could probably do a little bit
better<00:04:21.579> at<00:04:21.790> this<00:04:21.880> game<00:04:22.170> you<00:04:23.170> know<00:04:23.320> with<00:04:23.740> more

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
better at this game you know with more

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
better at this game you know with more
practice

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:50.850 

and<00:04:31.480> that<00:04:32.050> went<00:04:32.290> down<00:04:32.440> too<00:04:32.680> far<00:04:32.890> again

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.320 

we<00:04:51.860> have<00:04:51.979> some<00:04:52.130> picking<00:04:52.610> up<00:04:52.699> a<00:04:52.850> few<00:04:53.120> of<00:04:53.270> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
we have some picking up a few of the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.600 
we have some picking up a few of the
spares<00:04:53.690> so<00:04:54.620> I'm<00:04:54.680> not<00:04:54.800> looking<00:04:55.160> too<00:04:55.310> bad<00:04:55.340> in

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
spares so I'm not looking too bad in

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.279 
spares so I'm not looking too bad in
this<00:04:55.699> game<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:59.210> strike<00:04:59.750> is<00:04:59.780> going<00:05:00.020> to<00:05:00.110> take

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:00.289 
this game the strike is going to take

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.920 
this game the strike is going to take
some<00:05:00.319> practice<00:05:01.210> especially<00:05:02.210> if<00:05:02.539> I<00:05:02.599> want<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.870> do

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
some practice especially if I want to do

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.450 
some practice especially if I want to do
it<00:05:03.020> with<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.319> curve

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.680 

oh<00:05:10.310> I<00:05:11.310> thought<00:05:11.520> that<00:05:11.729> might<00:05:11.910> have<00:05:12.090> been<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.240> now

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
oh I thought that might have been it now

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:34.600 
oh I thought that might have been it now
wasn't<00:05:12.900> it

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.100 

well<00:05:35.610> this<00:05:35.850> is<00:05:36.090> better<00:05:36.270> than<00:05:36.390> bowling<00:05:36.750> on<00:05:37.080> the

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
well this is better than bowling on the

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:44.070 
well this is better than bowling on the
Atari<00:05:37.770> I<00:05:38.130> can<00:05:39.060> say<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.330> for<00:05:39.540> sure

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.960 

even<00:05:44.680> though<00:05:44.770> bowling<00:05:45.099> on<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.280> Atari<00:05:45.669> isn't

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
even though bowling on the Atari isn't

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.129 
even though bowling on the Atari isn't
bad<00:05:46.180> I<00:05:46.599> still<00:05:47.409> had<00:05:47.530> some<00:05:47.710> fun<00:05:47.919> playing<00:05:48.220> that

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 
bad I still had some fun playing that

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.110 
bad I still had some fun playing that
and<00:05:50.139> that<00:05:50.650> was<00:05:50.889> actually<00:05:51.069> on<00:05:51.370> my<00:05:51.400> list<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.939> buy

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
and that was actually on my list to buy

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.760 
and that was actually on my list to buy
and<00:05:52.449> this<00:05:53.319> kind<00:05:53.530> of<00:05:53.590> fun<00:05:54.240> it's<00:05:55.240> just<00:05:55.500> the<00:05:56.500> pins

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
and this kind of fun it's just the pins

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:06.149 
and this kind of fun it's just the pins
don't<00:05:56.979> bounce<00:05:57.430> like<00:05:58.060> these<00:05:58.330> pins<00:05:58.659> do

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:06.159 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:08.199 

if<00:06:07.159> you<00:06:07.249> miss<00:06:07.429> something<00:06:07.639> you<00:06:07.969> missed

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:08.209 
if you miss something you missed

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:17.290 
if you miss something you missed
something<00:06:08.569> in<00:06:08.659> the<00:06:08.809> other<00:06:08.989> one

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.020 

I<00:06:17.360> went<00:06:18.349> too<00:06:18.530> far<00:06:18.770> maybe<00:06:19.099> too<00:06:19.909> far<00:06:20.150> down<00:06:20.330> again

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
I went too far maybe too far down again

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:24.630 
I went too far maybe too far down again
a<00:06:22.180> little<00:06:22.810> curve<00:06:23.020> back<00:06:23.290> there<00:06:24.130> we<00:06:24.250> go<00:06:24.400> look<00:06:24.580> at

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:24.640 
a little curve back there we go look at

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.270 
a little curve back there we go look at
that<00:06:24.730> oh<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:26.500> thought<00:06:26.680> that<00:06:26.890> might<00:06:27.070> have<00:06:27.250> been

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
that oh I thought that might have been

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.400 
that oh I thought that might have been
it<00:06:27.430> again<00:06:27.730> I<00:06:27.940> just<00:06:28.330> can't<00:06:28.510> seem<00:06:28.990> to<00:06:29.110> get<00:06:29.230> that

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:29.410 
it again I just can't seem to get that

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:40.450 
it again I just can't seem to get that
strike<00:06:29.820> get<00:06:30.820> so<00:06:31.030> close

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:48.519 

oh<00:06:43.330> well<00:06:44.330> it's<00:06:44.990> okay

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:48.529 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:51.939 

well<00:06:49.129> that's<00:06:49.459> the<00:06:49.639> whole<00:06:49.759> game<00:06:49.999> 138<00:06:50.899> think<00:06:51.859> I

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:51.949 
well that's the whole game 138 think I

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:53.319 
well that's the whole game 138 think I
could<00:06:52.159> probably<00:06:52.369> do<00:06:52.609> better<00:06:52.759> with<00:06:53.029> some<00:06:53.209> more

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:53.329 
could probably do better with some more

00:06:53.329 --> 00:06:56.039 
could probably do better with some more
practice<00:06:53.599> I<00:06:54.049> don't<00:06:54.769> think<00:06:54.799> that's<00:06:55.129> too<00:06:55.309> bad

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:56.049 
practice I don't think that's too bad

00:06:56.049 --> 00:06:59.619 
practice I don't think that's too bad
well<00:06:57.049> I<00:06:57.399> guess<00:06:58.399> that's<00:06:58.579> a<00:06:58.759> look<00:06:58.909> at<00:06:59.149> a<00:06:59.179> bowling

00:06:59.619 --> 00:06:59.629 
well I guess that's a look at a bowling

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:02.079 
well I guess that's a look at a bowling
