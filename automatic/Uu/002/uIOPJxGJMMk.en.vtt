to the same point it's just a way to do
it<00:00:55.680> initially<00:00:56.680> when<00:00:57.219> we<00:00:57.250> started<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.090> program

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
it initially when we started the program

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540 
it initially when we started the program
we<00:00:58.660> realized<00:00:58.989> that<00:00:59.109> the<00:00:59.199> nurses<00:00:59.590> were<00:00:59.800> lacking

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
a lot of geriatric education you'll find

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.710 
a lot of geriatric education you'll find
that<00:01:03.160> your<00:01:03.309> nurses<00:01:03.609> were<00:01:03.699> typically<00:01:04.030> educated
