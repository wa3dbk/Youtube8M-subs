00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.099
 and 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.720
 ah 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.260
 and more 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.400
 I came back after weeks or days good 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:30.140
 let's go with a history of two women 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.320
 pretty jesus style ojeda tone of 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.320
 Sun 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.610
 pure gliding raisins 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 let's go well let's count it among the 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.350
 moms 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.680
 do not 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.810
 okay 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.260
 all right 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.640
 it slides from it from here where 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.640
 closed open 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.670
 what is being sold as another note 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.670
 closed equal 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.930
 we're just going to postpone rope number 23 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.930
 t 1 and which number one to air 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 so 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:41.630
 nobody gets second rope when free 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.630
 third rope 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.549
 the love everyone happy 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.689
 about 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.689
 plus 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.579
 they are from the free rope third string and 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.140
 I'm treading on you, commented index above 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.480
 of which number 2 fret 3 with the finger 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.060
 half over agreement number 3 after t 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.560
 4 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:23.010
 stretch marks and then we have passed the scale 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.010
 below 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 we go 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430
 and 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.940
 ah 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.940
 ok how is this 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.490
 ah 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 or not 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.740
 all right 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.210
 tampa 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.720
 again 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.230
 and everyone 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.230
 and 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.640
 all right 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.290
 once again a little bit faster for 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.270
 what to see I suppose I do not understand the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.910
 scale would be here closed open 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.250
 open closed the things we play 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.250
 closed open closed 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.380
 ah 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.270
 after Sunday and after here back 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.650
 you could say the sunny note ok 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.160
 then it would be here in the bottom 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.160
 everything ran like this 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.260
 so that all this 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.600
 all right 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.599
 I do not care 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.599
 i 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.000
 and there are double dug up by the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.810
 clubs of the minimum quantity of 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.870
 bondholders then 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.900
 ok first tone this is to the song 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.410
 then it is sunny 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.440
 you take me second that suffers your 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.440
 third 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:46.690
 in addition to some minors 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:50.080
 I think that would just be a minor and here 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:57.240
 would have another minor this is already greater 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:57.240
 would be also in the then they are re 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.639
 ok the song with that society 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.350
 supposedly not to touch her but like her 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.539
 is akin to the guitar half tone down 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.729
 they have a sustained sun and if you 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.860
 had gone up on the in the choir part 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.139
 is high then better I decided to go down 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.610
 reason 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.490
 it's good 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.419
 today you know that the letter with the 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:28.370
 chords you were to the description so 

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.370
 without more to say let's start 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:38.010
 pretty 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.010
 and after 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.690
 the agony 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.790
 ah 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:02.190
 d 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:02.190
 pretty and smiles as of 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:15.100
 How to forget 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.100
 although she does not 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.370
 and now I want a lot 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.230
 pretty 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.450
 again 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.730
 pretty 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:46.700
 if you like it, you know, like 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.700
 share it 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.800
 you carry long requests but 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.720
 that go up good now they try to upload them 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.510
 I have many songs by the way and 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:00.630
 plan to go up if they are not all going to be the 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:02.730
 the vast majority, mainly those that 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.820
 they ask me to ask for songs but only 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.890
 a person those who ask me more than two 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:10.350
 or three people obviously I will go up 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.030
 that as a preference the point is 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.340
 help them but you start to climb 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.440
 songs that only ask me some 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.760
 because they are songs that I know and 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:22.070
 same way not to battle and to raise the 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.070
 bases is to say you already know thanks
