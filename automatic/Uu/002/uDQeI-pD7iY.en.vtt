quality<00:00:41.370> longevity<00:00:42.329> as<00:00:42.809> well<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.320> tend<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
quality longevity as well I do tend to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
quality longevity as well I do tend to
last<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.340> little<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.760> longer<00:00:45.030> than<00:00:45.300> their<00:00:45.450> pc

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
counterparts and by that i mean they can

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.299 
counterparts and by that i mean they can
run<00:00:49.469> later<00:00:50.280> OS<00:00:50.809> builds<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.020> older<00:00:52.710> machines<00:00:53.070> so

run later OS builds on older machines so

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709 
run later OS builds on older machines so
they<00:00:53.340> seem<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.789> have<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.510> more

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719

they seem to have a little bit more
longevity<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.860> how<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:57.180> life<00:00:57.449> you're<00:00:57.690> going
