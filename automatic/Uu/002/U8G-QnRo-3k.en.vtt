00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
guy and I'll show you how it works in a

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.980 
guy and I'll show you how it works in a
second<00:00:20.939> but<00:00:21.060> specifications<00:00:21.689> are<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:21.869> inches

second but specifications are two inches
across<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.380> little<00:00:22.680> more<00:00:22.920> than<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.130> inch<00:00:23.279> wide

six<00:00:28.019> inches<00:00:28.920> thick<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.849> really<00:00:30.090> thin<00:00:30.300> which<00:00:30.750> is

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
six inches thick so really thin which is

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
six inches thick so really thin which is
nice<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.289> then<00:00:31.650> they<00:00:31.769> weigh<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:31.980> an<00:00:32.160> ounce

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
nice and then they weigh about an ounce

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.510 
nice and then they weigh about an ounce
not<00:00:32.969> including<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.390> lanyard<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.800> way<00:00:34.950> so

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
not including the lanyard and the way so

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.299 
not including the lanyard and the way so
here's<00:00:35.670> how<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.850> LDC<00:00:36.300> works<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.129> the<00:00:38.129> otha

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here's how the LDC works the the otha

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.010 
here's how the LDC works the the otha
sees<00:00:38.460> actually<00:00:38.730> has<00:00:38.820> two<00:00:39.059> handle<00:00:39.450> handle

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
sees actually has two handle handle

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.569 
sees actually has two handle handle
halves<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.410> they<00:00:40.469> pivot<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
halves and they pivot right here in the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.680 
halves and they pivot right here in the
center<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.329> finger<00:00:42.480> on<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
center so you put one finger on the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.450 
center so you put one finger on the
bottom<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> top<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.040> push

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
bottom one on the top and you can push

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.750 
bottom one on the top and you can push
the<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.390> handles<00:00:45.719> apart<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.280> I

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the two handles apart like that and I

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.100 
the two handles apart like that and I
will<00:00:47.910> mention<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.329> your<00:00:48.450> fingers<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.809> moist

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
will mention if your fingers are moist

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.900 
will mention if your fingers are moist
from<00:00:49.260> sweat<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.770> anything<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.700> hard

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
from sweat or anything it is really hard

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.150 
from sweat or anything it is really hard
to<00:00:51.510> get<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.110> handle<00:00:52.350> pieces<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.770> separate

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
to get the to handle pieces to separate

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.979 
to get the to handle pieces to separate
so<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.879> future<00:00:54.239> versions<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.660> think<00:00:54.809> it'd<00:00:54.899> be

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so on future versions I think it'd be

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
so on future versions I think it'd be
nice<00:00:55.170> personally<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.039> some<00:00:56.280> texture<00:00:56.670> here

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
nice personally to see some texture here

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.330 
nice personally to see some texture here
on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> front<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> back<00:00:57.859> so<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:58.920> even<00:00:59.250> if

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
on the front on the back so that even if

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.830 
on the front on the back so that even if
your<00:00:59.460> hands<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.789> moist<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.629> still

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
your hands are moist you can still

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.590 
your hands are moist you can still
separate<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.820> but<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:02.940> being<00:01:03.090> said<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.390> mean

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
separate them but that being said I mean

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.390 
separate them but that being said I mean
it's<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.799> cool<00:01:05.100> design

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it's it's a really really cool design

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's it's a really really cool design
once<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.180> open<00:01:06.479> this<00:01:07.350> portion<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
once it's open this portion here is the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.280 
once it's open this portion here is the
edge<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.580> will<00:01:09.390> mention<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.990> know<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> edge

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
edge I will mention you know the edge

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.899 
edge I will mention you know the edge
comes<00:01:10.530> super<00:01:10.830> sharp<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.850> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
comes super sharp but this is this is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.469 
comes super sharp but this is this is
titanium<00:01:12.510> carbide<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.939> it's<00:01:14.939> durable<00:01:15.360> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
titanium carbide and it's durable but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.670 
titanium carbide and it's durable but
it's<00:01:15.630> not<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> hold<00:01:16.170> an<00:01:16.259> edge<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.530> well

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's not going to hold an edge as well

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's not going to hold an edge as well
as<00:01:16.890> something<00:01:17.189> like<00:01:17.390> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.509> stainless

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
as something like you know stainless

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
as something like you know stainless
steel<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.409> another<00:01:20.070> thing<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.430> would<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.580> fun

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
steel so another thing that would be fun

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.249 
steel so another thing that would be fun
to<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.600> version<00:01:21.810> made<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.170> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
to see would be a version made out of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
to see would be a version made out of
all<00:01:22.409> stainless<00:01:22.950> steel<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> course<00:01:24.270> then

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
all stainless steel but of course then

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.670 
all stainless steel but of course then
it'd<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> lot<00:01:24.750> heavier<00:01:25.080> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.350> super

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it'd be a lot heavier this is super

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
it'd be a lot heavier this is super
light<00:01:25.860> again<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.400> weighing<00:01:26.880> weighing

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
light again you know weighing weighing

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.230 
light again you know weighing weighing
only<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:28.020> ounce<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.500> there's<00:01:29.430> trade-offs<00:01:29.729> no

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
only an ounce so there's trade-offs no

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.640 
only an ounce so there's trade-offs no
matter<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.600> look<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
matter how you look at it and then it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.859 
matter how you look at it and then it
slides<00:01:31.829> closed<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:33.240> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> then

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
slides closed just like that and then

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
slides closed just like that and then
you<00:01:34.020> can<00:01:34.170> wear<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.950> dog<00:01:35.159> tag<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.610> it's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you can wear it like a dog tag so it's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.679 
you can wear it like a dog tag so it's
always<00:01:36.360> there

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
always there

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.850 
always there
very<00:01:36.900> convenient<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:38.220> fun<00:01:38.400> tool<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:40.380> it's

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
very convenient really fun tool and it's

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.710 
very convenient really fun tool and it's
something<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.790> know<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.270> not<00:01:42.540> too

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
something that you know it's not too

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.630 
something that you know it's not too
expensive<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.439> maybe<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.280> worth<00:01:44.340> checking

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
expensive so maybe it's worth checking

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.630 
expensive so maybe it's worth checking
out<00:01:44.820> this<00:01:45.810> particular<00:01:46.079> model<00:01:46.619> designed<00:01:47.549> by

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
out this particular model designed by

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.310 
out this particular model designed by
Aaron<00:01:47.909> Harris<00:01:48.180> again<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.720> mission-critical

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
Aaron Harris again of mission-critical

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.920 
Aaron Harris again of mission-critical
tools<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.009> these<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.180> available<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.750> long

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
tools and these are available a long

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.240 
tools and these are available a long
time<00:01:52.140> ago<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.979> might<00:01:53.070> actually

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
time ago so some of you might actually

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.880 
time ago so some of you might actually
remember<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.820> particular<00:01:54.299> model<00:01:54.710> and<00:01:55.710> now

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
remember this particular model and now

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
remember this particular model and now
this<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.640> whole<00:01:56.790> store<00:01:57.030> stock<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.479> maybe

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
this is some whole store stock and maybe

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.999 
this is some whole store stock and maybe
he'll<00:01:57.869> start<00:01:58.110> making<00:01:58.469> them<00:01:58.590> again

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
he'll start making them again

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.039 
he'll start making them again
might<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.549> nice<00:01:59.670> we'd<00:01:59.939> love<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.299> some<00:02:00.329> some

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
might be nice we'd love to see some some

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.959 
might be nice we'd love to see some some
more<00:02:01.079> innovation<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:02.520> particular

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
more innovation with this particular

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.649 
more innovation with this particular
model<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.450> again<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.140> LDC<00:02:05.659> last-ditch

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
model so again that's the LDC last-ditch

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.869 
model so again that's the LDC last-ditch
cutting<00:02:07.020> tactical<00:02:07.560> dog<00:02:07.710> tag<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
cutting tactical dog tag so that's it
