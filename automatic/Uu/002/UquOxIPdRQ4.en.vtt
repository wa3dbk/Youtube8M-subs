here today to talk about the new feature
that<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.730> rocket<00:00:06.210> machines<00:00:06.569> have<00:00:06.899> come<00:00:07.109> out

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
that the rocket machines have come out

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.740 
that the rocket machines have come out
with<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.770> first<00:00:08.099> I'll<00:00:08.280> go<00:00:08.460> over<00:00:08.550> they<00:00:09.480> still

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
with and first I'll go over they still

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.259 
with and first I'll go over they still
have<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.019> shalini<00:00:10.940> with<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.030> straight

one<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.189> my<00:01:23.280> favorite<00:01:23.670> things<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.030> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
one of my favorite things about the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.999 
one of my favorite things about the
rocket<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.930> isn't<00:01:25.110> specific<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
rocket which isn't specific to the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.640 
rocket which isn't specific to the
rocket<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> e61<00:01:27.299> brew<00:01:27.600> head<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.049> it's

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
rocket but is the e61 brew head and it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.429 
rocket but is the e61 brew head and it's
thermo<00:01:28.979> siphon<00:01:29.340> system<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.780> how<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> has<00:01:31.259> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
thermo siphon system and how it has the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
thermo siphon system and how it has the
ability<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.130> efficiently<00:01:32.670> heat<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
ability to really efficiently heat the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.880 
ability to really efficiently heat the
brew<00:01:33.329> head<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:34.079> really<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
brew head I just I really like that

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.300 
brew head I just I really like that
she's<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.430> constant<00:01:36.210> temperature<00:01:36.630> exactly

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
she's the constant temperature exactly

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.280 
she's the constant temperature exactly
you<00:01:38.310> know<00:01:38.400> they're<00:01:38.610> hand<00:01:38.909> assembled<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:39.900> Italy

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you know they're hand assembled in Italy

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.590 
you know they're hand assembled in Italy
so<00:01:41.130> every<00:01:41.430> single<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.509> know

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so every single one is just you know

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
so every single one is just you know
quality<00:01:42.990> they<00:01:43.619> hand<00:01:43.890> may<00:01:44.009> come<00:01:44.189> over<00:01:44.430> there<00:01:44.549> to

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
quality they hand may come over there to

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.270 
quality they hand may come over there to
all<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.329> components<00:01:45.869> are<00:01:46.020> made<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:46.979> Italy

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
all all the components are made in Italy

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.810 
all all the components are made in Italy
yeah

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
yeah

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.289

far<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.360> know<00:01:49.070> and<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.180> no

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
far as I know and and just there's no

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
far as I know and and just there's no
pressure<00:01:51.540> stat<00:01:51.899> anymore<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> PID<00:01:52.799> it

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
pressure stat anymore with the PID it

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.289 
pressure stat anymore with the PID it
kind<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.159> goes<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.460> line<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> PID<00:01:54.180> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
kind of goes in line with the PID I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.270 
kind of goes in line with the PID I
really<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.409> involvement<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.979> PID

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
really like the involvement of the PID

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
really like the involvement of the PID
just<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.240> more<00:01:57.719> efficient<00:01:58.229> in

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just because it's a more efficient in

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.289 
just because it's a more efficient in
terms<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.799> controlling<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.250> temp<00:01:59.549> yeah<00:02:00.090> how

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
terms of controlling the temp yeah how

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
terms of controlling the temp yeah how
does<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> do<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.869> versus<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.590> heat

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
does it do that versus the heat

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.399 
does it do that versus the heat
exchanger<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.299> mean<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:03.990> how

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
exchanger what do you mean you know how

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.469 
exchanger what do you mean you know how
that<00:02:04.439> well<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.430> makes<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> more<00:02:05.939> efficient

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that well that makes it more efficient

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.490 
that well that makes it more efficient
well<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.020> PID<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:08.780> it's<00:02:09.780> considering<00:02:10.289> more

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
well the PID is it's considering more

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.540 
well the PID is it's considering more
things<00:02:10.830> than<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.099> pressure

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
things than just pressure

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:13.830 
things than just pressure
with<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> pressure<00:02:12.910> step<00:02:13.210> before<00:02:13.390> that<00:02:13.570> I

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
with the pressure step before that I

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.820 
with the pressure step before that I
mean<00:02:14.050> that's<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> only<00:02:14.470> thing<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.710> was

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
mean that's the only thing that was

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.920 
mean that's the only thing that was
considering<00:02:15.310> in<00:02:15.400> terms<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.790> temperature<00:02:16.180> so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
considering in terms of temperature so

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.510 
considering in terms of temperature so
now<00:02:17.440> you<00:02:17.830> have<00:02:18.040> something<00:02:18.280> that's

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
now you have something that's

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.640 
now you have something that's
considering<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.150> lot<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.480> things<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.350> get<00:02:20.440> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
considering a lot of things to get you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.860 
considering a lot of things to get you
to<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.070> consistent<00:02:21.670> temp<00:02:21.910> over<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.510> over<00:02:22.720> and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to a consistent temp over and over and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.540 
to a consistent temp over and over and
over<00:02:22.900> again<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.380> it<00:02:23.470> keeps<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.830> within<00:02:24.010> what

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
over again and it keeps it within what

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.280 
over again and it keeps it within what
about<00:02:24.790> one<00:02:24.940> degree<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.360> whatever<00:02:25.510> you<00:02:25.810> ask<00:02:26.020> it

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
about one degree of whatever you ask it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.200 
about one degree of whatever you ask it
exactly<00:02:26.740> right<00:02:27.010> with<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> heat<00:02:27.670> exchange<00:02:28.060> or<00:02:28.180> a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
exactly right with a heat exchange or a

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.000 
exactly right with a heat exchange or a
typical<00:02:28.600> heat<00:02:28.720> exchanger<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.260> had<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> little

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
typical heat exchanger you had a little

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.070 
typical heat exchanger you had a little
bit<00:02:30.190> more<00:02:30.370> variation<00:02:30.730> exactly<00:02:31.660> still<00:02:31.840> much

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
bit more variation exactly still much

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.930 
bit more variation exactly still much
better<00:02:32.110> than<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:32.620> single<00:02:32.830> boiler<00:02:33.400> but<00:02:33.760> this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
better than a single boiler but this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.730 
better than a single boiler but this
just<00:02:34.150> takes<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.870> next<00:02:35.050> level<00:02:35.140> yeah

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
just takes it to the next level yeah

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.300 
just takes it to the next level yeah
exactly

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
exactly

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.250 
exactly
so<00:02:36.820> Brendon<00:02:37.150> let's<00:02:37.480> show<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.840> folks<00:02:38.020> how<00:02:38.230> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
so Brendon let's show the folks how to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.440 
so Brendon let's show the folks how to
program<00:02:38.830> that<00:02:39.040> PA<00:02:39.250> yes<00:02:39.490> yes<00:02:39.910> let's<00:02:40.120> do<00:02:40.300> it

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
program that PA yes yes let's do it

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.690 
program that PA yes yes let's do it
get<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.930> drip<00:02:41.140> tray<00:02:41.260> out<00:02:41.470> here<00:02:41.830> so<00:02:42.280> there's

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
get the drip tray out here so there's

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.030 
get the drip tray out here so there's
two<00:02:42.880> arrows<00:02:43.210> on<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.630> and<00:02:44.020> you'll<00:02:44.590> notice<00:02:44.800> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
two arrows on this and you'll notice the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.720 
two arrows on this and you'll notice the
blinking<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:46.540> indicates<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.320> boiler<00:02:48.130> well

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
blinking that indicates the boiler well

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
blinking that indicates the boiler well
it's<00:02:48.940> blinking<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.660> wanted<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.930> explain<00:02:50.350> that

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it's blinking I wanted to explain that

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.800 
it's blinking I wanted to explain that
and<00:02:50.710> indicates<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.520> boiler<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.600> and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and indicates the boiler going on and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.690 
and indicates the boiler going on and
off<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.620> that's<00:02:53.740> what<00:02:53.890> keeps<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.250> within<00:02:54.460> that

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
off and that's what keeps it within that

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.270 
off and that's what keeps it within that
one<00:02:54.880> degree<00:02:55.240> whatever<00:02:55.480> you<00:02:55.720> ask<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:57.010> button

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
one degree whatever you ask the button

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.760 
one degree whatever you ask the button
on<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.550> Left<00:02:57.930> lets<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.110> program<00:02:59.380> the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
on the Left lets you program the

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.380 
on the Left lets you program the
temperature<00:03:00.220> and<00:03:00.640> once<00:03:00.940> you<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.210> into

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
temperature and once you get into

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.910 
temperature and once you get into
program<00:03:01.900> mode<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.230> can<00:03:02.410> change<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
program mode you can change the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.620 
program mode you can change the
temperature<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.910> whatever<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.300> want<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.570> to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
temperature to whatever you want it to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.130 
temperature to whatever you want it to
be<00:03:05.550> now<00:03:06.550> it's<00:03:06.790> gone<00:03:06.940> back<00:03:07.210> to<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.480> blinking

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
be now it's gone back to the blinking

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.140 
be now it's gone back to the blinking
that<00:03:08.290> means<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:08.650> back<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:09.070> its<00:03:09.120> normal<00:03:10.120> mode

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that means it's back to its normal mode

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.810 
that means it's back to its normal mode
now<00:03:11.050> if<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.320> hold<00:03:11.560> this<00:03:11.740> one<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.040> the<00:03:12.160> right<00:03:12.340> on<00:03:12.580> I

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
now if I hold this one on the right on I

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.120 
now if I hold this one on the right on I
can<00:03:13.720> actually<00:03:13.840> turn<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.320> boiler<00:03:14.620> off<00:03:14.650> if<00:03:15.010> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
can actually turn the boiler off if I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.870 
can actually turn the boiler off if I
want<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:17.020> then<00:03:17.230> hit<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.860> again<00:03:18.010> now<00:03:18.670> it's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
want to and then hit that again now it's

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.940 
want to and then hit that again now it's
going<00:03:19.360> back<00:03:19.390> to<00:03:19.750> its<00:03:19.930> normal<00:03:20.290> heating<00:03:20.800> mode

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
going back to its normal heating mode

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.510 
going back to its normal heating mode
and<00:03:21.340> we're<00:03:22.180> ready<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.480> go<00:03:22.630> what<00:03:23.410> they<00:03:23.560> do<00:03:23.620> also

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
and we're ready to go what they do also

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.229 
and we're ready to go what they do also
give<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.180> in<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.800> with<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:26.920> manual<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.880> the

here and then it will actually show you
in<00:03:43.390> Fahrenheit<00:03:44.110> over<00:03:44.140> here<00:03:44.560> how<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.860> converts

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
in Fahrenheit over here how it converts

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.280 
in Fahrenheit over here how it converts
and<00:03:45.700> then<00:03:45.970> it'll<00:03:46.270> show<00:03:46.390> you<00:03:46.630> what<00:03:46.959> the<00:03:47.110> brew

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
and then it'll show you what the brew

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.199 
and then it'll show you what the brew
head<00:03:47.470> will<00:03:47.709> be<00:03:47.830> displaying<00:03:48.489> exactly<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.120> it

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
head will be displaying exactly so it

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.420 
head will be displaying exactly so it
gives<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.660> handy<00:03:50.110> conversion<00:03:51.010> chart<00:03:51.250> to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
gives you this handy conversion chart to

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.100 
gives you this handy conversion chart to
to<00:03:51.550> go<00:03:51.640> from<00:03:51.850> centigrade<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.480> frantically

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
to go from centigrade to frantically

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.690 
to go from centigrade to frantically
so<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.770> this<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.459> boiler

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
so this is this is the boiler

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.790 
so this is this is the boiler
temperature<00:03:55.000> correct<00:03:55.600> yes<00:03:56.140> and<00:03:56.380> then<00:03:56.500> you<00:03:56.590> can

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
temperature correct yes and then you can

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.160 
temperature correct yes and then you can
what<00:03:57.130> you<00:03:57.250> with<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.580> handy<00:03:58.060> chart<00:03:58.330> you<00:03:58.989> can

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
and I think the only real con we have is

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.839 
and I think the only real con we have is
only<00:07:47.740> four<00:07:48.010> people<00:07:48.220> in<00:07:48.310> the<00:07:48.370> States<00:07:48.610> and

00:07:48.839 --> 00:07:48.849 
only four people in the States and

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:50.939 
only four people in the States and
that's<00:07:48.910> just<00:07:49.210> the<00:07:49.419> Celsius<00:07:49.630> display<00:07:50.260> which

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:50.949 
that's just the Celsius display which

00:07:50.949 --> 00:07:52.560
