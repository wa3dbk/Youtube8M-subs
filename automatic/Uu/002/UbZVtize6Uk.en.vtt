00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
thought boy that would make a nice

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.980 
thought boy that would make a nice
painting<00:01:16.409> or<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.220> draw<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.720> what<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.840> can

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
painting or like to draw on what you can

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.130 
painting or like to draw on what you can
do<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:20.150> what<00:01:21.150> I've<00:01:21.270> done<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.630> ahead<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> time

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
do is what I've done here ahead of time

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.420 
do is what I've done here ahead of time
is<00:01:22.290> I've<00:01:22.409> taken<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.040> actually

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is I've taken this and I'm actually

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.820 
is I've taken this and I'm actually
xeroxed<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.150> taking<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.350> put<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
xeroxed at taking it on put it on the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
xeroxed at taking it on put it on the
copier<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.880> blowing<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.360> up<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.990> a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
copier and blowing it up so it's a

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.710 
copier and blowing it up so it's a
little<00:01:28.080> bit<00:01:28.290> easier<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.270> and<00:01:30.270> then

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
little bit easier to work with and then

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
little bit easier to work with and then
what<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.470> typically<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.759> start

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
what you typically do is you start

what you typically do is you start
laying<00:01:33.930> your<00:01:34.140> grid<00:01:34.350> over<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.759> takes<00:01:35.970> a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
laying your grid over this that takes a

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.069 
laying your grid over this that takes a
little<00:01:36.150> bit<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.420> time<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.750> know<00:01:36.869> drawing

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
little bit of time you know drawing

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
little bit of time you know drawing
lines<00:01:37.350> on<00:01:37.560> this<00:01:37.770> thing<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:38.970> do

either<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.729> page<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.210> magazine<00:01:42.360> you

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
either the page of the magazine you

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.440 
either the page of the magazine you
don't<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.899> anymore<00:01:43.110> or<00:01:43.619> your<00:01:44.460> Xerox<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:47.450> just

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
don't need anymore or your Xerox or just

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.560 
don't need anymore or your Xerox or just
take<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.990> begin<00:01:49.649> folding<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.329> into<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
take this and begin folding it into a

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
take this and begin folding it into a
reasonable<00:01:52.259> number<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.829> squares<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.430> don't

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
reasonable number of squares you don't

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100 
reasonable number of squares you don't
want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.939> fold<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.630> fourths

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
want to just fold it into fourths

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.649 
want to just fold it into fourths
quarters<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.149> you're<00:01:57.149> still<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.479> going

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
quarters because you're still not going

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.499 
quarters because you're still not going
to<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.869> an<00:01:57.990> accurate<00:01:58.700> idea<00:01:59.700> of<00:02:00.000> where

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to have an accurate idea of where

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.620 
to have an accurate idea of where
certain<00:02:01.020> lines<00:02:01.259> cross<00:02:01.740> into

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
certain lines cross into

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.420 
certain lines cross into
ribs<00:02:03.049> you<00:02:03.229> really<00:02:03.530> want<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:03.799> fold<00:02:04.010> it<00:02:04.189> into

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
ribs you really want to fold it into

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.030 
ribs you really want to fold it into
maybe<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.790> four<00:02:05.210> by<00:02:05.390> four<00:02:05.420> pattern<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:07.009> don't

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
maybe a four by four pattern you don't

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.820 
maybe a four by four pattern you don't
want<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.340> go<00:02:07.460> 25<00:02:08.000> by<00:02:08.179> 25<00:02:08.240> or<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.200> know<00:02:09.289> it's<00:02:09.649> one

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
want to go 25 by 25 or you know it's one

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.870 
want to go 25 by 25 or you know it's one
thing<00:02:09.979> is<00:02:10.069> pretty<00:02:10.280> hard<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.459> fold<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> paper

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
thing is pretty hard to fold the paper

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.420 
thing is pretty hard to fold the paper
at<00:02:11.150> one<00:02:11.270> point<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:11.860> something<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.040> four

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
at one point but something like a four

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.699 
at one point but something like a four
by<00:02:13.610> four<00:02:13.880> grid<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.239> nice<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.380> took<00:02:15.590> this

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
by four grid is nice and I took this

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.500 
by four grid is nice and I took this
picture<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:17.709> created<00:02:18.709> my<00:02:18.860> grid<00:02:19.160> already

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
picture and I created my grid already

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.270 
picture and I created my grid already
and<00:02:20.510> this<00:02:20.840> right<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.500> actually<00:02:21.709> two

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
and this right here is actually two

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.880 
and this right here is actually two
times<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.760> size<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.209> the<00:02:23.360> original

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
times the size of the original

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.270 
times the size of the original
illustration<00:02:25.270> and<00:02:26.410> I've<00:02:27.410> done<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.800> in<00:02:28.010> pen

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
illustration and I've done this in pen

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.800 
illustration and I've done this in pen
just<00:02:28.550> for<00:02:28.760> you<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:28.940> see<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.360> you're<00:02:29.600> actually

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
just for you to see it you're actually

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.170 
just for you to see it you're actually
going<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.230> render<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:31.069> in<00:02:31.370> a<00:02:31.520> lighter<00:02:31.819> pencil

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
going to render this in a lighter pencil

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.110 
going to render this in a lighter pencil
that<00:02:32.660> you<00:02:32.780> can<00:02:32.959> erase<00:02:33.200> later<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.459> again<00:02:34.730> as<00:02:34.940> we

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
that you can erase later and again as we

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.699 
that you can erase later and again as we
state<00:02:35.540> in<00:02:35.630> our<00:02:35.660> other<00:02:35.810> videos<00:02:36.050> don't<00:02:36.350> draw

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
state in our other videos don't draw

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.040 
state in our other videos don't draw
real<00:02:37.040> hard<00:02:37.370> into<00:02:37.700> your<00:02:37.819> paper<00:02:38.090> or<00:02:38.390> your<00:02:38.420> canvas

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
real hard into your paper or your canvas

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.140 
real hard into your paper or your canvas
because<00:02:39.230> it's<00:02:39.500> harder<00:02:39.769> to<00:02:39.800> erase<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.000> also

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
because it's harder to erase and it also

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
because it's harder to erase and it also
leaves<00:02:41.510> that<00:02:41.720> mark<00:02:42.080> doesn't<00:02:42.500> look<00:02:42.860> good<00:02:43.010> so

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
leaves that mark doesn't look good so

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.390 
leaves that mark doesn't look good so
I've<00:02:44.390> drawn<00:02:44.600> this<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:45.050> one<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.100> things<00:02:46.310> you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
I've drawn this up one of the things you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.580 
I've drawn this up one of the things you
might<00:02:46.640> want<00:02:46.670> to<00:02:46.910> invest<00:02:47.269> in<00:02:47.450> in<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.230> future<00:02:48.380> is

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
might want to invest in in the future is

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.229 
might want to invest in in the future is
go<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.769> Michaels<00:02:49.220> or<00:02:49.430> some<00:02:49.580> other<00:02:49.760> art<00:02:49.940> supply

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
go to Michaels or some other art supply

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.449 
go to Michaels or some other art supply
store<00:02:50.569> and<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.530> should<00:02:51.709> pick<00:02:51.860> up<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:52.069> nice<00:02:52.250> set

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
store and you should pick up a nice set

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.460 
store and you should pick up a nice set
of<00:02:52.580> triangles<00:02:52.850> because<00:02:53.840> what<00:02:54.019> these<00:02:54.200> do<00:02:54.440> is

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
of triangles because what these do is

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.729 
of triangles because what these do is
they<00:02:54.709> help<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.100> square<00:02:55.519> off<00:02:55.549> your<00:02:56.500> grid<00:02:57.500> which

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
they help you square off your grid which

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.350 
they help you square off your grid which
is<00:02:57.920> important<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.730> don't<00:02:58.880> want<00:02:59.000> your<00:02:59.120> lines

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
is important you don't want your lines

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.580 
is important you don't want your lines
you<00:02:59.810> know<00:02:59.900> doing<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:02.049> it<00:03:03.049> just<00:03:03.260> sets<00:03:03.440> it

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
you know doing this and it just sets it

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.020 
you know doing this and it just sets it
up<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.769> lot<00:03:03.920> nicer<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.840> I've<00:03:06.049> drawn<00:03:06.319> my<00:03:06.730> 4x4<00:03:07.730> here

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
up a lot nicer so I've drawn my 4x4 here

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.180 
up a lot nicer so I've drawn my 4x4 here
I've<00:03:08.120> got<00:03:08.239> sixteen<00:03:08.690> squares<00:03:09.110> and<00:03:12.040> again<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
I've got sixteen squares and again this

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.920 
I've got sixteen squares and again this
was<00:03:13.370> doubled<00:03:13.790> what<00:03:13.910> I<00:03:13.940> did<00:03:14.209> is<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.450> took<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.810> and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
was doubled what I did is I took it and

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.560 
was doubled what I did is I took it and
I<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.200> took<00:03:15.320> my<00:03:15.380> scale<00:03:15.860> here<00:03:16.190> this<00:03:17.180> was<00:03:17.360> nine

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
I just took my scale here this was nine

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.390 
I just took my scale here this was nine
inches<00:03:17.930> I<00:03:18.079> decided<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:18.590> got<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.799> be<00:03:18.859> 18<00:03:19.040> on

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
inches I decided it's got to be 18 on

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.170 
inches I decided it's got to be 18 on
the<00:03:19.430> bottom<00:03:20.019> doing<00:03:21.019> 9<00:03:21.350> times<00:03:21.560> 2<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.769> 18<00:03:22.180> doubled

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
the bottom doing 9 times 2 is 18 doubled

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.210 
the bottom doing 9 times 2 is 18 doubled
this<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.780> then<00:03:24.170> you<00:03:24.320> just<00:03:24.350> divide<00:03:24.920> it<00:03:24.950> in<00:03:25.190> half

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
this and then you just divide it in half

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.240 
this and then you just divide it in half
into<00:03:26.060> quarters<00:03:26.480> because<00:03:27.290> you've<00:03:27.920> only<00:03:28.070> got<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
into quarters because you've only got a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.880 
into quarters because you've only got a
4<00:03:28.430> by<00:03:28.579> 4<00:03:28.609> grid<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.150> start<00:03:29.359> drawing<00:03:29.510> lines

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
4 by 4 grid and you start drawing lines

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
4 by 4 grid and you start drawing lines
so<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:30.920> take<00:03:31.130> in<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.430> we're<00:03:31.640> going<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.820> work

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
so I take in this we're going to work

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.750 
so I take in this we're going to work
with<00:03:32.060> this<00:03:32.150> one<00:03:32.299> first<00:03:33.489> we'll<00:03:34.489> go<00:03:34.579> on<00:03:34.670> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
with this one first we'll go on the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.190 
with this one first we'll go on the
upper<00:03:35.000> right-hand<00:03:35.180> corner<00:03:35.570> here<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.959> see

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
upper right-hand corner here you see

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.990 
upper right-hand corner here you see
that<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.650> wing<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.579> right<00:03:37.730> wing<00:03:37.910> in

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that this wing here the right wing in

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.670 
that this wing here the right wing in
the<00:03:38.120> drone<00:03:38.420> is<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:39.079> actually<00:03:39.470> using<00:03:40.220> two

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
the drone is is actually using two

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.550 
the drone is is actually using two
pennies<00:03:42.680> crying<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.370> did<00:03:44.299> this<00:03:44.480> right<00:03:44.959> after<00:03:45.320> I

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
pennies crying I did this right after I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.500 
pennies crying I did this right after I
drew<00:03:45.829> my<00:03:45.950> first<00:03:46.190> group<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.430> course<00:03:46.700> you'll<00:03:47.299> see

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
drew my first group of course you'll see

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.949 
drew my first group of course you'll see
that<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:47.840> right<00:03:48.109> wing<00:03:48.320> goes<00:03:48.739> into<00:03:49.130> this<00:03:49.280> upper

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
that the right wing goes into this upper

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.979 
that the right wing goes into this upper
right<00:03:50.959> hand<00:03:50.989> corner<00:03:51.590> and<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:53.450> trailing<00:03:53.750> edge

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
right hand corner and the trailing edge

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.289 
right hand corner and the trailing edge
actually<00:03:54.320> comes<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.100> about<00:03:55.310> the<00:03:55.489> middle<00:03:55.820> of

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
actually comes in about the middle of

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.410 
actually comes in about the middle of
the<00:03:57.079> square<00:03:57.470> what<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.280> grid<00:03:58.549> does<00:03:58.790> is<00:03:59.030> it<00:03:59.180> allows

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
the square what a grid does is it allows

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.360 
the square what a grid does is it allows
you<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.720> pick<00:04:00.200> up<00:04:00.350> lines<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.069> kind<00:04:01.280> of

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
you to pick up lines and you kind of

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.610 
you to pick up lines and you kind of
estimate<00:04:01.760> where<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:02.720> cuts<00:04:02.959> into<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.260> particular

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
estimate where it cuts into a particular

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.400 
estimate where it cuts into a particular
square<00:04:04.100> or<00:04:04.370> rectangle<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.720> like<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.140> forward

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
square or rectangle and like the forward

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.290 
square or rectangle and like the forward
edge<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.799> this<00:04:06.920> week

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
edge of this week

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.670 
edge of this week
and<00:04:07.420> this<00:04:07.780> looks<00:04:07.990> like<00:04:08.110> it's<00:04:08.290> about<00:04:08.320> the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and this looks like it's about the

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.730 
and this looks like it's about the
middle<00:04:09.300> the<00:04:10.300> top<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.840> drone<00:04:11.140> here<00:04:11.500> looked

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
middle the top of the drone here looked

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.530 
middle the top of the drone here looked
like<00:04:11.830> a<00:04:11.950> team<00:04:12.690> right<00:04:13.690> about<00:04:14.700> here<00:04:15.700> transferred

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
like a team right about here transferred

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.630 
like a team right about here transferred
over<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.840> their<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.830> forward<00:04:18.280> edge<00:04:18.430> of<00:04:18.580> the

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.610 
over to their the forward edge of the
drone<00:04:18.970> was<00:04:19.150> really<00:04:19.420> anything<00:04:19.720> about<00:04:19.930> their<00:04:20.320> in

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
drone was really anything about their in

charcoal pencil for you see and then I

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.680 
charcoal pencil for you see and then I
went<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.280> found<00:04:42.520> another<00:04:42.940> example<00:04:43.600> of

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
went and found another example of

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.360 
went and found another example of
another<00:04:43.930> photograph<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:44.650> again<00:04:44.830> took<00:04:45.130> that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
another photograph and again took that

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.140 
another photograph and again took that
Xerox<00:04:45.850> did<00:04:46.300> enlarge<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:47.460> and<00:04:48.460> folded<00:04:49.000> it

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
Xerox did enlarge that and folded it

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.060 
Xerox did enlarge that and folded it
again<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:49.840> a<00:04:49.870> nice<00:04:50.260> working<00:04:50.610> grid<00:04:51.610> 16<00:04:53.070> squares

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
again to a nice working grid 16 squares

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:03.510 
again to a nice working grid 16 squares
four<00:04:54.610> by<00:04:54.790> four<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.740> on<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.760> one<00:05:01.000> we<00:05:02.520> actually

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
four by four and on this one we actually

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.880 
four by four and on this one we actually
tripled<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.450> size<00:05:04.660> on<00:05:04.960> this<00:05:05.140> one<00:05:05.350> so<00:05:05.650> we

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
tripled the size on this one so we

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.190 
tripled the size on this one so we
didn't<00:05:06.100> just<00:05:06.280> double<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.640> we<00:05:06.760> tripled<00:05:07.150> it<00:05:07.270> we

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
didn't just double it we tripled it we

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.500 
didn't just double it we tripled it we
filled<00:05:08.440> up<00:05:08.530> this<00:05:08.710> whole<00:05:08.920> pan<00:05:09.640> almost<00:05:10.020> and

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
filled up this whole pan almost and

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:19.260 
filled up this whole pan almost and
starting<00:05:13.510> with<00:05:13.630> this<00:05:13.810> drawing<00:05:18.120> going<00:05:19.120> into

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
the cover for his goggles they come in

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.380 
the cover for his goggles they come in
up<00:05:35.080> here<00:05:35.410> they're<00:05:36.280> really<00:05:36.580> close<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:37.000> the<00:05:37.120> edge

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
up here they're really close to the edge

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.910 
up here they're really close to the edge
so<00:05:37.930> you<00:05:38.230> know<00:05:38.320> you've<00:05:38.470> got<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.650> pretty<00:05:38.860> good

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:38.920 
so you know you've got a pretty good

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.190 
so you know you've got a pretty good
idea<00:05:39.160> you<00:05:39.220> have<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.430> eyeball<00:05:39.910> everything<00:05:40.200> but

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
idea you have to eyeball everything but

idea you have to eyeball everything but
after<00:05:41.380> you<00:05:41.470> do<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:41.710> few<00:05:41.860> times<00:05:42.070> you<00:05:42.220> start<00:05:42.850> to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
after you do the few times you start to

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.400 
after you do the few times you start to
understand<00:05:43.420> how<00:05:43.510> to<00:05:43.600> lay<00:05:43.780> these<00:05:43.930> things<00:05:44.200> in

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
understand how to lay these things in

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.190 
understand how to lay these things in
the<00:05:45.340> goggles<00:05:45.760> are<00:05:45.880> real<00:05:46.030> close<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:46.600> top<00:05:46.840> of

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
the goggles are real close to the top of

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.550 
the goggles are real close to the top of
this<00:05:47.620> particular<00:05:48.580> square<00:05:48.850> here<00:05:49.290> his<00:05:50.290> eye

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
this particular square here his eye

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.330 
this particular square here his eye
comes<00:05:51.220> in<00:05:51.430> really<00:05:52.470> low<00:05:53.470> and<00:05:53.680> tight<00:05:53.950> to<00:05:54.190> the

corner of this this particular grid I

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.610 
corner of this this particular grid I
had<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.910> draw<00:05:58.090> this<00:05:58.300> shape<00:05:59.169> here<00:05:59.440> at<00:05:59.560> the

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
had to draw this shape here at the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.409 
had to draw this shape here at the
beginning<00:05:59.950> of<00:05:59.980> the<00:06:00.340> forward<00:06:00.910> side<00:06:01.150> of<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.460 
forward end of his sight as a circle
just<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.090> get<00:06:04.270> it<00:06:04.360> drawn<00:06:04.540> in<00:06:04.690> there<00:06:04.840> and<00:06:05.140> then

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:05.470 
just to get it drawn in there and then

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:06.630 
just to get it drawn in there and then
you<00:06:05.590> just<00:06:05.800> start<00:06:05.950> dropping<00:06:06.160> in<00:06:06.490> other

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
you just start dropping in other

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.600 
you just start dropping in other
elements<00:06:06.850> again<00:06:07.780> this<00:06:07.990> is<00:06:08.140> done<00:06:08.290> in<00:06:08.410> pen<00:06:08.740> so

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
elements again this is done in pen so

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.400 
elements again this is done in pen so
you<00:06:09.700> can<00:06:09.880> see<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.180> grids<00:06:10.450> don't<00:06:11.110> have<00:06:11.230> to<00:06:11.320> be

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
you can see the grids don't have to be

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.190 
you can see the grids don't have to be
in<00:06:11.500> should<00:06:12.070> be<00:06:12.160> in<00:06:12.250> linked<00:06:12.430> pencil<00:06:13.080> and<00:06:14.080> you

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
in should be in linked pencil and you

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.630 
in should be in linked pencil and you
shouldn't<00:06:14.500> feel<00:06:14.560> like<00:06:14.980> you<00:06:15.130> have<00:06:15.280> to<00:06:15.400> draw

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
shouldn't feel like you have to draw

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.000 
shouldn't feel like you have to draw
these<00:06:15.930> outside<00:06:16.930> lines<00:06:17.260> either<00:06:17.530> you<00:06:17.860> can

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
these outside lines either you can

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.530 
these outside lines either you can
actually

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
actually

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.260 
actually
just<00:06:18.800> reach<00:06:19.800> those<00:06:20.040> as<00:06:20.220> well<00:06:20.370> and<00:06:20.670> develop

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
just reach those as well and develop

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.030 
just reach those as well and develop
this<00:06:21.420> even<00:06:21.720> more<00:06:21.900> you<00:06:22.110> know<00:06:22.230> finish<00:06:22.770> off<00:06:22.920> the

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
this even more you know finish off the

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.870 
this even more you know finish off the
top<00:06:23.220> of<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.370> helmet

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
top of the helmet

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.450 
top of the helmet
maybe<00:06:24.390> put<00:06:24.630> more<00:06:24.810> of<00:06:24.840> his<00:06:24.990> hand<00:06:25.260> in<00:06:25.440> there<00:06:25.650> more

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
maybe put more of his hand in there more

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.560 
maybe put more of his hand in there more
of<00:06:26.520> his<00:06:26.640> arm<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.880> the<00:06:26.970> bag<00:06:27.120> you<00:06:27.330> can<00:06:27.450> maybe

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
of his arm to the bag you can maybe

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:28.940 
of his arm to the bag you can maybe
develop<00:06:27.930> this<00:06:28.050> hand<00:06:28.260> a<00:06:28.380> little<00:06:28.470> bit<00:06:28.620> more<00:06:28.800> but

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
develop this hand a little bit more but

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.980 
develop this hand a little bit more but
I<00:06:29.040> didn't<00:06:29.430> want<00:06:29.550> to<00:06:29.610> do<00:06:29.700> that<00:06:29.730> I<00:06:30.120> wanted<00:06:30.930> to

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
I didn't want to do that I wanted to

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.350 
I didn't want to do that I wanted to
keep<00:06:31.050> it<00:06:31.230> simple<00:06:31.350> for<00:06:31.560> you<00:06:31.880> and<00:06:32.880> after<00:06:33.210> you

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
keep it simple for you and after you

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.950 
keep it simple for you and after you
erase<00:06:33.750> all<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.230> gridlines

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
erase all the gridlines

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.900 
erase all the gridlines
you<00:06:36.960> know<00:06:37.080> this<00:06:37.260> starts<00:06:37.920> to<00:06:38.010> look<00:06:38.130> pretty

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
you know this starts to look pretty

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.490 
you know this starts to look pretty
close<00:06:39.150> to<00:06:39.420> the<00:06:39.510> rendering<00:06:39.840> of<00:06:39.900> what<00:06:40.080> we've<00:06:40.230> got

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
close to the rendering of what we've got

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.650 
close to the rendering of what we've got
here<00:06:40.770> so<00:06:41.010> you<00:06:41.220> know<00:06:41.340> it<00:06:41.970> allows<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:42.480> to

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
here so you know it allows you to

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.230 
here so you know it allows you to
actually<00:06:43.050> do<00:06:43.260> a<00:06:43.290> more<00:06:44.130> accurate<00:06:44.400> drawing<00:06:44.880> of

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
actually do a more accurate drawing of

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.810 
actually do a more accurate drawing of
something<00:06:45.480> and<00:06:45.900> you<00:06:46.680> you<00:06:47.280> actually<00:06:47.670> learn

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
something and you you actually learn

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.430 
something and you you actually learn
more<00:06:48.000> about<00:06:48.090> perspective<00:06:48.750> and<00:06:48.840> placement<00:06:49.350> and

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 
more about perspective and placement and

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.710 
more about perspective and placement and
you<00:06:49.500> don't<00:06:49.650> have<00:06:49.770> things<00:06:50.180> you<00:06:51.180> know<00:06:51.270> relate<00:06:51.570> to

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
you don't have things you know relate to

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.440 
you don't have things you know relate to
each<00:06:51.810> other<00:06:51.990> you<00:06:52.890> would<00:06:53.010> want<00:06:53.190> to<00:06:53.280> draw<00:06:53.490> you

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
each other you would want to draw you

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.180 
each other you would want to draw you
know<00:06:54.540> the<00:06:54.840> receiver<00:06:55.230> group<00:06:55.410> here<00:06:55.710> maybe<00:06:55.890> too

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
know the receiver group here maybe too

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.490 
know the receiver group here maybe too
deep<00:06:56.490> you<00:06:56.820> know<00:06:57.270> it<00:06:57.390> comes<00:06:57.780> in<00:06:57.990> you've<00:06:58.350> got<00:06:58.470> a

00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 
deep you know it comes in you've got a

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.750 
deep you know it comes in you've got a
pretty<00:06:58.680> good<00:06:58.770> idea<00:06:59.130> of<00:06:59.160> where<00:06:59.340> ever<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.580> ends

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
pretty good idea of where ever the ends

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.040 
pretty good idea of where ever the ends
so<00:07:01.220> everything<00:07:02.220> is<00:07:02.340> relatively<00:07:03.090> accurate<00:07:03.600> you

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
so everything is relatively accurate you

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.210 
so everything is relatively accurate you
wouldn't<00:07:04.230> want<00:07:04.350> to<00:07:04.380> draw<00:07:04.530> the<00:07:04.590> hand<00:07:04.860> like<00:07:05.070> too

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 
wouldn't want to draw the hand like too

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.980 
wouldn't want to draw the hand like too
far<00:07:05.490> forward<00:07:05.760> gave<00:07:06.060> her<00:07:06.150> this<00:07:06.300> hand<00:07:06.600> too<00:07:06.750> big

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
far forward gave her this hand too big

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.660 
far forward gave her this hand too big
and<00:07:07.290> maybe<00:07:07.410> his<00:07:07.590> eyes<00:07:07.740> too<00:07:08.040> small

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:08.670 
and maybe his eyes too small

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:11.660 
and maybe his eyes too small
so<00:07:09.240> what<00:07:09.480> grid<00:07:09.690> actually<00:07:09.930> helps<00:07:10.470> you<00:07:10.670> place

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:11.670 
so what grid actually helps you place

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:16.400 
so what grid actually helps you place
everything<00:07:12.270> very<00:07:13.230> accurately<00:07:13.800> and<00:07:14.270> I<00:07:15.350> knew<00:07:16.350> it

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
everything very accurately and I knew it

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:18.680 
everything very accurately and I knew it
again<00:07:16.620> I<00:07:16.710> use<00:07:16.860> them<00:07:17.040> for<00:07:17.190> my<00:07:17.310> artwork<00:07:17.580> a<00:07:18.180> very

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:18.690 
again I use them for my artwork a very

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:20.540 
again I use them for my artwork a very
very<00:07:19.140> effective<00:07:19.320> tool<00:07:19.650> and<00:07:19.980> I<00:07:20.130> hope<00:07:20.340> you<00:07:20.430> find

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:20.550 
very effective tool and I hope you find

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.110 
very effective tool and I hope you find
it<00:07:20.670> useful<00:07:20.810> thanks<00:07:21.810> very<00:07:21.960> much
