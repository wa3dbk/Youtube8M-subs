 at work on the road or while you scream in this 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 a game that is less autistic 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.910
 versions of candy theft 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.869

 defeat your opponent with 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 combinations of strategy skill and drops 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:47.789
 luck okay basically luck in this 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.950
 games generally have a skill as such 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.020
 dudes 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.739

 generally happen choose from eight 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.090
 perfectly balanced their eyes or 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 hunter and spend hours carefully 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.439
 I choose my deck which reflects 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.150
 how do you play and then when we finally 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.409
 still ready to win the game and copy 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.390
 one of those that really works 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.950
 among that for especially confident in the family you 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.930
 You can take archers capable of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.970
 arena playing field where everyone have 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 the same chances of winning as you are 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.930
 absolutely random chance 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.210
 oh oh well it's worse than some poker 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.229
 john listen soothing 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.229
 repeating music 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.900
 the game is free but if you want to win 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.790
 will have to pay 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.200
 so how long will you credit 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.360
 enough gold to collect 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.770
 decent deck or be good 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.170
 throwing your hard earned money 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.830
 the classic perished curse on 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.930
 scrams 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.100
 max ramos us goblins against the dwarves and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.570
 advanced packs that blizzard 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.980
 released every six months because 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.420
 what why develop myself waiting for him 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.620
 new games when we can make cards 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.350
 that's why we can't get something 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.270
 worth experiencing ups and downs in 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.420
 duels that will leave you accused 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.910
 forces lightened by anger and impossible 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.350
 express your emotions to the opponent and however 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.880
 it will not stop you from spamming 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.520

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.840
 time and enjoyment of bullying 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.760
 when finishing off the enemy 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.040
 just make sure you don't miss it 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 what is to circle the circle which is enough 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.580
 difficult for roasted players and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.990
 easy enough for chery days also 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.490
 which feature is a bunch 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.930
 streamers which butts every effort 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.489
 to help him sharpen the game so 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.530

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.590
