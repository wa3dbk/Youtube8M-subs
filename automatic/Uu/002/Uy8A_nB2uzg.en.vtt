this<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:54.880> not<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.210> big<00:01:56.069> it's<00:01:57.069> like<00:01:57.310> that

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this is not that big it's like that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.819 
this is not that big it's like that
close-up<00:01:59.710> good<00:01:59.859> page<00:02:00.039> so<00:02:00.280> it<00:02:00.399> doesn't<00:02:00.700> die<00:02:01.829> so

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
close-up good page so it doesn't die so

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:04.260 
close-up good page so it doesn't die so
they'll<00:02:03.009> likely<00:02:03.280> to<00:02:03.579> do<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.789> we're<00:02:03.939> just<00:02:03.969> going

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270
