00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:15.059
 Hello and hello I'm martrix the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.130
 exactly with a new video today 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.410
 there is another camp trike 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.439
 This time with the cock II better on the 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 Map warhawk and warhawk is one such 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.949
 I would like a typical debris map 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 my everything is broken all together 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.380
 it burns broken houses and other 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.050
 that is actually quite nice 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.870
 but somehow ghost is almost the only thing 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.969
 Such cards are those typical ones 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.760
 end time cards or this post-war 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.040
 cards or even everything totally destroyed 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.360
 I'm more like the fan of intact 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.090
 cards I say like for example 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.120
 terminal from mw2 or rice where everything else 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.770
 pretty nice but here you look 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
 can make friends but on some 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.129
 cards are a bit too much 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.920
 especially in such a lot of rubble and 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.149
 Ashes are spread all over the map 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.859
 I think that's always a bit 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.199
 confusing and a bit annoying or 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.780
 also a whole building then as a map 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.310
 half crashed I'm not 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.600
 such a fan of it but who knows that it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.049
 my opinion maybe thinks there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.390
 different 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.580
 ok hanni better that is of course one 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 English word and that's the way it is 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.630
 I'm curious how I am 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.740
 translated or I have of course 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.360
 Derived what is hot and hot in German 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.270
 this is a honey instead of making it even 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.790
 an animal that really exists 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.740
 Looks like that and you already can 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.350
 with a little bit of fantasy if you are now 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.640
 a bit more military or 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.650
 cluster designed like 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.560
 then you can already see that 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.780
 honey dax a real beast is so 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.520
 a proper killermaker and then 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.560
 you can also think that the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.000
 weapon the right weapon of the hand 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.350
 Bacher also a pretty good one 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.119
 assault rifle is that it definitely 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.410
 one of the standard storm rifles 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.060
 You can get that right in the 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.250
 you have to supply standard class 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 of course buy later then with 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.920
 an integrated silencer what 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.270
 actually pretty cool is still 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.619
 you do not need any more space for 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.659
 the mufflers a man can then 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.070
 for example, in addition to the underflow what in 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.590
 My eyes are always the most important 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.720
 even take the extended magazine 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.539
 and dollars you have a pretty good one 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.680
 assault rifle does not do that well 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.269
 but distance is possible for year for 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.600
 the melee is pretty well suited 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.110
 So a kind of assault rifle 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.519
 machine gun so not now 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.769
 perfect for the distance though 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.290
 middle range is the part really 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.630
 pretty nice and i can do it on everyone 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 If you want to appeal to everyone then 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.410
 next thing today I wanted one more 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.019
 bit about the different strike 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.360
 so packages speak soldier support 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.910
 and specialists yesterday I have one 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160
 couple of round reign with the soldier 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.829
 played and I have to say that this 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.170
 statements their real somehow 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.180
 actually quite cool but somehow 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.799
 Do not bring it so important for me 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.480
 have almost no match with the 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.220
 Complete your really many kids 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.100
 maybe that's because 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.320
 We only times only play 66 and then 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.900
 only on the external consoles 19 9 and 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.060
 19 9 players are on the way 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.959
 otherwise it really has it 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.239
 was not worth it 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.280
 though the killstreaks are pretty 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.540
 easy to reach but if you want the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.370
 then they actually do that 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.930
 not too many kills then I have the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.910
 gin the shopper none the one himself 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.200
 I can try and control myself 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.459
 really comes kills made because the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.660
 most of the adversaries are even the one 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.190
 had a security guard 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.750
 the problem was not that me 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.340
 somehow honored 1 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.959
 I just do not have all the opponents 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 because they are just somewhere on the 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.500
 you are not the butt of the world 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.030
 The part is not seen and so cool 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.510
 I think it's cool if you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.010
 really 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.230
 on the small map right in the 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.180
 opponent spontaneously shoot but because 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.340
 the cards are so big that's it 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.959
 quite difficult otherwise there is 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.209
 stop this vintage I think 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.629
 very funny for that does not shit that 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:49.069
 the health is not at all 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.599
 So you can indeed recover again 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.060
 play pretty well with it though if you can 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.440
 once a bit much harms deadline 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.209
 it's actually already was over 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.680
 then it does not take long anymore and you 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.379
 is dead right now that's why I think so too 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.760
 a little bit stupid also other conclusion 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.950
 their there is this loki there you can 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.329
 a lot of stuff under shooting is quite 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.670
 but I have also cool so far 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.159
 not really long tried a two 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.159
 Maybe he and I at least what I 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:15.409
 I have already mentioned that the dog 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.989
 the companion is very cute 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.639
 but I find him totally annoying so me 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.100
 just find that and right round 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.660
 sons in my eyes who use those 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.130
 it just like the hunter killer 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.289
 because the hand keel has not synonymous 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.789
 ate many deals and you have 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.380
 the thrown and then a kill 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.330
 most of the time it's easy 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.860
 one disturbs and then later still makes the 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.960
 hunter killer stop so you click 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.280
 surfaces broke and exactly the same is 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.860
 with this companion and also because 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.020
 he actually does a lot of kills 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.410
 almost never sometimes but actually 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.130
 never 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.590
 he is just good for such a dragon 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.389
 is my son i am already running 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.370
 the whistle had someone and I shoot 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.349
 on the opponent and the dog of the opponent 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.120
 and then stopped me and it looks like that 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.770
 mostly from and whatever me 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.539
 The dog is really upset when 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.729
 you just call him directly in front of it 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.039
 and in black parts it was always 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.100
 still so he then that dogs so 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.840
 many rounds 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.060
 dogs always come through this one but 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.200
 no, that could easily speak if you 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.880
 No one shoots straight at you 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.110
 just trigger so bite yourself 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.960
 in the ass you are dead 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.800
 which actually pretty much me 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.320
 That's why I would provoke everyone 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.090
 case anyone these statements its ans 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.370
 heart set there are certainly cooler 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.490
 things in my eyes and otherwise to 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.080
 I have to say support package now 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.120
 that I actually do not have much people 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.370
 they play around with it, there's coal 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.980
 threatening there is such a world without the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.930
 every ten seconds the opponents are always short 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:38.640
 show and also 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.380
 different types like me that we 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.140
 tender combs find it a different matter 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.700
 at very funny I do not know if you 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.980
 have heard the gameplay but if 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.020
 The speaker once said the network has come 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.460
 outside is always so I said then 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.130
 always understand it so I always understand 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.660
 saffron saffron was placed 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.980
 I can here as a small sound 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.240
 track superior so I 'm pretty 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.860
 crass I think because that's always on 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.140
 this pokémon so juice the 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.030
 development of happy then could 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.130
 you already feel that it in cod 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.720
 So Pokemon is there you have to do that 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.090
 really make it clear in my mind 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.070
 I think Saffron has always been placed 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.590
 does not just say that one word 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.630
 but it's called satcom but because I 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.430
 I'm not anymore 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.620
 right because sense and already totally 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.570
 crazy because of call of duty goes to me 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.670
 At the moment it's still a lot of stuff 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.890
 fun of course, I put on me too 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.950
 So just in the late evening from 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.150
 midnight I fail me and there 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.440
 I do not play that well either 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.820
 I do not get it either 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.940
 on the mouth or wonder then why 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:41.100
 died here and there and there 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.390
 It was such a few things in any case 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.400
 it was actually with the video that was 

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:45.540
 today again a camp strike tomorrow 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.320
 then it will probably come back 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.060
 new video 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.530
 I hope, of course , fell through it 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.750
 if you liked it you can 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.460
 of course leave a rating there and 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.960
 rather people that's it until the next one 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.960
 times people look and adiós
