00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
time doing these and I thought it was

time doing these and I thought it was
gonna<00:00:56.589> be<00:00:56.769> a<00:00:56.800> little<00:00:57.070> easier<00:00:57.489> than<00:00:57.550> it<00:00:57.760> was<00:00:57.970> I

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
gonna be a little easier than it was I

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.540 
gonna be a little easier than it was I
got<00:00:58.449> better<00:00:58.720> once<00:00:59.079> I<00:00:59.260> you<00:01:00.010> know<00:01:00.129> went<00:01:00.370> around

got better once I you know went around
my<00:01:00.790> head<00:01:01.059> but<00:01:01.629> so<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.559> took<00:01:02.650> this<00:01:02.949> one<00:01:03.129> down<00:01:03.309> to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
my head but so I took this one down to

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.770 
my head but so I took this one down to
kind<00:01:03.850> of<00:01:03.909> show<00:01:04.150> you<00:01:04.770> how<00:01:05.770> I<00:01:05.830> did<00:01:06.040> them<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.850> twist

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
kind of show you how I did them I twist

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.050 
kind of show you how I did them I twist
it<00:01:07.960> first<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.740> then<00:01:08.950> I<00:01:09.010> kind<00:01:09.460> of<00:01:09.520> started<00:01:09.820> off

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
it first and then I kind of started off

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.820 
it first and then I kind of started off
by<00:01:10.330> using<00:01:10.540> my<00:01:10.810> finger<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.520> wrap<00:01:12.760> around<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
by using my finger to wrap around and

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
by using my finger to wrap around and
then<00:01:15.369> I'm<00:01:15.520> just<00:01:15.729> kind<00:01:15.939> of<00:01:16.060> tucking<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.630> behind

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.210 

the<00:01:19.960> knot<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:23.110> I<00:01:23.380> said<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.890> don't<00:01:23.950> know<00:01:24.070> why

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
the knot and as I said I don't know why

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.010 
the knot and as I said I don't know why
the<00:01:24.280> sides<00:01:24.700> harder<00:01:25.299> for<00:01:25.420> me<00:01:25.540> to<00:01:25.630> do<00:01:25.780> than<00:01:25.960> the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
the sides harder for me to do than the

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.609 
the sides harder for me to do than the
back

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
back

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.819 
back
I<00:01:26.650> guess<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.159> angle<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.630> I've<00:01:29.470> got<00:01:29.680> some

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
I guess the angle so I've got some

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.319 
I guess the angle so I've got some
practicing<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.369> do<00:01:30.490> I<00:01:30.520> need<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.820> watch<00:01:31.000> Shari

okay<00:03:22.269> guys<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.720> finished<00:03:22.959> separating<00:03:23.709> all<00:03:24.069> the

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:24.099 
okay guys I finished separating all the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:27.330 
okay guys I finished separating all the
curls<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.810> put<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:26.859> took<00:03:26.980> sort<00:03:27.250> of

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
curls and I put it up and took sort of

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.000 
curls and I put it up and took sort of
like<00:03:27.519> a<00:03:27.549> faux<00:03:27.879> hawk<00:03:28.090> style<00:03:28.659> when<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.620> first<00:03:29.859> took

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
like a faux hawk style when I first took

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.410 
like a faux hawk style when I first took
the<00:03:30.189> curls<00:03:30.489> down<00:03:30.670> I<00:03:30.730> was<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.060> little<00:03:31.269> concerned

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
the curls down I was a little concerned

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.199 
the curls down I was a little concerned
because<00:03:31.750> they<00:03:32.079> were<00:03:32.139> real<00:03:32.470> tight<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.310> I

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
because they were real tight and I

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.940 
because they were real tight and I
hadn't<00:03:34.629> separated<00:03:34.840> them<00:03:35.260> enough<00:03:35.560> and<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.799> was

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
hadn't separated them enough and I was

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.199 
hadn't separated them enough and I was
looking<00:03:36.189> like<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.670> Grandma<00:03:37.000> Moses<00:03:37.480> thing<00:03:37.720> and

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
looking like the Grandma Moses thing and

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.789 
looking like the Grandma Moses thing and
but<00:03:40.209> then<00:03:40.359> once<00:03:40.569> I<00:03:40.660> started<00:03:40.690> separating<00:03:41.590> and

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
but then once I started separating and

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.920 
but then once I started separating and
making<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.819> fuller<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.480> know<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.629> liked<00:03:43.810> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
making it fuller you know I liked the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.750 
making it fuller you know I liked the
result<00:03:44.260> better<00:03:44.470> I<00:03:44.769> definitely<00:03:45.340> have<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.519> work

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
result better I definitely have to work

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.479 
result better I definitely have to work
on<00:03:45.940> my<00:03:46.060> technique<00:03:46.299> because<00:03:47.109> I<00:03:47.560> noticed<00:03:48.310> some

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
on my technique because I noticed some

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.460 
on my technique because I noticed some
of<00:03:48.579> my<00:03:48.669> ends<00:03:49.120> are<00:03:49.209> not<00:03:49.389> doing<00:03:50.230> what<00:03:50.349> they

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
of my ends are not doing what they

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.619 
of my ends are not doing what they
should<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:50.829> doing<00:03:50.859> it<00:03:51.190> kind<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.459> unruly<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.239> I

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629
