00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
that maybe you can do that if you

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
that maybe you can do that if you
practice<00:01:47.159> your<00:01:47.460> practice<00:01:48.119> does<00:01:48.270> make<00:01:48.299> perfect

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
practice your practice does make perfect

other<00:01:50.340> eye<00:01:50.490> where<00:01:51.090> I'm<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.810> my

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
other eye where I'm going to just do my

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020 
other eye where I'm going to just do my
trick<00:01:52.079> where<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.680> use<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> cold<00:01:53.280> pencil<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.000> just

dot in the shape or by using a flat
brush<00:01:58.259> on<00:01:58.530> shadow<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> first<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.420> I

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
I've seen where the line should be I'm

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.230 
I've seen where the line should be I'm
just<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.780> one<00:02:07.020> line

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
into the I bit more so by following the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.000 
into the I bit more so by following the
line<00:02:16.900> on<00:02:17.110> just<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:18.640> into<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.360> lash<00:02:19.570> line

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
a flat brush and this can also double up

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.000 
a flat brush and this can also double up
as<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:02.020> brow<00:03:02.380> brush<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:03.070> money<00:03:03.940> well<00:03:04.180> spent<00:03:04.210> and

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.260 
where it should be and then with this I
just<00:03:27.540> dot<00:03:29.190> very<00:03:30.190> lightly

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.500 

I'm<00:03:35.840> going<00:03:36.020> to<00:03:36.080> dot<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.350> line<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:41.180> as<00:03:41.210> you<00:03:41.360> can

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
I'm going to dot the line so as you can

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.510 
I'm going to dot the line so as you can
see<00:03:41.810> I've<00:03:42.020> dotted<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.530> lightly<00:03:42.770> now<00:03:43.280> that<00:03:43.400> is

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
see I've dotted it lightly now that is

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.740 
see I've dotted it lightly now that is
actually<00:03:43.850> a<00:03:43.880> lovely<00:03:44.210> look<00:03:44.390> if<00:03:44.540> you<00:03:44.600> just

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750
