00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
would take a look at an application

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.480 
would take a look at an application
called<00:00:09.480> impasse<00:00:10.019> which<00:00:10.830> which<00:00:11.250> is

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
called impasse which which is

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.720 
called impasse which which is
essentially<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> password<00:00:13.019> keeping

obviously you'll have to put in a
password<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.539> then<00:00:18.750> all<00:00:19.410> create<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> password

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
password and then all create a password

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.029 
password and then all create a password
then<00:00:20.520> once<00:00:21.390> you<00:00:22.260> open<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.500> app<00:00:22.560> you'll<00:00:22.890> need

interesting<00:01:50.280> with<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.790> which<00:01:50.939> is<00:01:50.970> one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
interesting with this one which is one

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.240 
interesting with this one which is one
of<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.509> reasons<00:01:51.750> i<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.979> can<00:01:53.009> jump

of the reasons i like it is we can jump

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.450 
of the reasons i like it is we can jump
into<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.520> settings<00:01:54.560> we<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.680> tweak<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> the
