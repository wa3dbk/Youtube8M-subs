order to get a good sound I've got an

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.400 
order to get a good sound I've got an
electric<00:02:15.330> guitar<00:02:15.420> here<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.930> me<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.290> we'll

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
electric guitar here with me so we'll

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.809 
electric guitar here with me so we'll
come<00:02:16.590> back<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.920> exploring<00:02:17.340> this<00:02:17.489> feature<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
come back to exploring this feature a

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.809 
come back to exploring this feature a
little<00:02:17.940> bit<00:02:18.800> another<00:02:19.800> innovative<00:02:20.220> feature<00:02:20.370> on

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
little bit another innovative feature on

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.910 
little bit another innovative feature on
the<00:02:20.910> acoustics<00:02:21.330> onic<00:02:21.599> 150<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.739> has<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the acoustics onic 150 is that it has a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.220 
the acoustics onic 150 is that it has a
USB<00:02:23.129> port<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.360> can<00:02:24.629> be<00:02:24.750> used<00:02:24.930> for<00:02:25.140> direct

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
USB port this can be used for direct

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.620 
USB port this can be used for direct
recording<00:02:25.709> to<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.040> computer<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:26.670> fender<00:02:27.330> also

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
recording to a computer and fender also

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.660 
recording to a computer and fender also
says<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.230> may<00:02:28.380> offer<00:02:28.680> firmware<00:02:29.280> upgrades

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
says that it may offer firmware upgrades

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
says that it may offer firmware upgrades
in<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.240> future<00:02:30.660> which<00:02:30.840> can<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.140> be<00:02:31.200> loaded

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
in the future which can then be loaded

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.100 
in the future which can then be loaded
into<00:02:31.800> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
into the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.830 
into the
amp<00:02:32.260> with<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.590> port<00:02:33.240> before<00:02:34.240> we<00:02:34.540> listen<00:02:34.630> to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
amp with this port before we listen to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.090 
amp with this port before we listen to
the<00:02:34.990> amp<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.380> should<00:02:35.620> say<00:02:35.770> that<00:02:35.980> it's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
the amp I should say that it's

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.680 
the amp I should say that it's
surprisingly<00:02:36.640> lightweight<00:02:37.120> for<00:02:37.390> its<00:02:37.510> size

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
surprisingly lightweight for its size

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.230 
surprisingly lightweight for its size
with<00:02:38.020> only<00:02:38.200> about<00:02:38.350> 22<00:02:38.740> and<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:39.010> half<00:02:39.160> pounds<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
with only about 22 and a half pounds and

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.330 
with only about 22 and a half pounds and
then<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.420> has<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> street<00:02:40.870> price<00:02:41.170> of<00:02:41.320> about<00:02:41.470> $500

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
then it has a street price of about $500

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.080 
then it has a street price of about $500
let's<00:02:43.120> have<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.330> listen<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:45.580> guitar<00:02:45.880> half

here's a Yamaha with a stock
under-saddle<00:02:48.010> pickup<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.700> I'm<00:02:48.790> going<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
under-saddle pickup and I'm going to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.410 
under-saddle pickup and I'm going to
start<00:02:49.330> out<00:02:49.480> with<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.780> amps<00:02:50.110> voicing<00:02:50.590> function

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
start out with the amps voicing function

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.570 
start out with the amps voicing function
set<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.170> M<00:02:53.320> only<00:02:53.830> in<00:02:53.950> other<00:02:54.070> words<00:02:54.310> there's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
set to the M only in other words there's

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.580 
set to the M only in other words there's
no<00:02:54.940> modeling<00:02:55.420> going<00:02:55.660> on<00:02:55.780> no<00:02:55.930> voicing<00:02:56.410> right

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
no modeling going on no voicing right

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.840 
no modeling going on no voicing right
now<00:02:56.770> which<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.040> also<00:02:57.190> what<00:02:57.370> we<00:02:57.460> heard<00:02:57.610> in<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
now which is also what we heard in the

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:09.920 
now which is also what we heard in the
intro<00:02:58.150> so<00:02:58.330> let's<00:02:58.510> hear<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:58.720> again

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.900 

I'm<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.070> go<00:03:11.190> through<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.460> couple<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
I'm going to go through a couple of the

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.750 
I'm going to go through a couple of the
voicing<00:03:12.440> options<00:03:13.440> here<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:14.580> can

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
voicing options here now you can

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.970 
voicing options here now you can
basically<00:03:15.330> go<00:03:15.690> from<00:03:15.960> parlour<00:03:16.560> all<00:03:16.740> the<00:03:16.830> way<00:03:16.920> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
basically go from parlour all the way to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.280 
basically go from parlour all the way to
a<00:03:17.130> jumbo<00:03:17.550> size<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.060> if<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.240> set<00:03:18.450> this<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.810> parlor

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
a jumbo size so if we set this to parlor

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
a jumbo size so if we set this to parlor
sound<00:03:19.680> policies<00:03:20.520> guitar<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.060> sound<00:03:21.300> like<00:03:21.450> this

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:44.110 

when<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.340> switch<00:03:32.520> it<00:03:32.760> over<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:32.970> dreadnought

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.970 

and<00:03:45.120> finally<00:03:46.020> all<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:46.350> over<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.680> jumbo

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
and finally all the way over to jumbo

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.800 
and finally all the way over to jumbo
and<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.280> can<00:03:47.430> actually<00:03:47.580> get<00:03:47.970> some<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.450> between

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
and you can actually get some in between

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.840 
and you can actually get some in between
settings<00:03:49.290> -<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> sort<00:03:49.740> of<00:03:49.890> goes<00:03:50.070> from<00:03:50.400> one<00:03:50.640> to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
settings - it sort of goes from one to

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.060 
settings - it sort of goes from one to
the<00:03:50.880> other<00:03:51.140> with<00:03:52.140> several<00:03:52.560> in-between

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
the other with several in-between

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.620 
the other with several in-between
settings<00:03:53.520> so<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.760> can<00:03:53.910> imagine<00:03:54.120> that<00:03:54.450> there's

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
settings so you can imagine that there's

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.060 
settings so you can imagine that there's
a<00:03:54.690> lot<00:03:54.780> of<00:03:54.840> different<00:03:55.290> sounds<00:03:55.470> so<00:03:55.740> here's<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
a lot of different sounds so here's the

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:10.520 
a lot of different sounds so here's the
jumbo<00:03:56.430> setting

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.470 

and<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:12.069> you<00:04:12.220> might<00:04:12.370> expect<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.939> jumbo<00:04:13.299> one

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
and as you might expect the jumbo one

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.229 
and as you might expect the jumbo one
was<00:04:13.689> sort<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.989> a<00:04:14.110> fullest<00:04:14.650> most<00:04:15.310> basis<00:04:15.879> owning

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
was sort of a fullest most basis owning

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.749 
was sort of a fullest most basis owning
one<00:04:16.419> just<00:04:17.049> as<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.530> real<00:04:17.769> guitars<00:04:18.160> would<00:04:18.609> be

00:04:18.749 --> 00:04:18.759 
one just as the real guitars would be

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.400 
one just as the real guitars would be
played<00:04:19.030> acoustic<00:04:19.299> from<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.900> parlor<00:04:20.259> to<00:04:20.380> a

the<00:05:18.700> dedicated<00:05:19.090> electric<00:05:19.600> voicings<00:05:20.050> I'm

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
the dedicated electric voicings I'm

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.590 
the dedicated electric voicings I'm
going<00:05:21.010> to<00:05:21.100> start<00:05:21.310> out<00:05:21.430> with<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.670> black<00:05:22.330> face

going to start out with a black face

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.780 
going to start out with a black face
voicing<00:05:23.230> which<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.470> obviously<00:05:23.860> modeled<00:05:24.670> after

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
voicing which is obviously modeled after

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:36.690 
voicing which is obviously modeled after
a<00:05:24.970> vintage<00:05:25.330> Fender<00:05:25.720> amp<00:05:25.750> so<00:05:26.170> here<00:05:26.320> we<00:05:26.380> go<00:05:35.700> but

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
a vintage Fender amp so here we go but

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.370 
a vintage Fender amp so here we go but
you<00:05:37.150> can<00:05:37.180> also<00:05:37.480> go<00:05:37.780> through<00:05:37.810> a<00:05:38.080> little<00:05:38.350> more

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
you can also go through a little more

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:49.350 
you can also go through a little more
gain<00:05:39.480> you<00:05:40.480> can<00:05:40.600> go<00:05:40.720> to<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.900> tweed<00:05:41.170> setting<00:05:47.310> or<00:05:48.360> of

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
gain you can go to a tweed setting or of

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.440 
gain you can go to a tweed setting or of
course<00:05:49.510> it<00:05:49.720> has<00:05:49.900> a<00:05:50.790> British<00:05:51.790> voicing<00:05:52.330> which

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
course it has a British voicing which

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.240 
course it has a British voicing which
I'm<00:05:52.600> guessing<00:05:52.780> is<00:05:52.990> modeled<00:05:53.560> after<00:05:53.680> Marshall

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
I'm guessing is modeled after Marshall

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:05.950 
I'm guessing is modeled after Marshall
and<00:05:54.370> it<00:05:54.460> certainly
