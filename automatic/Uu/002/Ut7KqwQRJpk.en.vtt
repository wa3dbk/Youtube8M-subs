whatever the Corvette c7.r
okay<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:29.939> think<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.750> arm<00:00:31.019> means<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
okay and I think the arm means it's a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.670 
okay and I think the arm means it's a
race<00:00:31.859> version<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.200> c7<00:00:34.200> that's<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> race

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
