00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.060
Whoops!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.940
Here comes Mignon!

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.500
Hey! Aren´t you the guy who called me kid?

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.260
If you want to treated like a proper lady... 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.160
perhaps you should sort out your behavior, missy.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.680
You´re treating me like a kid again!

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.340
Which is stronger...

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.860
your psychic powers or Mignon's magic?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.420
Let´s find out!

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.920
What do you want me to say?

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.640
What awesome magic!

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.200
How did you do that?!

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.920
This cannot be learnt...

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.140
especially...

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.380
by humans.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.380
Enter Mignon Beart!

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.660
What a freak show!

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.140
This girl makes me so mad!

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.260
Finally, the time has come.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.560
The time of battle with the clown,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.500
the time that is inevitable in order for me to stand out and shine more than anyone else.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.780
I am not a clown!

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.380
By the way, what IS this battle anyway?

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.080
This is almost like a battle for the championship on who is the weirdest!

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.240
Right?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.260
The world's strongest and most conspicuous girl is, 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.740
Mignon-chan!

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.780
Two sisters do battle in between good and evil.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.220
What an idiot.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.480
Now do you get it?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.940
Your big sister rules!

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.360
What? Mignon wins?

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.380
Mignon did it! Mignon did it!

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.420
Tweedly-deedly-dee!

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.660
Mignon´s one tough cookie!

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:08.240
Fire!

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.440
Bye-bye!

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.200
Broken down!

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.640
1, 2 and go!
