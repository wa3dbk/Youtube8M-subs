send<00:00:50.450> provides<00:00:50.870> very<00:00:51.200> less<00:00:51.500> grip<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:53.000> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
send provides very less grip so the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.780 
send provides very less grip so the
motor<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:53.960> working<00:00:54.320> all<00:00:54.470> the<00:00:54.620> time<00:00:57.129> on<00:00:58.129> road<00:00:58.610> we
