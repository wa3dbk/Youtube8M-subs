00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.739

 So to cook our cookie 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.800
 easy and no cod error 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.740
 We're going to need a pound of 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.610
 cod cut into strips a kilo of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.159
 potatoes 4 tablespoons olive oil 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.550

 large chopped three eggs beaten one 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.659
 cup chopped parsley flour 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.820
 August 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.119
 the whole room rosso here we are 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.490
 using lemon with herbs a menacing 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.800
 If you do not have the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.710
 menacing and frying oil 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.259
 let's start the first stage of the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.380
 preparing the cookie is to save the 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.750
 cod and it starts the day before 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.490
 so we're going to wash the fish for 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.490
 remove all saved 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.960
 It's washed up now, we'll stop. 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.880
 sauce in the water for about 18 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.940
 hours changing the water every three 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 hours touch the next day to the possession of 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.320
 salute the cod 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.680
 We're going to cook the potatoes until 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.860
 rate balls after that we 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.310
 Let's knead using or threatening to 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:33.710
 potatoes or the fork and we will book 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.710
 because it's part of the mass okay 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.000
 in a pan we'll put the olive oil 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 the garlic and the onion and we will stay until 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.160
 look golden after we 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.040
 we put the battalion that already 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.370
 I've already got it out of the water then we 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.380
 Let's put and mix until they 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.440
 be very golden, you can 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.750
 that the simple tinkering has already left the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.200
 whole cod that integrated the teeth 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.870
 Now, that's all. 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 mix we put a cod will already have 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.600
 potato genius 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.760
 the three eggs beaten the flour 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.760
 the parsley and the seasonings 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.230
 ready our mass now just do 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.129
 the cookies in the formative you 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.019
 to prefer 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.599
 I'm doing in that small format 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.209
 which I think is a great request for 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.459
 serve as impetigo in the glass or until 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.680
 even to leave you frozen in your 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.629
 freezer to always have to serve a 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.629
 visit to make a snack 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.780
 but they got so yielded 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.760
 approximately four forms of this 7580 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.430
 cookies will depend on the size you 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.810
 you do in that format cocktail gave 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.289
 75 balls and now to get it right it's just 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.579
 put the oil in the frying pan place 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:24.660
 approximately two fingers above the 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:27.030
 cookie height leaves oil 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.240
 happening when you look, you already have people 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.169
 you put the donut balls and 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.169
 is not positive 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.970
 This was the end result. 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.919
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.169
