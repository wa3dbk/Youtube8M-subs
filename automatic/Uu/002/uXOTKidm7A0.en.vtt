Ethiopian system of multiplication
a<00:00:12.690> bizarre<00:00:13.349> system<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:14.130> ignores<00:00:14.519> some

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
a bizarre system that ignores some

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
fractions a world where you could throw

Ethiopian system is so strange that it's
used<00:01:20.040> more<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> magic<00:01:20.850> trick<00:01:21.200> to<00:01:22.200> multiply

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649

with the right answer but it works every

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.990 
with the right answer but it works every

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
multiplication we multiply 31 first by 5

together<00:02:22.430> in<00:02:23.430> Ethiopia<00:02:24.060> instead<00:02:24.840> of
