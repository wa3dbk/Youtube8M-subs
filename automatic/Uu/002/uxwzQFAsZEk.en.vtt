gamer

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:16.349 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.550 

I've<00:00:17.160> played<00:00:17.970> Starcraft<00:00:18.300> ever<00:00:18.869> since<00:00:19.169> I<00:00:19.289> was

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
I've played Starcraft ever since I was

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.589 
I've played Starcraft ever since I was
in<00:00:19.769> junior<00:00:20.009> high<00:00:20.160> when<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:21.089> first<00:00:21.239> came<00:00:21.419> out

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:21.599 
in junior high when it first came out

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:24.470 
in junior high when it first came out
and<00:00:22.160> Protoss<00:00:23.160> was<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.669> only<00:00:24.029> race<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.419> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
and Protoss was the only race that I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.919 
and Protoss was the only race that I
knew

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
knew

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.080 
knew
so<00:00:25.349> when<00:00:25.679> Starcraft<00:00:26.279> 2<00:00:26.429> came<00:00:26.609> out<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:27.059> just

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
so when Starcraft 2 came out it just

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.470 
so when Starcraft 2 came out it just
automatically<00:00:27.929> B<00:00:28.829> became<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> choice<00:00:30.149> that<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
automatically B became the choice that I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.790 
automatically B became the choice that I
made<00:00:31.079> to<00:00:31.589> use<00:00:32.579> which<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.269> the<00:00:33.420> race<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.409> I<00:00:34.440> am

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
made to use which is the race that I am

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.960 
made to use which is the race that I am
pretty<00:00:35.250> good<00:00:35.460> at<00:00:35.579> right<00:00:35.850> now

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.280 

I<00:00:39.030> started<00:00:39.600> playing<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.840> lot<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:42.080> RPG<00:00:43.080> games

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
2 and of course I played a lot of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.470 
2 and of course I played a lot of
SimCity<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.900> a<00:00:52.470> lot<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.710> other<00:00:53.070> RPG<00:00:53.640> games<00:00:53.850> so

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
SimCity and a lot of other RPG games so

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.530 
SimCity and a lot of other RPG games so
I<00:00:54.930> jump<00:00:55.710> back<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.070> forth<00:00:56.130> from<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.670> RTS<00:00:57.510> and

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
I jump back and forth from our RTS and

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.130 
I jump back and forth from our RTS and
RPG<00:00:58.110> games<00:00:58.850> but<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.880> find<00:01:00.390> real-time<00:01:00.900> strategy

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
RPG games but I find real-time strategy

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.430 
RPG games but I find real-time strategy
games<00:01:01.470> a<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:02.220> more<00:01:02.400> challenging<00:01:02.970> just<00:01:03.239> as<00:01:03.440> you

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
games a bit more challenging just as you

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.770 
games a bit more challenging just as you
would<00:01:05.190> actually<00:01:05.580> want<00:01:05.730> to<00:01:05.820> cook<00:01:06.000> up<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.420> own

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
would actually want to cook up your own

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.980 
would actually want to cook up your own
strategy<00:01:07.400> instead<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.520> trying<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.480> use<00:01:09.750> other

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
strategy instead of trying to use other

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.530 
strategy instead of trying to use other
people's<00:01:10.350> strategies<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.119> invent

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
people's strategies you when you invent

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
people's strategies you when you invent
a<00:01:12.750> new<00:01:12.990> play<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.920> actually<00:01:14.160> get<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
a new play and you actually get to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.859 
a new play and you actually get to
execute<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.450> with<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.710> time<00:01:17.010> of<00:01:17.369> attack

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
execute it with the right time of attack

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.320 
execute it with the right time of attack
it<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.170> gives<00:01:19.440> you<00:01:21.260> this<00:01:22.260> really<00:01:23.330> this

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it really gives you this really this

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.749 
it really gives you this really this
pride<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> show<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.550> to

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pride and then you get to show off to

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.230 
pride and then you get to show off to
your<00:01:26.880> friends

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.190 

so<00:01:30.570> when<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.900> came<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.820> starcraft<00:01:32.820> 2<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.840> she

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
so when it came out starcraft 2 as she

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.289 
so when it came out starcraft 2 as she
just<00:01:34.440> started<00:01:34.710> playing<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.159> just<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.090> three

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
just started playing on just on my three

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.000 
just started playing on just on my three
times<00:01:36.540> but<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.380> i<00:01:37.560> didn't<00:01:38.070> actually<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.850> to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
times but then i didn't actually get to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.840 
times but then i didn't actually get to
become<00:01:41.010> that<00:01:41.310> into<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.729> until<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:42.330> had<00:01:43.850> reached

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
become that into it until i had reached

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.260 
become that into it until i had reached
four<00:01:45.360> diamonds<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.860> when<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.670> brothers

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
four diamonds and then when my brothers

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050 
four diamonds and then when my brothers
actually<00:01:48.720> challenged<00:01:49.110> me<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.500> play<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.700> be

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
actually challenged me to play to be

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.870 
actually challenged me to play to be
four<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:52.229> his<00:01:52.470> friends<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.520> beat

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
four with his friends and actually beat

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.760 
four with his friends and actually beat
them<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.360> that's<00:01:54.840> when<00:01:55.080> i<00:01:55.110> thought<00:01:55.229> oh<00:01:55.740> i

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
them and that's when i thought oh i

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.609 
them and that's when i thought oh i
might<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:57.000> quite<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:57.960> game<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.259> if

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
might be quite good at this game and if

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.650 
might be quite good at this game and if
i<00:01:58.770> did<00:01:59.399> engage<00:01:59.700> more<00:02:00.030> time<00:02:00.240> on<00:02:00.360> it<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
i did engage more time on it then I

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.880 
i did engage more time on it then I
might<00:02:04.610> make<00:02:05.610> career<00:02:05.970> out<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.440 

so<00:02:10.690> me<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.750> my<00:02:11.840> friends<00:02:12.200> actually<00:02:12.350> would<00:02:12.890> like

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so me and my friends actually would like

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.070 
so me and my friends actually would like
Taiwan<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.600> have<00:02:14.750> more<00:02:17.050> opportunities<00:02:18.050> for

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
Taiwan to have more opportunities for
