00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
all the way to the edge that's when

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.790 
all the way to the edge that's when
you'll<00:01:49.550> get<00:01:49.759> all<00:01:49.880> the<00:01:50.090> all<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:50.720> grooves<00:01:51.050> I

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.719 

should<00:01:54.800> do<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.040> I<00:01:55.479> like<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.509> use<00:01:56.869> like<00:02:00.729> oak

clip<00:02:10.450> basic<00:02:11.450> cut<00:02:11.630> up<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:11.959> just<00:02:12.470> rigid<00:02:12.650> enough

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
clip basic cut up it's just rigid enough

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.920 
clip basic cut up it's just rigid enough
to<00:02:13.459> hold<00:02:14.420> its<00:02:14.690> form<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.820> it's<00:02:17.030> just<00:02:17.390> flexible

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
to hold its form but it's just flexible

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.660

little<00:02:25.010> bit<00:02:25.360> flexibility<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.390> found<00:02:28.150> basically

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
little bit flexibility I found basically

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.660 
little bit flexibility I found basically
I'm<00:02:29.209> doing<00:02:29.269> here<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:30.310> running<00:02:31.310> it<00:02:31.459> all

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.860 

and<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.690> one<00:03:20.870> looks<00:03:21.050> like<00:03:25.420> now<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.450> sit<00:03:26.750> down

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and this one looks like now I sit down

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.710 
and this one looks like now I sit down
to<00:03:27.019> dry<00:03:27.319> it<00:03:27.830> should<00:03:28.340> take<00:03:28.489> about<00:03:28.640> 8<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.390> 16

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
to dry it should take about 8 to 16

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.440 
to dry it should take about 8 to 16
hours<00:03:30.110> for<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.409> to<00:03:30.440> dry<00:03:30.530> completely<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.549> I'll

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
hours for it to dry completely and I'll

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.149 
hours for it to dry completely and I'll
show<00:03:32.720> you<00:03:32.780> what<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.049> looks<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.440> after<00:03:34.010> its

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:34.159

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
dried so while we're weighing on that

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.000 
dried so while we're weighing on that
when<00:03:38.060> we<00:03:38.180> do<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.360> cleaning<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.459> vintage<00:03:40.459> 78
