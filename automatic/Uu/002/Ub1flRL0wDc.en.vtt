00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.850
 we are in aragon north of spain in this factory 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.380
 not that we manufacture products derived from mali products intended 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.730
 for human consumption 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.380
 upstream the director's job and therefore to select maize 46 without this 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.010
 folder 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.270
 but in this region half of the surface in France elite the task 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.529
 proves more and more difficult 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.680
 and in the showroom of the drugstore ap ap starting with 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.890
 problems with foreign exchange are totally encircled by GMOs according to 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.230
 the direction and intensity of the wind according to the flowering periods 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.840
 there are songs for which even by making sanitary cords do not 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.630
 can not separate the two production teams in the matter at once 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.220
 relative to 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.460
 in aragon of 80% organic or conventional corn is today condemned 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.530
 more and more organic farmers 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.980
 exceeds the tolerance threshold and they are forced to sell their corn on 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.180
 the ogm notepad market in the hand of a man in fall of bike and I 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.890
 know well I know people who want to buy corn corn but I 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.979
 do not do it because they could be contaminated shoes 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490
 for the knowledge 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.120
 so we can still do antonio it's up to us to show he's fighting 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.340
 against pests in a natural way with this type of trap because if the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.579
 Aragonese farmers are increasingly inclined to grow ogm 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:25.869
 these arguments to fight against the pests and to gain profitability 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.630
 a little unhealthy 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.530
 according to the roger lemerre gm to subscribe to soul years in the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 elah valley bravo to my years to come we are talking about a departure 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.229
 an argument that contradicts crime who believe themselves of callaspo quality has made 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.630
 part of a study group on GMOs in Spain 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 if it is true that spain cult of james still some 104 hectares 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.500
 it is also true that GMOs only make the 20% of e-mails disappear 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.450
 still say something to say 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.970
 he still does not get a good record for a promoted 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.020
 and that the problems are big and exist 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 these researchers favor him to transgenic crops but he wants 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.350
 as well 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.410
 that studies on the effects of long-term ogm can be made 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.630
 multinationals that markets transgenic maize does not seem to be 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.329
 facilitated the work of the laboratories 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.499
 more rarely women 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.979
 the general assembly also asked monsanto who gives me 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:26.669
 samples in order to study them this perspective in the genre 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.069
 fuse for different reasons sometimes we have technical reasons for example 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:33.739
 the first edison sleeve that have never really been in the rhythm 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.999
 never been predisposed to help his son I think he is 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.899
 normal to see the statue of posts 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:43.319
 if this is the case in quebec and ottawa 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.010
 are asking the government for permission to put any new 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.989
 transgenic maize species on the Spanish market the demand is 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.089
 currently under review
