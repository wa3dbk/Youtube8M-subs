00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.730
 doctor of biological sciences peter garyaev 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.279
 claims that can make medicine 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.100
 against aids avian flu essentially 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:19.660
 against any disease but she will 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.660
 act only on a certain 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.900
 human medicine that offers 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.999
 Peter Garyaev this waves coded 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.009
 information 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.539
 exposure to these won 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.829
 regenerate any organ and make 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:39.100
 human immortal if you failed 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.379
 replace your old organs with young ones 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.149
 that is, kidney heart seal vessels and so 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.670
 further you will grow old 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.699
 if you managed to replace what and be 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 young forever and you will live long 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:56.140
 at least thousands of years how ours lived 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:01:00.489
 biblical elders sim cad and Japheth and 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.460
 Noah and hotels is how the method works 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.690
 wave genetics using quantum 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.240
 computer 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.810
 read genetic information from 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.040
 object then sound and video image 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.640
 received information 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.740
 recorded on disk 9 medication is ready 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.119
 this entry is necessary from time to time 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:29.310
 listen to hear how our with you 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.130
 lymphocytes what they give an interesting sound 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.740
 unique sounds 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.399
 simultaneous information from them 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.759
 served mainly on us if you 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:45.509
 hardly everyone has cancer of the blood yes you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.340
 give healthy cells information from 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.729
 chat on all healthy cells 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.970
 Serve on a sick person who 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.429
 it means blood cancer and this spectrum 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.590
 says do as i do 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:00.899
 I am very simplified to brake 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.799
 aging as a recording object 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.709
 information 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.080
 Peter Garyaev proposes to use 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.069
 the cord blood of a newborn is 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.259
 acts on whom 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.010
 acts before she the child 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.090
 when it starts to get old after 30 years time 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.920
 at the same time will fix it all 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.350
 pathology crib disease that is a child 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.019
 waves cool acts on dad and on 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.239
 mom naturally and grandparents 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.620
 on both sides by mom and dad then 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.920
 there are immediate relatives this field 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.690
 actions of such matrices 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.700
 behind academician a lot 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.989
 experiments 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.350
 the results of some of them are just 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.209
 shake example in 2001 he 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.090
 together with a group of scientists in 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.500
 university of toronto in canada 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.200
 regenerated pancreas 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.400
 rats information has been removed from 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.080
 pancreas 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.570
 newborn rats 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.640
 until we can become immortal but 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.400
 aging processes have already learned 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.880
 manage in 10 years according to calculations 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.800
 scientists 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.250
 average life expectancy at 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:07.000
 the planet will be 90 years old and then man 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.720
 calmly able to step over the 150-year-old 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.850
 frontier 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.010
 hello there is a video on the internet 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.470
 Petra Garyeva where he talks about 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
 wave genetics and the achievements of such 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.480
 as rejuvenation healing regeneration 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.520
 the organs of the teeth on the site burned there where 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.100
 he offers matrices as universal 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.230
 so individual their cost from 500 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.760
 up to 1000 cu 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.000
 our sperm whale doesn't seem to be like 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.410
 tell hot and wave genetics 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.240
 what are the prospects for achieving 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.010
 consequences for both man and 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.500
 his children well in the first place what they say 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.690
 garyaev is not just theoretically 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.270
 possible but already proven practical 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:56.200
 digging this time that some regeneration 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:58.450
 organs of restoring youth this here 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.239
 these experiments go and advance but 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.600
 I do not know how to offer an attraction 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.890
 if now only one is known 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:11.650
 case and a ton of experimental animals this 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.730
 on the rat when was reached in 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:18.340
 laboratory conditions organ regeneration 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.100
 this again regeneration is very conditional 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.320
 and any matrix can offer and I 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.470
 hot i don't know because 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.060
 for the simple reason that here is the setting 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.700
 here are the harmonies 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.530
 generally 1st genetics it relies on 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.200
 harmonies and because harmony in everything 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.810
 it must surely but there is one 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.919
 small but man unlike all 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.660
 species is not 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.240
 fencing man here if a mosquito 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.580
 born a mosquito to grow mosquitoes if 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.970
 a rat born rats she will grow rats and 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.940
 rat organism harmony and i regeneration 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:58.450
 respectively , and organs is one thing 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.250
 human is very strong and social 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.630
 factor and 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:07.000
 in harmony includes all received 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.280
 social cultural information and 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.040
 so man is on the psyche path 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.600
 differs code omitted in 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.169
 unnaturalness to human 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.660
 that is, five types and types of psyche 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.580
 according to this need 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:25.360
 and pick up harmonics by 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.460
 restore or change the type 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.220
 psyche so talk about what it is 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:33.240
 here you can already in the practical plane and 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.800
 do not immediately use it all well here 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.430
 while not yet speak except 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.560
 of that there is one small but if 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.419
 above was provided 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.290
 as a result of a certain activity 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:50.810
 human activity certain wear 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:55.289
 its inner shell is biological 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:57.569
 the bodies then accordingly 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.180
 and provided for regeneration i.e. 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.039
 change your behavior 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.319
 morality is your type of psyche in 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.749
 humanity's side return to the path 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:09.419
 Divine Providence and accordingly 

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:12.509
 you are increasing already without 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.729
 no any terrestrial technologies you 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:18.830
 immediately increases the opportunity and 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:21.779
 longevity possibility of long youth 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:26.759
 from organ regeneration 

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:29.879
 and if you want to come so let's say zone 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:32.669
 God's allowance to at the same time possess 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:36.689
 some technologies of eternal youth 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.360
 against the will of above as well as they say 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.430
 cunning Allah and cunning and not cunning 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.669
 Allah Allah the most cunning of cunning 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.669
 so no need to shove against god
