00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello and welcome to the first one 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.609
 Follow minecraft tutorials this time 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.470
 as strong as it is in today 's theme 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.779
 this series will always be the case 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.609
 I explain to you today step for 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 walk like you to your beacon 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.630
 Here we start with the am 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.529
 easiest to obtain ingredient 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.059
 namely, you get glass of glass 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.890
 probably all but just for the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.079
 case that he had only just begun 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.129
 I show you mine too 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.680
 that again 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.149
 Glass is won abroad as brave 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.190
 through a shovel with you on the lookout 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 best a desert comes neat sand 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.200
 off and put this in open in 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.879
 which he uses as charcoal charcoal 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.989
 or another combustible material 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.710
 have put 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.719
 Now it is said that the oven then 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.230
 burned out and take the finished 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.630
 glass and cashed 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.180
 for years which although at the one 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.979
 tip needed to break down and it only 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.080
 in connection with water arises 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.060
 still one of the two easy ones 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.270
 Created ingredients for our beacon 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 just go into a cave and build 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.690
 take a few blocks off because he still has 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.090
 never have wondered 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.460
 simply obsidian and needs a lot 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 time to wait 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.630
 have you oxidize old let's go now 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.580
 over to the oldest part 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.860
 now it's time to go to hell 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.660
 travel and skeletons you only in 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 these black kÃ¶ln fortresses here 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.700
 so many fight so far three 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.530
 clockwork skulls together you can do that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.970
 take a long time because only rarely 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.340
 including the minecraft 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.770
 random generator to give you a skull 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.200
 if you can skull these three 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.050
 have you placed it over a tv wigans 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.850
 culture of the soest also in the 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.220
 Hell can find and get up 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.220
 a strong opponent caught because 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.020
 how you manage this minecraft 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.940
 to defeat titan remains undermined 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.140
 I recommend you however potions 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.420
 and enchanted weapons like 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.610
 to make equipment parts as you 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 otherwise definitely no chance 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.970
 if you want to know how it works then 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.890
 do not be afraid and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.480
 Enchantments are rented to tories 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 he will surely show you soon how 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.629
 that works 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.579
 if it has made the return to 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:28.239
 Then you will defeat one 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:31.030
 star because the village of this star 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.860
 is the final crafting ingredients ye 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.930
 needs to build a beacon 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.890
 Now he comes to the part where it 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.560
 is bought 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.200
 We have everything on ingredients to quote 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.480
 because he's there and glass and take 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.620
 Everything from the box and I'll show you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.620
 equal in ascot 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.910
 the star in the middle among three 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.820
 obsidian and over it under a dome 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.020
 From glass we now have our beacon 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.460
 or English the beacon flop now 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.290
 only the question remains what characterizes you 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.570
 the thing is really good that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.760
 tell in a new episode of 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.720
 minecraft tutorials next time 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.720
 with the devil
