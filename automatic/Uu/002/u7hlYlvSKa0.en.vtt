shield<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.720> grab<00:02:34.959> my<00:02:35.140> level<00:02:35.470> 50<00:02:35.859> and<00:02:36.069> when<00:02:36.340> I

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
shield to grab my level 50 and when I

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.369 
shield to grab my level 50 and when I
compared<00:02:36.849> the<00:02:36.970> stats<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.689> only<00:02:37.959> difference

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
compared the stats the only difference

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.339 
compared the stats the only difference
is<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.590> with<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.129> level<00:02:39.400> 48<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.209> get<00:02:40.450> 2,000

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
is that with the level 48 you get 2,000

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.349 
is that with the level 48 you get 2,000
less<00:02:41.530> health<00:02:41.859> which<00:02:42.310> isn't<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:42.970> big<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
less health which isn't that big of a

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.300 
less health which isn't that big of a
deal<00:02:43.540> but<00:02:44.079> it's<00:02:44.230> enough<00:02:44.530> to<00:02:44.680> make<00:02:44.859> you<00:02:45.010> want<00:02:45.250> to

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
deal but it's enough to make you want to

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.149 
deal but it's enough to make you want to
go<00:02:45.459> ahead<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.970> get<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.599> level<00:02:46.900> 50<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.950> while

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
we're clearing out these bully monks let

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.800 
we're clearing out these bully monks let
me<00:02:50.260> tell<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.620> exactly<00:02:51.190> why<00:02:51.819> the<00:02:51.879> Roughrider

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
me tell you exactly why the Roughrider

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.710 
me tell you exactly why the Roughrider
is<00:02:53.019> such<00:02:53.709> a<00:02:53.950> niche<00:02:54.310> item<00:02:54.790> in<00:02:54.909> this<00:02:55.060> game<00:02:55.359> and

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
is such a niche item in this game and

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.240 
is such a niche item in this game and
that<00:02:56.079> is<00:02:56.200> because<00:02:56.560> there<00:02:56.799> are<00:02:56.889> a<00:02:56.950> lot<00:02:57.220> of

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
that is because there are a lot of

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.879 
that is because there are a lot of
skills<00:02:57.730> on<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.480> character<00:02:58.900> skill<00:02:59.200> trees<00:02:59.470> that

00:02:59.879 --> 00:02:59.889 
skills on the character skill trees that

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.220 
skills on the character skill trees that
only<00:03:00.370> activate<00:03:01.090> when<00:03:01.629> your<00:03:01.810> shield<00:03:02.109> is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
only activate when your shield is

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.740 
only activate when your shield is
depleted<00:03:02.859> now<00:03:03.340> if<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.700> take<00:03:03.970> your<00:03:04.150> shield<00:03:04.480> off

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
depleted now if you take your shield off

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.119 
depleted now if you take your shield off
it's<00:03:05.019> not<00:03:05.230> going<00:03:05.379> to<00:03:05.439> activate<00:03:05.769> because<00:03:06.040> you

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:06.129 
it's not going to activate because you

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.099 
it's not going to activate because you
don't<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.579> a<00:03:06.609> shield<00:03:06.909> that's<00:03:07.120> depleted<00:03:07.629> but

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
don't have a shield that's depleted but

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.369 
don't have a shield that's depleted but
since<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:08.650> stays<00:03:08.980> at<00:03:09.189> a<00:03:09.250> constant<00:03:10.239> zero<00:03:10.930> of

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
since this stays at a constant zero of

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.400 
since this stays at a constant zero of
shield<00:03:11.980> capacity<00:03:12.269> it<00:03:13.269> registers<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.169> fact

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
shield capacity it registers the fact

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.500 
shield capacity it registers the fact
that<00:03:14.620> you<00:03:15.010> can<00:03:15.190> keep<00:03:15.430> these<00:03:15.669> skills<00:03:16.000> active

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
that you can keep these skills active

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.140 
that you can keep these skills active
the<00:03:16.840> entire<00:03:17.319> time<00:03:17.769> you're<00:03:18.010> running<00:03:18.190> around<00:03:18.430> so

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the entire time you're running around so

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.909 
the entire time you're running around so
it's<00:03:19.299> not<00:03:19.480> like<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:19.930> any<00:03:20.169> normal<00:03:20.470> shield

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
it's not like just any normal shield
