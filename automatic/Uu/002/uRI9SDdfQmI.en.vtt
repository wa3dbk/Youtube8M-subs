question is what to do about it the
options<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.039> have<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.640> date<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.510> low

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
options that we have to date for low

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.389 
options that we have to date for low
back<00:00:51.840> pain<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:53.399> bad<00:00:53.789> but<00:00:54.949> what<00:00:55.949> we<00:00:56.070> really

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
want is a treatment that repairs tissue

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.549 
want is a treatment that repairs tissue
or<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.489> regenerates<00:01:00.090> tissue<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:01.260> doesn't

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
or that regenerates tissue and doesn't

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.759 
or that regenerates tissue and doesn't
just<00:01:01.739> mask<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.850> pain<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.379> steroid

research<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.490> arthritis<00:01:09.360> work<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.140> well

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
research for arthritis work really well

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.920 
research for arthritis work really well
and<00:01:10.850> they<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.090> repeated<00:01:12.540> every<00:01:12.720> few

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
and they can be repeated every few

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.280 
and they can be repeated every few
months<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.680> they<00:01:13.799> don't<00:01:13.979> fix<00:01:14.189> anything<00:01:15.290> what

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
months but they don't fix anything what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140 
months but they don't fix anything what
we<00:01:16.380> need<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.680> medicine<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.250> things<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.850> fix

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
we need in medicine is things that fix

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
back pain you end up needing further

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.080 
back pain you end up needing further
surgeries<00:01:31.619> down<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> road<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.759> first<00:01:32.909> one

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
surgeries down the road or the first one

has<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> large<00:01:33.600> percentage<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.170> failure<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
has a large percentage of failure you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.929 
has a large percentage of failure you
know<00:01:35.520> maybe<00:01:35.759> 40<00:01:36.090> percent<00:01:36.710> okay<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.520> let<00:01:38.909> me

produced<00:01:46.470> throughout<00:01:46.649> life<00:01:46.950> not<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.729> when

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
produced throughout life not just when

here<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.490> bone<00:01:59.700> marrow<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> body<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
here the bone marrow in the body and you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.679 
here the bone marrow in the body and you
have<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.490> know<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.790> film<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.630> her

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
have a lot of it you know I film in her

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.200 
have a lot of it you know I film in her
everywhere<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.649> produces<00:02:05.219> stem<00:02:05.490> cells<00:02:05.820> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
everywhere it produces stem cells and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.350 
everywhere it produces stem cells and
I've<00:02:06.570> drawn<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.110> here<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.849> stem<00:02:08.849> cell<00:02:09.090> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
I've drawn one here a stem cell is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.080 
I've drawn one here a stem cell is
basically<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.259> blank<00:02:10.560> slate<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.580> hasn't<00:02:11.940> turned

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
basically a blank slate it hasn't turned

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.690 
basically a blank slate it hasn't turned
into

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
into

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
into
yet<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.140> waits<00:02:14.349> for<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.709> signal<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:16.540> know

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
yet and it waits for a signal to know

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.020 
yet and it waits for a signal to know
what<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.200> turn<00:02:17.410> into<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.430> eventually<00:02:18.760> it's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
what to turn into so eventually it's

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.430 
what to turn into so eventually it's
going<00:02:19.209> to<00:02:19.300> turn<00:02:19.420> either<00:02:19.599> into<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:19.930> cartilage

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
going to turn either into a cartilage

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.210 
going to turn either into a cartilage
cell<00:02:20.709> or<00:02:21.310> muscle<00:02:22.120> cell<00:02:22.360> or<00:02:22.690> bone<00:02:23.080> or<00:02:23.440> skin<00:02:23.920> cell

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
cell or muscle cell or bone or skin cell

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.550 
cell or muscle cell or bone or skin cell
and<00:02:24.580> there<00:02:25.300> may<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.450> some<00:02:25.720> others<00:02:25.959> too<00:02:26.170> but

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
and there may be some others too but

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.220 
and there may be some others too but
those<00:02:26.680> are<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:26.860> main<00:02:27.069> ones<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
those are the main ones all right so it

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.199 
those are the main ones all right so it
waits<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.769> signals<00:02:30.670> from<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.910> tissue

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
waits for the signals from the tissue

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.570 
waits for the signals from the tissue
around<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.380> tell<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.800> okay<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.370> is<00:02:33.459> what

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
around it to tell it okay this is what

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.180 
around it to tell it okay this is what
you<00:02:33.670> need<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:33.910> turn<00:02:34.030> into<00:02:34.860> alright<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.099> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you need to turn into alright so the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.520 
you need to turn into alright so the
study<00:02:36.430> involves<00:02:36.849> back<00:02:37.090> pain<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.690> injections

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
study involves back pain and injections

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.869 
study involves back pain and injections
of<00:02:38.650> stem<00:02:38.950> cells<00:02:39.280> into<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.420> disk<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.760> have

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
of stem cells into the disk so you have

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.820 
of stem cells into the disk so you have
your<00:02:43.030> bone<00:02:43.239> here<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.810> here<00:02:44.410> which<00:02:44.560> is<00:02:44.709> the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
your bone here and here which is the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.309 
your bone here and here which is the
vertebrae<00:02:45.340> okay<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.420> between<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.110> them<00:02:47.230> at

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
vertebrae okay and between and them at

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.770 
vertebrae okay and between and them at
every<00:02:47.500> level<00:02:47.680> you<00:02:48.370> have<00:02:48.780> intervertebral

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
every level you have intervertebral

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.380 
every level you have intervertebral
discs<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:50.860> they're<00:02:51.579> squishy<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.150> soft

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
discs and they're squishy and soft

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.819 
discs and they're squishy and soft
they're<00:02:52.720> made<00:02:52.870> up<00:02:52.959> normally<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.380> 80<00:02:53.590> percent

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
they're made up normally of 80 percent

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:59.509 
they're made up normally of 80 percent
water<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:55.269> as<00:02:55.420> we<00:02:56.290> age<00:02:56.579> we<00:02:57.579> turn<00:02:57.910> into<00:02:58.120> prunes

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
water but as we age we turn into prunes

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.830 
water but as we age we turn into prunes
where<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.610> water<00:03:00.849> comes<00:03:01.209> out<00:03:01.420> and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
where the water comes out and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.030 
where the water comes out and
unfortunately<00:03:02.349> it<00:03:02.440> doesn't<00:03:02.560> continue<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
unfortunately it doesn't continue to

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.319 
unfortunately it doesn't continue to
come<00:03:03.250> back<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:04.420> what<00:03:04.599> you<00:03:04.720> end<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.019> with<00:03:05.319> is

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
come back so what you end up with is

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.620 
come back so what you end up with is
decrease<00:03:07.329> in<00:03:07.569> height<00:03:07.810> of<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:09.160> disk<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.540> you

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
decrease in height of the disk and you

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.120 
decrease in height of the disk and you
start<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:10.989> lose<00:03:11.170> some<00:03:11.470> let's<00:03:11.709> just<00:03:11.860> say<00:03:11.950> this

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
start to lose some let's just say this

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.640 
start to lose some let's just say this
part<00:03:12.370> went<00:03:12.549> away<00:03:12.810> okay<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.049> if<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.440> have

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
part went away okay and if you have

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.680 
part went away okay and if you have
tears<00:03:14.950> in<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.310> disk<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.970> can<00:03:16.180> be<00:03:16.329> painful

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
tears in the disk that can be painful

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.690 
tears in the disk that can be painful
and<00:03:17.200> cause<00:03:17.650> what's<00:03:17.920> known<00:03:18.100> as<00:03:18.280> degenerative

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
and cause what's known as degenerative

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.069 
and cause what's known as degenerative
disk<00:03:19.450> disease<00:03:20.639> so<00:03:21.639> there<00:03:22.090> are<00:03:22.209> two<00:03:22.389> aspects<00:03:22.900> to

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
disk disease so there are two aspects to

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:25.559 
disk disease so there are two aspects to
the<00:03:23.200> study<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.940> there's<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.209> rigorous

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
the study and there's a rigorous

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.470 
the study and there's a rigorous
inclusion<00:03:26.109> process<00:03:26.650> but<00:03:27.370> if<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.819> stem<00:03:28.209> cells

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
inclusion process but if the stem cells

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.840 
inclusion process but if the stem cells
are<00:03:28.630> injected<00:03:28.780> into<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.530> disk<00:03:29.829> the<00:03:30.400> hope<00:03:30.639> is

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
are injected into the disk the hope is

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.030 
are injected into the disk the hope is
that<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.269> tissues<00:03:32.109> around<00:03:32.290> it

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
that the tissues around it

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.890 
that the tissues around it
will<00:03:33.760> tell<00:03:34.060> it<00:03:34.239> ok<00:03:34.569> you<00:03:34.630> need<00:03:34.840> to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
will tell it ok you need to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.710 
will tell it ok you need to
differentiate<00:03:35.380> into<00:03:35.859> cartilage<00:03:36.310> tissue<00:03:36.720> or

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
differentiate into cartilage tissue or

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.710 
differentiate into cartilage tissue or
this<00:03:37.900> type<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.109> collagen<00:03:38.799> and<00:03:39.700> it<00:03:40.450> will<00:03:40.569> do

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
this type of collagen and it will do

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.270 
this type of collagen and it will do
that<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.139> they've<00:03:41.319> shown<00:03:41.620> in<00:03:41.859> the<00:03:41.950> initial

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
that and they've shown in the initial

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.890 
that and they've shown in the initial
pilot<00:03:42.670> study<00:03:42.910> that<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.870> did<00:03:44.049> work<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
pilot study that it did work and the

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440 
pilot study that it did work and the
individuals<00:03:47.350> got<00:03:47.500> better<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:49.060> now<00:03:49.209> it's<00:03:49.359> in

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
individuals got better so now it's in

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:50.819 
individuals got better so now it's in
clinical<00:03:49.840> trials<00:03:50.170> and<00:03:50.260> multiple<00:03:50.620> sites

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
clinical trials and multiple sites

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.920 
clinical trials and multiple sites
around<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.220> country<00:03:51.280> there's<00:03:52.030> only<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.569> in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
around the country there's only one in

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.160 
around the country there's only one in
Arizona<00:03:53.519> okay<00:03:54.519> so<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.239> eventual<00:03:55.630> end<00:03:55.810> result

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
Arizona okay so the eventual end result

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.259 
Arizona okay so the eventual end result
of<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.410> hope<00:03:56.590> with<00:03:56.859> this<00:03:57.099> is<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.849> it<00:03:58.030> will<00:03:58.120> be
