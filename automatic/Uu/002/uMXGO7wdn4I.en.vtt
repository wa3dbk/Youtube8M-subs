00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.660
 operating system since I look in 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.150
 youtube and there are very few tutorials of what 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.270
 what is this system because it is less 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.280
 used that windows but still used and 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.739

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.989

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.879

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.060
