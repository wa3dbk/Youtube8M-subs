it<00:00:01.390> is<00:00:01.600> kind<00:00:01.780> of<00:00:01.870> upsetting<00:00:02.199> that<00:00:02.379> you

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:02.499 
it is kind of upsetting that you

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:04.080 
it is kind of upsetting that you
actually<00:00:02.620> have<00:00:02.919> to<00:00:03.039> play<00:00:03.249> team<00:00:03.489> fortress<00:00:03.519> 2

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
actually have to play team fortress 2

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.840 
actually have to play team fortress 2
that<00:00:04.330> 1280<00:00:04.810> x<00:00:05.049> 600<00:00:05.919> with<00:00:06.100> all<00:00:06.370> the<00:00:06.700> lowest

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:06.850 
that 1280 x 600 with all the lowest

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.820 
that 1280 x 600 with all the lowest
possible<00:00:07.149> settings<00:00:07.839> when<00:00:08.500> you<00:00:08.620> should

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:08.830 
possible settings when you should

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.950 
possible settings when you should
actually<00:00:09.010> be<00:00:09.310> playing<00:00:09.610> it<00:00:09.760> at<00:00:09.880> 1600<00:00:10.600> x<00:00:10.720> 900

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 
actually be playing it at 1600 x 900

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.490 
actually be playing it at 1600 x 900
with<00:00:11.530> almost<00:00:11.950> all<00:00:12.160> the<00:00:12.370> highest<00:00:12.850> settings<00:00:13.500> and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
with almost all the highest settings and

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.410 
with almost all the highest settings and
at<00:00:14.620> that<00:00:14.800> it<00:00:15.370> would<00:00:15.550> actually<00:00:15.670> be<00:00:15.880> giving<00:00:16.330> you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
at that it would actually be giving you

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.010 
at that it would actually be giving you
40<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:17.280> 60<00:00:18.280> frames<00:00:18.490> per<00:00:18.580> second<00:00:19.120> but<00:00:19.870> what

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
40 to 60 frames per second but what

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.720 
40 to 60 frames per second but what
happens<00:00:20.440> is<00:00:20.590> that<00:00:20.620> it<00:00:20.950> will<00:00:21.100> heat<00:00:21.310> up<00:00:21.340> quickly

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:21.730 
happens is that it will heat up quickly

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.930 
happens is that it will heat up quickly
and<00:00:22.300> as<00:00:22.660> soon<00:00:22.869> as<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.470> cpu<00:00:24.100> which<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.640> 80

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
and as soon as the cpu which is 80

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.160 
and as soon as the cpu which is 80
degrees<00:00:25.420> the<00:00:25.960> surface<00:00:26.380> is<00:00:26.560> built<00:00:26.860> to<00:00:27.100> actually

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
degrees the surface is built to actually

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.960 
degrees the surface is built to actually
throttle<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.350> cpu<00:00:29.800> down<00:00:30.039> so<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.610> start

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
throttle the cpu down so you start

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.079 
throttle the cpu down so you start
seeing<00:00:31.379> stuttering<00:00:32.379> on<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.859> the<00:00:33.819> video

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.089 
seeing stuttering on the the video

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:37.889 
seeing stuttering on the the video
itself<00:00:34.499> so<00:00:36.089> there's<00:00:37.089> no<00:00:37.269> way<00:00:37.420> I'm<00:00:37.600> actually

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
itself so there's no way I'm actually

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.709 
itself so there's no way I'm actually
overcoming<00:00:38.829> that<00:00:38.859> and<00:00:39.819> as<00:00:40.149> you<00:00:40.329> will<00:00:40.510> notice

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
overcoming that and as you will notice

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.840 
overcoming that and as you will notice
here<00:00:41.289> you<00:00:41.499> actually<00:00:42.069> see<00:00:42.280> that<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.609> frame

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
here you actually see that the frame

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.369 
here you actually see that the frame
rates<00:00:43.089> to<00:00:43.269> drop<00:00:43.569> but<00:00:43.839> they're<00:00:43.989> not<00:00:44.199> as

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
rates to drop but they're not as

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.639 
rates to drop but they're not as
noticeable<00:00:44.559> because<00:00:45.359> the<00:00:46.359> CPU<00:00:47.109> is<00:00:47.229> strong

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
noticeable because the CPU is strong

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.160 
noticeable because the CPU is strong
enough<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:48.159> actually<00:00:48.309> still<00:00:48.850> give<00:00:49.120> you<00:00:49.170> enough

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
enough to actually still give you enough

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.039 
enough to actually still give you enough
preference<00:00:51.069> per<00:00:51.219> second<00:00:51.670> for<00:00:52.479> you<00:00:52.749> not<00:00:52.929> to

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
preference per second for you not to

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.289 
preference per second for you not to
actually<00:00:53.379> notice<00:00:53.589> it<00:00:53.829> really<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.609> did<00:00:55.059> see<00:00:55.269> a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:55.299 
actually notice it really I did see a

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:58.829 
actually notice it really I did see a
couple<00:00:55.389> of<00:00:55.899> tips<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.920> teens<00:00:57.569> those<00:00:58.569> were

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
couple of tips to the teens those were

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.110 
couple of tips to the teens those were
noticeable<00:00:59.440> but<00:01:00.159> they're<00:01:00.370> very<00:01:00.609> few<00:01:00.909> and<00:01:00.969> far

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
noticeable but they're very few and far

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.770 
noticeable but they're very few and far
in<00:01:01.359> between<00:01:02.639> but<00:01:03.639> as<00:01:03.909> you<00:01:04.030> can<00:01:04.149> tell<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.600> game

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
in between but as you can tell the game

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.359 
in between but as you can tell the game
is<00:01:04.930> actually<00:01:05.049> playable<00:01:05.500> and<00:01:06.070> you<00:01:06.219> can

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
is actually playable and you can

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.230 
is actually playable and you can
actually<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.619> usually<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:09.219> it's<00:01:09.369> 20s<00:01:10.000> to

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
actually it's usually and it's 20s to

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.830 
actually it's usually and it's 20s to
30s<00:01:10.500> ha<00:01:11.500> goes<00:01:12.219> all<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.460> way<00:01:12.640> to<00:01:12.670> 50s<00:01:13.329> time

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
30s ha goes all the way to 50s time

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.599 
30s ha goes all the way to 50s time
frames<00:01:14.170> per<00:01:14.350> second<00:01:14.649> obvious<00:01:15.130> but<00:01:15.369> it's<00:01:15.490> not

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
frames per second obvious but it's not

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.940 
frames per second obvious but it's not
throttling<00:01:16.149> but<00:01:16.899> don't<00:01:17.140> fool<00:01:17.409> yourself<00:01:17.799> it

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
throttling but don't fool yourself it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.920 
throttling but don't fool yourself it
actually<00:01:18.250> does<00:01:18.430> truck<00:01:18.729> the<00:01:19.060> throttle<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.750> lot

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
actually does truck the throttle a lot

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.920 
actually does truck the throttle a lot
it<00:01:20.109> either<00:01:20.640> team<00:01:21.640> fortress<00:01:22.000> 2<00:01:22.180> the<00:01:22.570> reason<00:01:22.899> for

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
it either team fortress 2 the reason for

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.120 
it either team fortress 2 the reason for
this<00:01:23.560> because<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.570> engine<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.530> uses<00:01:26.979> is

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
this because I the engine it uses is

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.450 
this because I the engine it uses is
more<00:01:27.490> CPU<00:01:27.969> treatment<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.630> GPU<00:01:29.020> driven<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.100> it

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
more CPU treatment that GPU driven so it

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.020 
more CPU treatment that GPU driven so it
actually<00:01:30.700> hits<00:01:31.479> more<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:32.770> cpu<00:01:33.189> than<00:01:33.219> the<00:01:33.549> GPU

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
actually hits more the cpu than the GPU

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.109 
actually hits more the cpu than the GPU
and<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.539> heats<00:01:34.750> it<00:01:34.990> up<00:01:35.049> a<00:01:35.229> lot<00:01:35.380> faster<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
and it heats it up a lot faster just

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.149 
and it heats it up a lot faster just
look<00:01:37.719> at<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.899> rest<00:01:38.109> i<00:01:38.289> think<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:38.799> not<00:01:39.009> very

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
look at the rest i think it's not very

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.399 
look at the rest i think it's not very
playable<00:01:39.609> i<00:01:39.820> was<00:01:40.030> actually<00:01:40.210> able<00:01:40.990> to<00:01:41.229> play

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
playable i was actually able to play

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.569 
playable i was actually able to play
several<00:01:42.390> games<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.780> there<00:01:44.710> was<00:01:44.829> not<00:01:45.009> much<00:01:45.280> of

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
several games and there was not much of

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.819 
several games and there was not much of
holding<00:01:46.329> me<00:01:46.450> back<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.719> so<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.469> wasn't<00:01:47.770> that

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
holding me back and so it wasn't that

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.520 
holding me back and so it wasn't that
bad<00:01:48.130> actually<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:49.869> hear<00:01:50.049> i<00:01:50.079> was<00:01:50.229> just<00:01:50.439> being

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
bad actually to hear i was just being

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.679 
bad actually to hear i was just being
terrible<00:01:50.950> because<00:01:51.219> i<00:01:51.369> was<00:01:51.520> tired<00:01:51.789> of<00:01:52.060> testing

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
terrible because i was tired of testing

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.440 
terrible because i was tired of testing
different<00:01:52.840> resolutions<00:01:53.590> by<00:01:53.770> this<00:01:53.950> time<00:01:54.450> sorry

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
different resolutions by this time sorry

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.450 
different resolutions by this time sorry
for<00:01:55.659> those<00:01:55.749> guys<00:01:55.990> were<00:01:56.229> playing<00:01:56.439> bad<00:01:56.770> that<00:01:57.429> i

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
for those guys were playing bad that i

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.380 
for those guys were playing bad that i
did<00:01:57.909> messed<00:01:58.119> up<00:01:58.270> their<00:01:58.450> game<00:01:58.600> anyway

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
did messed up their game anyway

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.730 
did messed up their game anyway
hopefully<00:02:01.390> this<00:02:01.569> is<00:02:01.719> good<00:02:01.929> enough<00:02:02.049> for<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.409> if
