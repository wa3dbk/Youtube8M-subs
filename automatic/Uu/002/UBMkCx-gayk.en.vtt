00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hello my name is Stas and this 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.309
 soft club company so today 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.690
 finally I came out asphalt asphalt 8 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 even more than 21 numbers came out sometime during the day 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.710
 washed in the evening something about 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.560
 This is why he promised 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 generally 22 but nevertheless, because asphalt 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.449
 8 is practically no different from 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.980
 previous versions especially from asphalt 7 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.800
 if you wish you can write 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.540
 comments I will review it too 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 that's because I started buying in my 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.230
 from 6 or 5 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.520
 Asphalt I do not remember exactly mean I 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.070
 every time you take in general 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 asphalt any absolutely any asphalt in 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 hands yes here on your gadget and you 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 understand that this is just a game of it 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.829
 just race and serious about 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.379
 not worth it until the toy costs only 1 dollar 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.809
 at the same time there is a model name at the same time 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.629
 spending only 1 dollar you can in it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.760
 play enjoy and get huge 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.879
 pleasure in principle i like that 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.619
 same concerns real racing 3 there is a crisis it 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.510
 more realistic game compare them 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.860
 absolutely pointless well here it is 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.200
 completely different levels 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.510
 games, but naturally for different 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.220
 totally different categories of people therefore 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.920
 stop here of course not 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.939
 will be asphalt 8 in principle as for 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.170
 general and hernia 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.409
 toys all look really 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.290
 great on the schedule and even better cars still 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.060
 better traced even steeper of course 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.280
 accident accident it is really very 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.560
 cool stuff and slow motion 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 everything looks very cool you are 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 by the way such races when you need not 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 just come first or come there 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.360
 score warmed points but 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.220
 This is of course by the way as regards nitro 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 she is constantly recruited when you just 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.970
 drive well here and here also 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.649
 such banks are present 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.990
 armageddon and when you need just 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.180
 kills rivals here and the first who 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.680
 will come and I like grit 1 or rather 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.680
 the only one who will survive it there is not 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.110
 matters in 5 6 or 1 well here you are 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.049
 how grit won yes here and win that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.170
 same time for time speed on 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.060
 Of course the race is definitely a game. 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.799
 either hard or not hard 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.360
 whichever you drive 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.860
 by car 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.379
 unexpected avalanche unexpected change 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.510
 climate to constantly new maps and new 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.520
 with each new open race you have 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.650
 the opportunity to purchase a new car 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.660
 By the way, you can also improve it. 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.440
 at will, I have never improved my 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.450
 the car went through only 20 races 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.459
 concerns in general in principle iphone on 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.260
 iPhone she play much nicer 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.879
 of course than on ipad but on ipad 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.670
 everything looks much bigger 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:37.769
 but drawing naturally on iPhone 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 the fifth is just a quiz as to 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.080
 and n yes well everything is just much 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.989
 nicer here as for basically 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.209
 all games date if thats the same 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.519
 asphalt plan is the best 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.030
 decision for me and to be honest here 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.800
 its implementation is given but quite completely 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.300
 interesting if of course you have 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.970
 maybe through and poltava to play on 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.680
 plasma is definitely very cool this 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.120
 very nice and i hope that you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.310
 very, very much 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 therefore, in fact, I purchase once 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.000
 just this toy yes you 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.920
 get a lot of fun no more 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.050
 spend a dime I really like these 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.800
 models when just paid as grit 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.209
 yes it is better to pay once and constantly 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.390
 to play far than to pay constantly 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.950
 it is not clear at all for that here so if 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.659
 and the desire to repeat can write 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.390
 I made a review of the previous comments 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:28.769
