00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.329 

part<00:00:01.079> five<00:00:01.290> with<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.650> origami<00:00:02.100> alien<00:00:03.799> so<00:00:04.799> once

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
part five with the origami alien so once

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.450 
part five with the origami alien so once
you've<00:00:05.520> completed<00:00:05.940> this<00:00:06.330> side<00:00:06.980> you<00:00:07.980> must<00:00:08.220> do

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
you've completed this side you must do

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.000 
you've completed this side you must do
it<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.120> other<00:00:09.150> side<00:00:09.420> here<00:00:10.139> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.769> will<00:00:10.889> do

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
it on the other side here so I will do

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:30.130 
it on the other side here so I will do
that

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.850 

all<00:00:30.859> right<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:31.730> this<00:00:32.450> is<00:00:32.509> what<00:00:32.750> you<00:00:32.870> got<00:00:33.020> next

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
all right so this is what you got next

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.330 
all right so this is what you got next
step<00:00:34.250> would<00:00:34.610> be<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:35.059> start<00:00:35.360> creating<00:00:35.750> the<00:00:35.930> tail

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
step would be to start creating the tail

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.700 
step would be to start creating the tail
so<00:00:37.340> pick<00:00:37.730> your<00:00:37.760> favorite<00:00:37.970> side<00:00:38.720> you<00:00:39.500> should

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
so pick your favorite side you should

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.430 
so pick your favorite side you should
probably<00:00:39.890> pick<00:00:40.129> the<00:00:40.190> one<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.059> is<00:00:41.440> uglier

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
probably pick the one that is uglier

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.150 
probably pick the one that is uglier
though<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.550> kind<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.059> start<00:00:44.660> crimping<00:00:45.649> it<00:00:46.300> so

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
though you kind of start crimping it so

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.369 
though you kind of start crimping it so
what<00:00:49.160> I<00:00:49.190> mean<00:00:49.370> by<00:00:49.489> that<00:00:49.519> is<00:00:49.940> you<00:00:50.420> fold<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:51.260> up

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
what I mean by that is you fold it up

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.360 
what I mean by that is you fold it up
and<00:00:52.120> then<00:00:53.409> fold<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.589> back<00:00:54.739> down<00:00:54.769> just<00:00:55.010> a<00:00:55.339> little

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
and then fold it back down just a little

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:03.000 
and then fold it back down just a little
bit

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.060 

trying<00:01:03.700> to<00:01:03.940> keep<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:04.479> straight<00:01:04.809> so<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:06.570> like<00:01:07.570> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
trying to keep it straight so see like a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.790 
trying to keep it straight so see like a
zigzag

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.580 

and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.720> crimp<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.290> on<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.470> other<00:01:17.620> side<00:01:17.830> too

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and you crimp it on the other side too

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.530 
and you crimp it on the other side too
like<00:01:20.590> that

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.060 

and<00:01:25.660> then<00:01:26.370> from<00:01:27.370> there<00:01:28.170> you're<00:01:29.170> going<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.620> go

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
and then from there you're going to go

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.880 
and then from there you're going to go
ahead<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:32.580> grab<00:01:33.580> this<00:01:34.420> edge<00:01:34.750> right<00:01:34.900> here<00:01:35.290> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
ahead and grab this edge right here the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.110 
ahead and grab this edge right here the
small<00:01:36.190> edge<00:01:36.430> and<00:01:36.870> kind<00:01:37.870> of<00:01:37.990> push<00:01:38.620> it<00:01:38.650> in

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
small edge and kind of push it in

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.160 
small edge and kind of push it in
towards<00:01:40.120> Center<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.970> do<00:01:43.660> some<00:01:43.870> squash

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
towards Center and do some squash

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.060 
towards Center and do some squash
folding

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 

and<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.760> do<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> same<00:01:54.150> thing<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:54.570> other

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and you do the same thing to the other

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:05.500 
and you do the same thing to the other
side

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.030 

because<00:02:06.510> of<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.690> size<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.260> paper<00:02:07.590> I

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
because of the size of this paper I

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.780 
because of the size of this paper I
could<00:02:08.190> only<00:02:08.520> get<00:02:08.820> two<00:02:09.210> of<00:02:09.240> these<00:02:09.690> little

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
could only get two of these little

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.120 
could only get two of these little
indentations<00:02:11.790> in<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.380> bigger<00:02:13.380> paper<00:02:13.680> allows

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
indentations in a bigger paper allows

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.870 
indentations in a bigger paper allows
for<00:02:14.520> more<00:02:14.910> indentations<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.550> makes<00:02:17.550> it<00:02:17.730> look

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
for more indentations and makes it look

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.760 
for more indentations and makes it look
somewhat<00:02:18.360> scaly<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.690> push<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
somewhat scaly and then you push in the

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.220 
somewhat scaly and then you push in the
tip<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.040> little<00:02:23.340> bit<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:27.360> completes<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
tip a little bit and that completes the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.630 
tip a little bit and that completes the
tail<00:02:29.840> so<00:02:30.920> from<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:33.740> start<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.920> fold<00:02:35.490> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
tail so from there you start to fold it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.430 
tail so from there you start to fold it
in<00:02:35.730> half<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:40.020> kind<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.010> put<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:41.910> straight<00:02:42.210> up

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
in half and I kind of put it straight up

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.650 
in half and I kind of put it straight up
like<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.240> and<00:02:46.880> continue<00:02:47.880> folding<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.510> in

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
like that and continue folding it in

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:55.880 
like that and continue folding it in
half<00:02:48.690> as<00:02:49.290> best<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> can<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.550> course

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.100 

because<00:02:56.640> by<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.880> time<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.600> paper<00:02:57.810> should<00:02:58.050> be

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
because by this time the paper should be

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.350 
because by this time the paper should be
getting<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.590> thick<00:02:59.150> unless<00:03:00.150> of<00:03:00.330> course

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
getting pretty thick unless of course

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.130 
getting pretty thick unless of course
you<00:03:00.690> use<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.840> big<00:03:01.170> paper<00:03:01.970> actually<00:03:02.970> recommend<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
you use a big paper actually recommend a

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.560 
you use a big paper actually recommend a
paper<00:03:05.130> that's<00:03:05.820> maybe<00:03:06.000> like<00:03:06.390> 12<00:03:07.020> by<00:03:07.440> 12<00:03:07.800> inch<00:03:08.160> or

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
paper that's maybe like 12 by 12 inch or

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.680 
paper that's maybe like 12 by 12 inch or
30<00:03:09.570> by<00:03:09.750> 30<00:03:10.020> centimeters<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:11.090> actually<00:03:12.090> had<00:03:12.480> to

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
30 by 30 centimeters I actually had to

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:22.820 
30 by 30 centimeters I actually had to
use<00:03:12.720> half<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:16.550> anyway<00:03:17.550> ace<00:03:17.820> 20<00:03:18.600> on<00:03:20.960> you<00:03:21.960> start

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
use half that anyway ace 20 on you start

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.450 
use half that anyway ace 20 on you start
to<00:03:22.890> kind<00:03:23.550> of<00:03:23.670> fold<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.510> half<00:03:24.540> here<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.460> you

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
to kind of fold it in half here and you

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.520 
to kind of fold it in half here and you
have<00:03:26.610> completed<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:29.360> so<00:03:30.360> it's<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:30.990> basic<00:03:31.350> body

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
have completed it so it's the basic body

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.860 
have completed it so it's the basic body
of<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:31.800> alien<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:35.120> know<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> just<00:03:36.360> jumped<00:03:36.750> into

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
of the alien I know I just jumped into

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.420 
of the alien I know I just jumped into
this<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.670> my<00:03:38.670> camera's<00:03:39.450> memory<00:03:40.440> stick<00:03:40.920> kind

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
this but my camera's memory stick kind

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.240 
this but my camera's memory stick kind
of<00:03:41.580> ran<00:03:42.510> out<00:03:42.540> of<00:03:42.690> space<00:03:42.959> and<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.890> didn't<00:03:44.130> even

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
of ran out of space and I didn't even

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.660 
of ran out of space and I didn't even
realize<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.870> so<00:03:45.870> I'm<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.890> little<00:03:46.980> bit<00:03:47.190> ahead<00:03:47.280> so

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
realize it so I'm a little bit ahead so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.640 
realize it so I'm a little bit ahead so
I'll<00:03:47.790> just<00:03:47.940> unfold<00:03:48.090> back<00:03:48.570> a<00:03:48.600> few<00:03:48.990> steps<00:03:49.080> to

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
I'll just unfold back a few steps to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.820 
I'll just unfold back a few steps to
where<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.490> left<00:03:50.820> off<00:03:54.200> all<00:03:55.200> right<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.709> where

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
where I left off all right this is where

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.880 
where I left off all right this is where
I<00:03:55.860> was<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.990> we're<00:03:57.990> gonna<00:03:58.110> start<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.530> develop

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
I was and we're gonna start to develop

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.050 
I was and we're gonna start to develop
the<00:03:59.010> spikes<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.800> have<00:04:01.950> a<00:04:01.980> flap<00:04:02.310> here<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.940> a

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
the spikes so you have a flap here and a

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.870 
the spikes so you have a flap here and a
flap<00:04:03.450> up<00:04:03.750> top<00:04:04.080> right<00:04:04.110> here<00:04:04.470> you<00:04:05.430> fold<00:04:05.670> them

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
flap up top right here you fold them

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:12.670 
flap up top right here you fold them
both<00:04:07.190> well<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.370> fold<00:04:08.580> one<00:04:08.790> in<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.320> then<00:04:11.150> you

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
both well you fold one in and then you

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.180 
both well you fold one in and then you
fold<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.860> over<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:15.810> start<00:04:16.109> making<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.890> general

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
fold it over to start making the general

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.150 
fold it over to start making the general
shape<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.640> the<00:04:17.700> spike<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:19.260> fold<00:04:19.530> it<00:04:19.650> in<00:04:19.830> and

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
shape of the spike you fold it in and

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.409 
shape of the spike you fold it in and
you<00:04:20.400> fold<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.790> over<00:04:21.830> then<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.340> will<00:04:23.580> pinch<00:04:24.210> it

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
you fold it over then you will pinch it

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:33.020 
you fold it over then you will pinch it
and<00:04:25.430> then<00:04:26.540> curve<00:04:27.540> it<00:04:27.870> up<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:30.570> pinch<00:04:30.990> it

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
and then curve it up and you pinch it

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.300 
and then curve it up and you pinch it
and<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:34.010> curve<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.190> up<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.500> that's<00:04:38.100> what<00:04:38.280> that

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
and you curve it up so that's what that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.520 
and you curve it up so that's what that
looks<00:04:38.700> like<00:04:40.850> and<00:04:41.870> you<00:04:42.870> do<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.110> same<00:04:43.260> thing<00:04:43.410> to

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
looks like and you do the same thing to

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:49.970 
looks like and you do the same thing to
the<00:04:43.620> other<00:04:43.650> side<00:04:44.090> down<00:04:46.100> over<00:04:48.800> engines

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
the other side down over engines

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.930 
the other side down over engines
anchor<00:04:50.490> it<00:04:50.520> up<00:04:50.640> agents<00:04:52.370> say<00:04:53.370> no<00:04:53.580> I<00:04:53.610> got<00:04:53.820> it

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
anchor it up agents say no I got it

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.370 
anchor it up agents say no I got it
spikes<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.510> back<00:04:54.690> here<00:04:56.870> you<00:04:57.870> then<00:04:58.050> fold

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
spikes on the back here you then fold

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.960 
spikes on the back here you then fold
down<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.560> arms<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:02.280> long<00:05:02.460> piece<00:05:02.670> of<00:05:02.700> paper

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
down the arms this long piece of paper

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.070 
down the arms this long piece of paper
is<00:05:03.210> gonna<00:05:03.330> be<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.690> head

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
is gonna be the head

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.470 
is gonna be the head
so<00:05:04.320> we'll<00:05:04.500> start<00:05:04.680> developing<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.480> you're

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
so we'll start developing that you're

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.860 
so we'll start developing that you're
going<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.840> start<00:05:07.470> precreasing<00:05:08.010> by<00:05:08.760> folding<00:05:09.720> it

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
going to start precreasing by folding it

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.060 
going to start precreasing by folding it
back<00:05:10.220> straight<00:05:11.220> back<00:05:11.400> like<00:05:11.460> that<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:13.070> then

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
back straight back like that and then

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:22.600 
back straight back like that and then
you<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.000> an<00:05:15.090> outside<00:05:15.419> reverse<00:05:15.720> fold

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.330 

and<00:05:22.699> then<00:05:23.949> you<00:05:24.949> can<00:05:25.129> see<00:05:25.599> you're<00:05:26.599> going<00:05:26.810> to

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
and then you can see you're going to

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.499 
and then you can see you're going to
fold<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.550> back<00:05:28.580> for<00:05:29.479> a<00:05:30.550> pre<00:05:31.550> crease<00:05:31.789> and<00:05:32.560> then

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:34.509 
fold it back for a pre crease and then

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:42.070 
fold it back for a pre crease and then
do<00:05:35.509> another<00:05:35.659> outside<00:05:36.199> reverse<00:05:36.469> fold

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.839 

from<00:05:42.680> there<00:05:43.629> you<00:05:44.629> are<00:05:44.659> going<00:05:44.810> to<00:05:45.639> fold<00:05:46.639> it

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:46.849 
from there you are going to fold it

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:56.140 
from there you are going to fold it
inwards<00:05:54.069> I<00:05:55.069> realize<00:05:55.610> I<00:05:55.699> just<00:05:55.729> do<00:05:55.940> that<00:05:56.060> all

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
inwards I realize I just do that all

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.469 
inwards I realize I just do that all
off-camera<00:05:56.629> but<00:05:57.250> that's<00:05:58.250> what<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.580> is<00:05:58.699> it's

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
off-camera but that's what it is it's

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.610 
off-camera but that's what it is it's
basically<00:05:59.870> just<00:05:59.960> zigzagging<00:06:00.620> in<00:06:02.530> and<00:06:03.530> you

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
basically just zigzagging in and you

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:09.060 
basically just zigzagging in and you
push<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:03.979> all<00:06:04.069> in

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.920 

fold<00:06:09.670> it<00:06:09.760> in<00:06:09.880> half<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:10.270> then<00:06:10.360> go<00:06:10.570> ahead<00:06:10.720> and

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
fold it in half and then go ahead and

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.830 
fold it in half and then go ahead and
let<00:06:11.410> a<00:06:11.470> little<00:06:11.770> bit<00:06:11.920> come<00:06:12.280> out<00:06:12.630> for<00:06:13.630> our<00:06:13.690> mouth

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
let a little bit come out for our mouth

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.540 
let a little bit come out for our mouth
and<00:06:15.630> from<00:06:16.630> there<00:06:16.840> you<00:06:17.230> are<00:06:17.260> going<00:06:17.380> to<00:06:17.800> start<00:06:18.340> to

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
and from there you are going to start to

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.850 
and from there you are going to start to
basically<00:06:19.120> develop<00:06:19.390> the<00:06:19.690> body<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:20.440> are<00:06:20.560> going

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
basically develop the body you are going

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.240 
basically develop the body you are going
to<00:06:21.100> make<00:06:21.550> the<00:06:23.490> body<00:06:24.490> a<00:06:24.610> little<00:06:24.760> more<00:06:24.910> full<00:06:25.570> by

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
to make the body a little more full by

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:34.770 
to make the body a little more full by
opening<00:06:27.250> this<00:06:27.430> up

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.080 

and<00:06:34.870> if<00:06:35.800> you<00:06:35.890> notice<00:06:36.220> this<00:06:36.700> should<00:06:36.940> have

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
and if you notice this should have

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.230 
and if you notice this should have
pushed<00:06:37.360> down<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.840> little<00:06:38.830> bit<00:06:38.950> of<00:06:39.130> paper<00:06:39.790> here

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
pushed down a little bit of paper here

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:50.160 
pushed down a little bit of paper here
you're<00:06:40.930> going<00:06:41.080> to<00:06:41.200> fold<00:06:41.380> that<00:06:41.530> in<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:49.170> that

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
you're going to fold that in so that

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.400 
you're going to fold that in so that
allowed<00:06:50.470> for<00:06:50.800> more<00:06:51.460> space<00:06:51.730> for<00:06:51.760> the<00:06:52.030> body

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:52.410 
allowed for more space for the body

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:58.470 
allowed for more space for the body
makes<00:06:53.410> it<00:06:53.560> look<00:06:53.740> fuller<00:06:56.820> from<00:06:57.820> here<00:06:58.150> you<00:06:58.390> are
