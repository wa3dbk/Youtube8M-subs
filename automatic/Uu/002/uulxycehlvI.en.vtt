00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hi folks Kevin Inkster here I just want

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.660 
hi folks Kevin Inkster here I just want
to<00:00:08.640> share<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.180> a<00:00:09.210> few<00:00:09.510> ideas<00:00:09.750> on<00:00:10.260> how<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:10.670 
to share with you a few ideas on how to

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.369 
to share with you a few ideas on how to
how<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.730> fit<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.360> how<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.600> use<00:00:12.930> the<00:00:13.200> new

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:13.379 
how to fit and how to use the new

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.090 
how to fit and how to use the new
adapter<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> contour<00:00:14.760> sander<00:00:15.209> so<00:00:16.100> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
adapter for the contour sander so the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.740 
adapter for the contour sander so the
contour<00:00:17.400> sander<00:00:17.820> originally<00:00:18.240> comes<00:00:18.510> with<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
contour sander originally comes with a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.480 
contour sander originally comes with a
little<00:00:19.140> hex<00:00:19.350> nut<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.650> fits<00:00:20.039> straight<00:00:20.310> onto

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
little hex nut and fits straight onto

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.750 
little hex nut and fits straight onto
your<00:00:20.670> angle<00:00:21.030> grinder<00:00:21.330> like<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:21.920> and<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.640> we

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
your angle grinder like so and what we

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.460 
your angle grinder like so and what we
do<00:00:23.910> is<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.179> take<00:00:24.390> out<00:00:24.599> that<00:00:24.630> hex<00:00:24.990> nut<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
do is we take out that hex nut and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.230 
do is we take out that hex nut and
replace<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.009> with<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.779> plastic<00:00:27.779> flange<00:00:28.380> and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
replace it with this plastic flange and

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.210 
replace it with this plastic flange and
countersunk<00:00:30.240> screw<00:00:30.720> now<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.529> idea<00:00:31.890> here<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
countersunk screw now the idea here is

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.370 
countersunk screw now the idea here is
that<00:00:32.369> if<00:00:33.330> you<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.720> problem<00:00:34.080> of<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that if you have the problem of the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.020 
that if you have the problem of the
sanding<00:00:34.770> disc<00:00:34.950> coming<00:00:35.280> off<00:00:35.400> you<00:00:35.580> can<00:00:35.790> just

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
sanding disc coming off you can just

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
sanding disc coming off you can just
punch<00:00:36.240> this<00:00:36.540> through<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.730> locate<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
punch this through and locate the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
punch this through and locate the
sanding<00:00:39.270> disc<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.989> makes<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.320> stay

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
sanding disc and that just makes it stay

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.950 
sanding disc and that just makes it stay
on<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.800> lot<00:00:40.980> longer<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.719> use

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
on a lot longer and you now can use

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.260 
on a lot longer and you now can use
sanding<00:00:43.829> discs<00:00:44.100> which<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.399> no<00:00:44.579> adhesive<00:00:45.120> as

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
sanding discs which have no adhesive as

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.560 
sanding discs which have no adhesive as
well<00:00:45.480> now<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:45.989> new<00:00:46.350> model<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.829> sander<00:00:47.570> the

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
well now the new model of the sander the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
well now the new model of the sander the
early<00:00:48.750> ones<00:00:48.930> were<00:00:48.989> red<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> new<00:00:50.039> model

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
early ones were red that the new model

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
early ones were red that the new model
is<00:00:50.460> now<00:00:50.609> black<00:00:50.850> it's<00:00:51.090> virtually<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> same<00:00:51.690> but

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
is now black it's virtually the same but

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
be just hand tightness but if it is too

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
be just hand tightness but if it is too
tight<00:01:27.210> then<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.630> use<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> pair<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.140> pliers<00:01:28.320> or

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
tight then just use a pair of pliers or

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
tight then just use a pair of pliers or
a<00:01:28.650> spanner<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> hold<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> aluminum<00:01:30.329> component

a spanner to hold the aluminum component

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
a spanner to hold the aluminum component
and<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.259> unthread<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.390> comes

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and then just unthread it like so comes

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.730 
and then just unthread it like so comes
across<00:01:33.600> quite<00:01:34.470> easily<00:01:35.090> now<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.740> remove

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
across quite easily now then you remove

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670 
across quite easily now then you remove
the<00:01:38.090> screw<00:01:39.090> from<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> center<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.079> hex<00:01:40.470> head

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.120 
the screw from the center the hex head
screw<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.909> bolt<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> take<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> hex<00:01:43.920> head

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
screw or bolt so I take the hex head

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.149 
screw or bolt so I take the hex head
bolt<00:01:44.399> out<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.390> simply<00:01:45.869> replace<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.530> with

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
bolt out and I simply replace it with

the flange and the screw will come in a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
the flange and the screw will come in a
pack<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.630> with<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.960> allen<00:01:58.320> keys

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
pack like so with a little allen keys

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.499 
pack like so with a little allen keys
which<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.520> tighten<00:01:59.759> etc<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.450> I

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
which you can use to tighten etc but I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.539 
which you can use to tighten etc but I
have<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:00.840> found<00:02:01.289> it<00:02:01.950> works<00:02:02.189> really<00:02:02.430> well

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
have actually found it works really well

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.289 
have actually found it works really well
if<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.240> bit<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.539> superglue<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.880> glue

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
if I get a bit of superglue and glue

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.830 
if I get a bit of superglue and glue
them<00:02:06.539> together<00:02:08.300> literally<00:02:09.300> takes<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.660> few

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
them together literally takes a few

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.070 
them together literally takes a few
seconds<00:02:10.259> look<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.700> put<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.420> just

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
seconds look so put that in and just

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.700 
seconds look so put that in and just
superglue<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.130> in<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:15.200> you'll<00:02:16.200> find<00:02:16.500> that

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
superglue that in and you'll find that

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.850 
superglue that in and you'll find that
you<00:02:16.800> never<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> use

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
you never have to use

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.600 
you never have to use
the<00:02:17.970> L&amp;K<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.030> all<00:02:19.240> because<00:02:19.600> it'll<00:02:20.050> always

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the L&amp;K at all because it'll always

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.850 
the L&amp;K at all because it'll always
twist<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.790> locate<00:02:22.150> itself<00:02:22.540> very<00:02:22.750> well<00:02:22.860> so

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
twist and locate itself very well so

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.910 
twist and locate itself very well so
here<00:02:24.850> we<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.120> it<00:02:25.210> here<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.630> put<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.500> like<00:02:26.680> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
here we have it here I put it in like so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.190 
here we have it here I put it in like so
and<00:02:27.220> now<00:02:27.280> if<00:02:28.000> I<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.150> put<00:02:28.420> it<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.840> angle

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
and now if I just put it on to the angle

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.810 
and now if I just put it on to the angle
grinder<00:02:30.000> onto<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.120> shaft

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
grinder onto the shaft

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.950 
grinder onto the shaft
it'll<00:02:33.820> thread<00:02:34.120> straight<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.690> use

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
it'll thread straight on now you can use

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.540 
it'll thread straight on now you can use
the<00:02:38.440> flange<00:02:38.860> with<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.210> adhesive-backed

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the flange with the adhesive-backed

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.080 
the flange with the adhesive-backed
sanding<00:02:42.550> discs<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.570> can<00:02:43.750> use<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:45.090> without

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
sanding discs or you can use it without

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.660 
sanding discs or you can use it without
adhesive<00:02:46.930> back<00:02:47.110> sanding<00:02:47.500> discs<00:02:47.770> so<00:02:47.950> first<00:02:48.550> of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
adhesive back sanding discs so first of

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.910 
adhesive back sanding discs so first of
all<00:02:48.870> I'll<00:02:49.870> show<00:02:49.930> you<00:02:50.260> just<00:02:50.470> do<00:02:50.560> with<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.709> normal

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
all I'll show you just do with a normal

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.820 
all I'll show you just do with a normal
adhesive<00:02:51.690> disk<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.920> simply<00:02:55.050> place<00:02:56.050> the<00:02:56.320> the

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
adhesive disk you simply place the the

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.530 
adhesive disk you simply place the the
adhesive<00:02:57.370> disk<00:02:57.520> straight<00:02:57.850> over<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.150> top<00:02:58.180> like

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
adhesive disk straight over the top like

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.900 
adhesive disk straight over the top like
so<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.680> really<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.190> like<00:03:00.400> these<00:03:00.610> paper

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
so now I really do like these paper

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.470 
so now I really do like these paper
discs<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:02.310> we<00:03:03.310> have<00:03:03.489> had<00:03:03.670> people<00:03:03.700> complain

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
discs and we have had people complain

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.870 
discs and we have had people complain
that<00:03:04.510> they<00:03:04.810> come<00:03:05.020> off<00:03:05.170> too<00:03:05.380> fast<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.010> they

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
that they come off too fast and they

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.770 
that they come off too fast and they
acknowledge<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:08.580> we<00:03:09.580> tried<00:03:10.060> all<00:03:10.270> kinds<00:03:10.300> of

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
acknowledge that we tried all kinds of

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.050 
acknowledge that we tried all kinds of
different<00:03:10.989> ways<00:03:11.770> of<00:03:11.980> attaching<00:03:12.280> sanding

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
different ways of attaching sanding

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.330 
different ways of attaching sanding
discs<00:03:13.300> with<00:03:13.480> velcro<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.230> other<00:03:14.890> things<00:03:15.190> and

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
discs with velcro and other things and

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.420 
discs with velcro and other things and
they<00:03:15.430> all<00:03:15.459> had<00:03:15.760> their<00:03:15.880> problems<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
they all had their problems and the the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.760 
they all had their problems and the the
adhesive<00:03:18.880> was<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.270> best<00:03:19.540> by<00:03:20.110> far<00:03:20.140> the<00:03:20.560> best

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
adhesive was the best by far the best

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.170 
adhesive was the best by far the best
and<00:03:21.130> most<00:03:21.850> flexible<00:03:22.060> so<00:03:23.519> it<00:03:24.519> does<00:03:24.730> do<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> very

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
and most flexible so it does do a very

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.690 
and most flexible so it does do a very
very<00:03:25.360> fine<00:03:25.570> job<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.170> once<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:26.739> gets<00:03:26.950> very<00:03:27.220> hot

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
very fine job but once it gets very hot

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.900 
very fine job but once it gets very hot
the<00:03:28.480> adhesive<00:03:28.959> can<00:03:29.170> give<00:03:29.380> way<00:03:29.590> so<00:03:30.070> now<00:03:30.700> it's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
the adhesive can give way so now it's

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:40.650 
the adhesive can give way so now it's
just<00:03:30.970> beautiful<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.690> doing<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:31.989> sanding<00:03:32.350> so

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.580 

they<00:03:41.660> say<00:03:43.360> even<00:03:44.360> with<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> flange<00:03:45.080> you<00:03:45.470> can

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
they say even with the flange you can

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.680 
they say even with the flange you can
just<00:03:45.800> stick<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.400> adhesive<00:03:46.849> on<00:03:46.970> over<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.480> top

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
just stick the adhesive on over the top

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.809 
just stick the adhesive on over the top
if<00:03:48.140> you<00:03:48.230> do<00:03:48.500> have<00:03:48.680> problems<00:03:48.950> with<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.489> sanding

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
if you do have problems with the sanding

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.000 
if you do have problems with the sanding
discs<00:03:50.000> coming<00:03:50.269> off<00:03:50.420> it's<00:03:51.110> usually<00:03:51.410> because

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
discs coming off it's usually because

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.800 
discs coming off it's usually because
you've<00:03:52.190> got<00:03:53.769> sort<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.890> residue<00:03:55.480> adhesive<00:03:56.480> or

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
you've got sort of residue adhesive or

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.070 
you've got sort of residue adhesive or
wood<00:03:57.110> dust<00:03:57.349> on<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.519> pad<00:03:58.849> and<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.780> remove

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
wood dust on the pad and you can remove

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.720 
wood dust on the pad and you can remove
that<00:04:00.290> very<00:04:00.470> very<00:04:00.620> quickly<00:04:00.950> by<00:04:01.190> just<00:04:01.400> running

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
that very very quickly by just running

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.940 
that very very quickly by just running
the<00:04:01.910> disc<00:04:02.599> without<00:04:02.810> the<00:04:03.110> pad<00:04:03.319> onto<00:04:03.530> something

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
the disc without the pad onto something

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.660 
the disc without the pad onto something
soft<00:04:04.280> like<00:04:04.810> rubber<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:06.980> will<00:04:07.280> rub<00:04:07.459> the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
soft like rubber and that will rub the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.460 
soft like rubber and that will rub the
residue<00:04:08.390> off<00:04:08.420> so<00:04:08.810> that's<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.080> quick<00:04:09.230> way<00:04:09.290> to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
residue off so that's a quick way to

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.860 
residue off so that's a quick way to
clean<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:09.950> but<00:04:10.580> if<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:10.940> still<00:04:11.599> having

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
clean it but if you still having

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:20.580 
clean it but if you still having
problems<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.530> can<00:04:13.040> simply<00:04:15.639> undo<00:04:16.639> the<00:04:16.790> pad

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.420 

push<00:04:21.280> the<00:04:21.459> screw<00:04:21.730> out<00:04:21.820> whoop<00:04:22.449> sorry<00:04:23.280> push<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
push the screw out whoop sorry push the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.310 
push the screw out whoop sorry push the
screw<00:04:24.669> out<00:04:24.820> so<00:04:25.540> now<00:04:25.690> I'll<00:04:25.870> put<00:04:25.900> the<00:04:26.199> adhesive

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
screw out so now I'll put the adhesive

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.710 
screw out so now I'll put the adhesive
pad<00:04:26.889> straight<00:04:27.280> the<00:04:27.910> behaves<00:04:28.330> you've<00:04:28.480> just

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
pad straight the behaves you've just

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.620 
pad straight the behaves you've just
straight<00:04:28.990> onto<00:04:29.139> the<00:04:29.260> pad<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.770> so<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.449> then<00:04:31.449> I

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
straight onto the pad like so and then I

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.240 
straight onto the pad like so and then I
just<00:04:31.810> push<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.729> screw<00:04:33.729> through<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.060> center

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
just push the screw through the center

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.870 
just push the screw through the center
now<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.310> flange<00:04:36.699> now<00:04:37.030> locates<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.840> disc<00:04:38.229> and

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
now the flange now locates the disc and

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.480 
now the flange now locates the disc and
it<00:04:39.880> won't<00:04:40.120> come<00:04:40.330> off

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
it won't come off

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.980 
it won't come off
now<00:04:42.490> the<00:04:42.880> difference<00:04:43.240> is<00:04:43.389> that<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.690> flange

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
now the difference is that the flange

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.409 
now the difference is that the flange
does<00:04:44.290> get<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> little<00:04:44.830> bit<00:04:44.949> in<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.160> way<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
does get a little bit in the way so

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.730 
does get a little bit in the way so
that's<00:04:46.419> not<00:04:46.660> really<00:04:46.990> good<00:04:47.229> when<00:04:47.410> you're<00:04:47.530> doing

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
that's not really good when you're doing

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.189 
that's not really good when you're doing
external<00:04:48.690> sanding<00:04:49.690> but<00:04:49.780> when<00:04:49.930> it<00:04:50.050> you're

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
external sanding but when it you're

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.350 
external sanding but when it you're
doing<00:04:50.350> internal<00:04:50.949> sanding<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.850> doesn't<00:04:52.210> seem

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
doing internal sanding it doesn't seem

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.360 
doing internal sanding it doesn't seem
to<00:04:52.479> get<00:04:52.570> in<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.750> way<00:04:52.870> at<00:04:52.990> all<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:53.410> if<00:04:54.190> you're

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
to get in the way at all and if you're

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.920 
to get in the way at all and if you're
always<00:04:54.490> aware<00:04:54.910> of<00:04:54.970> that<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.570> put<00:04:55.690> it<00:04:55.780> on<00:04:55.870> a

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
always aware of that just put it on a

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.629 
always aware of that just put it on a
slight<00:04:56.200> angle<00:04:56.380> you'll<00:04:56.710> find<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.070> it<00:04:57.220> flexes

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
slight angle you'll find that it flexes

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:12.209 
slight angle you'll find that it flexes
nicely<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.540> it'll<00:04:58.720> get<00:04:58.900> right<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.350> corner

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.889 

you'll<00:05:13.219> find<00:05:13.550> that<00:05:13.879> the<00:05:14.059> sanding<00:05:14.449> this<00:05:14.599> now

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:14.899 
you'll find that the sanding this now

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:17.639 
you'll find that the sanding this now
lasts<00:05:15.289> about<00:05:15.379> five<00:05:15.800> times<00:05:16.520> longer<00:05:16.849> than<00:05:17.029> the

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649 
lasts about five times longer than the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:20.529 
lasts about five times longer than the
adhesive<00:05:18.649> disk<00:05:18.830> just<00:05:19.669> stuck<00:05:20.149> on<00:05:20.179> to<00:05:20.449> the

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
adhesive disk just stuck on to the

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:20.949 
adhesive disk just stuck on to the
rubber

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:20.959 
rubber

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:22.899 
rubber
however<00:05:21.679> after<00:05:21.979> a<00:05:22.189> while<00:05:22.339> especially<00:05:22.819> if

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:22.909 
however after a while especially if

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.820 
however after a while especially if
you're<00:05:22.999> doing<00:05:23.179> a<00:05:23.240> lot<00:05:23.389> of<00:05:23.419> severe<00:05:23.839> flexing<00:05:24.439> you

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
you're doing a lot of severe flexing you

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.439 
you're doing a lot of severe flexing you
might<00:05:25.069> find<00:05:25.309> that<00:05:25.459> it<00:05:25.580> starts<00:05:25.879> to<00:05:26.029> give<00:05:26.240> away

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
might find that it starts to give away

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:29.469 
might find that it starts to give away
at<00:05:26.629> the<00:05:26.779> edges<00:05:26.990> and<00:05:27.379> starts<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.339> crease<00:05:29.119> the

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
at the edges and starts to crease the

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.909 
at the edges and starts to crease the
paper<00:05:29.899> now<00:05:30.879> we<00:05:31.879> found<00:05:32.209> with<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.809> cloth<00:05:33.649> back

pocketknife or something and just cut a
little<00:06:00.440> cross<00:06:00.889> then<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:01.910> the<00:06:02.330> flange<00:06:02.990> will<00:06:03.230> go

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
little cross then the the flange will go

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.730 
little cross then the the flange will go
through<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.700> but<00:06:05.450> with<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:06.260> ones<00:06:06.440> which

the contour sander in future packs as

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.719 
the contour sander in future packs as
well<00:06:16.030> so<00:06:17.030> these<00:06:17.540> disks<00:06:18.050> last<00:06:18.919> a<00:06:19.250> long<00:06:19.550> long

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
well so these disks last a long long

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.659 
well so these disks last a long long
time<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.150> is<00:06:20.210> 120<00:06:20.810> grit<00:06:21.200> this<00:06:21.410> one<00:06:21.590> it's<00:06:22.550> got

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.159 
put the flange in through the through
the<00:06:27.919> paper<00:06:28.160> like<00:06:28.490> so<00:06:28.729> put<00:06:29.690> the<00:06:29.810> disc<00:06:29.990> back<00:06:30.169> on

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169 
the paper like so put the disc back on

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.960 
the paper like so put the disc back on
and<00:06:33.169> just<00:06:33.560> hand<00:06:33.800> tighten<00:06:34.130> there's<00:06:34.460> no<00:06:34.610> need<00:06:34.820> to

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:34.970 
and just hand tighten there's no need to

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.659 
and just hand tighten there's no need to
over<00:06:35.300> tighten<00:06:35.570> this<00:06:36.070> you'll<00:06:37.070> feel<00:06:37.310> when<00:06:37.520> it

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
over tighten this you'll feel when it

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:40.450 
over tighten this you'll feel when it
reaches<00:06:38.000> the<00:06:38.180> bottom<00:06:38.450> of<00:06:38.570> the<00:06:38.690> flange<00:06:39.460> there

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
reaches the bottom of the flange there

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.850 
reaches the bottom of the flange there
it<00:06:40.550> is<00:06:40.700> so<00:06:41.180> it's<00:06:41.330> nice<00:06:41.479> and<00:06:41.690> tight<00:06:41.870> you'll<00:06:42.530> find

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
it is so it's nice and tight you'll find

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.590 
it is so it's nice and tight you'll find
that<00:06:43.040> this<00:06:43.220> sanding<00:06:43.639> this<00:06:43.760> will<00:06:44.000> last<00:06:44.180> almost

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
that this sanding this will last almost

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.810 
that this sanding this will last almost
indefinitely<00:06:45.320> I've<00:06:45.590> been<00:06:45.800> using<00:06:46.010> this<00:06:46.250> quite

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
indefinitely I've been using this quite

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.969 
indefinitely I've been using this quite
extent<00:06:47.270> extensively<00:06:48.229> over<00:06:48.350> the<00:06:48.560> last<00:06:48.620> few

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
extent extensively over the last few

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:50.590 
extent extensively over the last few
days<00:06:49.190> and<00:06:49.310> I<00:06:49.400> haven't<00:06:49.729> worn<00:06:49.880> out<00:06:50.060> any<00:06:50.270> of<00:06:50.450> these

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:50.600 
days and I haven't worn out any of these

00:06:50.600 --> 00:07:05.600 
days and I haven't worn out any of these
discs<00:06:51.080> so<00:06:51.680> here<00:06:51.830> we<00:06:51.890> go

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:05.610 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:08.400 

so<00:07:06.610> that's<00:07:06.790> the<00:07:07.030> flange<00:07:07.510> you<00:07:07.780> can<00:07:07.930> see<00:07:08.139> I<00:07:08.169> can

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
so that's the flange you can see I can

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.060 
so that's the flange you can see I can
use<00:07:08.560> that<00:07:08.590> either<00:07:08.949> hold<00:07:09.340> on<00:07:09.550> and<00:07:11.070> sanding

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:12.070 
use that either hold on and sanding

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.340 
use that either hold on and sanding
discs<00:07:12.340> with<00:07:12.550> no<00:07:12.729> adhesive<00:07:13.030> on<00:07:13.389> them<00:07:13.570> or<00:07:13.720> I<00:07:13.750> can

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350 
discs with no adhesive on them or I can

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.379 
discs with no adhesive on them or I can
use<00:07:14.380> the<00:07:14.650> adhesive<00:07:14.770> disks<00:07:15.400> over<00:07:15.520> the<00:07:16.000> top<00:07:16.210> or

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:16.389 
use the adhesive disks over the top or

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:19.770 
use the adhesive disks over the top or
through<00:07:16.449> the<00:07:17.410> flange<00:07:17.740> either<00:07:18.639> way<00:07:18.940> it<00:07:19.479> seems

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:19.780 
through the flange either way it seems

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.379 
through the flange either way it seems
to<00:07:19.870> solve<00:07:20.199> all<00:07:20.440> of<00:07:20.470> the<00:07:20.620> problems<00:07:21.030> so<00:07:22.030> well

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389 
to solve all of the problems so well

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.150 
to solve all of the problems so well
hope<00:07:22.780> you<00:07:22.900> enjoy<00:07:23.110> using<00:07:23.320> it<00:07:23.560> thank<00:07:23.919> you<00:07:24.010> very

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 
hope you enjoy using it thank you very

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.310 
hope you enjoy using it thank you very
