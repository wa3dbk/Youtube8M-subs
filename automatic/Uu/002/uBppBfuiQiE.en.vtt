00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.600
 he survived the apocalypse in a way 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.920

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.500
 here 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 Tell us how you survived the 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.030
 solar radiation but when everything 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.720
 it started 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.720
 sorry 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:15.300
 I was in the gym the gym 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.190
 I guess doing a lot of arm from 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 the beginning we go in parts if you were 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.320
 inside a gym how are you doing 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 so badly burned but I to protect them 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.350
 of solar radiation I wanted to 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.940
 protect then I got in for three 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.940
 days to a tanning bed 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.200
 then because you have the hair 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.420
 also so burnt 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.610
 good when you leave the gym does not 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.170
 there was nobody in the streets I was 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.060
 desperate to find someone 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.420
 then to draw attention to me 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.420
 I set fire 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:58.040
 and then tell how it was that you lost 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.999
 the good arm is that I came running 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.999
 not if understood 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.129
 and just in there many ethno and there 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:11.530
 there was a soda machine 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.530
 then it was easy for me to put my hand 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:21.230
 and it gets stuck 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:25.870
 and what he did good is carrying with me 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.870
 multipurpose knife is this that right now 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:42.560
 with the arm he had this tool 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.990
 why not unscrew the machine 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.200
 to take out the arm 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.110
 juris arrest him if you knew something 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.730
 electricity you would know that it is very 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.030
 dangerous unscrewed disarm it 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.260
 cheap when connected and why 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.420
 do not disconnect from the machine 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.420
 well, that is really conferred asshole 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.049
 it allows me very safe 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640
 do not 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.290
 then he did not remove the onion 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.479
 if we continue to apologize to apologize 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:29.080
 the one of the interruption although we see that 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:32.229
 you do not have bad teeth how it was that the 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.770
 you lost good I able that I suddenly 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:37.749
 comes a horde of zombies and came to a 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.830
 street and to be able to cross I had to 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:44.879
 go through a plague of rats and mice and 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.879
 I 'm not afraid of them 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:51.490
 to an agreement will tell small of the 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.889
 legend of the mouse of the teeth 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.580
 so what are the types and the breath 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.580
 and in chinga 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:05.060
 and all you want to know what it was 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.620
 what happened because people were very 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.540
 he asked saying why it was that 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.320
 they found doing oral sex 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.740
 yourself to me yes because yes because I 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.740
 reached 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:29.210
 like those are full of proteins 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:29.210
 Well, there is not something else 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.600
 in the coming days 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.070
 all right 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.800
 in this sense stationed by the 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.960
 four signs of the apocalypse and already 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.960
