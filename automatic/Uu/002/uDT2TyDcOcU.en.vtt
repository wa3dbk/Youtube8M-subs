the<00:01:59.939> cool<00:02:00.119> part<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.100> actually<00:02:02.280> open

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
the cool part is to if you actually open

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
the cool part is to if you actually open
your<00:02:02.969> door<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:04.259> what<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> did<00:02:04.740> there<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.009> just

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
your door so what I did there is just

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.520 
your door so what I did there is just
press<00:02:05.430> Y<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.119> just<00:02:06.360> hold<00:02:06.869> down<00:02:06.990> on<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
press Y and then just hold down on the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.499 
press Y and then just hold down on the
stick<00:02:07.829> just<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.250> sort<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> run<00:02:08.940> away<00:02:09.179> from<00:02:09.239> your

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
stick just to sort of run away from your

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.720 
stick just to sort of run away from your
door<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.080> leaves<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.379> open

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
door so it leaves it open

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.820 
door so it leaves it open
so<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.840> do<00:02:12.960> leave<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.260> radio<00:02:13.410> running

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
so if you do leave the radio running

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.440 
so if you do leave the radio running
