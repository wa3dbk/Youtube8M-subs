00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
pictures first thing the company did was

tape off the areas that shouldn't be

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.820 
tape off the areas that shouldn't be
painted<00:01:07.050> and<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:07.800> they<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.190> down<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:09.830> layer

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
painted and then they put down a layer

of mocha color on all the cement they

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.910 
of mocha color on all the cement they
use<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.600> wooden<00:01:18.960> patterns<00:01:19.410> to<00:01:19.680> simulate

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
use these wooden patterns to simulate

the<00:01:20.310> sandstone<00:01:20.880> shape<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.670> tool

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
the sandstone shape this is the tool

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
the sandstone shape this is the tool
that<00:01:25.140> they<00:01:25.290> made<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> outline<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.370> the<00:01:26.580> sand

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that they made the outline of the sand

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:42.630 
that they made the outline of the sand
stones<00:01:27.120> with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.070 

these<00:01:43.640> patterns<00:01:44.030> were<00:01:44.180> followed<00:01:44.540> using<00:01:44.930> the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
these patterns were followed using the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.590 
these patterns were followed using the
air<00:01:45.320> driven<00:01:45.590> tool<00:01:45.950> which<00:01:46.670> engraved<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.330> line

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
air driven tool which engraved a line

00:01:47.600 --> 00:02:01.480 
air driven tool which engraved a line
into<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.710> existing<00:01:49.190> concrete

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:09.300 

the<00:02:02.299> air<00:02:02.360> tool<00:02:02.600> was<00:02:02.810> powered<00:02:03.170> by<00:02:03.200> a<00:02:03.350> compressor

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.410

this<00:02:34.460> is<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.850> looked<00:02:35.060> like<00:02:35.210> after<00:02:35.450> the

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
this is what it looked like after the

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.710 
this is what it looked like after the
sandstone<00:02:36.200> patterns<00:02:37.060> had<00:02:38.060> been<00:02:38.330> engraved

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
sandstone patterns had been engraved

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:58.780 
sandstone patterns had been engraved
into<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> concrete

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.510 

here<00:02:59.790> it<00:02:59.879> is<00:02:59.969> cleaned<00:03:00.299> up<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.540> bit

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
here it is cleaned up a bit

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.400 
here it is cleaned up a bit
a<00:03:04.970> few<00:03:05.970> days<00:03:06.090> later<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.570> layer<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.140> concrete

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
a few days later a layer of concrete

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:31.400 
a few days later a layer of concrete
sealer<00:03:08.160> was<00:03:08.790> applied
