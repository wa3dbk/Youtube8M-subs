00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:09.500
 electronic school monte 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.430
 good afternoon guys welcome 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.410
 saleh to the electronics lab 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.450
 digital electronic analog 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.280
 here you see what the second semester is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.860
 which is analog and the third semester 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.150
 that is digital the idea that they come to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.860
 these laboratories that know what 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.350
 you have each one of them and see 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 you realize that what in 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 a moment they will require for the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.300
 next courses that are going to start that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.790
 they are the sabatinos from day 29 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.309
 then that you realize 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.949
 can draw their conclusions that courses 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.469
 will interest you then what 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.690
 we do is all the boards 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.850
 that you see manufactured are the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.530
 same boys are final works 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.559
 each of the boards 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.829
 the components that they have you have to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.390
 know how each of them works 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.069
 then there are all types of everything 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.989
 what analog types are where they have 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:03.640
 what is power sections 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.310
 digital analog 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.240
 if one serves to manufacture alarms there 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.189
 goes 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.820
 any other circuit circuits 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.619
 activation of a load can be changed 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.000
 the load by different types can be 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.890
 also single-phase alternating current 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.470
 Three-phase can be motors at each 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.590
 sensors 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.560
 of presence to count objects or 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.270
 detect any item, we have 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.150
 a lot of variety the modules that they see 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.860
 you here in the back boys is 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.180
 where the tests of each one are made 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.460
 of the components that you see in the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.830
 theory then that theory comes it 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.930
 check in practice to verify 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.910
 it really works as they say the 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.710
 theory and take out details that no more 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.480
 they see some problems in practice 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.470
 then each of the boards are 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.610
 trailers to work with both 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.610
 analog electronics as digital 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.190
 the other boards also have 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.910
 different types of systems with this 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.600
 case for the audio stages there can 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.520
 put an ipad 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.010
 all this also works for the race 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.840
 that divides the second semester that is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.890
 analog and they're going to radio and television 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.750
 in audio good image here in the area of 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.610
 instrumentation that is the career of 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 specialization of this laboratory 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.020
 events the modules what they bring 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.500
 in each circuit each component 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:37.170
 a question that you have any doubt that 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.060
 they want to know to whom of the two types 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.520
 on the board that we have in the background is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.050
 of the digital type that has the three or 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.820
 four electronics we have the train 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.260
 digital canonics and power 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.910
 these are hybrids then there are 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.310
 combination of the three electronic 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.260
 including electricity by this one are 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.650
 starting with basic electricity what 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.959
 race have you which are going 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.060
 floor mechanics today is all the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.370
 areas that the matters or charges that 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.049
 does the school have to 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.000
 need to carry some electronics 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.129
 when you are recommending that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.870
 come to the courses is very important 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.480
 for you although your career does not 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.579
 include it more completely because 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.319
 participate in the courses because that gives them 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.930
 will help your load be more 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.150
 complete and having your card all the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.159
 courses given by the brochures indicate 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.750
 the constancy that is given to them has 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.170
 curricular baroque 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.389
 that is, his career is worth more because 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.519
 that is recommended to them to participate in 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.530
 Latin or summer courses so that 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.480
 When your career is over, go 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.639
 you better prepared to have 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.680
 more likely that they accept them in 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:42.139
 work any faster or power 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.720
 occupy more important positions 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.150
 then that's the advantage to us some 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.730
 equipment and laboratory instruments 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.389
 well this is about us to the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.189
 time to work 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.019
 We try to use as little as possible of 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.760
 equipment tools because what 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.500
 we do with the theory is 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.630
 immediately diagnose the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.580
 type of problem in a computer failure 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.830
 in order to detect that fault we are not 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.930
 they have very good theoretical foundations and the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.700
 practice will help us when it comes to doing 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.170
 repairs at the laboratory level 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.670
 with these instruments are the threads with 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.990
 the winner of signals 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.390
 we have the digital wands 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.820
 tools of all kinds but it 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.310
 try to make the least possible use of 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.950
 they not to be careful to handle 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
 tool your team the idea is to do 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.730
 with clients the most jobs 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.110
 fast and that is affordable from that 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.110
 way we can also have the 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.030
 ease of getting more work 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.920
 because we're going to see the diagnostics and 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.020
 repairs faster because they are looking for 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.360
 what is cost and time that what is 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.660
 normally look for our question 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.660
 many 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.330
 they realized then this what 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:49.370
 we have here we wait for you in the courses 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.370
 welcome follow your tour thanks
