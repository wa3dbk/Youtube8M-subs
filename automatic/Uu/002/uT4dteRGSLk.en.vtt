00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
what enables them to happen how did this

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.110 
what enables them to happen how did this
whole<00:03:26.989> thing<00:03:27.230> come<00:03:27.470> together<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:28.760> what<00:03:28.910> I<00:03:28.940> like

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
whole thing come together so what I like

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.550
