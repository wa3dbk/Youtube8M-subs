really like about it um let's start off

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.700 
really like about it um let's start off
with<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.070> stuff<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.400> don't<00:00:17.460> like<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.990> 36

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710

with the stuff I don't like it is 36
inches<00:00:19.859> long<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.630> yortuk<00:00:21.630> feels<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.619> little

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
inches long and yortuk feels a little

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120 
inches long and yortuk feels a little
cramped<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:24.230> that's<00:00:25.230> something<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
cramped but that's something that you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.580 
cramped but that's something that you
can<00:00:26.279> easily<00:00:26.720> extend<00:00:27.720> your<00:00:27.990> feet<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.260> little<00:00:28.349> bit

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
can easily extend your feet a little bit

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.609 
can easily extend your feet a little bit
and<00:00:29.330> maybe<00:00:30.330> put<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.750> foot<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.260> little<00:00:31.289> bit

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and maybe put your foot a little bit

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.380 
and maybe put your foot a little bit
farther<00:00:31.830> back<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.630> foot<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.770> know

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
farther back and then this foot you know

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.990 
farther back and then this foot you know
slides<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:36.690> bit<00:00:36.870> forward<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:38.000> that

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
slides a little bit forward but that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
slides a little bit forward but that
would<00:00:39.239> probably<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.020> i<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.320> am<00:00:40.559> not<00:00:40.710> used

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
would probably do it i just am not used

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
would probably do it i just am not used
to<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.010> yet<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.640> i<00:00:42.469> also<00:00:43.789> i'm<00:00:44.789> not<00:00:45.180> really

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to it yet but i also i'm not really

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.790 
to it yet but i also i'm not really
looking<00:00:45.510> forward<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:47.059> how<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.390> choppy

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
looking forward to how kind of choppy

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.720 
looking forward to how kind of choppy
the<00:00:49.800> board<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.520> feels<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> little

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
the board is it feels like the little

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
the board is it feels like the little
kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> almost<00:00:54.030> gas<00:00:54.510> pedals<00:00:55.020> over<00:00:55.350> here<00:00:55.649> when

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
kind of almost gas pedals over here when

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
kind of almost gas pedals over here when
you're<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.690> doing<00:00:57.960> those<00:00:58.140> three

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you're when you're doing those three

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.729 
you're when you're doing those three
trips<00:00:58.980> there's<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> rail<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:01.590> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
trips there's a rail here but then it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.429 
trips there's a rail here but then it
just<00:01:01.770> stops<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.609> comes<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:04.229> picks

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
just stops and comes down and then picks

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.730 
just stops and comes down and then picks
back<00:01:04.559> up<00:01:04.739> again<00:01:04.979> over<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.460> um<00:01:06.560> show<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.650> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
back up again over here um show you on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
back up again over here um show you on
the<00:01:07.860> side<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.670> goes<00:01:08.820> straight<00:01:09.299> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the side it kind of goes straight and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.440 
the side it kind of goes straight and
then<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.380> kind<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.189> straightly<00:01:11.970> goes<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
then just kind of straightly goes down

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.609 
then just kind of straightly goes down
and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.290> rail<00:01:13.439> isn't<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.950> sharp<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.659> feel
