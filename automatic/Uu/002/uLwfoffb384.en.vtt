so<00:00:33.870> Martin<00:00:34.230> perhaps<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.829> could<00:00:34.950> start<00:00:35.100> us<00:00:35.399> off

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
so Martin perhaps you could start us off

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.880 
so Martin perhaps you could start us off
by<00:00:35.910> deciphering<00:00:36.270> yet<00:00:36.870> another<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.380> those<00:00:37.530> AV

by deciphering yet another of those AV
acronyms<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.210> HDCP<00:00:39.870> actually<00:00:40.140> stand<00:00:40.500> for

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
acronyms what at HDCP actually stand for

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.069 
acronyms what at HDCP actually stand for
I'm<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.550> designed<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.059> do<00:00:42.210> well

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I'm not so actually designed to do well

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.779 
I'm not so actually designed to do well
as<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.260> say<00:00:43.379> Chris<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.340> another<00:00:44.520> AV

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
as you say Chris it is another AV

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.670 
as you say Chris it is another AV
acronym<00:00:45.300> high<00:00:45.480> bandwidth<00:00:45.899> digital<00:00:46.110> content

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
acronym high bandwidth digital content

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
acronym high bandwidth digital content
protection<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.059> they

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
protection so you can see why they

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
protection so you can see why they
shortened<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.570> HDCP<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.980> basically<00:00:50.370> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
shortened it to HDCP and basically it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
shortened it to HDCP and basically it
was<00:00:50.640> developed<00:00:51.120> by<00:00:51.180> Intel<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.809> it's

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
was developed by Intel and it's

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.920 
was developed by Intel and it's
essentially<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.829> prevent<00:00:53.070> piracy<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
essentially to prevent piracy and the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
essentially to prevent piracy and the
ability<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.260> copy<00:00:55.530> HD<00:00:56.219> images<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> video<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
ability to copy HD images and video and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.420 
ability to copy HD images and video and
audio<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.289> well<00:00:58.469> across<00:00:59.070> peer-to-peer

so<00:01:01.800> what's<00:01:01.980> HDC<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.730> doing<00:01:03.180> within<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> AV

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
so what's HDC be doing within the AV

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.270 
so what's HDC be doing within the AV
system

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280

work<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.210> mentioned<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.659> designed<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
work as I mentioned is designed to

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.510 
work as I mentioned is designed to
prevent<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> digital<00:01:07.650> audio<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.950> video

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.800 
content being copied by third-party
device<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> travels<00:01:12.000> between<00:01:12.090> connections

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
device as it travels between connections

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.840 
device as it travels between connections
so<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> transmitting<00:01:13.710> device<00:01:13.950> delivers<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
so as a transmitting device delivers the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.430 
so as a transmitting device delivers the
content<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.450> then<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> display<00:01:15.900> receives<00:01:16.259> it

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
content and then the display receives it

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.410 
content and then the display receives it
both<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:16.979> which<00:01:17.280> had<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.640> HDCP<00:01:18.390> compliant

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
both of which had to be HDCP compliant

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.990 
both of which had to be HDCP compliant
an<00:01:19.110> able<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.650> pass<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:20.009> HD<00:01:20.460> video<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> audio

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
an able to pass that HD video and audio

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600 
an able to pass that HD video and audio
across<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.409> that's<00:01:22.619> therefore<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.430> can

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
across so that's therefore that this can

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
across so that's therefore that this can
cause<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> HDCP<00:01:24.690> compliance<00:01:25.320> errors<00:01:25.649> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
cause the HDCP compliance errors and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.430 
cause the HDCP compliance errors and
affect<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> success<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.420> signal<00:01:27.780> thus

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
affect the success of the signal thus

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.710 
affect the success of the signal thus
correct<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.979> HDCP<00:01:29.880> basically<00:01:30.479> has<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> be

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
correct the HDCP basically has to be

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
correct the HDCP basically has to be
present<00:01:30.869> on<00:01:31.049> both<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.619> source<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
display if it's present on the source

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
display if it's present on the source
but<00:01:35.159> isn't<00:01:35.369> present<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.850> display<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.659> no

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
but isn't present on the display then no

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.630 
but isn't present on the display then no

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
past if both source and display are

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.950 
past if both source and display are
compliant<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.970> will<00:01:42.119> get<00:01:42.270> video<00:01:42.660> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.450 
compliant and you will get video and
audio<00:01:43.200> being<00:01:43.590> passed<00:01:43.830> between<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.280> both

a things like pcs a can be non HDCP

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.600 
a things like pcs a can be non HDCP
compliant<00:01:58.479> because<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.649> PC<00:01:59.979> the<00:02:00.100> content<00:02:00.490> is

compliant because on a PC the content is
your<00:02:00.759> own<00:02:00.909> although<00:02:01.420> it's<00:02:01.600> digital<00:02:02.049> once<00:02:02.619> you

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
your own although it's digital once you

send it up to a screen it's actually
your<00:02:04.509> own<00:02:04.659> content<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.350> therefore<00:02:05.469> you<00:02:05.740> only

so<00:02:06.130> there's<00:02:06.280> no<00:02:06.429> issues<00:02:06.729> with<00:02:06.850> showing<00:02:07.240> that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so there's no issues with showing that

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.089 
so there's no issues with showing that
across<00:02:07.929> the<00:02:08.110> network<00:02:08.440> or<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.830> know<00:02:08.920> across

across the network or you know across

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.309 
across the network or you know across
the<00:02:09.220> internet<00:02:09.640> as<00:02:09.759> well<00:02:10.050> some<00:02:11.050> other

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
the internet as well some other

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.500 
the internet as well some other
instances<00:02:11.769> are<00:02:12.069> where<00:02:12.489> maybe<00:02:12.849> a<00:02:12.940> broadcaster

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
instances are where maybe a broadcaster

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.449 
instances are where maybe a broadcaster
have<00:02:13.599> got<00:02:13.720> their<00:02:13.870> own<00:02:13.989> content<00:02:14.410> so<00:02:14.920> companies

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
have got their own content so companies

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.640 
have got their own content so companies
like<00:02:15.519> Sky<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.180> BBC<00:02:16.690> own<00:02:17.170> their<00:02:17.500> own

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
like Sky in the BBC own their own

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.080 
like Sky in the BBC own their own
content<00:02:18.099> therefore<00:02:18.310> they<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.849> what<00:02:19.000> they

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
content therefore they can do what they

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.460 
content therefore they can do what they
want<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:19.569> therefore<00:02:19.930> it<00:02:19.989> doesn't<00:02:20.200> have<00:02:20.349> an

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
want to it therefore it doesn't have an

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.400 
want to it therefore it doesn't have an
HD<00:02:20.830> CP<00:02:21.129> compliancy<00:02:21.730> in-house<00:02:22.390> once<00:02:23.049> it's<00:02:23.290> then

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
HD CP compliancy in-house once it's then

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350 
HD CP compliancy in-house once it's then
broadcast<00:02:23.650> at<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.519> point<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:24.910> then<00:02:25.060> becomes

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
broadcast at that point it then becomes

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.380 
broadcast at that point it then becomes
HDCP<00:02:26.290> compliant<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.430> finally<00:02:27.819> Martin<00:02:28.180> tell

no you are stuck with it if it's an on

no you are stuck with it if it's an on
HDCP<00:02:49.750> device<00:02:50.049> and<00:02:50.709> then<00:02:50.829> on<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.069> HDCP<00:02:51.700> display

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
HDCP device and then on the HDCP display

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.910 
HDCP device and then on the HDCP display
I'm<00:02:52.599> afraid<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.290> you're<00:02:53.440> not<00:02:53.530> going<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.799> get

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
I'm afraid then you're not going to get

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.940 
I'm afraid then you're not going to get
an<00:02:54.130> image

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
an image

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.460 
an image
so<00:02:56.950> that's<00:02:57.130> HDCP<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.750> would<00:02:58.900> seem<00:02:59.140> that<00:02:59.320> if

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so that's HDCP and it would seem that if

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.920 
so that's HDCP and it would seem that if
you're<00:02:59.650> experiencing<00:03:00.460> HDCP<00:03:01.240> error<00:03:01.390> messages

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
you're experiencing HDCP error messages

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.170 
you're experiencing HDCP error messages
the<00:03:02.380> likelihood<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.460> one<00:03:03.730> or<00:03:03.970> more<00:03:04.000> of
