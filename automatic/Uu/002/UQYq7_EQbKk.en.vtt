00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 And then everyone's good with the good 6 today. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.089
 I decided to bring a vlog to the channel 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 I know you are leaving hours 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.320
 completely different from normal but 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.870
 stay calm because today we are going 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.130
 have three videos consider this video that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.010
 It's going out in the middle of the afternoon. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.560
 exactly at 3 o'clock as a video 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.510
 Why not bring this blog on 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.250
 mid-afternoon time currently nothing to 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.779
 to see is the following guys I think 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 some things that I have in order to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.830
 talk to you that I 'm already here in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 my head for a long time I 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.070
 I need to put out and also 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 I need to know what you think about 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.630
 some business and talk let's go 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.640
 To talk this video is a video to give 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 A conversation with the galley is known to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.390
 the channel is and I've spoken several times 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 most important thing in my life 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 then it happens that when you make a 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 which is very important to be 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.309
 focused 24 hours a day while the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 State is thinking about that thing 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.059
 A time comes for you 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.920
 I thought something has to change. 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.480
 to continue moving forward 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.399
 to improve 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.370
 so I think I got it the week 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.790
 conclusion that youtube is for 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.479
 me something a little frustrating let's go like this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.890
 tell 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.439
 the youtube is being for me is a little 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.180
 strange because you made the videos for 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.340
 I had fun from the beginning the channel never 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.259
 I do anything I wanted to do and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.360
 This was something that I 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.159
 Channel cameras went like this I'm going to record 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.710
 I wish I had what you give me 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.750
 The channel is my will, I want it, I want it 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.479
 It was basically so I thought but 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.600
 the channel began to arrive in a proportion 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.210
 size in which I feel the owner of a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.579
 very important thing and feel 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.409
 Thank you to do with that. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.900
 the way it had to be that in the case 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.509
 It was 12 days a day every day so I 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.939
 I started putting routine in the head and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.130
 I began to treat the channel not only as 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.350
 something to do for pleasure something that I 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.659
 I used to have fun but I started to 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.070
 to treat a channel as serious work and 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.840
 I feel like this is not what I wanted 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.790
 to the channel because I think when 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.780
 you begin to treat something as something 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.000
 very serious she loses that grace to have 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 that innocence she loses that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.920
 initial essence that in the case was 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.819
 fun laugh make others do 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.890
 have fun 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.020
 It was fun for me that I created the 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.830
 my channel so I feel that from 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 From the moment I started 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.600
 to charge a lot of myself for everyone 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.190
 the days we have videos right then the 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.860
 I started to get a little bit 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.330
 stuck to this routine and treat the channel 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.190
 as a job I think from there 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.500
 I lost some of the essence and that's it 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.720
 that I want I want it here to be 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 something that is natural for me in the videos that 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.680
 I'm in real life I do for 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.140
 fun then I think because of 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.880
 this and also for other reasons and I 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.950
 I'll start making some changes in the 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.350
 channel and from now on we will have a 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.780
 phase which I hope will be much better 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.510
 and I hope you guys give me the good support 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.640
 that I 'm thinking I do not want to decrease 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 the video frequency is right for me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.450
 I struggled a lot to be able to force two 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.700
 videos per day practically the year 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 whole as you know was class is 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.900
 everybody has class and the college high school 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.180
 well pulled had afternoon class had 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.920
 It proves Saturday morning so I never 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660
 had plenty of time for the channel 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.030
 but I always found a way to take 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.950
 a few lines a day to record the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.720
 videos edit in london to put in 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.730
 channel to publicize the miner's doing 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.890
 because for those who think that the work of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.800
 October, just record the video ready. 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.750
 too wrong, there's too much more 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.269
 So now that I'm on vacation, you can 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.340
 focus more can make a lot more video 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.530
 and as I had promised to you I 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.720
 wanted to start increasing both the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.970
 video per day I thought about putting three 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.709
 videos to see how the channel 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.870
 to see if you do not enjoy or 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.519
 not if I have time if I see that the 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.720
 parties are very quiet for me I 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.519
 I can try to increase from three to 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.930
 I 'm not going to stay the day, either. 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.150
 on my computer during my 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.530
 Vacation I'm leaving I'm going to have fun I'm going 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.019
 go out with my friends and I will not stay in 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.850
 home also 24 hours a day and even if 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.970
 I'm at the computer and I'm not staying 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.680
 100% of the time on the channel sometimes I go 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.850
 play a game, I'll do something, I'll go 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.610
 have fun because we also have people 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.650
 you need to clear your head and give 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.050
 relaxed from time to time but finally to 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.060
 When I'm back from the trip there. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.340
 I was able to bring some ideas that I 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.560
 I could not put it into practice as if 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.480
 Do you know what I'm about to change? 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.570
 now, in truth, then he had said 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.910
 very complicated came painter and 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.669
 electrician at home doing 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.560
 noise all day and then it got difficult 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.150
 to find a good time to record the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.560
 videos and put on the channel so 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.270
 these days we only had 2 times per 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.780
 day and also nothing much 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.789
 the innovator nor a new series but today 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.009
 at 6 o'clock will start a new series 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.930
 so we will start a new 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.870
 adventure on a strike will be just in time 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.810
 and I also have a lot of good ideas 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.000
 that I will try to bring there during this 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.460
 week and I will try to renew I will try 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.710
 make new thing more fun and like 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.930
 I told you guys do what I 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.550
 I do not want to treat youtube as a 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.520
 I work because I think so 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.560
 Today's jobs are 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.150
 very soft will be much more centers 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.159
 Caracas behind will be between 8 o'clock in the morning 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.030
 at six o'clock every day have bound 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.620
 this is not what I want for mine 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.810
 life I always knew that what is 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.120
 a different thing but I do not want it either 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.800
 a job I did not not enjoy myself I 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.430
 I want to do what I like what I think 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.050
 like this 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.539
 if I went to college 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.000
 Working, you thought I'd stay five hours. 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.319
 a college and probably what 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.389
 you graduate 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:23.099
 What are you going to do for this life? 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.199
 you choose something that you do not like 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.360
 do prayers of life one thing you do 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:28.770
 do not like that just for the money is not 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.110
 that I want at least not for the 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.940
 youtube not for my life and i think 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.819
 That I made this clear to me. 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.069
 even then from today I'll go 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:39.780
 do only what I like 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:42.090
 despite this I think a lot of people are going 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.340
 criticize me many kings will also speak 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.919
 silly because sometimes we start 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.810
 one thing and it does not end and I am 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.639
 professional and do this for example 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.770
 start a series of non-minecraft 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.199
 finish or simply stop recording 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.120
 out of nowhere and if I stopped recording a 

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:59.099
 one day or if I stopped doing it 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.080
 something someday you can be sure 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.699
 that has a reason sometimes I do not 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.889
 I'll tell you why the 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.639
 Sometimes it's a bigger problem than you 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:07.409
 think 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.690
 but if I ever stop doing one 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.270
 stop or stop recording a video is 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.800
 Why did some problem happen? 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.930
 simply because I am a child of the 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.789
 bitch and I stopped because I want to understand 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.729
 so you'll always tell if you 're going to have a 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:23.099
 problem then do not wonder if there's nothing 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.599
 some series end but for those who 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.400
 Do you like a lot of channels, can I talk to you? 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.250
 You the next guys like I said. 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.990
 today at 6 pm the third time 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.479
 that we will have is going to be the beginning of 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.490
 a new series that will be just in time 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:36.300
 This week we will finish 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.490
 that series 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.740
 minecraft challenges that time map 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.210
 which calls several of 2 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.650
 I think the name of the map is then 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.720
 ending that series we will go 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.509
 start a new series that will also 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.009
 it's too much time and minecraft fashion 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:52.259
 what is a series that you like 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.630
 Wow, it's probably going to start in 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:57.599
 next week or maybe even this week 

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.639
 So news are coming to us. 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:01.530
 will have lots of great content going to give 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:03.030
 to post three times a day and the 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.940

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:31.199
 You think about everything that I just did.

 speak with the pil pile of words that 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:35.699
 in your face it was a certain way 

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.349
 outburst I think I was already kind of 

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.270

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.159
 I needed to make a video of itself that says 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:47.009
