00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.230
 Part ten out of ten is the perfect one 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.420
 no size no fear we do 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.849
 six illegal fakes card a whole 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.880
 normal fakes have everything there is easy 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.880
 something successful is marginal 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.539
 we drank the pink colors we change 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:28.169
 begging us to know almost everything 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.849
 you know more writes more clearly 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:32.240
 we just try in now 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.920
 make smallest sony 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:40.710
 forget everything that is learned their 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.910
 Part 95 as dirty and not mine 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.470
 Of course, there is a lot of case 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.720
 playful that is it also exists 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:49.100
 from the opponent a little bit too 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.140
 fooled and fade accepted 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.660
 One thing is still in front of every human being has one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.790
 some movement pattern on the fight this 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.530
 your opponent learns pattern while in two 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.930
 minutes know that means he knows 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.730
 about how you move when there is one 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 good fighter is i can read or 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.079
 has been watching videos before that try 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.759
 we're breaking a bit 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.319
 break the rhythm I have her like 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.610
 you see, if I'm not up and down here 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:16.010
 always move an option 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.280
 because of the dish from the front to the back 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.230
 then this applies now to break by 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.090
 for example short-distance that is one 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 make a quick move and out of this 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.760
 movement can of course the 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.140
 striking track and nothing 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.729
 comes and there opponent busy 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.470
 as so complex I can go in 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.900
 we can do the same thing, too 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 if you have good luck and your opponent 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.260
 save that the time, we can 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.610
 at that time also a field draw disappoint 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:54.530
 but with the forest afterwards 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:55.910
 everything legally dirty no what I 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.800
 Of course my fight sometimes say 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.930
 pass when attacking took what 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.399
 happened he happened something 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 Doing politics know exactly what 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.680
 he comes to the very front and gives directly 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.380
 to adjust 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.420
 nobody says that there is a kiss in front 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.300
 The referee says Veit 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.760
 then you might like to fight the 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.450
 hand stop if you think okay that 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.209
 other sphere 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.549
 but caution is there , after all, fast 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:26.269
 on you that means loose forward 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:28.370
 go no longer be on the handshake 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.610
 I stood directly the hand carries away completely 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.390
 first point in a bad mood 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.760
 a very good one and you have it automatically 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.560
 the attention for the fight 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.430
 steered when it is negative 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.730
 no matter if it's a nice clean tricks 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.470
 I 've got myself out now, I have it now 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.930
 still have the classic how much clock 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.180
 actually I'm quite fond or 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.080
 Also called we just look away 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.000
 got 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.130
 and we can do that with the saver 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.010
 make and yet go in or we 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.180
 can protect that with the foot 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.380
 that is also always happy 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.000
 Of course, studying is also rare 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.420
 you can use something from me 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.830
 maybe even the qualified one though 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.630
 Looking away, for example 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.690
 the news and of course, come 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.930
 but then it is also different lousy 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:23.360
 even if you disappointed ok and timeout 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.650
 the time was fighting sunday is stopped 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.560
 it would not protect something with the ones 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:32.120
 I do not usually agree, most of the time 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.049
 In the middle I want to be on the edge 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.340
 Do not do that anymore if I am 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.110
 be open here 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.819
 hate I say stop stop stop 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.140
 and then just go in 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.150
 but that is really nice 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.860
 very borderline I think that was 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.160
 really the punishment adopt official 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.410
 sign but it frustrates the opponent 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.120
 of course in 3d one for it 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.680
 cautionable a set point stationed there 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.069
 he has no desire for the opposing band 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.150
 be more medium and less 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.489
 was hit hard 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.079
 let's say I want to do now in the biz 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.510
 over on the accident with the liver in the 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:05.090
 Schedule make time 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.560
 nothing of my body exactly meets him 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.730
 now I have no more air like that 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.920
 right 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.599
 drive up show there is 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.400
 go to the coach for a time-out 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.659
 The coach has to go with the gloves then 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:21.320
 I've been around for a few seconds 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:23.270
 it's natural to breathe that , of course 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.250
 sometimes it is lousy when and in the 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.080
 pressure device to the limit of the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.000
 tackle device the pink comes easy 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:33.169
 dangerously close and I just hope 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.380
 I think just run away nice 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.960
 take out the anti-social is available 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.919
 a warning is not bad 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.479
 is worse than having a point 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.979
 cashed the fck has happened believe 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:46.270
 I just rain out everyone 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:49.639
 Eerie in any case you have to 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.470
 offers itself if you still only 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.889
 Few time to fight say we lead 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.510
 10 82 points ahead of the opponent 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.250
 Of course, now try this very much 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.560
 catch up two points 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.449
 And then it's easy time 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.990
 it's just going to blow 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.990
 to let 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.250
 there is no warning yet 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.380
 point deduction it anyway and that comes 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.540
 Almost for our next five 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.180
 Share there is not fighting tactics in it 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.920
 show you the tactics a bit yes 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.190
 with the felix as I said from you yet 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.660
 more 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.900
 We're going a lot, too 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:30.930
 the time is a bit limited yes 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:35.840
 I know it's just this semi-contact 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:41.690
 deceive it much much and wait for the 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.690
 35 12 35 Kampfaktik is coming soon
