it's been quite a while but this is
series<00:00:14.309> where<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.519> basically<00:00:14.820> run<00:00:15.150> around<00:00:15.509> with

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
series where I basically run around with

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.800 
series where I basically run around with
a<00:00:16.080> carbine<00:00:16.820> sometimes<00:00:17.820> with<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> suppressor

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
a carbine sometimes with the suppressor

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.500 
a carbine sometimes with the suppressor
like<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.230> doing<00:00:19.470> now<00:00:19.590> with<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> acw-r<00:00:20.760> which

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
like I'm doing now with the acw-r which

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140 
like I'm doing now with the acw-r which
has<00:00:21.689> quite<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> bit<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.529> horizontal<00:00:23.490> recoil<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
has quite a bit of horizontal recoil and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150 
has quite a bit of horizontal recoil and
then<00:00:24.600> there's<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.019> suppressor<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.010> it's

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
then there's a suppressor so it's

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.339 
then there's a suppressor so it's
knocking<00:00:26.340> down<00:00:26.609> my<00:00:26.820> velocity<00:00:27.240> quite<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> bit<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
knocking down my velocity quite a bit so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.679 
knocking down my velocity quite a bit so

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780

of<00:03:51.930> red<00:03:52.230> dots<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.709> has<00:03:52.860> been<00:03:52.980> another<00:03:53.459> nice

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
of red dots this has been another nice

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.380 
of red dots this has been another nice
moment<00:03:54.209> with<00:03:54.900> an<00:03:55.200> lmg<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:56.370> drop<00:03:56.730> down<00:03:57.060> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
moment with an lmg just drop down and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390

hit<00:03:58.110> them<00:03:58.230> from<00:03:58.319> behind<00:03:58.410> these<00:03:59.160> are<00:03:59.310> those

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
hit them from behind these are those

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.800 
hit them from behind these are those
moments<00:03:59.459> where<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.000> can<00:04:00.120> get<00:04:00.209> swatted<00:04:00.540> wipes

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810

like<00:04:01.170> that<00:04:01.940> didn't<00:04:02.940> kill<00:04:03.090> them<00:04:03.240> all<00:04:03.420> that

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
like that didn't kill them all that

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.120 
like that didn't kill them all that
means<00:04:03.870> they're<00:04:04.080> still<00:04:04.290> spawning<00:04:04.560> back<00:04:04.860> and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
means they're still spawning back and

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.970 
means they're still spawning back and
why<00:04:05.490> not<00:04:05.730> share<00:04:06.000> one<00:04:06.840> or<00:04:07.080> two<00:04:07.290> more<00:04:07.440> sandwiches

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
why not share one or two more sandwiches

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.490 
why not share one or two more sandwiches
and<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:09.330> throw<00:04:09.690> wasn't<00:04:09.989> going<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.170> net<00:04:10.319> me<00:04:10.440> a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
and that throw wasn't going to net me a

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.140 
and that throw wasn't going to net me a
kill<00:04:10.770> but<00:04:10.980> it<00:04:11.100> also<00:04:11.250> wasn't<00:04:11.400> gonna<00:04:11.700> kill<00:04:11.940> me<00:04:12.120> I

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
kill but it also wasn't gonna kill me I

actually caught one on the ledge earlier

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.979

and<00:04:14.160> I<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.310> hold<00:04:14.610> off<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:14.970> like<00:04:15.180> six<00:04:15.540> seconds

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
and I to hold off for like six seconds

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
to pick the dang thing up so this is a

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.300 
to pick the dang thing up so this is a
nice<00:04:18.209> lmg<00:04:18.690> move<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.410> it's<00:04:19.650> too<00:04:19.980> little<00:04:20.130> too

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310

thought we had this set in the bag I

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.500 
thought we had this set in the bag I
started<00:04:44.070> wandering<00:04:44.280> around<00:04:44.610> and<00:04:45.270> playing

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
started wandering around and playing

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.780 
started wandering around and playing
around<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:45.900> an<00:04:46.020> LED<00:04:46.470> keeping<00:04:46.890> their<00:04:47.070> two<00:04:47.250> LEDs

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790

around in an LED keeping their two LEDs
at<00:04:48.090> bay<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:49.290> ran<00:04:49.500> my<00:04:49.530> infantry<00:04:50.040> only<00:04:50.310> set<00:04:50.520> up

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
at bay and I ran my infantry only set up

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.300 
at bay and I ran my infantry only set up
on<00:04:50.790> my<00:04:51.150> lav<00:04:51.840> which<00:04:52.530> isn't<00:04:52.979> a<00:04:53.100> full

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
on my lav which isn't a full

on my lav which isn't a full
anti-vehicle<00:04:54.000> set<00:04:54.240> up<00:04:54.330> there's<00:04:54.510> no<00:04:54.660> Zuni<00:04:55.229> so<00:04:55.440> I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
anti-vehicle set up there's no Zuni so I

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.670 
anti-vehicle set up there's no Zuni so I
could<00:04:55.770> do<00:04:55.890> really<00:04:56.190> well<00:04:56.370> with<00:04:56.640> the<00:04:56.669> small<00:04:57.680> mini

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
could do really well with the small mini

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.130 
could do really well with the small mini
gun<00:04:58.919> with<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.460> LAV<00:04:59.729> to<00:05:00.090> pick<00:05:00.300> at<00:05:00.419> infantry<00:05:00.960> but

gun with the LAV to pick at infantry but

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.659 
gun with the LAV to pick at infantry but
I<00:05:01.169> actually<00:05:01.320> was<00:05:01.770> able<00:05:01.890> to<00:05:02.070> keep<00:05:02.220> both<00:05:02.430> their

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
I actually was able to keep both their

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.430 
I actually was able to keep both their
la<00:05:02.880> visa<00:05:03.120> because<00:05:03.390> no<00:05:03.720> one<00:05:03.840> want<00:05:04.050> to<00:05:04.110> rush<00:05:04.260> me

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
la visa because no one want to rush me

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.230 
la visa because no one want to rush me
they<00:05:05.010> don't<00:05:05.250> really<00:05:05.370> know<00:05:05.580> what<00:05:05.760> card<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.090> was

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
they don't really know what card I was

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.770 
they don't really know what card I was
holding<00:05:06.450> so<00:05:06.750> that<00:05:07.020> helped<00:05:07.289> out<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.530> team<00:05:07.770> and

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
holding so that helped out the team and

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
holding so that helped out the team and
but<00:05:09.780> it<00:05:09.870> didn't<00:05:10.050> help<00:05:10.080> out<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.350> team<00:05:10.380> enough

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
but it didn't help out the team enough

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.590 
but it didn't help out the team enough
because<00:05:11.250> I<00:05:11.340> got<00:05:11.520> too<00:05:11.669> distracted<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.300> got<00:05:12.450> too

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
because I got too distracted I got too

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.900 
because I got too distracted I got too
far<00:05:12.870> away<00:05:12.990> and<00:05:13.500> that's<00:05:14.010> the<00:05:14.250> tough<00:05:14.430> part<00:05:14.460> about

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
far away and that's the tough part about

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.909 
far away and that's the tough part about
this<00:05:15.419> map<00:05:15.690> because<00:05:15.990> it's<00:05:16.200> easy<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.710> push

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
this map because it's easy to push

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.850 
this map because it's easy to push
outside<00:05:17.460> lanes<00:05:17.789> so<00:05:18.720> they<00:05:18.840> literally<00:05:19.140> blow<00:05:19.650> us

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
outside lanes so they literally blow us

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.700 
outside lanes so they literally blow us
off<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:20.490> set<00:05:20.700> of<00:05:20.820> em<00:05:20.910> comes

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
off that set of em comes

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.970 
off that set of em comes
and<00:05:21.860> I<00:05:22.160> kind<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.210> miss<00:05:23.810> an<00:05:24.140> opportunity<00:05:24.470> here

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
and I kind of miss an opportunity here

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.670 
and I kind of miss an opportunity here
to<00:05:25.160> do<00:05:25.370> something<00:05:26.060> epic<00:05:26.380> should<00:05:27.380> have<00:05:27.470> jumped

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
to do something epic should have jumped

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.470 
to do something epic should have jumped
down<00:05:27.890> and<00:05:28.280> should<00:05:28.790> have<00:05:28.850> finished<00:05:29.030> that<00:05:29.210> guy

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
down and should have finished that guy

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:34.090 
down and should have finished that guy
and<00:05:29.930> I<00:05:30.440> mess<00:05:30.830> up<00:05:30.860> the<00:05:31.820> parachute<00:05:32.830> it's<00:05:33.830> that

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
and I mess up the parachute it's that

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.800 
and I mess up the parachute it's that
simple<00:05:34.130> at<00:05:34.610> all<00:05:34.730> look<00:05:35.090> at<00:05:35.180> that<00:05:35.330> another

massive<00:05:45.170> pressure<00:05:45.800> on<00:05:46.070> us<00:05:46.100> there<00:05:47.090> goes<00:05:47.270> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
massive pressure on us there goes the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.630 
massive pressure on us there goes the
bike<00:05:47.630> not<00:05:47.930> exactly<00:05:48.200> a<00:05:48.410> high<00:05:48.650> priority<00:05:48.680> targets
