 typing ok now what are we going to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.829
 to do is close our micro of our 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 multitasking if we have it open clear 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.019
 if we do not have it open it does not matter ok 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.540

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:38.030
 inside of the brand, we will notice that 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.150
 has changed what is the texture of 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.359
 as it was before now not that you see a 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.519
 little more colorful what is this the 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.829
 grass textures all all 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.150
 blocks change look add a touch more 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.849
 different from what is the macro that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.609
 original already with the haters looks a bit 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.159
 more colorful and the truth gives a touch 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.810
