00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone with you quadriga and so in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.200
 the run-up to halloween i decided to do 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.000
 whole block of programs dedicated 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.920
 every kind of evil and undead 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.139
 I did not allow aplomb to display in 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 some special series of videos you do 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.520
 I understand yourself so smart 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 what will they be a little shorter than usual but 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.260
 but will go all week through 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:28.619
 day before every day I do not know in general 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:31.320
 let's go today we start talking 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 o really brutal comic heroes 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.309
 which, albeit with some reservations 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.120
 fighting for a just cause but their fate 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.860
 closely associated with ash and the forces of darkness 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.690
 Perhaps we will begin with a citizen of which I am 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.890
 very asked to tell after the release 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.950
 hellboy program 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.440
 spawn fucking colorful character with 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.320
 which seems earth is bad to do 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.750
 impossible so he is cool on a par with 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 the same hal battle spawn hero is relatively 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.629
 new and appeared in its own 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.609
 Augustings in 1992 on pages and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.220
 Meydzh comics which actually in the same 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.700
 year and hatched to work with brutal 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.710
 heroes in black black heroes author 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 the comic Todu McFarlane ut was not 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.810
 for the first time because back in the late 80s 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.869
 he was not together with dive michael 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.270
 developed by veins and so real name 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.119
 full of al simmons and he is a former agent 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.710
 special unit ceru killed 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.770
 by order of his own boss 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.439
 jason wine special department as you understand 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 was doing a very dirty job so 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:40.200
 after death the soul of simmons is understood 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 went where he concluded a contract with 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.689
 demon mell god and reborn as hell 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.909
 spawn back to the world of humans demon 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.280
 defiler judging by the appearance of a clown 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.259
 fast food diet 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.329
 mentor trying to pin down 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.420
 protagonist loyalty to the dark side but 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.810
 clear the stump and particularly successful in itself 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.420
 comic grim cruel very tragic 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.860
 slept a lot of time 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.940
 homelessness is destroyed by street 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 core gangs 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.190
 with homeless people a normal leisure word 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.050
 there is still a maza of all sorts of nuances but you 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.240
 you understand that in the end you become 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.490
 hero and if you consider the methods 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.980
 antihero well and taken to cause 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.530
 good left and right spawn it 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.510
 damn cool colorful story in 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.490
 largely changing the usual look at 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.160
 super hero 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.590
 the narrative is sometimes very unusual 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.810
 besides the main ongoingov were 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.320
 all sorts of spin-offs and very curious 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.090
 crossovers for example in 1994 came out 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.650
 lower ile crossover 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.860
 united spawn 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.580
 and batman damn yes my balls are bigger 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.190
 just because I said it out loud 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.590
 a lot more spins with gene 13 also 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.080
 ninja turtles and many others but 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.910
 if comics you too lazy to search or read 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.750
 that is a great animated series 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.470
 atpl which has 3 seasons and 18 7 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.630
 and the 97 year feature film which 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.760
 came out bright and colorful well, as it is not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.640
 especially successful apparently although collected 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.620
 considerable for those times 87 lyam green 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.510
 work on a sequel for a while 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.940
 held and important place in history should 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:20.310
 were borrowed by sam and twitch a couple of cops 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.500
 present in all spawn stories 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.390
 and the protagonist himself whose role is rather 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.910
 just the same actor michael would do 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.560
 jay white was somewhere in the background to him at all 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.220
 probably would not have much 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.920
 chatter with new developmental power 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.950
 the project took place in 2007 that is, through 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.980
 10 years after the original and declared 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.400
 what will it be 2008 but then everything again 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.860
 I died until 2009 when 5 started talking about 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.140
 the fact that they say mcfarlane writes scene 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.510
 announced that after all we will 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.540
 already a full restart did not count and 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.300
 not even a restart, but something completely new 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.000
 a story that will not just be gloomy 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.570
 but it will be creepy and style will be sooner 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.190
 a thriller or a horror movie not a superhero 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.230
 general oddly enough but talk about 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.209
 the sequel lasted throughout 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.760
 past time since exit 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.280
 the original film and he came out on remember 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.880
 already 17 years ago while in the process 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.830
 promised a bunch of nishtyakov rating r but 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.049
 last year, McFarlane stated 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.419
 what the film is exactly to be and work on it 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.800
 will start in 2014 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:30.600
 but you understood yes she never started but 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.090
 the topic still got off the ground 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.490
 after all, it was just recently announced 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.130
 new cartoon project pass paw 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.229
 Well, even some hordes were shown 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.479
 Yes, and the world of the comic began 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.919
 fermentation and fully refreshed team 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.470
 working on ongoingov 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.380
 and what does that say i think about 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.240
 maturing something serious seems to me to 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.669
 we were decided to shake well and 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.340
 to remind of spawn and if successful 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.090
 operations a full-fledged movie does not force 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.810
 waiting for yourself 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.520
 so squeeze the cams and wait for what u 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.680
 me for today 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 as I said at the beginning of this week I 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.160
 I plan to release a few commercials so 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.130
 don't forget to subscribe to the channel 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.289
 share videos with friends and more often 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.820
 apparently check the feed but was with you 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.820
 quadriga all bye 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.390
 this is bye bye 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.900
 by the way if you thought that I 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.820
 talked about the hero himself not much then 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.889
 you didn’t seem like i just don’t 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.990
 I like to repeat and there is a spawn 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:42.449
 awesome video on the channel thickness alas 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.789
 and Wendy, well, as usual, I did more 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:46.789
 focus on movies and future projects
