is acta cool and today I want to talk

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.859 
is acta cool and today I want to talk
about<00:00:16.230> maximum<00:00:17.039> hits<00:00:17.310> in<00:00:17.550> runescape<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.720> as

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
about maximum hits in runescape so as

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.230 
about maximum hits in runescape so as
you<00:00:18.900> all<00:00:19.170> know<00:00:19.340> previously<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.580> maximum<00:00:21.000> hits

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
you all know previously the maximum hits

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.359 
you all know previously the maximum hits
were<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:21.990> big<00:00:22.289> thing<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.830> escape<00:00:23.160> like

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
were kind of big thing in to escape like

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.670 
were kind of big thing in to escape like
people<00:00:23.939> were<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.359> comparing<00:00:25.109> how<00:00:25.289> much<00:00:25.470> is

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
people were really comparing how much is

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
people were really comparing how much is
your<00:00:25.710> max<00:00:26.160> heat<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.810> people<00:00:27.810> were<00:00:27.930> testing

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
your max heat or people were testing

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
your max heat or people were testing
like<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:28.920> what's<00:00:29.160> your<00:00:29.310> max<00:00:29.550> hit<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.000> they

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
like what what's your max hit and they

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
like what what's your max hit and they
were<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.359> borrowing<00:00:30.660> dragon<00:00:31.410> 200<00:00:31.890> sports<00:00:32.250> or

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
were like borrowing dragon 200 sports or

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.000 
were like borrowing dragon 200 sports or
a<00:00:33.000> GSS<00:00:33.510> from<00:00:33.780> other<00:00:33.989> people<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.829> test

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
a GSS from other people just to test

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.979 
a GSS from other people just to test
their<00:00:35.280> maximum<00:00:35.730> hits<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> then<00:00:36.719> they<00:00:36.930> could

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
their maximum hits and then they could

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.560 
their maximum hits and then they could
tell<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.010> their<00:00:38.160> friends<00:00:38.520> like<00:00:38.700> oh<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.360> was

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
tell to their friends like oh this was

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.180 
tell to their friends like oh this was
my<00:00:39.719> new<00:00:39.870> maximum<00:00:40.379> heat<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> stuff<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.129> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
my new maximum heat and stuff like that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.670 
my new maximum heat and stuff like that
so<00:00:41.550> when<00:00:42.030> jagex<00:00:42.420> made<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.750> updates<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.350> change

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
so when jagex made the updates to change

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.729 
so when jagex made the updates to change
the<00:00:44.040> max<00:00:44.219> hit<00:00:44.460> by<00:00:44.760> tenfold<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:46.170> was<00:00:46.379> kind<00:00:46.649> of

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
the max hit by tenfold that was kind of

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
the max hit by tenfold that was kind of
pissing<00:00:47.460> people<00:00:47.760> off<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> lot<00:00:48.149> but<00:00:48.420> people

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
pissing people off a lot but people

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.290 
pissing people off a lot but people
quickly<00:00:49.590> learned<00:00:50.039> what's<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> maximum<00:00:50.969> hit

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
quickly learned what's the maximum hit

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.689 
quickly learned what's the maximum hit
in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> new<00:00:51.809> system<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.469> they<00:00:53.250> could<00:00:53.430> just

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
in the new system like they could just

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.000 
in the new system like they could just
do<00:00:54.030> some<00:00:54.270> Rambo<00:00:54.690> specs<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.770> ten

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
do some Rambo specs and it was just ten

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.889 
do some Rambo specs and it was just ten
fold<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> was<00:00:56.940> quite<00:00:57.390> simple<00:00:57.870> to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
fold and it was quite simple to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
fold and it was quite simple to
calculate<00:00:58.140> what's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.890> maximum<00:00:59.190> hit<00:00:59.520> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
calculate what's the maximum hit and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090 
calculate what's the maximum hit and
there<00:01:00.239> was<00:01:00.390> even<00:01:00.719> calculators<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
there was even calculators up that you

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.039 
there was even calculators up that you
could<00:01:02.309> calculate<00:01:02.550> your<00:01:02.940> maximum<00:01:03.480> hip<00:01:03.690> but

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
could calculate your maximum hip but

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.469 
could calculate your maximum hip but
ever<00:01:04.290> since<00:01:04.589> jagex<00:01:05.100> installed<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> EOC<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
ever since jagex installed the EOC to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.510 
ever since jagex installed the EOC to
runescape<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:07.200> over<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.799> year<00:01:07.830> ago<00:01:08.189> I

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
runescape like over one year ago I

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.760 
runescape like over one year ago I
haven't<00:01:09.330> seen<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:10.200> talking<00:01:10.619> about

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
haven't seen people talking about

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.910 
haven't seen people talking about
maximum<00:01:11.400> hits<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> no<00:01:12.689> Rambo<00:01:13.200> specs<00:01:13.650> or

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
maximum hits there is no Rambo specs or

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.010 
maximum hits there is no Rambo specs or
anything<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> no<00:01:15.270> people

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
anything like that there is no people

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.990 
anything like that there is no people
talking<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.590> maximum<00:01:17.070> hits<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:17.820> was

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
talking about maximum hits so I was

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
talking about maximum hits so I was
extremely<00:01:18.540> curious<00:01:19.200> how<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.740> get<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> maximum

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
extremely curious how to get the maximum

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
extremely curious how to get the maximum
hit<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> runescape<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:22.439> not<00:01:22.500> sure<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.040> I

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
hit in runescape and I'm not sure if I

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.920 
hit in runescape and I'm not sure if I
could<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.610> get<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> maximum<00:01:24.600> hit

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
could actually get the maximum hit

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.450 
could actually get the maximum hit
because<00:01:25.229> there<00:01:25.680> are<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:25.860> many<00:01:26.159> different

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
because there are so many different

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.399 
because there are so many different
factors<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.390> need<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.750> consider<00:01:27.930> when

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
factors that you need to consider when

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
factors that you need to consider when
you<00:01:28.500> are<00:01:28.530> testing<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> maximum<00:01:29.430> heat<00:01:29.880> but

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
you are testing out the maximum heat but

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.569 
you are testing out the maximum heat but
i<00:01:30.659> figured<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.290> i<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.009> my<00:01:32.159> maximum

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
i figured that i want to get my maximum

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.969 
i figured that i want to get my maximum
hit<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.210> one<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:33.810> hit<00:01:34.079> splat<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.770> that

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
hit that it's one big hit splat so that

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.130 
hit that it's one big hit splat so that
was<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> requirement<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.060> i<00:01:36.659> figured<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
was the requirement and i figured that

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
was the requirement and i figured that
the<00:01:37.500> balance<00:01:37.890> strike<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> most<00:01:38.939> powerful

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
the balance strike is the most powerful

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.440 
the balance strike is the most powerful
hit<00:01:39.900> in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> game<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.710> didn't<00:01:41.280> find<00:01:41.549> any<00:01:41.880> quite

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
hit in the game I didn't find any quite

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960 
hit in the game I didn't find any quite
so<00:01:42.689> powerful<00:01:43.380> ability<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> figured<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
so powerful ability so I figured that

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
so powerful ability so I figured that
the<00:01:45.180> balance<00:01:45.509> strike<00:01:45.780> must<00:01:46.079> be<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the balance strike must be the one that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.770 
the balance strike must be the one that
gives<00:01:47.009> me<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.549> best<00:01:47.670> hit<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.659> at

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
gives me the best hit that I can do at

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.319 
gives me the best hit that I can do at
least<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.439> my<00:01:49.619> original<00:01:49.799> idea<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.939> use<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
least so my original idea was to use the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
least so my original idea was to use the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
balanced like ability on a monster when

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.700 
balanced like ability on a monster when
I<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.790> bare<00:01:54.060> second<00:01:54.479> ability<00:01:54.720> activated<00:01:55.560> I

upset<00:01:58.590> with<00:01:58.799> almost<00:01:59.159> zero<00:01:59.430> HP<00:02:00.149> left<00:02:00.360> but<00:02:00.719> since

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
upset with almost zero HP left but since

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389 
upset with almost zero HP left but since
I<00:02:01.140> found<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.680> hard<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.009> find<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
I found it really hard to find a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
I found it really hard to find a
controlled<00:02:02.850> situation<00:02:03.090> where<00:02:03.780> i<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:04.140> just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
controlled situation where i can just

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.850 
controlled situation where i can just
factor<00:02:04.829> in<00:02:05.100> all<00:02:05.310> these<00:02:05.579> things<00:02:05.939> together<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
factor in all these things together and

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.229 
factor in all these things together and
the<00:02:07.860> most<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.220> would<00:02:08.369> still<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.789> full<00:02:09.000> HP

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the most that would still have full HP

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.990 
the most that would still have full HP
left<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.959> stuff<00:02:10.110> like<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.289> i<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:11.489> gave<00:02:11.790> up

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
left and stuff like that i just gave up

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.790 
left and stuff like that i just gave up
with<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
with you

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.350 
with you
the<00:02:12.980> better<00:02:13.340> credibility<00:02:13.940> because<00:02:14.060> that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
the better credibility because that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.570 
the better credibility because that
would<00:02:14.510> give<00:02:14.690> me<00:02:14.810> only<00:02:14.960> 20<00:02:15.530> seconds<00:02:15.860> time<00:02:16.190> frame

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
would give me only 20 seconds time frame

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.940 
would give me only 20 seconds time frame
they<00:02:16.850> use<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.570> things<00:02:17.780> like<00:02:18.050> lowering<00:02:18.710> my

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
they use all the things like lowering my

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
they use all the things like lowering my
HP<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:19.550> stuff<00:02:19.730> like<00:02:19.910> that<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.210> when<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.900> have

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
HP and stuff like that and when I have

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.500 
HP and stuff like that and when I have
less<00:02:21.440> defense<00:02:22.280> when<00:02:22.550> I<00:02:22.580> use<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> bear<00:02:23.120> circuit

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
less defense when I use the bear circuit

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.630 
less defense when I use the bear circuit
I<00:02:23.630> would<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.410> easy<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:25.040> die<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.520> I

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
I would just be so easy to die and I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.520 
I would just be so easy to die and I
would<00:02:25.790> die<00:02:25.940> like<00:02:26.150> 15<00:02:26.660> times<00:02:26.960> when<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.320> was

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
would die like 15 times when I was

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
would die like 15 times when I was
trying<00:02:27.770> to<00:02:27.920> do<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.310> here<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:29.270> was<00:02:29.630> just

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
trying to do this here so I was just

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.110 
trying to do this here so I was just
completely<00:02:30.470> happy<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:31.070> do<00:02:31.220> what<00:02:31.580> I<00:02:31.610> did<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:31.940> I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
completely happy to do what I did so I

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.450 
completely happy to do what I did so I
just<00:02:32.480> used<00:02:32.690> Derek's<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.470> I<00:02:33.530> used<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:34.070> different

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
just used Derek's and I used a different

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.370 
just used Derek's and I used a different
bunch<00:02:34.880> of<00:02:35.030> different<00:02:35.450> weapons<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.140> the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
bunch of different weapons in the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.440 
bunch of different weapons in the
dominant<00:02:36.920> hour<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.700> if<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.970> die<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.240> doesn't

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
dominant hour so if I die it doesn't

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.200 
dominant hour so if I die it doesn't
really<00:02:38.930> matter<00:02:39.140> on<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.560> battles<00:02:40.550> just<00:02:40.610> anchor

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
really matter on the battles just anchor

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.020 
really matter on the battles just anchor
which<00:02:41.450> had<00:02:41.960> 15<00:02:42.500> khp<00:02:43.070> so<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.400> was<00:02:43.550> kind<00:02:43.760> of<00:02:43.820> nice

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
which had 15 khp so it was kind of nice

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.270 
which had 15 khp so it was kind of nice
to<00:02:44.090> kill<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.690> one<00:02:44.900> because<00:02:45.110> it<00:02:45.890> has<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> lot<00:02:46.250> of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
to kill that one because it has a lot of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.910 
to kill that one because it has a lot of
HP<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:46.910> was<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.270> trying<00:02:47.630> like<00:02:48.320> using<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
HP so I was just trying like using the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.370 
HP so I was just trying like using the
balanced<00:02:49.340> like<00:02:49.520> with<00:02:49.760> very<00:02:50.000> low<00:02:50.240> HP<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.200> the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
balanced like with very low HP so the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.140 
balanced like with very low HP so the
maximum<00:02:51.530> heat<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.280> got<00:02:52.460> in<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.700> Dominion

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
maximum heat that I got in the Dominion

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.250 
maximum heat that I got in the Dominion
tower<00:02:53.330> was<00:02:54.790> 8140<00:02:55.790> which<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:56.390> find<00:02:56.630> really<00:02:56.960> high

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
tower was 8140 which I find really high

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.020 
tower was 8140 which I find really high
to<00:02:57.320> be<00:02:57.620> honest<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:57.980> was<00:02:58.130> really<00:02:58.670> nice<00:02:58.790> because

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
to be honest it was really nice because

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.180 
to be honest it was really nice because
I<00:02:59.240> haven't<00:02:59.810> seen<00:03:00.080> anybody<00:03:00.380> do<00:03:00.710> that<00:03:00.740> kind<00:03:01.100> of

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
I haven't seen anybody do that kind of

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.370 
I haven't seen anybody do that kind of
damage<00:03:01.250> when<00:03:01.880> they<00:03:02.090> are<00:03:02.150> doing<00:03:02.390> regular<00:03:02.660> pvm

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
damage when they are doing regular pvm

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.560 
damage when they are doing regular pvm
or<00:03:03.620> fighting<00:03:03.950> some<00:03:04.340> monsters<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.270> it<00:03:05.420> was

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
or fighting some monsters so it was

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.360 
or fighting some monsters so it was
definitely<00:03:05.750> something<00:03:06.320> that<00:03:06.470> is<00:03:06.710> not<00:03:07.010> normal

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
definitely something that is not normal

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240 
definitely something that is not normal
in<00:03:07.910> normal<00:03:08.450> fight<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.840> I<00:03:09.080> managed<00:03:09.740> to<00:03:09.770> get<00:03:10.070> a

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
in normal fight so I managed to get a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.100 
in normal fight so I managed to get a
special<00:03:10.670> situation<00:03:10.910> where<00:03:11.510> i<00:03:11.540> get<00:03:11.810> more

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
special situation where i get more

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.110 
special situation where i get more
damage<00:03:12.530> than<00:03:12.710> you<00:03:12.860> usually<00:03:13.100> get<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:13.760> was

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
damage than you usually get I was

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.730 
damage than you usually get I was
getting<00:03:14.270> bigger<00:03:14.630> hits<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.260> the<00:03:15.380> Derrick's

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
getting bigger hits with the Derrick's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.100 
getting bigger hits with the Derrick's
quite<00:03:16.100> consistently<00:03:16.940> so<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.300> suppose<00:03:17.750> that<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
quite consistently so I suppose that the

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.710 
quite consistently so I suppose that the
dialogue<00:03:18.500> set<00:03:18.770> bonus<00:03:19.190> does<00:03:19.580> affect<00:03:20.150> abilities

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
dialogue set bonus does affect abilities

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.750 
dialogue set bonus does affect abilities
I'm<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.200> sure<00:03:21.260> about<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:22.010> but<00:03:22.070> I<00:03:22.280> think<00:03:22.610> it

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
I'm not sure about that but I think it

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.270 
I'm not sure about that but I think it
might<00:03:22.970> affect<00:03:23.330> or<00:03:23.570> it<00:03:24.410> has<00:03:24.620> something<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.130> do

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
might affect or it has something to do

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.210 
might affect or it has something to do
with<00:03:25.489> that<00:03:25.700> Derek's<00:03:26.270> have<00:03:26.600> less<00:03:27.020> HP<00:03:27.350> than<00:03:27.950> the

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
with that Derek's have less HP than the

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.130 
with that Derek's have less HP than the
bandos<00:03:28.970> are<00:03:29.120> more<00:03:29.360> that<00:03:29.480> I<00:03:29.600> was<00:03:29.720> using<00:03:29.870> or

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
bandos are more that I was using or

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.900 
bandos are more that I was using or
something<00:03:30.440> like<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.620> because<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.580> balance

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
something like that because the balance

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.370 
something like that because the balance
strike<00:03:32.209> ability<00:03:32.420> works<00:03:32.930> with<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
strike ability works with the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.490 
strike ability works with the
percentages<00:03:33.739> of<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.820> HP<00:03:35.270> of<00:03:35.450> your<00:03:35.810> character

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
percentages of the HP of your character

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.670 
percentages of the HP of your character
and<00:03:36.650> also<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.400> percentage<00:03:37.940> of<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.350> HP<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.380> the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
and also the percentage of the HP of the

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.199 
and also the percentage of the HP of the
monster<00:03:40.010> that<00:03:40.160> you<00:03:40.310> are<00:03:40.430> hitting<00:03:40.610> so<00:03:41.000> yeah<00:03:41.180> I

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
monster that you are hitting so yeah I

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.760 
monster that you are hitting so yeah I
don't<00:03:41.480> know<00:03:41.600> exactly<00:03:42.170> how<00:03:42.350> the<00:03:42.410> balance

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
don't know exactly how the balance

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.640 
don't know exactly how the balance
strike<00:03:43.070> works<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:43.880> at<00:03:44.270> least<00:03:44.750> it<00:03:44.989> factors<00:03:45.410> in

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
strike works but at least it factors in

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.500 
strike works but at least it factors in
that<00:03:45.860> if<00:03:45.980> you<00:03:46.100> have<00:03:46.250> very<00:03:46.489> low<00:03:46.640> HP<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.209> you<00:03:47.360> hit

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
that if you have very low HP and you hit

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.449 
that if you have very low HP and you hit
a<00:03:47.540> monster<00:03:47.989> that<00:03:48.170> has<00:03:48.320> full<00:03:48.560> HP<00:03:48.770> you<00:03:49.130> will<00:03:49.280> make

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
a monster that has full HP you will make

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.550 
a monster that has full HP you will make
a<00:03:49.640> ton<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.450> damage<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.320> what's

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
a ton of damage and this is what's

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.920 
a ton of damage and this is what's
important<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.370> anybody<00:03:52.760> who's<00:03:53.150> doing<00:03:53.480> pvm

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
important for anybody who's doing pvm

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.560 
important for anybody who's doing pvm
and<00:03:54.200> who<00:03:54.590> wants<00:03:54.890> to<00:03:54.920> heal<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.459> 3k<00:03:56.000> out<00:03:56.239> of<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
and who wants to heal like 3k out of the

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.780 
and who wants to heal like 3k out of the
balanced<00:03:56.930> right<00:03:57.080> so<00:03:57.590> only<00:03:57.890> non<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.370> don't<00:03:58.550> think

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
balanced right so only non I don't think

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.820 
balanced right so only non I don't think
I<00:03:58.970> got<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.360> best<00:03:59.540> hit<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.020> runescape<00:04:00.470> or<00:04:00.680> the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
I got the best hit in runescape or the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.040 
I got the best hit in runescape or the
biggest<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.280> but<00:04:01.489> I<00:04:01.520> got<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:02.030> decent<00:04:02.239> big<00:04:02.780> hit

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
biggest it but I got a decent big hit

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.870 
biggest it but I got a decent big hit
and<00:04:03.200> it's<00:04:03.709> definitely<00:04:04.280> something<00:04:04.489> that<00:04:04.670> you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
and it's definitely something that you

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.550 
and it's definitely something that you
don't<00:04:05.030> see<00:04:05.180> every<00:04:05.780> day<00:04:05.810> when<00:04:06.140> you<00:04:06.260> are<00:04:06.410> doing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
don't see every day when you are doing

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.800 
don't see every day when you are doing
PBM<00:04:07.070> at<00:04:07.280> least<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.640> haven't<00:04:08.030> seen<00:04:08.330> people

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
PBM at least I haven't seen people

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.479 
PBM at least I haven't seen people
hitting<00:04:09.080> this<00:04:09.230> much<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.800> if<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.070> have<00:04:10.250> some

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
hitting this much but if you have some

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.370 
hitting this much but if you have some
kind<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.790> information<00:04:11.120> about<00:04:11.720> what's<00:04:12.080> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
kind of information about what's the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.830 
kind of information about what's the
maximum<00:04:12.680> hit<00:04:13.010> or<00:04:13.280> if<00:04:13.790> you<00:04:14.060> can<00:04:14.330> actually<00:04:14.510> hit

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
maximum hit or if you can actually hit

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.680 
maximum hit or if you can actually hit
like<00:04:15.019> over<00:04:15.320> 10k<00:04:15.890> in<00:04:16.100> one<00:04:16.430> single<00:04:16.820> hit<00:04:17.180> splat<00:04:17.540> I

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
like over 10k in one single hit splat I

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.390 
like over 10k in one single hit splat I
would<00:04:17.870> be<00:04:18.019> really<00:04:18.260> interested<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.919> hear<00:04:19.040> that

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
would be really interested to hear that

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.820 
would be really interested to hear that
I<00:04:19.580> think<00:04:20.090> that's<00:04:20.330> possible<00:04:20.600> and<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.440> definitely

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
I think that's possible and I definitely

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.260 
I think that's possible and I definitely
didn't<00:04:22.310> test<00:04:22.550> everything<00:04:22.940> out

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
didn't test everything out

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.020 
didn't test everything out
but<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:23.479> can<00:04:23.750> try<00:04:24.139> so<00:04:24.860> yeah<00:04:25.280> definitely<00:04:25.550> if

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
but you can try so yeah definitely if

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.550 
but you can try so yeah definitely if
you<00:04:26.090> have<00:04:26.360> some<00:04:26.569> kind<00:04:26.720> of<00:04:26.870> a<00:04:27.020> video<00:04:27.289> like<00:04:27.500> that
