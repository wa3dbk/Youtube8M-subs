00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
started turning my tubes from right

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.170 
started turning my tubes from right
sides<00:00:16.350> together<00:00:16.529> back<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.250> right<00:00:17.490> sides<00:00:17.850> out

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
sides together back to right sides out

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.359 
sides together back to right sides out
so<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:18.930> going<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.140> need<00:00:19.260> today<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
so what we are going to need today is a

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.300 
so what we are going to need today is a
ball<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.910> twine<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> ball<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.020> string<00:00:22.560> one

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
ball of twine or a ball of string one

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.820 
ball of twine or a ball of string one
fat<00:00:24.000> safety<00:00:24.630> pin<00:00:24.840> now<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> size<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
fat safety pin now the size of the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.529 
fat safety pin now the size of the
safety<00:00:26.130> pin<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.460> actually<00:00:26.820> proportional<00:00:27.119> to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
safety pin is actually proportional to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.970 
safety pin is actually proportional to
the<00:00:27.660> width<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.230> strip<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.680> I've<00:00:28.769> got<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the width of the strip so I've got a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.370 
the width of the strip so I've got a
four<00:00:29.429> inch<00:00:29.699> strip<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:30.750> I<00:00:30.810> can<00:00:30.960> use<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> big

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
four inch strip here so I can use a big

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.620 
four inch strip here so I can use a big
safety<00:00:31.650> pin<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.399> big<00:00:32.700> ball<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.090> twine<00:00:33.180> if

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
safety pin and a big ball of twine if

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.870 
safety pin and a big ball of twine if
you're<00:00:34.140> doing<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> two<00:00:34.829> inch<00:00:35.010> tube<00:00:35.309> that's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
you're doing like a two inch tube that's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.220 
you're doing like a two inch tube that's
gonna<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.180> turned<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:36.510> can<00:00:36.660> go<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> little<00:00:36.989> bit

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
gonna be turned you can go a little bit

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530 
gonna be turned you can go a little bit

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
safety pin and automate might not come

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.470 
safety pin and automate might not come
down<00:00:53.160> here<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> little<00:00:53.520> bit<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.940> let<00:00:54.090> me<00:00:54.210> close

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that safety pin just like that and then

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.050 
that safety pin just like that and then
that<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.020> stitched<00:01:34.560> into<00:01:35.060> my
