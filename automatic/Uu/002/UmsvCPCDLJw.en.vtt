important<00:05:31.620> part<00:05:32.620> that<00:05:33.190> transfers<00:05:33.910> the<00:05:34.120> sound

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
important part that transfers the sound

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.440 
important part that transfers the sound
the<00:05:35.280> vibrations<00:05:36.280> from<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.550> strings<00:05:36.700> you<00:05:37.270> see

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:37.450 
the vibrations from the strings you see

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.600 
the vibrations from the strings you see
that<00:05:37.690> when<00:05:38.200> when<00:05:38.440> you<00:05:38.530> hit<00:05:38.680> them<00:05:38.860> both<00:05:39.280> strings

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
that when when you hit them both strings

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.700 
that when when you hit them both strings
the<00:05:40.270> vibrations<00:05:40.870> from<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.050> strings<00:05:41.200> goes

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
the vibrations from the strings goes

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.650 
the vibrations from the strings goes
down<00:05:41.950> through<00:05:42.190> the<00:05:42.370> bridge<00:05:42.610> through<00:05:43.450> that

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
down through the bridge through that

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.880 
down through the bridge through that
head<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.020> that's<00:05:44.140> what<00:05:44.320> makes<00:05:44.530> them<00:05:44.680> they

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
head and that's what makes them they

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.470 
head and that's what makes them they
sound<00:05:45.160> very<00:05:45.430> important<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.060> have<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.180> really

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
sound very important to have a really

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.630 
sound very important to have a really
good<00:05:48.120> bridge<00:05:49.120> on<00:05:49.330> your<00:05:49.360> banjo<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:49.990> get<00:05:50.230> to<00:05:50.640> get

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
good bridge on your banjo to get to get

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.270 
good bridge on your banjo to get to get
the<00:05:51.760> optimal<00:05:52.300> sound<00:05:52.540> out<00:05:52.960> of<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.230> and<00:05:53.560> then

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
the optimal sound out of it and then

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.200 
the optimal sound out of it and then
moving<00:05:54.640> down<00:05:54.960> past<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.080> bridge<00:05:56.760> we<00:05:57.760> have<00:05:57.910> the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
moving down past the bridge we have the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.290 
moving down past the bridge we have the
tailpiece<00:06:01.410> and<00:06:02.410> what<00:06:02.590> that<00:06:02.800> does<00:06:03.040> is<00:06:03.280> it<00:06:04.240> just

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
tailpiece and what that does is it just

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.800 
tailpiece and what that does is it just
connects<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.960> strings<00:06:05.320> from<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.710> back

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
connects the strings from the back

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.390 
connects the strings from the back
connect<00:06:07.810> the<00:06:08.320> strings<00:06:08.680> to<00:06:08.890> the<00:06:08.920> back<00:06:09.160> of<00:06:09.340> the

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
connect the strings to the back of the

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.880 
connect the strings to the back of the
tail<00:06:09.580> piece<00:06:09.790> right<00:06:10.090> right<00:06:10.570> back<00:06:11.380> up<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.650> the
