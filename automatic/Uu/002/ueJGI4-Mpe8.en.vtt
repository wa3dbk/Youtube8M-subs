00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
background okay so I'm just basically

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.520 
background okay so I'm just basically
taking<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> air<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.890> bread<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.840> then

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
taking the air out of the bread and then

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.760 
taking the air out of the bread and then
I'm<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> cut<00:00:41.730> sections<00:00:42.530> and<00:00:43.530> I've<00:00:43.680> been

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
I'm going to cut sections and I've been

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200 
I'm going to cut sections and I've been
doing<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.010> long<00:00:44.340> enough<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.850> kind

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
doing this long enough that I can kind

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.479 
doing this long enough that I can kind
of<00:00:45.300> guess<00:00:46.430> about<00:00:47.430> what<00:00:47.489> size<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.489> for

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
of guess about what size that I need for

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.240 
of guess about what size that I need for
each<00:00:50.670> pan<00:00:51.829> this<00:00:52.829> one<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.399> go<00:00:53.579> into

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
each pan this one is going to go into

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.069 
each pan this one is going to go into
the<00:00:56.250> 8<00:00:56.670> inch<00:00:56.910> pan<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> I'm<00:01:00.480> only<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:00.930> let

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the 8 inch pan and I'm only going to let

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.810 
the 8 inch pan and I'm only going to let
it<00:01:01.109> proof<00:01:01.440> because<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.129> been<00:01:02.309> proving<00:01:02.699> quite

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it proof because it's been proving quite

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
it proof because it's been proving quite
a<00:01:02.910> while<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:04.350> only<00:01:04.530> going<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.799> let<00:01:04.920> it

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
a while here I'm only going to let it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
a while here I'm only going to let it
proof<00:01:05.159> probably<00:01:05.549> another<00:01:05.790> 20<00:01:06.030> minutes<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.540> so

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
proof probably another 20 minutes or so

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.539 
proof probably another 20 minutes or so
and<00:01:06.960> then<00:01:07.020> throw<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.070> oven<00:01:08.159> because

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and then throw it into the oven because

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.539 
and then throw it into the oven because
I<00:01:08.700> don't<00:01:08.850> want<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> bread<00:01:09.299> dough<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:10.549> overflow

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I don't want the bread dough to overflow

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
I don't want the bread dough to overflow
the<00:01:11.729> pans<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.860> get<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> really

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the pans so and you get that really

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.480 
the pans so and you get that really
weird<00:01:15.060> like<00:01:15.780> alcohol<00:01:16.290> smell<00:01:18.830> when<00:01:19.830> they

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
weird like alcohol smell when they

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.460 
weird like alcohol smell when they
overproof<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.330> kind<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.659> funky<00:01:21.960> ammonia

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
overproof it's kind of a funky ammonia

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.430

as if i took the top and i just cut a
section<00:02:42.319> along<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.130> top<00:02:43.340> here<00:02:43.540> with<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> knife

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
section along the top here with a knife

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.229 
section along the top here with a knife
and<00:02:45.260> then<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:45.950> would<00:02:46.130> all<00:02:46.340> rise<00:02:46.670> kind<00:02:47.150> of

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
and then it would all rise kind of

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.699 
and then it would all rise kind of
toward<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.540> area<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.110> we<00:02:48.230> keep<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> bread

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
toward that area so we keep the bread

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.449 
toward that area so we keep the bread
shape<00:02:48.980> but<00:02:49.940> with<00:02:50.209> this<00:02:50.360> particular<00:02:50.569> bread<00:02:51.050> its

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
shape but with this particular bread its

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.990 
shape but with this particular bread its

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
pandion and i don't really need to do

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.559 
pandion and i don't really need to do
