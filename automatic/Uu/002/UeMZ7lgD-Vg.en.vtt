a good tip with an improvising is to
finish<00:02:50.210> on<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.870> root<00:02:51.050> note<00:02:51.080> which<00:02:51.500> in<00:02:51.650> this

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
finish on the root note which in this

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.860 
finish on the root note which in this
case<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:52.340> play<00:02:52.660> is<00:02:53.660> your<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:53.960> and<00:02:54.230> v<00:02:54.680> great
