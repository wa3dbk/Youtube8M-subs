00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.290
 the third part of the paper minecraft we 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.690
 Today I will show of course 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:20.180
 the actual business today we have resources and up 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:23.820
 resource i make a big diamond 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.820
 as you see i cut the shemk 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.769
 and we will be difficult, he will 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.380
 3D surround 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.820
 that is, forgive me, don't judge strictly here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 It turned out very smoothly and do this 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 here it is the back side of the diamond it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:54.030
 front you can copy this then 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.510
 I took a pixel like 4202 shorter 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.989
 pixel took 1 cell that's like one 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.620
 block you can say so can i tell you 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.619
 to show 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280
 shemku such a diamond but you can 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.710
 make it bigger you like 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.979
 want i'm going to do some 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.000
 the model can be even bigger and here I am 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 drew a sword going to make for myself 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.770
 the world but this diamond scheme we are there 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.170
 small diamond how do you see not that 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.930
 this 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.170
 that is, I will have a large amount not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.909
 diamond and flat small 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:48.950
 also i will be flat emerald here 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:53.600
 as you see you can draw everything 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.700
 that is, look here six down 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.429
 pixels 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.780
 here we go up one space then 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:09.049
 2 then 4 then we rise 2 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:15.019
 per per per 4 2 2 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:16.220
 by 3 by 2 by 1 that is, it will be a form 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.599
 such a diamond 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.000
 you can pause and draw 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:29.269
 and of course the quality is bad I take off 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.329
 here you can draw a sim card 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 there is this ass and this before 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:38.150
 And also with draw a scheme from mod yes the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.750
 it's easy here 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:51.250
 first 3 pixels then go up 1 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 on 1 on 1 on 6 on 1 on 1 on 1 on 3 1 116 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.450
 on 111 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.450
 principle easily you can also draw 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:15.420
 nothing further i'm for now that's all that 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:22.530
 I want to show what I painted 4 hours 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:29.319
 spent and this is this beauty is 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:34.950
 the skeleton here it is I spent 4 hours like me 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:39.540
 for a long time he painted here so hard and 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.540
 also i drew with lime 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:52.840
 here is a slide skeleton 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.940
 the skeleton here is very layer and can also be 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.379
 in the fourth part I'll show you ready 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.310
 3d diamond flat diamond and maybe 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:07.410
 emerald map let's see it happen 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.940
 maybe in 4 episodes i am you 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.870
 some diagram show for example the scheme 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.220
 Rubik's Cube 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:20.950
 that is, I made a rubik cube that is 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:25.210
 white side red yellow here 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.919
 orange so above blue below 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 green that is cool cube rubik 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:36.789
 turned out for some reason it looks like I'm 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.090
 watercolor paints to draw on the 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:44.320
 business here is a normal marker well such 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.590
 here's a cube of ruby ​​need to flip over here 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.880
 miles like blue such dove but 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.639
 in fact there is dark green that is 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:05:02.190
 I drew this dice bought here 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:02.190
 Rubik 's this is a real cube market 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.479
 here is the green side so i made a copy 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.599
 the same Rubik's Cube only with me 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:19.060
 It turned out less I took one 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:23.530
 cell as 3 pixels which means you 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:27.460
 you can draw it all yourself 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.830
 there i drew three parts of the matrix who 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:36.270
 se9 pixels up because they were baked 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.400
 here's the other 9 by 9 pixels 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.630
 and try to do this 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.040
 fine rubik cube 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.040
 he will just be for beauty 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:57.380
