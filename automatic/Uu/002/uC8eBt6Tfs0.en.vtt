00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.279 
makes us fat so obesity or overweight
it's<00:01:24.740> not<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:24.950> fat<00:01:25.280> problem<00:01:25.820> it's<00:01:26.240> an<00:01:26.450> over<00:01:26.750> acid

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
it's not a fat problem it's an over acid

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.260 
it's not a fat problem it's an over acid
problem<00:01:27.710> okay<00:01:28.039> so<00:01:28.100> balancing<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.880> the

that it has to do with diet and what we
eat<00:01:33.200> well<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.159> do<00:01:34.310> with<00:01:34.490> what<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.820> eat<00:01:35.119> what

eat well you do with what you eat what

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.510 
eat well you do with what you eat what
you<00:01:35.600> drink<00:01:35.630> even<00:01:36.409> your<00:01:36.649> thoughts<00:01:37.009> can<00:01:37.369> make

you drink even your thoughts can make

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.399 
you drink even your thoughts can make
you<00:01:37.670> over<00:01:37.939> acidic<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:39.350> really

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
you over acidic and so it's really

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.399 
you over acidic and so it's really
important<00:01:40.039> to<00:01:40.070> focus<00:01:40.280> on<00:01:40.670> more<00:01:41.329> alkaline<00:01:41.869> more
