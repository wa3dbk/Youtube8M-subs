 reach of the mouth 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.130
 but is it anyway you already 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.650
 food theory 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.779
 according to this diet what is good for each 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.809
 one of us has been chosen for thousands 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.170
 years it is in the genetic memory that the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.090
 our blood 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 the blood- type diet classifies the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.680
 food of three forms food 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 highly beneficial neutral foods and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.820
 harmful foods 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.730
 the highly beneficial foods they 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.610
 as a remedy in the body the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 neutrals only have nutritional value and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.690
 the poisons are naturopathic poisons 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.719
 eva herman has been working with the diet for eight 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.750
 years the food method has been 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.520
 developed almost half a century the two 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.189
 American doctors 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.430
 for them, blood is the key to 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.710
 digestive systems when 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.470
 we do not feed ourselves according to the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.530
 our blood type would be opening 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.030
 doors for diseases including the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
 obesity 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.390
 an example is the meat red meat 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.299
 type 3 is a remedy she energy her 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.049
 helps maintain the weight of the type there it is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.950
 a poison 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.130
 I had to say goodbye to red meat 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.350
 paulo is one of the four thousand patients 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.040

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:58.090

 paulo ate all the enemies of the group at 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.960
 and even not believing much in f1 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.540
 decided to try a menu 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:16.420
 rich and vegetable friends blood from soybean 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 vegetables black lentil beans 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.959
 fish like sardine sold 14 pounds 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.100
 and never went back to gain weight 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:31.090
 today as sodium is my main source for 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.070
 soybeans and occasionally a pet one 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.240
 chicken meat 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.900
 Nothing else who has my blood type. 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:44.200
 he is without rewarding the ideal basket of the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.610
 group or releases meat olive oil

 roll wheat-based foods 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.340

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.070
 it is much to our this is my 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:07.769
 problem any thing khan rooms and 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:12.390
 mother was like that yesterday, it 's just because it's 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.590
 even being the photo is nine months ago 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.250
 the extra pounds 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.510
 weighed in the health of the owner of two light 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.650
 months of regime 16 pounds less 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.470
 vanity recovered 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.920
 Dona Adelaide walks serelepe do 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.920
 pilot 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:39.120
 the motor fashion quite up to chances now 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.170
 everyone - year is already a big 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.349
 thing 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.590
 in the house of Mrs. madalena the reeducation 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.579
 food charged in the kitchen 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.430
 she has blood abe follows a diet but 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:56.159
 the house group continues to harvest the show 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.189
 who likes the line allowed the beans 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.079
 carioca and brown rice and white 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.689
 but they also do not like the 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.359
 Carioca beans prefer more jobs 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.730
 food to them black and white 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:12.359
 so this frank paper is beautiful 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.109
 of the tasty you pretend that the 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:18.509
 turning homage to the greatest 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.500
 enemies of the ab group are the meat 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.729
 red 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.270
 milk and corn and bananas and see how much 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.639
 of weight in relation to your photo 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.620
 all of 800 and it was not only the weight that 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.310
 improved by the way it was not just the weight 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.310
 was everything 

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:40.860
 adriana recently started the blood 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.500
 of type b is what allows the 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.320
 menu and tolerates the 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.599
 dairy is a problem less for those who 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.599
 feeds away from home as she 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.580
 increase your own tea on the floors and rice 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.030
 that it is wonderful that those who 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.820
 determines is lacking this helps 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.280
 accelerate a weight loss be me you 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.450
 has two options to act in this area is only 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:18.150
 another meat that is red 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:22.680
 creates type b should not consume meat 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.200
 of chicken wheat black beans and tomato 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.880
 adriana thinks it will not be so difficult 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:31.740
 as long as you pass away from the desserts 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.650
 but it is not enough to simply consume 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.770
 food as in all education 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.080
 This food also requires exercise. 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.230
 physical but also had a way 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.480
 different from the known one for example who 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.370
 have blood type b should do 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.200
 moderate exercise 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:54.540
 To send the bicycle to the adelaide is 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.280
 type 3 and you need to do exercises 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.680
 intense as running 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.590
 already dona madalena type abe needs 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.270
 just a light walk and your 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.490
 paulo that is of type a 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:09.200
 does not need much more than good 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.200
 reading to maintain the shape 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.910
 for the group a 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.100
 heavy exercise ends up promoting a 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.180
 agostin accumulation 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.419
 increases appetite and feeling tired 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:27.270
 so hard law and light exercise 

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:29.669
 would help reduce body and 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.280
 equilibrium according to the secret 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.590
 to live in peace with the balance 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.570
 for yes for not the ideal always 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.960
 seek medical advice before 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:42.750
 any diet and provide 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:45.900
 attention if she teaches you to eat right 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:48.690
 because no regime will replace the 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:53.780
 old maxim if you eat more than 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.780
 need to fatten the industry
