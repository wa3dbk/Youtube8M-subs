00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.880 
all I ever aim for since I just one
person<00:03:04.450> who<00:03:04.599> just<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.989> just<00:03:05.049> want<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.530> connect

think there's there's two rules that I

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.740 
think there's there's two rules that I
try<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.350> kind<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.829> go<00:03:12.040> by<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:13.090> most<00:03:13.299> important

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
try to kind of go by the most important

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.190 
try to kind of go by the most important
one<00:03:13.780> is<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.139> D<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.880> Golden<00:03:16.269> Rule<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:16.660> that's

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
one is the D the Golden Rule and that's

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.020 
one is the D the Golden Rule and that's
basically<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:18.010> treat<00:03:18.220> others<00:03:18.519> as<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.790> would

basically to treat others as you would
want<00:03:19.090> them<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.540> treat<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.420> know
