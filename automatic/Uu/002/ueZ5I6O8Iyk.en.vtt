00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.480
 micaela presents at the iaa f 2013 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.340
 in mÃ¼nster swivel camp it 150 er 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 offers for track construction in 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.299
 panned state more than six 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.550
 but dump truck reduces it 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.439
 space requirements at gleiss construction projects 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.130
 anyway extremely limited 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.310
 we have the Em 2013 here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 swung lada it brought 150 e 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.650
 a machine in the 11 5 tons class 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.480
 without and that is noticeable two ways 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.070
 because we are doing that for the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.350
 swing loader here to use 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 waive the two-way suspension 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.350
 We may not have to travel with you 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.710
 this machine but we can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.160
 then drive parallel to the gravel and 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.480
 bring in ballast or swell 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.309
 move laterally on the machine like that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.230
 that we save costs for the customer 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.520
 with a machine he work the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 classical character look exotic 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.690
 in the product range the canucks is the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.870
 best suited for the track 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 petra the special thing about the device 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.560
 is actually behind me 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 traditional locomotives are the locals 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.549
 idea of this locomotive is in one 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.220
 cooperation with a French 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.680
 manufacturer of ethik company 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.530
 the product is called be truck the b stands 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.090
 for twice that is once on the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.990
 road and once on the rail itself 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.330
 can move 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 We realize that in a simple way 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.450
 fashion is the basis of the machine 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.670
 namely a classic wheel loader one 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.380
 construction machine and the around of ours 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.200
 cooperation partner in france one 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.750
 Locomotive built around has an advantage 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.360
 that I just very easily on the track 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.159
 but driving can also be done 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.020
 Just as easy to get off the train 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 can and therefore the productivity of 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740
 can significantly increase machine enough 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.840
 not only has to drive by rail 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.159
 we can here with a device which is a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.960
 Use weight of 24 tons has up to 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.829
 Move or move 2,400 tons of wagons 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.360
 warp 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.860
 in the equivalent locomotive steel on steel 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.010
 I would have to weigh about one use 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.260
 of 50 tons 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.250
 it's a slightly unusual measure 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.140
 for a classic 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.180
 Baumaschinenhersteller and if you have the 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.950
 you visit the trade fair visit 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.440
 realize that you have so many 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.240
 Construction machines do not even find here 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760
 the construction machine is usually at 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.310
 track construction when the earth movement is done 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.670
 is out of the business because if then 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.560
 is worked on the railway whether new construction 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.320
 or repair are very very 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.480
 specific machines called for ballack 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.090
 That's why it feels so much here anyway 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.490
 at home because we are with our approach of 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.830
 multifunctionality of our machines ob 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.570
 with the excavators or the wheel loaders 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.940
 have as many as possible 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.630
 tools a wide variety of tasks 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.970
 to fulfill 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.530
 That's why we feel at this fair 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:58.890
 well and find our place in
