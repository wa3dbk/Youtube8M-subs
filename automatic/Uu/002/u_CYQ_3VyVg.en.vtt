00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
also what I could've done was gone for

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.740

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
probably should have done because then I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.740 
probably should have done because then I
could<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.000> gone<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.239> Rob's<00:01:03.390> feeling<00:01:03.660> which

could have gone for Rob's feeling which

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.030 
could have gone for Rob's feeling which
means<00:01:03.899> I've<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.170> an<00:01:04.379> extra<00:01:04.589> turn<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.860> talks

maybe he doesn't carry rock cider stone
edge<00:01:10.650> or<00:01:10.799> maybe<00:01:10.920> he's<00:01:11.159> fearing<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.549> fact<00:01:11.760> that

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.490 
edge or maybe he's fearing the fact that
he<00:01:11.970> could<00:01:12.119> miss<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.020> turn<00:01:13.170> after<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
he could miss then the turn after that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.570 
he could miss then the turn after that
he's<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> get<00:01:13.860> up<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> rock<00:01:14.280> says<00:01:14.430> I'm

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
he's going to get up the rock says I'm

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.399 
he's going to get up the rock says I'm
that's<00:01:14.820> going<00:01:15.030> sorry<00:01:15.689> as<00:01:15.869> i'm<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.170> going<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that's going sorry as i'm just going to

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.980 
that's going sorry as i'm just going to
rapid<00:01:16.770> spin<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.189> then<00:01:18.180> he<00:01:18.600> goes<00:01:18.720> for<00:01:18.900> Earth

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
rapid spin and then he goes for Earth

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840 
rapid spin and then he goes for Earth
quick<00:01:19.170> again<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.250> spun<00:01:20.490> away<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
quick again so because I spun away the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
quick again so because I spun away the
rocks<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.750> he<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.500> keeps<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.830> for

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
rocks and he just keeps going for

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.440 
rocks and he just keeps going for
earthquake<00:01:23.369> what<00:01:23.700> I'm<00:01:23.820> gonna<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
earthquake what I'm gonna do here is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
earthquake what I'm gonna do here is
actually<00:01:24.570> switch<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.170> my<00:01:25.259> Charizard<00:01:25.830> which

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
actually switch into my Charizard which

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.859 
actually switch into my Charizard which
also<00:01:26.549> could<00:01:26.759> have<00:01:26.880> been<00:01:27.000> risky<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.659> he

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
also could have been risky because he

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
also could have been risky because he
could<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.080> just<00:01:28.110> been<00:01:28.380> doing<00:01:28.470> all<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
could have just been doing all that to

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
could have just been doing all that to
probably<00:01:29.909> lower<00:01:30.240> my<00:01:30.450> Charizard<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> then

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
probably lower my Charizard in and then

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.630 
probably lower my Charizard in and then
gone<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> rocks<00:01:32.100> are<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.310> Stone<00:01:32.610> Age

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
gone from the rocks are the Stone Age

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.580 
gone from the rocks are the Stone Age
unlock<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.780> me<00:01:33.869> he<00:01:34.049> actually<00:01:34.140> just<00:01:34.439> go

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
unlock me for me he actually just go

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
unlock me for me he actually just go
straight<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> earthquake<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:35.970> was

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
straight for the earthquake which was

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.850 
straight for the earthquake which was
the<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.509> offensive<00:01:36.990> play<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.409> opposed<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the more offensive play as opposed to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.469 
the more offensive play as opposed to
the<00:01:37.979> smarter<00:01:38.310> play<00:01:38.460> because<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.000> was<00:01:39.150> him<00:01:39.299> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
the smarter play because if I was him I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
the smarter play because if I was him I
would<00:01:39.689> have<00:01:39.930> just<00:01:39.960> gone<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.409> rock<00:01:40.590> side<00:01:40.829> are

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
would have just gone for rock side are

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
would have just gone for rock side are

anyways<00:01:59.210> he<00:01:59.690> brings<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.080> sup<00:02:00.350> obviously

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
anyways he brings in sup obviously

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.560 
anyways he brings in sup obviously
freeing<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.520> fact<00:02:01.730> that<00:02:01.790> he<00:02:01.970> could<00:02:02.120> be<00:02:02.210> sparf

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570

unfortunately<00:02:37.100> actually<00:02:37.760> pulls<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.180> crit<00:02:38.450> but

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
unfortunately actually pulls a crit but

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.960 
unfortunately actually pulls a crit but
if<00:02:39.350> he<00:02:39.530> had<00:02:39.709> pulled<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.040> rockslide<00:02:40.400> I<00:02:40.730> mean

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
if he had pulled the rockslide I mean

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.340 
if he had pulled the rockslide I mean
sorry<00:02:41.180> if<00:02:41.330> he<00:02:41.450> had<00:02:41.600> pulled<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.900> flinch<00:02:42.170> and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
sorry if he had pulled the flinch and

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.750 
sorry if he had pulled the flinch and
then<00:02:42.709> hit<00:02:42.830> me<00:02:42.920> with<00:02:43.040> another<00:02:43.070> Rock<00:02:43.489> side<00:02:43.700> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
then hit me with another Rock side I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.550 
then hit me with another Rock side I
would<00:02:44.030> still<00:02:44.300> be<00:02:44.420> at<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.810> same<00:02:45.080> amount<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.440> HP

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
would still be at the same amount of HP

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.979 
would still be at the same amount of HP
so<00:02:45.950> it's<00:02:46.700> not<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.150> big<00:02:47.270> of<00:02:47.330> a<00:02:47.480> deal<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:47.810> this

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
so it's not that big of a deal but this

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.420 
so it's not that big of a deal but this
doesn't<00:02:48.320> mean<00:02:48.380> that<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.860> survivability<00:02:49.310> of

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
doesn't mean that the survivability of

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.390 
doesn't mean that the survivability of
my<00:02:50.030> why<00:02:50.270> not<00:02:50.480> is<00:02:50.630> basically<00:02:51.170> gone<00:02:51.620> because

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
my why not is basically gone because

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.530 
my why not is basically gone because
he's<00:02:52.520> gonna<00:02:52.610> bring<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.000> charge<00:02:53.239> on<00:02:53.390> him

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
he's gonna bring in the charge on him

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.210 
he's gonna bring in the charge on him
from<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.200> name<00:02:54.470> I'm<00:02:54.650> thinking<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.070> he<00:02:55.190> might

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
from the name I'm thinking that he might

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.770 
from the name I'm thinking that he might
go<00:02:55.520> for<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> dragon<00:02:56.209> dance<00:02:56.390> so<00:02:56.540> what<00:02:56.690> I'm

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
go for the dragon dance so what I'm

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.540 
go for the dragon dance so what I'm
gonna<00:02:56.870> do<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.140> actually<00:02:57.590> go<00:02:57.890> for<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.130> Encore

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
gonna do is actually go for the Encore

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.040 
gonna do is actually go for the Encore
but<00:02:59.090> he<00:02:59.150> ends<00:02:59.330> up<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.540> straight<00:02:59.870> for<00:02:59.989> the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
but he ends up going straight for the

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.810 
but he ends up going straight for the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.479 
but really even if he was specs and
pretty<00:03:26.570> sure<00:03:26.720> air<00:03:26.959> /<00:03:27.230> would<00:03:27.530> not<00:03:27.709> be<00:03:27.860> a<00:03:27.890> tua<00:03:28.190> KO

about<00:03:30.769> thirty<00:03:31.220> percent<00:03:31.340> which<00:03:31.970> means<00:03:32.209> another

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
about thirty percent which means another

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.780 
about thirty percent which means another
