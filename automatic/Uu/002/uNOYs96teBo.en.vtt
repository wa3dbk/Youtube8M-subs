00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:23.640
 more important to know now, and my brother 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.680

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.870
 here block yorktown away from the wires to 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.390
 another thing 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.560
 The first to say that, we 'll go. 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.970
 get here in this connected entry 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.640
 It made a small noise myself. 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.330
 ask is now listening to the noise 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.330
 here o 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:57.180
 Okay , now I'm going to make the sound here in the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 game only in the direction of the game can either 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.960
 to lower the normal tv to take all of tv 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.930
 let the sound have to be tone 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.140
 Let's hear it now, it's only the tone. 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.870
 There seems to be no more sound here now. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.550
 I'll teach you to move it from here. 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.130
 here in this place 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:19.950
 You will enter the cable and 2002 that goes 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.850
 be connected on the cell phone or ipod and things 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.280
 of the type 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.700
 that's when my guy happened to 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.080
 bond everything daddy hit in the middle of a 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.510
 game is talking to somebody you 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.670
 I was not going to make that difference here. 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.140
 the microphone and will be less 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.880
 your voice gets lower 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.800
 This little light will appear here. 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:44.810
 Red you are not saying anything ta 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.810
 mutated microphone and then you pull it over 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.860
 and you will now be in the role of the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.420
 The telephone is able to talk to your mother. 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.800
 always playing and will only have to call 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:05.310
 We always leave here always bigger. 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:09.480
 It will only get very low people I today 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.660
 I leave the 26 so because they stay 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.820
 they are so good but they are not great 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.680
 so nothing then can leave in the middle 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.550
 everything is going to be great for you both 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.760
 this step according to the last thing 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.360
 move from here you will see your return from 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.750
 voice 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.940
 you take and put the return of borges 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.870
 just this one here you control the volume 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:37.890
 of normal audio and this one you 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:39.780
 controls the sound of the game with the score at 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.950
 direction of the game so long here 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:46.500
 put the game on so long this was it 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:50.210
 that I wanted to show and ready, thanks. 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.210
 collaboration until the next
