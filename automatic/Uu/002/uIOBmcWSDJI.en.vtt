I would do a Likert to kind of hit a

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
I would do a Likert to kind of hit a
different<00:00:37.680> angle<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.370> target<00:00:38.640> shoulders<00:00:39.000> and

able to hit 335 on a medium grip so what
I<00:01:10.320> learned<00:01:10.560> today<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:12.030> volume<00:01:12.360> work

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
I learned today is your volume work

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.980 
I learned today is your volume work
whatever<00:01:13.619> most<00:01:14.100> comfortable<00:01:14.909> stance<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.659> grip

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that you have that's not most important

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210 
that you have that's not most important
if<00:01:18.930> you're<00:01:19.200> gonna<00:01:19.290> compete<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.830> powerlifting

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
if you're gonna compete in powerlifting

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.520 
if you're gonna compete in powerlifting

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
crossfit it's not great league what's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.469 
crossfit it's not great league what's
most<00:01:25.500> important<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.640> single<00:01:27.150> rep

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
most important is that single rep

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.999 
most important is that single rep
there's<00:01:27.930> people<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.920> only

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
there's people that I know that can only

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
there's people that I know that can only
swap<00:01:29.400> 405<00:01:30.150> maybe<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.750> three<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.079> four<00:01:31.259> times

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
swap 405 maybe like three or four times

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030 
swap 405 maybe like three or four times
but<00:01:32.159> they're<00:01:32.579> able<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.420> squat<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.170> 95<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.829> even

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
but they're able to squat for 95 or even

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.410 
but they're able to squat for 95 or even
500<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.670> competition<00:01:36.119> day

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
500 on competition day

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
500 on competition day
so<00:01:36.960> what's<00:01:37.200> most<00:01:37.409> important<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.979> finding<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
so what's most important is finding that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.080 
so what's most important is finding that
grip<00:01:39.000> or<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> stance<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.820> most

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
grip or that stance that is the most

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.270 
grip or that stance that is the most
powerful<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.750> most<00:01:42.960> explosive<00:01:43.439> because<00:01:43.829> once

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
powerful the most explosive because once

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.609 
powerful the most explosive because once
you<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.759> weight<00:01:45.210> moving<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:46.170> weight

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you get that weight moving that weight

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.980 
you get that weight moving that weight
has<00:01:46.890> broken<00:01:47.280> Ursa<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.270> has<00:01:48.600> its<00:01:48.810> own

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
has broken Ursa and it has its own

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.499 
has broken Ursa and it has its own
momentum<00:01:49.259> enough<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.610> use<00:01:50.729> less<00:01:51.180> force

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
momentum enough you can use less force

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.630 
momentum enough you can use less force
and<00:01:51.840> less<00:01:52.020> work<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.590> continue<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.189> finish<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and less work to continue and finish the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
and less work to continue and finish the
rep<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.960> about<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.619> amount<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
rep so it's not about the amount of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.740 
rep so it's not about the amount of
falling<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.640> you're<00:01:56.759> putting<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.270> taking

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
falling that you're putting in so taking

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.240 
falling that you're putting in so taking
this<00:01:57.840> philosophy<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.619> also<00:01:58.770> gonna<00:01:58.979> apply

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
this philosophy I'm also gonna apply

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.789 
this philosophy I'm also gonna apply
this<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.610> Della's<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.899> sumo<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.469> able<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
this to my Della's but sumo I'm able to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.500 
this to my Della's but sumo I'm able to
hit<00:02:01.950> 495<00:02:02.640> 4<00:02:03.210> reps

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510

eight<00:02:03.660> reps<00:02:04.230> of<00:02:04.380> nine<00:02:04.850> but<00:02:05.850> unconventional

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
eight reps of nine but unconventional

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.630 
eight reps of nine but unconventional
I<00:02:06.810> can<00:02:06.990> only<00:02:07.110> wrap<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.470> up<00:02:07.590> maybe<00:02:07.830> like<00:02:07.950> four<00:02:08.430> or

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
I can only wrap it up maybe like four or

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.850 
I can only wrap it up maybe like four or
five<00:02:08.700> times<00:02:09.119> but<00:02:09.960> every<00:02:10.290> single<00:02:10.470> time<00:02:10.650> I

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
five times but every single time I

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.140 
five times but every single time I
pulled<00:02:11.250> 545<00:02:12.060> conventional<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.840> get<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.290> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
pulled 545 conventional I get it and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.780 
pulled 545 conventional I get it and
probably<00:02:16.040> fifty<00:02:17.040> percent<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.490> time<00:02:17.670> when

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
probably fifty percent of the time when

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.740 
probably fifty percent of the time when
I<00:02:17.850> pull<00:02:18.150> 545<00:02:19.140> sumo<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.610> get<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.270> I

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
I pull 545 sumo I don't get it and I

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.330 
I pull 545 sumo I don't get it and I
even<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> hard<00:02:22.350> time<00:02:22.560> with<00:02:22.740> five<00:02:22.920> twenty

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
even have a hard time with five twenty

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.060 
even have a hard time with five twenty
five<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> that<00:02:24.420> tells<00:02:24.870> me<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.500> once<00:02:25.740> again

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
five so that tells me that once again
