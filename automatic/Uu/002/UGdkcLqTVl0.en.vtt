and now we're going to snip the excess

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.030 
and now we're going to snip the excess
wire<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:29.710> make<00:01:30.250> our<00:01:30.430> loop<00:01:31.440> what<00:01:32.440> I<00:01:32.470> usually<00:01:32.740> do

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
wire and make our loop what I usually do

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.510 
wire and make our loop what I usually do
is<00:01:33.220> I<00:01:33.340> put<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.790> wire<00:01:33.940> between<00:01:34.180> my<00:01:34.480> fingers<00:01:34.930> I

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
is I put the wire between my fingers I

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610 
is I put the wire between my fingers I
place<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.700> wire<00:01:36.880> cutters<00:01:37.390> right<00:01:37.810> above<00:01:38.140> very

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:38.620 
place the wire cutters right above very

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.280 
place the wire cutters right above very
carefully<00:01:39.220> and<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:40.570> usually<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:41.170> good

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
carefully and that's usually a good

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
carefully and that's usually a good
amount<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:42.040> length<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.420> make<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.900> loop<00:01:44.290> of

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
amount of length to make a loop of

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.760 
amount of length to make a loop of
course<00:01:46.450> you<00:01:46.660> can<00:01:46.810> use<00:01:46.960> whatever<00:01:47.110> technique

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770

ends<00:01:51.250> of<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.490> wire<00:01:51.600> before<00:01:52.600> you<00:01:52.750> snip<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:56.100> now

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
ends of the wire before you snip it now

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.290 
ends of the wire before you snip it now
you're<00:01:57.280> going<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.670> take<00:01:57.850> your<00:01:58.030> round<00:01:58.240> nose

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
you're going to take your round nose

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:10.469 
you're going to take your round nose
pliers<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:59.290> make<00:01:59.710> your<00:01:59.890> loop

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.690 

once<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.319> have<00:02:11.500> your<00:02:11.650> loop<00:02:11.890> you're<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.550> to

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
once you have your loop you're going to

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.229 
once you have your loop you're going to
thread<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.590> jump<00:02:14.890> ring<00:02:21.239> then

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
thread that on to your jump ring then

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.210

you're going to thread on your ear wire

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.030 
you're going to thread on your ear wire
before<00:02:24.580> we<00:02:24.879> close<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.300> jump<00:02:25.480> ring<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:26.040> always

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
before we close the jump ring I always

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.580 
before we close the jump ring I always
like<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.400> be<00:02:27.519> consistent<00:02:28.239> with<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.900> loops<00:02:29.140> so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
like to be consistent with the loops so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.940 
like to be consistent with the loops so
what<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.090> just<00:02:31.599> as<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.900> habit<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.650> make
