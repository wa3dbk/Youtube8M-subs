00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.460
 best legendary pokémon according to their 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.890
 states is the 'top ten' according to its 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.870
 defense I hope you like it and I do not know 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.690

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:55.750

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.030
 forget to give it to and subscribe good 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.220
 before starting I would like to repeat what 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 that I said in the previous top ten and that is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.839
 the data is 100% real 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.880
 taken from the wikileaks page if not 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.640
 you think you can search in google or click 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.039
 in the link that I leave in the subscription 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.340
 well let's start at once in the 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:18.490
 put number 10 we find 339 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.680
 points to month spirit damn asshole 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.930
 floating dwarf is a damn forever 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.880
 Alone lives alone in a cave in the middle of 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.000
 a lake if he lived in civilization 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.850
 I would live locked in a closet xddddd 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.920
 of dvd but well all that does not matter if 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.780
 you enter the 'top ten' even if it's in the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.270
 tenth position because it means that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.190
 you have good stats although a pokémon of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.970
 sinister guy with high attack gets him 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.070
 a game 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.310
 a low and sure blow that puts it in a 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.700
 I'm good, we're going with the next one 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.520
 the 9th place with 342 points is 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.100
 gea tran yo 0 that is not very surprising 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.170
 because this bicharraco shows that it has 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.780
 a lot of defense although it seems that it has 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.940
 more than what he really has besides is 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.730
 another forever alone lives at the bottom of the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.950
 sea is joke in the background of the damn 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.320
 hard mountain and the mountain reverence of 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.240

 It can also be good male or female 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.010
 Do not despair, do not worry 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.030

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.440

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.120
 it is in a great position in attack not 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.580
 I'll tell you what if you want to know 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.010
 you will have to see that video but although 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.380
 have a good defense a place and or a match 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.890
 amp and so on they put an accurate wave and 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.300
 they burst it in the position number 7 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.270

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.060

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.709

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.830

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.390

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:23.400
 win the champions that madrid xddddd 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.220

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.840
 like a lot personally have a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.390
 aspect of leader and of noble good we go 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.320
 already with the next position in the post 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:40.380
 number 4 are positioned with 394 points 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.750
 lucia yoox and I have already lived schattat maracas 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.750

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.010
 account of who I prefer between looked and 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.449
 joe joe and he looks like he puts a hydro 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.620
 bombay the most 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.340
 behind 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:00.440
 and oxygen is bad very defensive though 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.270
 I like to fight on the offensive and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.940
 play around with the changes of 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.250
 good features let's open already 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.729
 the expected podium with bronze in the 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.639
 bronze defense is positioned with 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.380
 416 points dragon good if you have seen 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.690
 the 'top ten' attack you will have given 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.600
 realize that it is a very physical Pokémon 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.960
 although that is quite normal since with 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.479
 his 950 kilos is the heaviest pokemon 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.090
 that there is truth that is a beast 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:30.169
 physical though the movements 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.840
 dependent on the weight can happen 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.240
 invoice and the silver arrives here 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.900
 'top ten' in the position number 2 we 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.360
 we found with 438 points with register 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.370
 I can not tell you about this pokemon 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.889
 a lot since I've never had it 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.660
 although if I can tell you an anecdote and 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.669
 is that in their spirits in the games 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.190
 diamond and pearl is in a posture 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:52.789
 similar to the Nazi greeting what caused great 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.760
 controversy 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.220
 If you do not believe it, look for it and the 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.099
 gold of the 'top ten' with this pokemon in the 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.099
 ranked number 1 with 548 points 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.529
 to king and whatever goes the kings are 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:14.379
 the kings of this 'top ten' 3 of 4 miss 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.479
 king and 6 that has not gone well either 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.249
 I know a lot about this pokemon is weak to the 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.409
 guy fights like his other three 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:22.449
 companions but he is the one who has more 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:25.569
 defense so it can hold up pretty 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:27.550
 good good friends, I hope I have 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:29.860
 liked the video here says goodbye 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.999
