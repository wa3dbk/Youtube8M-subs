00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
the thing is about like frame rates and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.590 
the thing is about like frame rates and
stuff<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:04.290> for<00:01:04.619> games<00:01:05.060> 60fps<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.299> actually

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
stuff I know for games 60fps is actually

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120 
stuff I know for games 60fps is actually
helpful<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.260> reaction<00:01:07.500> times<00:01:08.010> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
helpful because of reaction times and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.679 
helpful because of reaction times and
all<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.570> but<00:01:09.570> with<00:01:09.960> animation<00:01:11.420> the<00:01:12.420> amount

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
all that but with animation the amount

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.100 
all that but with animation the amount
of<00:01:12.780> frames<00:01:13.049> after<00:01:13.439> maybe<00:01:14.330> 24<00:01:15.330> becomes<00:01:15.780> sort<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
of frames after maybe 24 becomes sort of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.149 
of frames after maybe 24 becomes sort of
redundant<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.869> you're<00:01:18.869> basically<00:01:19.350> doing

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
redundant because you're basically doing

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
redundant because you're basically doing
more<00:01:20.909> than<00:01:21.090> two<00:01:21.330> times<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.900> amount<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.259> work

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
more than two times the amount of work

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.410 
more than two times the amount of work
for<00:01:23.100> something<00:01:23.490> that's<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.240> gonna

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
for something that's not really gonna

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.859 
for something that's not really gonna
look<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.049> different<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> probably<00:01:27.689> not

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
look that much different so probably not

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.210 
look that much different so probably not
