00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.329 

the<00:00:02.939> next<00:00:03.270> step<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.020> shrink<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.589> rejecting

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
the next step is to shrink the rejecting

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.750 
the next step is to shrink the rejecting
tube<00:00:05.609> into<00:00:06.029> place<00:00:06.440> this<00:00:07.440> tube<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:08.040> pre<00:00:08.340> coated

tube into place this tube is pre coated

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.270 
tube into place this tube is pre coated
with<00:00:08.910> adhesive<00:00:09.480> so<00:00:09.960> when<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.230> shrinks<00:00:10.440> it<00:00:10.830> will

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
with adhesive so when it shrinks it will

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.280 
with adhesive so when it shrinks it will
seal<00:00:11.580> completely<00:00:11.910> around<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> cable<00:00:13.049> jacket

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
is heated the adhesive will flow at the

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.060 
is heated the adhesive will flow at the
ends<00:00:21.390> indicating<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.500> shrinking<00:00:22.949> is
