the<00:01:57.329> hit<00:01:57.479> detection<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.079> game<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.350> vastly

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the hit detection in this game is vastly

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.959 
the hit detection in this game is vastly
better<00:01:58.920> than<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> modern<00:01:59.820> warfare

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
better than it is a modern warfare

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.859 
better than it is a modern warfare
modern<00:02:00.780> warfare<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.229> black<00:02:01.439> ops<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
modern warfare in black ops so

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.499 
modern warfare in black ops so
yeah<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> can't<00:02:04.619> complain<00:02:04.740> too<00:02:05.070> much<00:02:05.509> but

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
yeah so I can't complain too much but

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.570 
yeah so I can't complain too much but
anyways<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.259> couple<00:02:07.979> times<00:02:08.100> it's<00:02:08.340> happened

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
anyways a couple times it's happened

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.620 
anyways a couple times it's happened
where<00:02:08.670> I've<00:02:08.759> been<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.330> middle<00:02:09.569> of

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
where I've been in the middle of

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.100 
where I've been in the middle of
disarming<00:02:10.110> mcom<00:02:10.500> station<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.450> bar

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
disarming mcom station and it the bar

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.530 
disarming mcom station and it the bar
just<00:02:13.350> disappears<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:14.970> understand<00:02:15.360> that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
just disappears I don't understand that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.880 
just disappears I don't understand that
and<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.900> because<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.260> got<00:02:16.290> too<00:02:16.530> far<00:02:16.770> away

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
and it's not because I got too far away

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.920 
and it's not because I got too far away
because<00:02:17.340> there's<00:02:18.150> been<00:02:18.270> other<00:02:18.450> times<00:02:18.510> where

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
because there's been other times where

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.300 
because there's been other times where
up<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> couple<00:02:19.440> feet<00:02:19.650> away<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.890> still<00:02:20.130> being

up in a couple feet away and still being

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.610 
up in a couple feet away and still being
able<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.670> disarm<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.390> that's<00:02:21.989> not<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.410> case

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
able to disarm it so that's not the case

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.930 
able to disarm it so that's not the case
that's<00:02:22.830> not<00:02:23.069> why<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:25.670> disarming<00:02:26.670> bar

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that's not why I the disarming bar

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.520 
that's not why I the disarming bar
disappeared<00:02:27.630> for<00:02:27.810> me<00:02:27.930> in<00:02:28.020> that<00:02:28.080> last

disappeared for me in that last

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.460 
disappeared for me in that last

situation but when I was noting on was

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.750 
situation but when I was noting on was
that<00:02:31.650> they<00:02:31.830> still<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.250> problem<00:02:32.520> where

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
that they still have that problem where

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.220 
that they still have that problem where
if<00:02:32.910> someone<00:02:33.120> dies<00:02:33.390> while<00:02:33.750> they're<00:02:33.900> trying<00:02:34.170> to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.380 
it a kit of course next to me in comm
station<00:02:38.280> because<00:02:38.580> we're<00:02:38.760> trying<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> disarm

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390

station because we're trying to disarm
it<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.260> when<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.860> next<00:02:41.040> teammate<00:02:41.550> goes<00:02:41.760> up<00:02:41.970> to

try<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.300> disarm<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.870> rather<00:02:43.380> than<00:02:43.650> getting<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
try to disarm it rather than getting the

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860 
try to disarm it rather than getting the
the<00:02:45.510> action<00:02:46.170> which<00:02:46.530> is<00:02:46.709> be<00:02:47.330> before<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.600> to

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the action which is be before be to

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.890 
the action which is be before be to
start<00:02:49.050> disarming<00:02:50.300> conveniently<00:02:51.300> be<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
start disarming conveniently be is the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.050 
start disarming conveniently be is the
same<00:02:52.110> button<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.560> pick<00:02:52.739> up<00:02:52.890> your<00:02:52.920> kit<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.519> so

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
same button to pick up your kit and so

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
same button to pick up your kit and so
when<00:02:54.299> you<00:02:54.360> go<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> disarm<00:02:54.900> often<00:02:55.260> types<00:02:55.470> of

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
when you go to disarm often types of

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.949 
when you go to disarm often types of
just<00:02:55.769> start<00:02:55.920> swapping<00:02:56.340> kits<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.720> just

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
just start swapping kits and it just

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.720 
just start swapping kits and it just
throws<00:02:58.290> off<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.680> disarming<00:02:59.130> process<00:02:59.549> and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
throws off the disarming process and

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.699 
throws off the disarming process and
oftentimes<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.390> gets<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.989> screwed<00:03:01.290> over<00:03:01.440> they

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
oftentimes it gets you screwed over they

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.259 
oftentimes it gets you screwed over they
haven't<00:03:02.040> fixed<00:03:02.220> that<00:03:02.370> yet<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:02.970> don't

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
haven't fixed that yet and so I don't

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.199 
haven't fixed that yet and so I don't
know<00:03:03.360> why<00:03:03.569> that<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.519> I<00:03:05.519> don't<00:03:05.880> know<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.090> they

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
know why that is I don't know if they

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.970 
know why that is I don't know if they
could<00:03:06.269> put<00:03:06.720> something<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.410> program<00:03:07.769> to

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
could put something in in the program to

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.590 
could put something in in the program to

so<00:05:20.590> your<00:05:20.740> bullets<00:05:21.220> actually<00:05:21.400> act<00:05:21.820> as<00:05:22.180> objects

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
so your bullets actually act as objects

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.590 
so your bullets actually act as objects
and<00:05:23.200> so<00:05:23.500> as<00:05:23.800> a<00:05:23.860> distance<00:05:24.460> increases

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
and so as a distance increases

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.590 
and so as a distance increases
as<00:05:27.560> an<00:05:27.800> object<00:05:28.040> i<00:05:28.430> should<00:05:28.610> say<00:05:28.790> increases<00:05:29.450> in

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
as an object i should say increases in

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.570 
as an object i should say increases in
distance<00:05:30.050> away<00:05:30.230> from<00:05:30.560> you<00:05:30.710> you<00:05:30.890> have<00:05:31.310> to<00:05:31.370> make

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
distance away from you you have to make

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.210 
distance away from you you have to make
up<00:05:31.610> for<00:05:31.790> it<00:05:32.090> and<00:05:32.240> so<00:05:32.480> if<00:05:32.780> a<00:05:32.930> guy<00:05:33.140> is<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.860> hundred

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
up for it and so if a guy is a hundred

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.550 
up for it and so if a guy is a hundred
yards<00:05:34.520> away<00:05:34.670> you<00:05:35.510> actually<00:05:35.750> have<00:05:36.110> to<00:05:36.230> carry

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 
yards away you actually have to carry

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.770 
yards away you actually have to carry
your<00:05:36.890> reticle<00:05:37.460> slightly<00:05:38.270> above<00:05:38.480> them<00:05:38.630> because

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
your reticle slightly above them because

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.480 
your reticle slightly above them because
your<00:05:38.930> bullet<00:05:39.200> will<00:05:39.350> drop<00:05:39.710> over<00:05:40.100> that<00:05:40.250> distance

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
your bullet will drop over that distance

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.360 
your bullet will drop over that distance
and<00:05:40.910> you<00:05:40.970> also<00:05:41.120> have<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.480> lead<00:05:41.720> guys<00:05:42.020> too<00:05:42.470> and

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
and you also have to lead guys too and

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.920 
and you also have to lead guys too and
so<00:05:43.550> if<00:05:43.640> a<00:05:43.700> guy's<00:05:43.850> strafing<00:05:44.300> sideways<00:05:44.780> across

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
so if a guy's strafing sideways across

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.890 
so if a guy's strafing sideways across
your<00:05:45.290> screen<00:05:45.530> at<00:05:45.940> 200<00:05:46.940> yards<00:05:47.330> you<00:05:47.720> not<00:05:47.870> only

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
your screen at 200 yards you not only

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.740 
your screen at 200 yards you not only
have<00:05:48.230> to<00:05:48.260> lead<00:05:48.610> lead<00:05:49.610> him<00:05:49.910> but<00:05:50.180> yet<00:05:50.360> the<00:05:50.510> make

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
have to lead lead him but yet the make

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.530 
have to lead lead him but yet the make
up<00:05:50.930> for<00:05:51.080> the<00:05:51.140> bolt<00:05:51.350> dropped<00:05:51.650> as<00:05:51.800> well<00:05:52.070> and

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
up for the bolt dropped as well and

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.450

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
being able to do that at one point of

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.360 
being able to do that at one point of
sniping<00:05:55.730> and<00:05:56.060> also<00:05:56.720> be<00:05:56.870> able<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:57.080> play

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
close-quarter battles with the sniper

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.050 
close-quarter battles with the sniper
rifle<00:05:59.630> they<00:06:00.350> have<00:06:00.500> done<00:06:00.710> such<00:06:01.310> an<00:06:01.550> amazing<00:06:01.670> job

because I was basically sleep and I put
down<00:06:56.480> my<00:06:56.540> controller<00:06:56.960> because<00:06:57.110> there<00:06:57.290> was
