00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
probably continue to always do when I

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.330 
probably continue to always do when I
team<00:03:54.810> do<00:03:55.049> something<00:03:55.440> make<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.650> big<00:03:55.859> first<00:03:56.099> down

team do something make a big first down

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.449 
team do something make a big first down
on<00:03:56.730> fourth-and-one<00:03:57.359> or<00:03:57.810> school<00:03:58.220> we<00:03:59.220> act<00:03:59.400> like

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
on fourth-and-one or school we act like

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:00.830 
on fourth-and-one or school we act like
the<00:03:59.639> game's<00:03:59.849> over<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.269> it<00:04:00.569> could<00:04:00.690> be<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
the game's over and it could be the

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.750 
the game's over and it could be the
first<00:04:01.049> quarter<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.129> I<00:04:02.159> just<00:04:02.370> feel<00:04:02.609> we<00:04:02.730> just

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
first quarter so I just feel we just

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.430 
first quarter so I just feel we just
gotta<00:04:03.030> keep<00:04:03.599> keeping<00:04:04.049> each<00:04:04.109> other<00:04:04.169> together

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
gotta keep keeping each other together

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.270 
gotta keep keeping each other together
and<00:04:05.310> play<00:04:05.459> hard<00:04:06.799> what<00:04:07.799> did<00:04:07.919> you<00:04:08.069> learn<00:04:08.220> about

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
and play hard what did you learn about

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.879 
and play hard what did you learn about
that<00:04:08.819> particular<00:04:09.030> law<00:04:09.690> about<00:04:10.109> your<00:04:10.379> team<00:04:10.590> and

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
that particular law about your team and

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.259 
that particular law about your team and
also<00:04:11.010> yourself<00:04:11.430> I<00:04:12.590> figured<00:04:13.590> that<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:15.030> as

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
also yourself I figured that like as

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.029 
also yourself I figured that like as
much<00:04:15.510> what<00:04:15.810> did<00:04:15.930> you<00:04:15.989> exactly<00:04:16.139> what<00:04:16.739> he<00:04:16.829> said

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
much what did you exactly what he said

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.149 
much what did you exactly what he said
how<00:04:17.639> some<00:04:18.479> time<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> team<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.739> out<00:04:19.889> and

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:20.159 
how some time a team can get out and

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:21.800 
how some time a team can get out and
there<00:04:20.489> will<00:04:20.729> Spirit<00:04:21.090> will<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.359> slow<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.599> get

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
there will Spirit will be slow to get

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.760 
there will Spirit will be slow to get
out<00:04:21.959> and<00:04:22.109> then<00:04:22.229> they'll<00:04:22.349> bring<00:04:22.530> us

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
out and then they'll bring us

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.219 
out and then they'll bring us
but<00:04:23.639> the<00:04:23.879> first<00:04:24.120> week<00:04:24.360> that<00:04:24.599> really<00:04:24.960> didn't

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
but the first week that really didn't

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.159 
but the first week that really didn't
affect<00:04:25.349> as<00:04:25.680> much<00:04:25.919> like<00:04:26.879> some<00:04:27.180> somehow<00:04:27.599> the

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
affect as much like some somehow the

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.140 
affect as much like some somehow the
second<00:04:28.530> week<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.830> really<00:04:29.009> came<00:04:29.280> back<00:04:29.550> to<00:04:29.970> show

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
second week it really came back to show

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.180 
second week it really came back to show
from<00:04:30.360> last<00:04:30.479> year<00:04:30.750> I<00:04:30.780> wish<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.199> do<00:04:31.319> that<00:04:31.500> we

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
from last year I wish to do that we

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.770 
from last year I wish to do that we
thought<00:04:32.370> we<00:04:32.580> thought<00:04:32.940> we<00:04:33.120> were<00:04:33.330> getting<00:04:33.419> over

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
thought we thought we were getting over

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.260 
thought we thought we were getting over
things<00:04:33.900> like<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.319> but<00:04:35.009> I<00:04:35.190> really<00:04:35.819> bring<00:04:36.150> it

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
things like that but I really bring it

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.330 
things like that but I really bring it
back<00:04:36.389> to<00:04:36.569> practice<00:04:36.930> the<00:04:37.080> way<00:04:37.169> practice<00:04:37.560> was<00:04:37.770> we

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
back to practice the way practice was we

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.460 
back to practice the way practice was we
were<00:04:38.490> sluggish<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.210> when<00:04:39.569> in<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.139> game<00:04:40.319> we

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
were sluggish so when in the game we

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.200 
were sluggish so when in the game we
started<00:04:40.770> to<00:04:40.860> be<00:04:40.979> sluggish<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.550> then<00:04:42.060> we<00:04:42.180> just

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
started to be sluggish and then we just

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.830 
started to be sluggish and then we just
shut<00:04:42.569> down<00:04:42.599> so<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.500> lot<00:04:43.740> of<00:04:43.770> it<00:04:43.979> is<00:04:44.099> mental<00:04:44.840> to

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
shut down so a lot of it is mental to

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.110 
shut down so a lot of it is mental to
say<00:04:45.960> that<00:04:46.169> would<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.560> agree<00:04:46.710> yes<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:47.280> lot<00:04:47.819> of<00:04:47.879> an

say that would you agree yes a lot of an

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.710 
say that would you agree yes a lot of an
answer<00:04:48.389> as<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:50.190> go<00:04:50.400> down<00:04:50.699> the<00:04:50.940> road<00:04:51.210> you've<00:04:51.539> got
