 fully pack 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:25.600
 There is a slight flattening 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:30.640
 in that case, destroy everything 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:35.560

 How cool is that ? 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:49.629
 Sometimes it rewards me confused something 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.750
 shoots down there are the things 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.019

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:09.189

 cool that I say sluggish are 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.830
 the world is always changing dynamically 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.870
 I think clubs even hunt for me 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.870

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.199

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.319

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.999
 be careful that meets otherwise 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:16.759
 through you through 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:16.759
 through zack &amp; pop and r over ok and 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:28.919
 Pacman now ok but still missing 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:37.050
 units 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:41.219
 I do not have to look long what 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:45.800
 would have happened if you come in effect 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:06:01.430
 to donator is almost in or out again 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:06:01.430

 still further or what I want people 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.389
 I once thought of what happens when 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.159
 collecting all nothing changes 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:37.659
 it's just a gimmick somehow 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:39.610
 I found out 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:40.750

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.729

 We would like some credit or 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.259
 Anything else can also like game suggestions 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.000

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:50.110
