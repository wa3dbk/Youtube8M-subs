my<00:00:05.050> last<00:00:05.290> column<00:00:05.740> I<00:00:05.950> got<00:00:06.340> a<00:00:06.370> few<00:00:06.609> questions

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
my last column I got a few questions

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.140 
my last column I got a few questions
about<00:00:07.530> soul<00:00:08.530> during<00:00:08.800> the<00:00:08.950> small<00:00:09.280> wires<00:00:09.639> to<00:00:10.120> the

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
about soul during the small wires to the

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.170 
about soul during the small wires to the
LEDs<00:00:10.750> and<00:00:11.080> some<00:00:12.010> apprehension<00:00:12.670> about<00:00:12.760> doing

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
LEDs and some apprehension about doing

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.750 
LEDs and some apprehension about doing
that<00:00:13.350> well<00:00:14.350> these<00:00:14.590> little<00:00:14.830> tiny<00:00:15.070> things<00:00:15.490> can

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:15.760 
that well these little tiny things can

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.029 
that well these little tiny things can
be<00:00:15.910> made<00:00:16.059> to<00:00:16.090> behave<00:00:16.570> if<00:00:16.869> you<00:00:17.289> take<00:00:17.529> your<00:00:17.710> time

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
be made to behave if you take your time

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.009 
be made to behave if you take your time
and<00:00:18.310> a<00:00:18.670> little<00:00:18.789> care<00:00:19.150> shouldering<00:00:19.599> the<00:00:19.720> wires

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
and a little care shouldering the wires

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.919 
and a little care shouldering the wires
to<00:00:20.409> them<00:00:20.529> becomes<00:00:21.009> quite<00:00:21.339> easy<00:00:21.659> let<00:00:22.659> me<00:00:22.779> show

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
to them becomes quite easy let me show

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.300 
to them becomes quite easy let me show
you<00:00:22.960> how<00:00:23.550> let's<00:00:24.550> turn<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:24.880> soldering<00:00:25.359> iron<00:00:25.570> on

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
you how let's turn a soldering iron on

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.639 
you how let's turn a soldering iron on
while<00:00:27.310> that's<00:00:27.460> getting<00:00:27.909> heated<00:00:28.089> up<00:00:28.619> what<00:00:29.619> I

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
while that's getting heated up what I

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.710 
while that's getting heated up what I
have<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:30.039> do<00:00:30.189> is<00:00:30.369> to<00:00:30.609> actually<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:32.710> flux<00:00:33.070> on

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:33.720 
have to do is to actually put flux on

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:42.900 
have to do is to actually put flux on
each<00:00:35.100> LED<00:00:36.420> both<00:00:37.420> sides<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.609> solder

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
each LED both sides so that the solder

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.680 
each LED both sides so that the solder
will<00:00:43.269> flow<00:00:43.890> easily<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:49.149> right<00:00:49.239> now<00:00:49.420> that<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
will flow easily all right now that the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.029 
will flow easily all right now that the
soldering<00:00:50.019> iron<00:00:50.320> has<00:00:50.500> reached<00:00:50.739> its

things easier or just approach oops here

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:18.180 
things easier or just approach oops here
we<00:01:08.290> go<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.320> little<00:01:11.440> pass<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:17.190> the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
we go just a little pass one on the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.310 
we go just a little pass one on the
other<00:01:18.280> that's<00:01:19.000> always<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.600> it<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.050> wires

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
other that's always to it not a wires

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:30.010 
other that's always to it not a wires
already

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.719 

just<00:01:30.680> take<00:01:30.859> the<00:01:30.890> wire<00:01:32.829> take<00:01:33.829> one<00:01:34.130> side<00:01:34.460> as

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
just take the wire take one side as

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.599 
just take the wire take one side as
close<00:01:35.090> as<00:01:35.359> you<00:01:35.509> can<00:01:35.750> to<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.259> shrink<00:01:37.039> tubing

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
close as you can to the shrink tubing

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:44.499 
close as you can to the shrink tubing
and<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:39.770> other<00:01:39.920> side<00:01:40.479> right<00:01:41.479> on<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:41.750> pad<00:01:43.509> this

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
and the other side right on the pad this

00:01:44.509 --> 00:02:03.880 
and the other side right on the pad this
is<00:01:44.689> where<00:01:44.960> tiny<00:01:45.469> adjustments<00:01:45.679> are<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.850> order

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.700 

there<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:08.929> they're<00:02:09.929> pretty<00:02:10.350> much<00:02:10.380> in

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
there you go they're pretty much in

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.070 
there you go they're pretty much in
place<00:02:10.979> now<00:02:12.890> okay<00:02:13.890> let's<00:02:14.220> try<00:02:14.460> this<00:02:14.840> here<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:15.990> go

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
place now okay let's try this here we go

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
place now okay let's try this here we go
I'm<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.800> very<00:02:17.400> touch<00:02:20.870> to<00:02:21.870> one<00:02:22.050> side<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
I'm just very touch to one side to the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:35.270 
I'm just very touch to one side to the
other<00:02:27.000> side<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:31.310> will<00:02:32.310> see<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:34.040> put<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.130> back

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
other side you will see that put it back

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.300 
other side you will see that put it back
a<00:02:35.340> bit<00:02:35.490> here<00:02:37.400> she<00:02:38.400> stepped<00:02:38.730> right<00:02:38.940> on<00:02:39.000> there

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
a bit here she stepped right on there

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.949 
a bit here she stepped right on there
and<00:02:41.310> I'm<00:02:41.489> going<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.730> cut<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:45.090> exceeding<00:02:45.690> water

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and I'm going to cut the exceeding water

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:56.479 
and I'm going to cut the exceeding water
off<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:48.180> there's<00:02:48.480> your<00:02:48.690> LED<00:02:55.160> hope<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.340> now

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
off and there's your LED hope you now

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.449 
off and there's your LED hope you now
once<00:02:56.730> we've<00:02:57.630> soldered<00:02:58.200> sucker<00:02:58.980> on<00:02:59.220> there

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
once we've soldered sucker on there

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.690 
once we've soldered sucker on there
let's<00:03:00.120> test<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:01.190> he<00:03:02.690> Eureka<00:03:04.280> we<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.459> one

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
let's test it he Eureka we have one

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.729 
let's test it he Eureka we have one

shining in while we're here would you

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.860 
shining in while we're here would you
show<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.070> how<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.549> box<00:03:11.910> works<00:03:12.239> I<00:03:14.750> brought<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
show you how this box works I brought it

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.430 
show you how this box works I brought it
down<00:03:16.049> from<00:03:16.080> 30<00:03:16.560> milliamps
