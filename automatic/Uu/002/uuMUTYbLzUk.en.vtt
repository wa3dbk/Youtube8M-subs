00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello everyone, max and today we are 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.040
 try with you to calculate our cheaters 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.610
 customer today with nickname brother look 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.610
 observe 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.060
 there was a player already saw it yes he 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:33.150
 tried to shoot such a building 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:36.390
 but this is impossible he saw standing 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:41.090
 me in x because in order to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 cheat computations are so much more convenient 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 so i will come back when the round is over and so 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.050
 I returned again watching one further 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.220
 the warning is already there once 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.220
 already slept and so we look 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.509
 It seems ours, I think that we have a. 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.750
 Well, you will not move it all look 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.750
 farther 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.600
 so 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.149
 saw a player 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.149
 of course will shoot 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.649
 I think in that moment when he shot he 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.049
 drove the mouse and 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:46.049
 I drove the mouse just a straight through to the player 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.750
 so we will count it as 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.799
 second warning for 2 fields like u 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:59.899
 slept so our little brother turned out 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:02:03.689
 cheat we burned him and he got a ban 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.069
 I hope you enjoyed this server 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.069
 bye everyone
