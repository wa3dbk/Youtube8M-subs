thing's monsters the new furnaces these

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.650 
thing's monsters the new furnaces these
days<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.860> about<00:00:49.950> half<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.969> length<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.480> this

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
as you can see this thing's almost as

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.090 
as you can see this thing's almost as
big<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.520> my<00:00:53.730> truck<00:00:53.969> bed<00:00:54.590> there's<00:00:55.590> probably<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
big as my truck bed there's probably a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
big as my truck bed there's probably a
few<00:00:56.129> hundred<00:00:56.460> pounds<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.730> steel<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.390> tin<00:00:57.980> here

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
few hundred pounds of steel and tin here

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.029 
few hundred pounds of steel and tin here
there's<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.140> liner<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.920> was

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
inside that goes up to the roof we went

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.620 
inside that goes up to the roof we went
to<00:01:05.489> had<00:01:05.580> replaced<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.240> because<00:01:06.479> this

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to had replaced all that because this

to had replaced all that because this
there's<00:01:06.840> full<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> rust<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.619> when<00:01:08.400> we<00:01:08.520> pull

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
there's full of rust and when we pull

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.230 
there's full of rust and when we pull
this<00:01:08.790> apart

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
this apart

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.450 
this apart
the<00:01:09.720> previous<00:01:10.200> owners<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.560> lived<00:01:10.740> here<00:01:10.890> had

the previous owners that lived here had

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.160 
the previous owners that lived here had
like<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.880> gooped<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.810> hold<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
like really gooped it up to hold all the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.899 
like really gooped it up to hold all the
fittings<00:01:13.320> together<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.520> there's<00:01:14.640> actually

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
fittings together and there's actually

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.039 
fittings together and there's actually
you<00:01:14.970> could<00:01:15.060> see<00:01:15.180> we're<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> Yellowjackets

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

just built up inside this thing and that
was<00:01:48.509> probably<00:01:48.659> part<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> problem<00:01:49.170> why<00:01:49.500> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
was probably part of the problem why it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.100 
was probably part of the problem why it
finally<00:01:50.100> burned<00:01:50.310> out<00:01:50.689> but<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.750> had<00:01:51.869> some<00:01:52.020> other

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
finally burned out but I had some other

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.749 
finally burned out but I had some other
motor<00:01:52.530> problems<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.130> stuff<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.460> then<00:01:53.549> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
motor problems and stuff and then this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
motor problems and stuff and then this
wasn't<00:01:53.970> heat<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> house<00:01:54.420> anymore<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
wasn't heat in the house anymore so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.260 
wasn't heat in the house anymore so
anyway<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:56.399> there's<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> bin<00:01:56.759> here<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.090> some

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
anyway then there's a bin here with some

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
anyway then there's a bin here with some
little<00:01:57.540> bit<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.780> wiring<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.380> we'll<00:01:59.310> move

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
little bit of wiring in it we'll move

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.209 
little bit of wiring in it we'll move
over<00:01:59.549> here<00:02:00.290> here's<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.680> was<00:02:01.829> inside<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
over here here's what was inside the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.670 
over here here's what was inside the
furnace<00:02:02.369> this<00:02:02.640> piece<00:02:02.850> here<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> probably<00:02:03.680> it's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
furnace this piece here is probably it's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.120 
furnace this piece here is probably it's
at<00:02:04.740> least<00:02:04.829> 50<00:02:05.460> 60<00:02:05.759> pounds

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
at least 50 60 pounds

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.620 
at least 50 60 pounds
I<00:02:07.159> was<00:02:07.580> kind<00:02:07.850> of<00:02:07.880> stoked<00:02:08.090> at<00:02:08.240> first<00:02:08.390> thick<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
I was kind of stoked at first thick and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.300 
I was kind of stoked at first thick and
that<00:02:08.720> was<00:02:08.840> all<00:02:08.929> aluminum<00:02:09.350> but<00:02:09.500> it's<00:02:09.590> not<00:02:09.740> just

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
that was all aluminum but it's not just

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.110 
that was all aluminum but it's not just
him<00:02:10.690> here's<00:02:11.690> what's<00:02:11.990> inside<00:02:12.230> oh<00:02:12.260> dehumidifier

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
him here's what's inside oh dehumidifier

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.730 
him here's what's inside oh dehumidifier
and<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.240> motor<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.720> fan<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:16.150> filter<00:02:17.150> they're

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and a motor and a fan and filter they're

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:21.940 
and a motor and a fan and filter they're
too<00:02:18.740> much<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:20.390> then<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:20.959> this<00:02:21.290> is<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> main

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
too much and then on to this is the main

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.979 
too much and then on to this is the main
blower<00:02:22.280> inside<00:02:22.850> the<00:02:22.970> furnace<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.720> thing<00:02:23.900> is

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
blower inside the furnace this thing is

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.050 
blower inside the furnace this thing is
really<00:02:24.170> heavy<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:24.590> like<00:02:24.739> 40<00:02:25.040> pounds<00:02:25.160> that's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
really heavy it's like 40 pounds that's

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.400 
really heavy it's like 40 pounds that's
a<00:02:26.180> big<00:02:26.330> motor<00:02:26.569> I'll<00:02:26.930> be<00:02:27.050> pulling<00:02:27.200> all<00:02:27.380> that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
a big motor I'll be pulling all that

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.650 
a big motor I'll be pulling all that
apart<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:28.610> then<00:02:28.850> there's<00:02:29.180> a<00:02:29.209> lot<00:02:29.330> of<00:02:29.450> small

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
apart and then there's a lot of small

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.580 
apart and then there's a lot of small
stuff<00:02:29.690> inside<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:32.390> automated<00:02:32.959> all<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
stuff inside this automated all the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:34.690 
stuff inside this automated all the
stuffs<00:02:33.860> called<00:02:34.069> just<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.430> lot<00:02:34.550> of<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
stuffs called just a lot of the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.940 
stuffs called just a lot of the
components<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.209> were<00:02:35.360> taken<00:02:35.630> off<00:02:35.950> this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
components that were taken off this

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.650 
components that were taken off this
natural<00:02:37.640> gas<00:02:37.670> pipe<00:02:38.110> had<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.440> big<00:02:39.769> brass<00:02:39.950> fitting

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
natural gas pipe had a big brass fitting

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.449 
natural gas pipe had a big brass fitting
this<00:02:41.660> is<00:02:41.780> cast<00:02:42.080> aluminum<00:02:42.290> we'll<00:02:43.070> be<00:02:43.190> pulling

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
this is cast aluminum we'll be pulling

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.040 
this is cast aluminum we'll be pulling
all<00:02:43.519> that<00:02:43.640> apart<00:02:43.880> there's<00:02:44.600> another<00:02:44.810> motor

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
all that apart there's another motor

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.530 
all that apart there's another motor
there<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:46.820> what's<00:02:47.060> left<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.300> my<00:02:47.390> old

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
there and this what's left of my old

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.750 
there and this what's left of my old
thermostat<00:02:48.220> probably<00:02:49.220> not<00:02:49.310> much<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.640> there

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
thermostat probably not much in there

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.720 
thermostat probably not much in there
but<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> little<00:02:50.090> bit<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.540> copper<00:02:51.530> pipe<00:02:51.800> yeah

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
but a little bit and copper pipe yeah

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.030 
but a little bit and copper pipe yeah
lots<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.090> wiring<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.800> there's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.890> couple

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
lots of wiring and there's a couple

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.120 
lots of wiring and there's a couple
transformers<00:02:55.700> there<00:02:55.910> as<00:02:56.360> well<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.130> basically

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
transformers there as well so basically

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.810 
transformers there as well so basically
this<00:02:58.519> is<00:02:58.580> what's<00:02:58.940> inside<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.269> a<00:02:59.420> furnace<00:03:00.820> I'll

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
this is what's inside of a furnace I'll

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.000 
this is what's inside of a furnace I'll
probably<00:03:02.000> only<00:03:02.239> get<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.840> know<00:03:02.959> 20<00:03:03.590> 30<00:03:03.620> bucks

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
probably only get you know 20 30 bucks

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.930 
probably only get you know 20 30 bucks
out<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> all<00:03:04.459> of<00:03:04.610> this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
out of all of this

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.759 
out of all of this
it<00:03:05.239> doesn't<00:03:05.810> even<00:03:05.959> touch<00:03:06.170> what<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.470> furnace

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
it doesn't even touch what a furnace

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.610 
it doesn't even touch what a furnace
costs<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:08.150> guess<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.840> can<00:03:08.959> let<00:03:09.080> you<00:03:09.140> in<00:03:09.290> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
costs I guess I can let you in the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.319 
costs I guess I can let you in the
furnace<00:03:09.920> itself<00:03:10.069> cost<00:03:10.459> about<00:03:10.670> 600<00:03:11.209> bucks

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
furnace itself cost about 600 bucks

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.660 
furnace itself cost about 600 bucks
which<00:03:12.140> isn't<00:03:12.320> bad<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.769> new<00:03:12.890> furnace<00:03:13.190> but

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
which isn't bad for a new furnace but

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.580 
which isn't bad for a new furnace but
the<00:03:14.060> labor<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.600> won't<00:03:14.870> tell<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.110> what<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.260> costs

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
the labor I won't tell you what it costs

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.590 
the labor I won't tell you what it costs
because<00:03:15.680> it's<00:03:16.070> very<00:03:16.190> expensive<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.150> anyway<00:03:17.390> I

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
because it's very expensive so anyway I

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.289 
because it's very expensive so anyway I
