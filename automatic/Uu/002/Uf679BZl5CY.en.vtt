 in the morning of that pretty good enough 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.430
 reinforced with a lot of variety is that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.230

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 it is not the example we think of 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.239
 calories then be small amounts 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.340
 It's even clear that having something is 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.750
 other one salty thing fruit south coffee 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.480
 This is very important breakfast. 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.850
 and it's a different way to start 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.949
 neodi dia is a great opportunity 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.140

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.549
 We want breakfast at 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.799
 The less I think so 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 even we wake up they spend hours 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 They go out like we want a salt thing. 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.810
 So I prepared as food and 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.920
 importance even in this 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.080
