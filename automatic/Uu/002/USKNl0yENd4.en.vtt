 horizontal incision above the hair

 pubic 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.350
 through it the surgeon has access to 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.860
 abdominal muscles that can be 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.620
 approximate if they are

 leaving a firmer abdominal wall the 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.049
 flaccid tissue covering a muscle 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.250
 abdominal is pulled down and removed

 leaving the abdomen son and beautiful navel 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.040
 is repositioned in its original location 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:01.380
 through a new orifice whose incision 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.090
 is hidden in the scar itself 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.790
 umbilical 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.640
 the size of the scar will be determined 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.829
 by the degree of sagging of the abdomen when 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.590
 the patient shows little excess of 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.410
 skin the size of the incision is smaller 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.450
 very similar to the size of the cesarean section 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.570
 technique known as mini 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.400
 abdominoplasty in cases where there is

 great flaccidity of skin 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.280
 the scar is bigger but it hides 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.590
 in the brand of the swimsuits the use of 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.370
 drain may be necessary for removal 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.590
 of fluids that form below the skin 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.780
 facilitating healing and promoting 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.150
 faster recovery 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.760
 it is withdrawn in the days following 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.670
 surgery according to each case

 thus providing the best contour 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.770
 corporal 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.860
 the scars ripen 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.630
 less visible over time 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.700
 It may take a few months for the 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:09.570
 final result 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.090
 post-surgical recommendations the use of 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.000
 modeling strap is a must in 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.700
 postoperative helping to reshape a 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.580
 new abdomen shape will decrease the 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.610
 accumulation of liquids and also accelerate 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.530
 recovery by compressing the 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.840
 operated region 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.270
 in the first days the patient should 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.950
 keep your posture curved so you do not 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.890
 commit the points 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.650
 sleep should also maintain the 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:40.470
 curved pillow aid 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.480
 underneath the knees and back 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.020
 lymphatic drainage sessions and 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.910
 ultrasound accelerate recovery 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.820
 promoting the absorption of bumps and 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:54.320
 improving internal healing and 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.320
 You have a good surgery.
