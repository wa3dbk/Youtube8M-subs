everybody ham and Fred with you again
just<00:00:05.700> start<00:00:05.879> doing<00:00:06.029> some<00:00:06.450> work<00:00:06.629> with<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.839> beta

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
just start doing some work with the beta

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.209 
just start doing some work with the beta
testers<00:00:07.649> on<00:00:08.000> stoves<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.330> fuel<00:00:09.990> now<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.800> am<00:00:11.099> a

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
testers on stoves and fuel now I am a

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.690 
testers on stoves and fuel now I am a
big<00:00:11.460> fan<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:13.700> compressibility

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
big fan because of the compressibility

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.779 
big fan because of the compressibility
and<00:00:15.170> portability<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.470> little<00:00:16.770> s<00:00:17.430> bit

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
and portability of the little s bit

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.849 
and portability of the little s bit
stoves<00:00:18.720> you've<00:00:19.020> seen<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.380> all<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:19.619> sure

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
stoves you've seen them all I'm sure

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
stoves you've seen them all I'm sure
most<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.640> used<00:00:20.850> him<00:00:21.029> um

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
most of you have used him um

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.240 
most of you have used him um
and<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.600> only<00:00:24.750> thing<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.170> even<00:00:25.710> though<00:00:25.740> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
and the only thing is even though the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.589 
and the only thing is even though the
stoves<00:00:26.550> themselves<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.390> fairly<00:00:27.630> cheap<00:00:27.810> I

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
stoves themselves are fairly cheap I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.990 
stoves themselves are fairly cheap I
which<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.630> why<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.929> have<00:00:31.820> primaries<00:00:32.820> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
which is why I have primaries and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.270 
which is why I have primaries and
backups<00:00:33.480> for<00:00:33.719> all<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.960> them<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.730> the<00:00:35.730> fuel

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
backups for all of them I the fuel

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.100 
backups for all of them I the fuel
usually<00:00:38.280> comes<00:00:38.520> either<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.910> white<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
usually comes either in white or this

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.220 
usually comes either in white or this
color<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.790> basically<00:00:42.120> trioxane<00:00:42.989> and

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
color here it is basically trioxane and

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.630 
color here it is basically trioxane and
one<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.320> these<00:00:46.410> cubes<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.129> give<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.399> about

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
one of these cubes will give you about

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
one of these cubes will give you about
13<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> 15<00:00:48.719> minutes<00:00:49.050> which<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.289> enough<00:00:49.559> time<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
13 to 15 minutes which is enough time to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.189 
13 to 15 minutes which is enough time to
boil<00:00:50.039> water<00:00:50.480> some<00:00:51.480> people<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.840> go<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:52.050> two

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
boil water some people will go with two

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.470 
boil water some people will go with two
tablets<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.890> um<00:00:54.410> again<00:00:56.120> depends<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.360> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
tablets but um again depends on what you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
tablets but um again depends on what you
want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> do<00:00:57.840> but<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.649> get<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> little

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
want to do but these can get a little

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.939 
want to do but these can get a little
expensive<00:00:59.870> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> pack<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:02.600> well<00:01:03.949> at

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
expensive if you want to pack up well at

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.649 
expensive if you want to pack up well at
the<00:01:05.309> old<00:01:05.519> supply<00:01:05.939> store<00:01:08.000> from<00:01:09.000> Brigade

quartermasters trioxane compressed fuel
can<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.450> see<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.400> dollar<00:01:17.400> 49<00:01:18.979> for<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
can you see that a dollar 49 for the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.120 
can you see that a dollar 49 for the
whole<00:01:20.250> box<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:22.640> remember<00:01:23.640> these

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
whole box and in it I remember these

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:32.289 
whole box and in it I remember these
you've<00:01:26.130> got<00:01:26.430> three<00:01:28.729> trioxane<00:01:29.729> bars<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
you've got three trioxane bars now a

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
you've got three trioxane bars now a
third<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.600> bar<00:01:34.009> equals<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> these<00:01:37.040> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
third of this bar equals one of these it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.560 
third of this bar equals one of these it
tells<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.579> break<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.880> up<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.119> three<00:01:39.390> pieces

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
tells you to break it up in three pieces

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.920 
tells you to break it up in three pieces
so<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:41.220> flat<00:01:41.790> compressible<00:01:42.689> piece

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so in this flat compressible piece

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.740 
so in this flat compressible piece
you've<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.579> equivalent<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.450> one<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
you've got the equivalent to one of

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.249 
you've got the equivalent to one of
these<00:01:46.159> much<00:01:47.159> more<00:01:47.460> compressible<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:49.110> we're

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
these much more compressible now we're

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.870 
these much more compressible now we're
going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.530> doing<00:01:49.680> some<00:01:49.950> on-camera<00:01:50.490> testing

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
going to be doing some on-camera testing

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
going to be doing some on-camera testing
here<00:01:51.030> later<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> week<00:01:51.750> between<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.950> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
here later in the week between this and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.350 
here later in the week between this and
these<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.259> they<00:01:55.439> measure<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.369> for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
these to see how they measure up but for

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.410 
these to see how they measure up but for
just<00:01:57.540> basic<00:01:57.719> heating<00:01:58.640> food<00:01:59.640> whatever<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.210> know

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
just basic heating food whatever I know

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.740 
just basic heating food whatever I know
people<00:02:00.899> are<00:02:01.140> getting<00:02:01.259> into<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> gas<00:02:02.189> fueled

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
people are getting into the gas fueled

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
people are getting into the gas fueled
stoves<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.110> stuff<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.710> which<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> good

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
stoves and stuff like that which is good

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:13.130 
stoves and stuff like that which is good
but<00:02:06.979> even<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.550> fire<00:02:09.090> starting<00:02:10.099> this<00:02:11.360> trioxane

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
but even for fire starting this trioxane

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.070 
but even for fire starting this trioxane
trioxane<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.920> should<00:02:14.130> say<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:15.600> pretty<00:02:15.840> cool

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
trioxane I should say it's pretty cool

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.260 
trioxane I should say it's pretty cool
and<00:02:16.350> we're<00:02:16.470> going<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.650> try<00:02:16.920> these

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
and we're going to try these

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.900 
and we're going to try these
military-issue<00:02:18.650> trioxane<00:02:19.650> bars<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.310> see<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
military-issue trioxane bars and see a

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.620 
military-issue trioxane bars and see a
burn<00:02:21.540> test<00:02:21.840> between<00:02:22.140> one<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> these<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.630> one

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
burn test between one of these and one

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.200 
burn test between one of these and one
of<00:02:24.690> these<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.260> see<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.770> one<00:02:26.580> third<00:02:26.910> really

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
of these and see if one third really

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.150 
of these and see if one third really
does<00:02:27.390> equal<00:02:27.720> one<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.770> that's<00:02:28.890> coming

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
does equal one of these so that's coming

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.920 
does equal one of these so that's coming
up<00:02:29.310> later<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.760> week<00:02:29.820> but<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.630> know<00:02:30.750> what

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
up later in the week but you know what

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.180 
up later in the week but you know what
for<00:02:31.380> a<00:02:31.440> dollar<00:02:31.680> forty<00:02:32.070> nine<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:34.620> equivalent

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
for a dollar forty nine the equivalent

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.600 
for a dollar forty nine the equivalent
of<00:02:37.100> nine<00:02:38.100> of<00:02:38.460> these<00:02:40.310> basically<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.430> same

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
of nine of these basically the same
