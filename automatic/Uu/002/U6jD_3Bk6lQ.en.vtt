00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 Hi there, this is the second video from the series 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.480
 how to clean the nozzles 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.670
 today i will tell you how simple 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 garage conditions can be cleaned yourself 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.040
 fuel injector with gasoline 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.040
 engine that we need for this 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.100
 a couple of pieces of clean rags 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.449
 copper insulated wire length 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.449
 about 1 meter knife 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.249
 plastic clamps 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.740
 everything 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.640
 9 volt croma battery 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.110
 length of oxygen hose 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:51.260
 about 45 centimeters 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:53.739
 some electrical tape and cleaning composition 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.090
 will we have an ordinary 4th carburetor 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.309
 for cleaning almost any 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.390
 carburetor cleaner 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.730
 the only thing worth paying attention to 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.250
 when buying it so that the working cap 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.990
 cleaner approximately in diameter 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.090
 fits inside diameter 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.150
 oxygen hose in general so you can 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.530
 had to paste inside 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.710
 nozzle cleaning principle is quite simple 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:20.390
 we need to clean the pollution nozzle 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.869
 both inside and out clean pretty 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.380
 just with the help of 2 moved the same 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.720
 composition 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.790
 that even a carburetor to clean or 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.729
 inside we can start over a 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.770
 energize the injector contacts 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.960
 so that it opens and spill under 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.630
 pressure caustic composition of our case with 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.070
 carburetor cleaner to start 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.810
 remove the nozzle from the fuel manifold 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.810
 and clean and and out 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.930
 here is our nozzle filmed on our dirty 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.760
 in front of czech outside and even inside 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.450
 recommend removing all rubber 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:05.190
 seals so as not to damage them in 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.800
 the cleaning process while we are going 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.869
 make cleaning device 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.069
 can be put in a bag in a small 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.040
 bath 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:18.469
 from a cap of the same carbkliner or 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.469
 other chemistry the same solution 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.129
 for now our nozzle waiver 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:34.049
 making that assiduous to brush or 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:35.239
 From the inside for a start we will provide a connection 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.780
 nozzles 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.300
 Besides 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.040
 for this we take our piece of wire de 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.350
 mode in two parts of approximately 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:51.290
 half a meter on one side of each too 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.290
 knife clean the insulation 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.069
 isolation poems on these loose ends 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.610
 wires we connect the batteries with 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.610
 using electrical tape 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.670
 with back and juice 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.769
 the sides of each wire are slightly expandable 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.280
 awl insulation how we will connect 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.280
 battery drawings 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.110
 connecting nozzles and batteries, we 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.290
 figured out now need to make 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.319
 cylinder adapter 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:43.190
 on the nozzle of this we need 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.920
 oxygen hose clamp and cap with 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.180
 cylinder core player 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.720
 we need to do that through 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.640
 cap 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.450
 scorpion fluids passed to the top 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.200
 entering the hose from the hose already 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.450
 nozzle for this is just a cap 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.450
 piercing an opening through upward 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.830
 now we have brace through 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.830
 hole 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.130
 Next, insert the cap 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.130
 rubber hose 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.400
 native hole from which should have been 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.819
 go to the open air will be drowned out by yourself 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.819
 hose 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.320
 and we press this place with a yoke 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:42.820
 our adapter is ready on this side 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:44.890
 will put on the balance of which with this 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.800
 sides in it exhibit on earlier 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.510
 connected fuel injector at 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.070
 work with such compounds as cleaner 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.330
 the carburetor must not use 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.190
 dual protection 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:01.270
 Others like glasses because once in 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.970
 eyes he is easy only and your eyesight that we 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.810
 do further take pre-cleaned 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.810
 outside nozzle 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.100
 insert its free end of ours 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.300
 adapter 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.300
 and crimped clamp 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.680
 and 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.940
 further Poroshenko twist up to our 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:33.690
 batteries made by us 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:39.720
 told by connecting delivery 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:44.360
 a characteristic click behind means that 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.360
 nozzle turned on ie opened 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.669
 Now we dress our adapter with 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.620
 connected under the nozzle 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.620
 on a carburetor cleaner cylinder 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.879
 and gently apply pressure 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.650
 making sure that the torch is even 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.510
 turn the nozzle 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.790
 adapters and about dota in reverse 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.600
 direction and then move on to 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.600
 the next nozzle 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.800
 in such a simple way you can 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.800
 clean the nozzles on your car
