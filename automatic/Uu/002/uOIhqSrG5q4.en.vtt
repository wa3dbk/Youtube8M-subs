welcome back this tutorial is on
choosing<00:00:38.580> your<00:00:38.910> flute<00:00:39.180> or<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.900> your<00:00:40.080> case

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
choosing your flute or in your case

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760 
choosing your flute or in your case
maybe<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.740> next<00:00:40.920> flute<00:00:41.810> flutes<00:00:42.810> are<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
maybe the next flute flutes are the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.820 
maybe the next flute flutes are the
sound<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.370> affected<00:00:44.970> by<00:00:45.180> not<00:00:46.140> only<00:00:46.290> the<00:00:46.440> size

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
sound is affected by not only the size

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.710 
sound is affected by not only the size
and<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.280> shape<00:00:47.310> but<00:00:47.700> also<00:00:47.880> the<00:00:48.120> type<00:00:48.330> of<00:00:48.360> woods

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
and the shape but also the type of woods

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.590 
and the shape but also the type of woods
that<00:00:48.930> are<00:00:49.080> used<00:00:49.320> now<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.730> obvious<00:00:51.150> difference

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that are used now the obvious difference

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.540 
that are used now the obvious difference
is<00:00:51.810> as<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> difference<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
is as you can see the difference in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.030 
is as you can see the difference in
sizes<00:00:54.140> between<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.590> flute<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:57.710> this<00:00:58.710> flute

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
sizes between this flute and this flute

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.690 
sizes between this flute and this flute
and<00:00:59.930> what<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.020> called<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> pitch<00:01:01.650> is<00:01:01.920> directly

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
and what is called the pitch is directly

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.299 
and what is called the pitch is directly
proportional<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.050> size<00:01:04.380> so<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.190> other

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
proportional to the size so in other

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.950 
proportional to the size so in other
words<00:01:05.520> a<00:01:06.259> smaller<00:01:07.259> the<00:01:07.470> flute<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:09.540> higher<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
words a smaller the flute the higher the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:17.160 
words a smaller the flute the higher the
pitch

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.570 

as<00:01:18.170> opposed<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.620> this<00:01:18.830> one<00:01:19.070> which<00:01:19.250> is<00:01:19.430> much

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
as opposed to this one which is much

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.510 
as opposed to this one which is much
larger<00:01:19.880> it's<00:01:20.570> going<00:01:20.900> to<00:01:21.020> be<00:01:21.140> deeper<00:01:27.520> now

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
larger it's going to be deeper now

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.010 
larger it's going to be deeper now
another<00:01:29.119> difference<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.630> you're<00:01:29.780> going<00:01:29.990> to

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
another difference that you're going to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.160 
another difference that you're going to
hear<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.760> as<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.909> heard<00:01:32.119> this<00:01:32.300> smaller<00:01:32.840> flute

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
hear is as you heard this smaller flute

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.890 
hear is as you heard this smaller flute
it's<00:01:33.410> also<00:01:33.619> much<00:01:34.430> brighter<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.270> in<00:01:35.690> some

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
it's also much brighter and in some

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.620 
it's also much brighter and in some
cases<00:01:36.110> even<00:01:36.259> louder<00:01:36.800> this<00:01:37.490> worded<00:01:37.970> wood<00:01:38.330> is

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
cases even louder this worded wood is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.960 
cases even louder this worded wood is
birch<00:01:39.050> and<00:01:39.410> tends<00:01:40.280> to<00:01:40.369> be<00:01:40.460> very<00:01:40.610> bright

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
birch and tends to be very bright

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:49.510 
birch and tends to be very bright
