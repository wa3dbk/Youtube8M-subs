okay<00:00:01.650> no<00:00:01.860> this<00:00:02.100> guy<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.629> putting<00:00:03.629> this<00:00:03.929> year<00:00:04.290> to

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
okay no this guy is putting this year to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.560 
okay no this guy is putting this year to
the<00:00:05.009> tube<00:00:06.379> so<00:00:07.379> they<00:00:07.500> can<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:08.130> what<00:00:09.120> kind<00:00:09.480> of

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
the tube so they can you what kind of

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:26.720 
the tube so they can you what kind of
soulless<00:00:11.030> device<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.269> making

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.700 

hopefully<00:00:27.660> somebody<00:00:28.080> will<00:00:28.350> make<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:30.710> breeam

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
hopefully somebody will make a breeam

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.369 
hopefully somebody will make a breeam
you<00:00:31.920> picture<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> these<00:00:32.790> boxes<00:00:33.390> because<00:00:33.629> our

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
you picture of these boxes because our

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.510 
you picture of these boxes because our
display<00:00:35.010> cable<00:00:35.520> goes<00:00:36.230> to<00:00:37.230> reenter<00:00:37.949> this<00:00:38.190> box

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
display cable goes to reenter this box

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
display cable goes to reenter this box
so<00:00:39.210> he<00:00:40.489> had<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> good<00:00:42.000> picture<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.780> from<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
so he had a good picture it from the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.250 
so he had a good picture it from the
back<00:00:43.589> side<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:46.070> kerala<00:00:47.070> boxes<00:00:48.260> these

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
back side of this kerala boxes these

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.130 
back side of this kerala boxes these
curvy<00:00:49.650> nuts<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> speak

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.750 

interesting<00:00:58.140> would<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.590> if<00:00:58.770> somebody<00:00:59.340> pulls

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
interesting would be if somebody pulls

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.060 
interesting would be if somebody pulls
all<00:01:00.060> this<00:01:00.300> plaque<00:01:00.630> what<00:01:00.900> that<00:01:01.110> will<00:01:01.290> happen

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.290 

but<00:01:06.050> they<00:01:07.050> don't<00:01:07.290> seem<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.730> make<00:01:08.730> any<00:01:08.790> lower

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
but they don't seem to make any lower

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.760 
but they don't seem to make any lower
changes<00:01:11.090> would<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.480> most<00:01:12.930> important

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
changes would be the most important

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.940 
changes would be the most important
thing<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> test<00:01:18.080> but<00:01:19.080> not<00:01:19.260> with<00:01:19.410> any<00:01:19.560> little

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
thing to test but not with any little

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.530 
thing to test but not with any little
change<00:01:20.310> they<00:01:20.670> cannot<00:01:21.030> say<00:01:21.270> anything<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> all

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
change they cannot say anything so all

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.130 
change they cannot say anything so all
the<00:01:27.780> time<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.680> whole<00:01:29.690> setup<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:30.990> just<00:01:31.350> running

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the time the whole setup is just running

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.290 
the time the whole setup is just running
they<00:01:34.140> don't<00:01:34.320> switch<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.070> off<00:01:35.340> they

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
they don't switch it on and off they

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.359 
they don't switch it on and off they
should<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:37.580> test<00:01:38.580> Howard<00:01:40.100> how<00:01:41.100> will<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
should just test Howard how will the

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.510 
should just test Howard how will the
starting<00:01:41.910> and<00:01:42.090> stopping<00:01:42.360> works<00:01:43.310> that<00:01:44.310> would

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
starting and stopping works that would

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.109 
starting and stopping works that would
be<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> most<00:01:45.090> important<00:01:46.580> seem<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.850> see

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
be the most important seem to see

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:00.260 
be the most important seem to see
because<00:01:48.300> then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.850> make<00:01:52.340> some<00:01:59.090> you<00:02:00.090> can

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
because then you can make some you can

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
because then you can make some you can
make<00:02:00.509> some<00:02:02.479> decision<00:02:03.479> how<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.750> might<00:02:03.960> work<00:02:04.020> all

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
make some decision how it might work all

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.230 
make some decision how it might work all
together<00:02:04.940> no<00:02:06.140> what<00:02:07.140> was<00:02:07.410> faked<00:02:07.830> better<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:09.000> say

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
together no what was faked better to say

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:16.100 
together no what was faked better to say

I really get this antenna here control

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:24.830 
I really get this antenna here control

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
change our necks into the other side the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.820 
change our necks into the other side the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
other wall which sound uh puts the power

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.550

through<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.520> spin<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.510> too<00:02:39.810> probably<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
through the spin here too probably the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.699 
through the spin here too probably the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
upper beam solo a puppy to the tube then

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.690 
upper beam solo a puppy to the tube then
I<00:02:46.890> reckon<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:48.770> generator<00:02:50.840> connect<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:52.050> us

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
I reckon to the generator connect to us

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.870 
I reckon to the generator connect to us
so<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.760> generators<00:02:54.569> probably<00:02:55.020> not<00:02:55.260> not

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
so the generators probably not not

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.780 
so the generators probably not not

them<00:04:05.990> so<00:04:06.990> it<00:04:07.709> was<00:04:07.950> would<00:04:08.790> be<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.300> easiest

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
them so it was would be the easiest

them so it was would be the easiest
solution<00:04:09.900> such<00:04:11.480> frequency<00:04:12.480> inverters<00:04:13.230> are

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
solution such frequency inverters are

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.300 
solution such frequency inverters are
not<00:04:14.480> but<00:04:15.480> too<00:04:15.780> expensive<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:16.560> can<00:04:16.919> already

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
not but too expensive you can already

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.789 
not but too expensive you can already
get<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> good<00:04:18.120> one<00:04:18.419> for<00:04:18.660> five<00:04:18.959> kilowatts<00:04:19.530> of

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
get a good one for five kilowatts of

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.950 
get a good one for five kilowatts of
powers<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.700> range<00:04:21.060> from<00:04:21.480> about<00:04:23.360> 200<00:04:24.360> to

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
powers in the range from about 200 to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.330 
powers in the range from about 200 to
500<00:04:25.380> euros<00:04:26.130> or<00:04:26.310> dollars<00:04:26.450> something<00:04:27.450> like<00:04:27.630> this

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
500 euros or dollars something like this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.130 
500 euros or dollars something like this
so<00:04:29.340> that's<00:04:30.270> no<00:04:30.540> problem<00:04:32.510> but<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.630> probably<00:04:33.900> is

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
so that's no problem but it probably is

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:41.090 
so that's no problem but it probably is
controller<00:04:34.680> uses<00:04:35.190> antenna<00:04:39.470> alright<00:04:40.470> just

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
controller uses antenna alright just

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.540 
controller uses antenna alright just
look<00:04:41.820> at<00:04:41.940> my<00:04:42.090> other<00:04:42.240> videos<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:42.870> down<00:04:43.500> where<00:04:44.490> I

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
look at my other videos and down where I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.040 
look at my other videos and down where I
explained<00:04:45.180> how<00:04:45.419> how<00:04:45.750> will<00:04:45.930> they<00:04:46.050> faked<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
explained how how will they faked it and

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.230 
explained how how will they faked it and
you<00:04:49.229> will<00:04:49.350> see<00:04:50.900> that<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:52.169> could<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.740> be

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
you will see that this could really be

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.360 
you will see that this could really be
the<00:04:54.240> way<00:04:54.479> they<00:04:54.720> have<00:04:54.870> done<00:04:55.140> it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.270 

alright<00:05:00.370> i<00:05:00.790> guess<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:01.030> studio<00:05:01.720> also<00:05:01.990> gets<00:05:02.380> a<00:05:02.500> bit

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
alright i guess a studio also gets a bit

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.240 
alright i guess a studio also gets a bit
boring<00:05:03.460> so
