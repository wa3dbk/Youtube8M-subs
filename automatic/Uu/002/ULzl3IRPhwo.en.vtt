00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 we wish our viewers to live by 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 To means it is important and to think when 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.360
 choose pasta thank you so much this 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.800
 there were economic news 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.860
 Russian students received assignments from 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.240
 whose parents grabbed his head 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.699
 resentment caused questionnaire using 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 which vein officials figure out how 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 the situation with drug use 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.810
 and alcohol is there and very unusual 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 questions that shake their 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.960
 candor nikolay nikolayev about all 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.710
 in order it's terrible at all really 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.989
 I think that this is already the case at school 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 You can not give such things first 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.200
 the reaction of parents of schoolchildren for whom 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.510
 the ministry of health has developed 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 question nick when what and how much and what 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.420
 it was then 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.520
 police fight or for example sex without 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 condom but such questions Ministry of Health 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 yet voluntarily recommends celebrating 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.329
 schoolchildren aged 10 to 18 years 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.930
 I personally do not use it there but if you 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.079
 used 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.539
 but his goal was filled of course no to me 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.629
 it seems this is not right let them at 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:11.880
 for example, they will begin to scoff there 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:22.020
 over them because to use 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:23.880
 Energy has the original 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.130
 the document which the Ministry of Health entitled as 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 rapid test listed here 12 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 most common drugs and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 extensive list of alcoholic beverages 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 and named apparently for convenience 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 perceptions on youth slang you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.050
 you know that there is no such screwdriver 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.010
 screwdriver either i saw 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.890
 jar figure screwdriver what 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.990
 banquet there is such a point how many times 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.300
 you sniffed inga tape substances like 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.250
 glue aerosol gasoline and the like 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.530
 specially to get unusual 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.930
 sensations well, what is not advertising in flight 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.910
 Life Ministry of Health as if warns if 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.610
 parents did not have time to hide the aerosol or 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.960
 glue ministry is not to blame for 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 the beginning of the questionnaire officials call 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.710
 teen to be extremely honest with 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 this promise anonymity is true nowhere 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.149
 indicate compliance guarantees for them 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.550
 impractical even if one of them 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.310
 drank let's say drank champagne nobody 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.880
 this will not be recognized sooner all 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.400
 will do right despite the fact that it is 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.260
 anonymous profiles here we have it a little 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.210
 I have not yet high school students 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.160
 divided someone even thinks that 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.200
 correctly completed questionnaire is not a turnout 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.760
 sincere a true autobiography but 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.930
 example, it will be easier to get 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.060
 work or vice versa people should know 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.190
 how many schools consume alcohol in general 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.840
 and how many chickens but will the school become after 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.090
 answers to non-child questions less 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.540
 drink and smoke while you can only guess 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.380
 on this all this will allow scientists and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.970
 professionals understand the big picture 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.100
 prevalence no personal 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.600
 teacher's perceptions are perceived 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.489
 ministry of health youth issues 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.500
 rather, as instructions for use and not 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.570
 hide that they are afraid to oppose it 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.070
 is an introductory lawsuit and they 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.350
 more likely to cause interest in the child 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.900
 so he went and tried 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.060
 if we will 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.530
 on their own there began to say that we 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.959
 against we can lose the job 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.579
 physical education teacher andrew went sure 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.620
 that and without any questionnaires knows everyone 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.840
 underprivileged children in their school couple 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.849
 circles in the gym and everything is already clear 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.159
 what was there on the eve of moonshine or beer 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.260
 what's the difference but also another question about sex 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.269
 without a condom will remain unanswered 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.170
 Nikolay Nikolaev Dmitriy Mikhailov and nose 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.170
