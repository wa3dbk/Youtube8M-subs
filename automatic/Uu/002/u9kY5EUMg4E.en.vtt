 club to private poker club online for free on pokerstars.it but not 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.950
 comes on only the largest poker site in Italy 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.740
 I have been studying the Bonavena savior phenomenon for about two years, I am trying to understand 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.119
 what is the secret of one of the most successful players if not the most successful e 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.759
 of Italy in this last period 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.109
 and I think I understood something 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.509
 luck counts okay it has often helped him as another casione like here at 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.850
 nova goriza's italian poker tour I didn't help him hi as soon as he came out with a 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.930
 opponent who will be there soon will come 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 I believe his ability to know how to read his opponents counts 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.340
 and above all to know how to listen 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.920
 he eats so much of that guano in certain situations he throws you under the cards 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.330
 when others fail and fail to do so 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.540
 save 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.170
 I got it 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.560
 you told her everything exactly 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.520
 oh but you know very well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.660
 on the other hand it is so long that 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.110
 because you follow me tnt we play now 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.950
 this Italy a little to tower them they love so I stay here where we know each other 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.010
 very well 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.740
 certainly a lot of tower they are very difficult to interpret masselli interpreter in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310
 right way i believe that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.310
 that we can get good results not because I am anymore 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.680
 broth theme maybe my way to conceive tournament 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.660
 roles played said well fold to eat so many cards that I would like to play 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.340
 bresso franke not play them though 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.410
 I believe they are there 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.840
 moana 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.850
 and the nougat part. you have not attempted murder apart from being a receptacle 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.780
 of the world wax manicure I am very good 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.410
 and there are so many girls who are really good at vegetables 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.750
 sombreri si but I can't get there just because for them 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.740
 and difficult to interpret a tournament honcho tar love refound the know-how 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.740
 rely on to resist 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.210
 you train in a certain way to have this innate discipline of yours 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.180
 I do not think 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.180
 you could also train gardauto 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.279
 adopts eliminate some defects but 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.599
 but basically I believe that a disciplinary basis is a very important basis 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.659
 vericert melt gave it the truth 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.139
 then rest can also improve them here and then do it though if you don't have it for the 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.589
 tournament there is a friend of easy service a very good friend 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:30.129

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.749
 but tournament will not reach us maya 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.749
 because he doesn't have the ability to play a tournament 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.379
 it does not have the capacity 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.319
 while playing every day it grows 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.349
 and being a winning player for the maximum 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.819
 you can't play utorrent 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.549

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.869
 however it rewards putting hola millionth flag of yours 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:52.569
 career 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.059
 that maybe a pinch of this your dowry for failure 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.999
 if in what situation inputs into the role of truth I must admit that they have 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.309
 played 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.309
 my pocket and when I'm not playing my pocket parrot 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:10.839

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.719
 it would have been that luck instead 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:30.699
