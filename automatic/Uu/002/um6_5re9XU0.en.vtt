00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.539 

okay<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:03.780> now<00:00:04.410> let's<00:00:04.680> talk<00:00:04.830> about<00:00:04.890> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
okay so now let's talk about the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.410 
okay so now let's talk about the
cellular<00:00:05.940> structure<00:00:06.450> of<00:00:07.259> bone<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:08.160> can<00:00:09.030> think

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
cellular structure of bone you can think

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.770 
cellular structure of bone you can think
of<00:00:09.660> bone<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.320> being<00:00:10.559> mostly<00:00:11.130> made<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.780> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
of bone as being mostly made up of the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.530 
of bone as being mostly made up of the
bone<00:00:13.019> matrix<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:14.070> then<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.759> cells<00:00:15.089> that

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
bone matrix and then the cells that

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.689 
bone matrix and then the cells that
actually<00:00:16.139> help<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.680> form<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.400> bony<00:00:17.730> matrix

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
actually help to form this bony matrix

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.689 
actually help to form this bony matrix
now<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.050> majority<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.080> bone<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:23.010> made<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.580> of

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
now the majority of bone is made up of

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.810 
now the majority of bone is made up of
the<00:00:23.820> bone<00:00:24.000> matrix<00:00:24.240> which<00:00:25.140> consists<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.160> two

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the bone matrix which consists of two

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.540 
the bone matrix which consists of two
principal<00:00:27.660> building<00:00:27.930> blocks<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
principal building blocks the first of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.959 
principal building blocks the first of
which<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.789> called<00:00:30.080> osteoid<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:32.460> forms

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
which is called osteoid and this forms

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.720 
which is called osteoid and this forms
the<00:00:33.180> organic<00:00:33.960> portion<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.010> matrix<00:00:35.460> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
the organic portion of the matrix and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.459 
the organic portion of the matrix and
then<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.989> something<00:00:37.440> called

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
then you have something called

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.790 
then you have something called
hydroxyapatite<00:00:38.750> which<00:00:39.750> forms<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.379> inorganic

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
hydroxyapatite which forms the inorganic

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.150 
hydroxyapatite which forms the inorganic
portion<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> bone<00:00:42.239> matrix<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> first

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
portion of the bone matrix so first

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.639 
portion of the bone matrix so first
let's<00:00:44.370> talk<00:00:44.489> about<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.820> organic<00:00:45.809> portion<00:00:46.110> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
let's talk about the organic portion of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.729 
let's talk about the organic portion of
the<00:00:46.860> bone<00:00:47.070> matrix<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.360> organic<00:00:48.899> portion<00:00:49.170> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the bone matrix the organic portion of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.069 
the bone matrix the organic portion of
the<00:00:50.250> bone<00:00:50.430> matrix<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.239> made<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
the bone matrix is made up of like I

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.549 
the bone matrix is made up of like I
said<00:00:52.410> osteo<00:00:52.920> II<00:00:53.120> which<00:00:54.120> consists<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.230> soft

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
said osteo II which consists of a soft

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
said osteo II which consists of a soft
but<00:00:55.890> highly<00:00:56.399> ordered<00:00:56.730> structure<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.660> proteins

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
but highly ordered structure of proteins

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.200 
but highly ordered structure of proteins
and<00:00:59.210> then<00:01:00.210> collagen<00:01:01.430> specifically<00:01:02.430> type<00:01:02.940> 1

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and then collagen specifically type 1

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.250 
and then collagen specifically type 1
collagen<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> together<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:06.119> orientation<00:01:07.049> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
collagen so together the orientation of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.920 
collagen so together the orientation of
these<00:01:07.560> highly<00:01:08.070> organized<00:01:08.610> collagen<00:01:09.420> fibers

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
these highly organized collagen fibers

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.649 
these highly organized collagen fibers
along<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> proteins<00:01:11.340> helps<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.420> give

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
along with the proteins helps to give

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.039 
along with the proteins helps to give
bone<00:01:13.049> its<00:01:13.530> tensile<00:01:14.369> strength<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.900> does

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
bone its tensile strength so what does

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.469 
bone its tensile strength so what does
tensile<00:01:16.470> strength<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:17.009> mean<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.610> you

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
tensile strength really mean if you

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.899 
tensile strength really mean if you
think<00:01:18.840> about<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.290> really<00:01:19.950> hard<00:01:20.310> piece<00:01:20.880> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
think about a really hard piece of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.170 
think about a really hard piece of
rubber<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.990> rubber<00:01:22.920> eraser<00:01:23.040> for<00:01:23.700> example

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
rubber like a rubber eraser for example

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
rubber like a rubber eraser for example
I<00:01:24.390> kind<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> tensile<00:01:25.830> strength<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
I kind of think of tensile strength as

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.010 
I kind of think of tensile strength as
being<00:01:26.430> similar<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> piece<00:01:27.840> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
being similar to the way that piece of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
being similar to the way that piece of
rubber<00:01:28.229> gives<00:01:29.040> ever<00:01:29.549> so<00:01:29.790> slightly<00:01:30.060> if<00:01:30.329> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
rubber gives ever so slightly if you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.179 
rubber gives ever so slightly if you
were<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.630> push<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> but<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> still<00:01:31.530> holds

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
were to push on it but it still holds

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.460 
were to push on it but it still holds
its<00:01:32.490> shape<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.140> what<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.320> can

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
its shape and so that's what you can

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.060 
its shape and so that's what you can
think<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:35.189> bones<00:01:36.119> tensile<00:01:36.810> strength<00:01:37.259> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
think of as bones tensile strength now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.289 
think of as bones tensile strength now
for<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.939> inorganic<00:01:39.479> portion<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.290> bone<00:01:41.299> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
for the inorganic portion of bone the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.740 
for the inorganic portion of bone the
inorganic<00:01:42.689> portion<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> bone<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.860> made<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
inorganic portion of bone is made up of

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.649 
inorganic portion of bone is made up of
hydroxyapatite<00:01:46.040> and<00:01:47.040> I'll<00:01:47.970> draw<00:01:48.240> its

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hydroxyapatite and I'll draw its

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.810 
hydroxyapatite and I'll draw its
chemical<00:01:49.290> formula<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.600> calcium

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
chemical formula here it is calcium

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.950 
chemical formula here it is calcium
along<00:01:53.820> with<00:01:54.180> phosphate<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.610> water<00:01:56.960> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
along with phosphate and water so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.399 
along with phosphate and water so
basically<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.710> hydroxyapatite<00:01:59.399> is<00:02:00.000> is

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
basically all hydroxyapatite is is

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.760 
basically all hydroxyapatite is is
calcium<00:02:01.409> phosphate<00:02:02.009> crystals<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.770> these

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
calcium phosphate crystals and these

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.730 
calcium phosphate crystals and these
calcium<00:02:05.340> phosphate<00:02:05.939> crystals<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.930> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
calcium phosphate crystals are the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.490 
calcium phosphate crystals are the
mineral<00:02:08.190> portion<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> bone<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.810> gives<00:02:10.080> bone

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
mineral portion of bone that gives bone

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.100 
mineral portion of bone that gives bone
it's<00:02:11.270> rigid<00:02:12.270> strength

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
it's rigid strength

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.600 
it's rigid strength
and<00:02:13.200> density<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.710> now<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> better

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and density so now you have a better

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.500 
and density so now you have a better
understanding<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.590> osteoid<00:02:20.520> or<00:02:21.060> organic

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
understanding of the osteoid or organic

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.830 
understanding of the osteoid or organic
portion<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.890> bone<00:02:23.070> matrix<00:02:23.610> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
portion of the bone matrix and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.760 
portion of the bone matrix and
hydroxyapatite<00:02:24.840> which<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
hydroxyapatite which make up the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.180 
hydroxyapatite which make up the
inorganic<00:02:26.490> portion<00:02:27.240> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.570> bone<00:02:27.750> matrix<00:02:28.190> so

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
inorganic portion of the bone matrix so

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.830 
inorganic portion of the bone matrix so
now<00:02:29.370> let's<00:02:29.580> talk<00:02:29.730> about<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:30.060> cells<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.720> are

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
now let's talk about the cells that are

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960 
now let's talk about the cells that are
actually<00:02:31.260> responsible<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:32.040> making<00:02:32.610> up<00:02:32.760> this

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
actually responsible for making up this

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.960 
actually responsible for making up this
bony<00:02:33.300> matrix<00:02:34.100> there<00:02:35.100> are<00:02:35.340> four<00:02:35.760> different

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
bony matrix there are four different

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.630 
bony matrix there are four different
types<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.480> cells<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.410> be<00:02:37.560> familiar<00:02:37.830> with<00:02:38.160> in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
types of cells to be familiar with in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.880 
types of cells to be familiar with in
bone<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.570> first<00:02:39.810> group<00:02:40.140> are<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
bone and the first group are the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.060 
bone and the first group are the
osteoprogenitor<00:02:41.490> cells<00:02:42.170> next<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.800> what

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
osteoprogenitor cells next we have what

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.210 
osteoprogenitor cells next we have what
are<00:02:44.100> called<00:02:45.020> osteoblasts<00:02:46.020> then<00:02:46.830> there<00:02:47.100> are

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
are called osteoblasts then there are

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.630 
are called osteoblasts then there are
the<00:02:47.430> osteocytes<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.990> finally<00:02:49.980> we<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the osteocytes and finally we have the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.630 
the osteocytes and finally we have the
osteo<00:02:51.330> class<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.860> can<00:02:53.100> see<00:02:53.280> they<00:02:53.459> all

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
osteo class and so you can see they all

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.270 
osteo class and so you can see they all
share<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.270> same<00:02:54.450> root<00:02:54.840> osteo<00:02:55.410> meaning<00:02:56.040> bone

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
share the same root osteo meaning bone

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.850 
share the same root osteo meaning bone
so<00:02:56.940> let's<00:02:57.540> make<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.870> little<00:02:58.260> bit<00:02:58.380> more<00:02:58.620> room

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
so let's make a little bit more room

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.550 
so let's make a little bit more room
here<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.670> talk<00:03:00.300> about<00:03:00.330> each<00:03:00.990> of<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.290> cells

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
here and talk about each of these cells

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.370 
here and talk about each of these cells
one<00:03:01.770> by<00:03:01.920> one<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.490> they<00:03:02.640> do<00:03:02.700> so<00:03:03.690> first<00:03:04.140> up

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
one by one and what they do so first up

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.580 
one by one and what they do so first up
we<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.190> osteoprogenitor<00:03:06.180> cells<00:03:06.590> these

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
we have the osteoprogenitor cells these

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.770 
we have the osteoprogenitor cells these
cells<00:03:08.010> are<00:03:08.250> basically<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.420> precursor

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
cells are basically just the precursor

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.910 
cells are basically just the precursor
to<00:03:11.150> osteoblasts<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:12.720> basically<00:03:13.320> they're<00:03:13.620> just

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
to osteoblasts so basically they're just

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.820 
to osteoblasts so basically they're just
an<00:03:14.130> immature<00:03:14.730> version<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.650> osteoblasts<00:03:16.650> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
an immature version of osteoblasts and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.610 
an immature version of osteoblasts and
they<00:03:17.280> differentiate<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.000> osteoblasts

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
they differentiate into osteoblasts

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.770 
they differentiate into osteoblasts
under<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> influence<00:03:20.459> of<00:03:20.730> various<00:03:20.820> growth

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
under the influence of various growth

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.650 
under the influence of various growth
factors<00:03:23.480> so<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.510> brings<00:03:25.140> us<00:03:25.530> up<00:03:25.800> to

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
factors so that brings us up to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.840 
factors so that brings us up to
osteoblasts<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:28.550> osteoblasts<00:03:29.550> are<00:03:29.640> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
osteoblasts now osteoblasts are the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.050 
osteoblasts now osteoblasts are the
cells<00:03:30.180> that<00:03:30.570> are<00:03:30.630> responsible<00:03:31.019> for

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
cells that are responsible for

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.120 
cells that are responsible for
synthesizing<00:03:33.290> both<00:03:34.290> collagen<00:03:35.160> and<00:03:35.480> proteins

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
synthesizing both collagen and proteins

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.090 
synthesizing both collagen and proteins
specifically<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.489> couple<00:03:38.790> of<00:03:39.000> proteins<00:03:39.570> called

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
specifically a couple of proteins called

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.990 
specifically a couple of proteins called
osteocalcin<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.820> osteo<00:03:42.600> pontén<00:03:43.350> and

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000 

together<00:03:48.000> these<00:03:48.840> make<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:50.060> osteoid

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
together these make up osteoid

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.080 
together these make up osteoid
osteoblasts<00:03:53.010> are<00:03:53.070> also<00:03:53.280> responsible<00:03:53.730> for

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
osteoblasts are also responsible for

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.479 
osteoblasts are also responsible for
producing<00:03:54.959> alkaline<00:03:55.920> phosphatase<00:03:58.190> which<00:03:59.190> is

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
producing alkaline phosphatase which is

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.710 
producing alkaline phosphatase which is
the<00:04:00.000> enzyme<00:04:00.570> that<00:04:00.600> is<00:04:00.840> responsible<00:04:01.800> for

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
the enzyme that is responsible for

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.470 
the enzyme that is responsible for
forming<00:04:03.720> hydroxyapatite<00:04:04.470> or<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:06.150> mineral

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
forming hydroxyapatite or the mineral

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.280 
forming hydroxyapatite or the mineral
portion<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.080> bone<00:04:07.760> once<00:04:08.810> osteoblasts<00:04:09.810> have

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
portion of bone once osteoblasts have

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.740 
portion of bone once osteoblasts have
synthesized<00:04:11.220> enough<00:04:11.610> collagen<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.239> proteins

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
synthesized enough collagen and proteins

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.259 
synthesized enough collagen and proteins
and<00:04:13.170> alkaline<00:04:13.560> phosphatase<00:04:14.160> to<00:04:14.400> form<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
and alkaline phosphatase to form the

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.020 
and alkaline phosphatase to form the
organic<00:04:16.049> and<00:04:16.380> inorganic<00:04:16.739> portion<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.790> the

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
organic and inorganic portion of the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.300 
organic and inorganic portion of the
bony<00:04:18.239> matrix<00:04:18.690> around<00:04:19.019> them<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.830> they're

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
bony matrix around them and they're

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.870 
bony matrix around them and they're
finally<00:04:20.519> surrounded<00:04:21.180> by<00:04:21.330> all<00:04:21.510> of<00:04:21.539> this<00:04:21.840> they

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
finally surrounded by all of this they

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.370 
finally surrounded by all of this they
mature<00:04:23.880> into<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.990> osteocytes

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
mature into the osteocytes

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.830 
mature into the osteocytes
so<00:04:26.500> the<00:04:26.770> mature<00:04:26.950> version<00:04:27.820> of<00:04:28.090> an<00:04:28.240> osteoblast

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
so the mature version of an osteoblast

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.920 
so the mature version of an osteoblast
once<00:04:29.170> it's<00:04:29.350> all<00:04:29.560> done<00:04:30.210> synthesizing<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.690> bony

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
once it's all done synthesizing the bony

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.240 
once it's all done synthesizing the bony
matrix<00:04:32.500> becomes<00:04:32.890> an<00:04:33.100> osteocyte<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.740> that

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
matrix becomes an osteocyte so that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.520 
matrix becomes an osteocyte so that
brings<00:04:36.520> us<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:37.260> osteocytes<00:04:39.660> now<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.720> spaces

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
brings us to osteocytes now the spaces

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.660 
brings us to osteocytes now the spaces
that<00:04:41.950> osteocytes<00:04:42.910> occupy<00:04:43.810> are<00:04:44.200> called<00:04:44.670> within

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
that osteocytes occupy are called within

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.040 
that osteocytes occupy are called within
bone<00:04:45.940> are<00:04:46.330> called<00:04:46.720> lacunae<00:04:47.440> and<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:49.870> term

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
bone are called lacunae and the term

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.140 
bone are called lacunae and the term
lacunae<00:04:50.470> really<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:50.950> refers<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.310> an<00:04:51.820> empty

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
lacunae really just refers to an empty

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.020 
lacunae really just refers to an empty
space<00:04:52.360> within<00:04:52.630> bone<00:04:52.960> so<00:04:53.260> under<00:04:53.620> a<00:04:53.680> microscope

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
space within bone so under a microscope

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.180 
space within bone so under a microscope
these<00:04:55.030> spaces<00:04:55.390> love<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.230> me<00:04:56.440> like<00:04:56.860> little

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
these spaces love to me like little

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.820 
these spaces love to me like little
leaks<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.510> that's<00:04:58.810> how<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.080> remember<00:04:59.620> what

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
leaks and so that's how I remember what

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.680 
leaks and so that's how I remember what
lacunae<00:05:00.340> are<00:05:00.490> they<00:05:00.700> are<00:05:00.760> little<00:05:01.150> lakes<00:05:01.390> or

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
lacunae are they are little lakes or

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.810 
lacunae are they are little lakes or
absences<00:05:02.410> empty<00:05:03.280> spaces<00:05:03.580> within<00:05:04.030> bone<00:05:04.420> and

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
absences empty spaces within bone and

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.390 
absences empty spaces within bone and
these<00:05:06.820> osteocytes<00:05:07.360> have<00:05:08.140> little<00:05:08.920> arms<00:05:09.160> or

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
these osteocytes have little arms or

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.040 
these osteocytes have little arms or
branches<00:05:09.820> that<00:05:09.970> reach<00:05:10.030> out<00:05:10.480> to<00:05:10.690> communicate

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
branches that reach out to communicate

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.920 
branches that reach out to communicate
with<00:05:11.530> other<00:05:11.860> osteocytes<00:05:12.400> or<00:05:13.030> osteoblasts

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
with other osteocytes or osteoblasts

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.200 
with other osteocytes or osteoblasts
which<00:05:14.380> kind<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.770> gives<00:05:14.950> them<00:05:15.130> the<00:05:15.460> starlike

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
which kind of gives them the starlike

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.790 
which kind of gives them the starlike
appearance<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.400> these<00:05:18.400> little<00:05:18.640> branches<00:05:19.390> are

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
appearance and these little branches are

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.870 
appearance and these little branches are
like<00:05:20.800> sensors<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.430> pick<00:05:21.610> up<00:05:21.640> new

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
like sensors that pick up new

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.700 
like sensors that pick up new
information<00:05:22.000> send<00:05:22.630> out<00:05:22.720> signals<00:05:22.900> basically

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
information send out signals basically

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.640 
information send out signals basically
allowing<00:05:24.340> osteocytes<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.660> communicate<00:05:26.380> with

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
allowing osteocytes to communicate with

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.440 
allowing osteocytes to communicate with
other<00:05:26.890> cells<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.460> help<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.790> maintain<00:05:27.970> bone

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
other cells that help to maintain bone

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.330 
other cells that help to maintain bone
and<00:05:29.220> then<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.340> final<00:05:30.730> cell<00:05:30.940> type<00:05:31.270> is<00:05:31.600> the

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
and then the final cell type is the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.090 
and then the final cell type is the
osteoclast<00:05:33.870> now<00:05:34.870> osteoclasts<00:05:35.680> are<00:05:35.740> derived

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
osteoclast now osteoclasts are derived

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.900 
osteoclast now osteoclasts are derived
from<00:05:36.220> a<00:05:36.460> cell<00:05:36.640> line<00:05:36.880> called<00:05:37.240> monocytes<00:05:38.230> and

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
from a cell line called monocytes and

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.990 
from a cell line called monocytes and
they<00:05:39.910> are<00:05:40.180> responsible<00:05:40.660> for<00:05:41.110> bone<00:05:42.100> resorption

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.600 

so<00:05:46.000> basically<00:05:46.630> they<00:05:47.230> break<00:05:47.680> bone<00:05:48.040> back<00:05:48.400> down

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
so basically they break bone back down

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.580 
so basically they break bone back down
again<00:05:48.910> and<00:05:49.180> they<00:05:49.390> do<00:05:49.450> this<00:05:49.870> with<00:05:50.200> an<00:05:50.410> enzyme

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
again and they do this with an enzyme

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.160 
again and they do this with an enzyme
called<00:05:51.210> tartrate<00:05:52.210> resistant<00:05:52.750> acid

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
called tartrate resistant acid

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:00.330 
called tartrate resistant acid
phosphatase<00:05:57.240> so<00:05:58.560> osteoblasts<00:05:59.560> help<00:05:59.800> build<00:06:00.100> up

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
phosphatase so osteoblasts help build up

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.970 
phosphatase so osteoblasts help build up
bone<00:06:00.580> with<00:06:00.850> an<00:06:01.120> enzyme<00:06:01.450> alkaline<00:06:02.350> phosphatase

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
bone with an enzyme alkaline phosphatase

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.370 
bone with an enzyme alkaline phosphatase
and<00:06:03.130> then<00:06:03.570> osteoclasts<00:06:04.570> helps<00:06:05.020> you<00:06:05.140> break

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
and then osteoclasts helps you break

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.380 
and then osteoclasts helps you break
that<00:06:05.590> bone<00:06:05.830> back<00:06:05.860> down<00:06:06.340> again<00:06:06.670> with<00:06:07.060> an<00:06:07.240> enzyme

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
that bone back down again with an enzyme

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:11.310 
that bone back down again with an enzyme
heart<00:06:08.230> rate<00:06:08.470> resistant<00:06:08.950> acid<00:06:09.400> phosphatase<00:06:10.320> so

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
heart rate resistant acid phosphatase so

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.460 
heart rate resistant acid phosphatase so
bone<00:06:11.620> is<00:06:11.980> basically<00:06:12.460> constantly<00:06:13.180> being

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
bone is basically constantly being

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:16.590 
bone is basically constantly being
remodeled<00:06:14.470> built<00:06:15.100> up<00:06:15.280> by<00:06:15.460> osteoblasts<00:06:15.850> and

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
remodeled built up by osteoblasts and

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.850 
remodeled built up by osteoblasts and
broken<00:06:17.170> down<00:06:17.320> again<00:06:17.680> by<00:06:18.120> osteoclasts<00:06:19.120> and<00:06:19.860> an

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
broken down again by osteoclasts and an

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.430 
broken down again by osteoclasts and an
easy<00:06:21.160> way<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:21.520> keep<00:06:21.790> this<00:06:22.030> treat<00:06:22.390> is<00:06:22.660> to<00:06:22.960> think

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
easy way to keep this treat is to think

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.510 
easy way to keep this treat is to think
that<00:06:24.810> osteoblasts<00:06:25.810> the<00:06:26.050> B<00:06:26.290> and<00:06:26.590> blass<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:27.280> for

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
that osteoblasts the B and blass is for

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.230 
that osteoblasts the B and blass is for
building<00:06:27.790> bone<00:06:28.450> and<00:06:28.750> then<00:06:29.310> osteoclast<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.940> C

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
building bone and then osteoclast the C

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.560 
building bone and then osteoclast the C
in<00:06:31.660> clat<00:06:32.230> osteo<00:06:32.800> class<00:06:32.860> is<00:06:33.340> for<00:06:33.640> crashing<00:06:34.240> bone

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
in clat osteo class is for crashing bone

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.290 
in clat osteo class is for crashing bone
down<00:06:34.810> so<00:06:35.440> osteoblasts<00:06:36.190> build<00:06:36.370> up<00:06:36.520> bone<00:06:36.760> osteo

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
down so osteoblasts build up bone osteo

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.920 
down so osteoblasts build up bone osteo
class<00:06:37.360> break<00:06:38.229> it<00:06:38.410> back<00:06:38.560> down

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:38.930 
class break it back down

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.370 
class break it back down
again<00:06:39.380> now<00:06:40.280> as<00:06:40.600> osteoclasts<00:06:41.600> are<00:06:41.750> resolving

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
again now as osteoclasts are resolving

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.560 
again now as osteoclasts are resolving
bone<00:06:42.650> they<00:06:43.070> start<00:06:43.490> to<00:06:43.639> form<00:06:43.880> little<00:06:44.180> empty

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570
