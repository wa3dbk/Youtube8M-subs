00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.320
 1 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.920
 many people depend on a 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.719
 stem cell transplant to survive 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.250
 unfortunately three times out of four we 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.670
 can not find a compatible donor in 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.670
 the family 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 the cell donor registry 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.419
 strains then becomes the only hope in 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.800
 registering you increase the 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.630
 chances that a patient finds a donor 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.840
 compatible 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.399
 your generosity could save a life 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.720
 but who can register in the register and 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.239
 how does your cell donors become 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.250
 strains 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.730
 first of all you must have between 18 and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 35 years old be healthy and be 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.250
 willing to give stem cells to 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.250
 whoever needs it 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.269
 How to register 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 if you qualify the first step 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.190
 is to read the guide for the donor 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.339
 downloadable potential on our site 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 web 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.510
 once knowledgeable complete the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.510
 online registration form 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.130
 you will then receive a package of 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.350
 oral sampling by mail 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.080
 follow the instructions 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.280
 perform the smear and return 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.780
 we the kit containing your 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.080
 samples in the envelope answers 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.180
 provided your samples will be 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.300
 analyzed in the laboratory to determine 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.220
 your genetic profile and data 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.510
 will be kept in our register in 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.790
 all confidentiality 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.890
 they will only serve to establish a 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.979
 compatibility between waiting patients 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.479
 of transplant and you after returning 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.390
 your package your registration 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.399
 completed record it could be that 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.780
 you are never contacted as it is 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.899
 could that one of contacts in six 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.539
 months or even in 20 years but a day 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.070
 until you are 60 years old 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.110
 could find compatible with a 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:19.120
 patient and so have the chance to 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.410
 save someone's life when our 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.510
 register receives a call 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.670
 the latter can come from anywhere 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.010
 in the world we are informed that a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 patient from here or elsewhere needs 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.459
 a stem cell transplant 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.320
 we search in the registers 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.780
 ours and if you are potentially 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.130
 compatible we call you and 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.010
 check that you are always ready to 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.410
 donate if yes we ask you 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.000
 blood samples 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.430
 these samples serve among others to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.950
 confirm your compatibility h is there 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380
 with that of the patient if your 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.510
 compatibility is confirmed we will 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.709
 let's transmit the excellent news and if 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.900
 all the best conditions are 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.130
 gathered we will invite you to proceed 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.630
 donations 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.660
 give stem cells give the 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.660
 life
