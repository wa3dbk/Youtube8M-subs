that<00:02:14.160> long<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.180> would<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.480> that<00:02:15.570> Sony

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
that long and I would think that Sony

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.500 
that long and I would think that Sony
would<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.320> plenty<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:16.860> other<00:02:17.070> areas<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:18.150> sell

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
