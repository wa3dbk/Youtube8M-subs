hey<00:00:06.000> I'm<00:00:06.390> Ben<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.649> Prius<00:00:08.040> V<00:00:08.220> mobile

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
hey I'm Ben this is my Prius V mobile

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759 
hey I'm Ben this is my Prius V mobile
lab<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.269> I'm<00:00:09.360> using<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.840> learn<00:00:10.080> everything

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
lab and I'm using it to learn everything

I<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.099> about<00:00:11.340> mass<00:00:12.000> now<00:00:12.599> I've<00:00:12.690> already<00:00:13.019> looked

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170

I can about mass now I've already looked
at<00:00:13.320> solids<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.070> have<00:00:14.370> looked<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.700> liquids<00:00:15.120> so

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
at solids and have looked at liquids so

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.029 
at solids and have looked at liquids so
it's<00:00:15.630> time<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:15.839> something<00:00:16.320> even<00:00:16.560> more

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
it's time for something even more

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the Prius V but how much exactly here's

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.810 
the Prius V but how much exactly here's
where<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.140> lungs<00:00:58.410> come<00:00:58.739> in<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.370> average

where my lungs come in the average
person<00:01:00.239> exhale<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> about<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:01.199> gallons<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
person exhale is about two gallons of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.950 
person exhale is about two gallons of
carbon<00:01:02.219> dioxide<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.420> course<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.840> an

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
hour this means that the fill-up one

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.539 
hour this means that the fill-up one
cubic<00:01:06.540> foot<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.140> take<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:07.680> person<00:01:08.159> for

cubic foot it would take one person for

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.780 
cubic foot it would take one person for
hours<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.600> fill<00:01:09.810> up<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.189> 67<00:01:11.189> point<00:01:11.460> three

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
hours to fill up all 67 point three

hours to fill up all 67 point three
cubic<00:01:12.299> feet<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> Prius<00:01:13.170> V<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.710> would<00:01:14.040> take

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
cubic feet of the Prius V it would take

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:21.730 
cubic feet of the Prius V it would take
one<00:01:14.520> person<00:01:15.090> days

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.190 

let's<00:01:22.740> try<00:01:23.070> air<00:01:23.430> how<00:01:24.119> much<00:01:24.180> compressed<00:01:24.869> air

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
let's try air how much compressed air

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
let's try air how much compressed air

Great Barrier Reef

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.660 
Great Barrier Reef
I<00:01:50.049> figured<00:01:51.049> out<00:01:51.170> how<00:01:51.500> much<00:01:51.530> gas<00:01:52.040> I<00:01:52.280> can<00:01:52.430> fit

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
I figured out how much gas I can fit

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.029

into<00:01:52.939> my<00:01:53.210> car<00:01:53.479> as<00:01:53.689> we've<00:01:54.140> already<00:01:54.380> discovered

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
into my car as we've already discovered

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.889 
into my car as we've already discovered
we<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:55.549> get<00:01:55.700> quite<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.030> few<00:01:56.119> liquids<00:01:56.750> and

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
we can get quite a few liquids and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.319 
we can get quite a few liquids and
solids<00:01:57.380> into<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.039> prius<00:01:58.369> v<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:58.789> there's<00:01:59.180> only

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
solids into the prius v and there's only

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.590
