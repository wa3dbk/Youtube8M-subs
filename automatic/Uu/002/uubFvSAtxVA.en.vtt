00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
of the risk seals stuck in position

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.980 
of the risk seals stuck in position
I<00:00:09.440> used<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.650> hot<00:00:10.830> glue<00:00:11.130> gun<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.460> get<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.360> old

I used the hot glue gun to get the old
one<00:00:13.320> off<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.799> little<00:00:14.610> bit<00:00:14.910> tricky<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.039> that's

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
one off a little bit tricky but that's

off without too much hassle the worst

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.880 
off without too much hassle the worst
part<00:00:24.449> was<00:00:24.689> getting<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:26.119> the<00:00:27.119> trim<00:00:27.420> off<00:00:27.890> the

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
part was getting the the trim off the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
part was getting the the trim off the
rubber<00:00:29.070> strip<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.670> goes<00:00:29.730> around<00:00:30.170> I've<00:00:31.170> got<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.970 
can of paint stuffed up I've technically
dumb<00:00:35.070> vole<00:00:35.719> off<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.200> I've<00:00:37.380> got<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> kind<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
dumb vole off and I've got a kind of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 
dumb vole off and I've got a kind of
paint<00:00:38.280> stuck<00:00:38.730> up<00:00:38.879> inside<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.660> just<00:00:39.870> hoping

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
paint stuck up inside it I'm just hoping

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.920 
paint stuck up inside it I'm just hoping
I<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:40.739> out<00:00:41.070> sometime<00:00:41.930> and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I can get that out sometime and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.299 
I can get that out sometime and
basically<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:44.370> once<00:00:45.180> you've<00:00:45.360> stripped<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
basically you once you've stripped the

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.610 
basically you once you've stripped the
OL<00:00:47.309> seal<00:00:47.789> away<00:00:48.030> then<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> new<00:00:49.320> seal

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
OL seal away then you put the new seal

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.200 
OL seal away then you put the new seal
in<00:00:49.829> place<00:00:50.780> that's<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.610> fold<00:00:53.879> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
in place that's it and then you fold it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
in place that's it and then you fold it
back<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.989> actually<00:00:55.500> touching<00:00:56.010> where<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
back it's actually touching where the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.470 
back it's actually touching where the
old<00:00:57.120> seal<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.949> arm<00:00:59.239> and<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> arm

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
old seal was on the arm and the arm

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
old seal was on the arm and the arm
protrudes<00:01:01.079> about<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.649> much

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
protrudes about that much

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.149 
protrudes about that much
so<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.000> adem<00:01:03.270> fold<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.899> seal<00:01:04.110> back<00:01:04.470> on<00:01:04.710> itself

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
so the adem fold the seal back on itself

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.399 
so the adem fold the seal back on itself
that's<00:01:05.580> why<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> tapes<00:01:06.150> there<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.990> stop<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
that's why the tapes there to stop the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.740 
that's why the tapes there to stop the
glue<00:01:07.590> spreading<00:01:08.189> fold<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.150> seal<00:01:09.330> back<00:01:09.570> on

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
glue spreading fold the seal back on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.890 
glue spreading fold the seal back on
itself<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> paste<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> well

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
itself and paste the in a bit that well

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.660 
itself and paste the in a bit that well
paste<00:01:13.170> both<00:01:13.439> surfaces<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> are<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.580> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
paste both surfaces that are going to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.770 
paste both surfaces that are going to
meet<00:01:16.460> right<00:01:17.460> I'm<00:01:17.759> talking<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> cameras

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
meet right I'm talking on the cameras

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.800 
meet right I'm talking on the cameras
wondering<00:01:19.259> I'll<00:01:20.130> let<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> dry<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:20.909> 10-15

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
wondering I'll let it dry for 10-15

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.620 
wondering I'll let it dry for 10-15
minutes<00:01:22.259> put<00:01:22.590> another<00:01:22.740> coat<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.340> let<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.330> dry

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
minutes put another coat on let it dry

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
minutes put another coat on let it dry
for<00:01:24.689> another<00:01:24.990> 10<00:01:25.259> minutes<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.280> gently

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
for another 10 minutes and then gently

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.210 
for another 10 minutes and then gently
fold<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.659> seam<00:01:27.900> down<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> sticks

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
fold the seam down because it sticks

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.340 
fold the seam down because it sticks
straight<00:01:29.460> away<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:30.840> once<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
straight away and then once it's in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.039 
straight away and then once it's in
place<00:01:31.500> give<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> good<00:01:32.189> roll<00:01:32.460> with<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
place give it a good roll with the

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
place give it a good roll with the
roller<00:01:35.420> all<00:01:36.420> right<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.860> carefully<00:01:38.700> take

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
roller all right and then carefully take

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.600 
roller all right and then carefully take
that<00:01:39.329> light<00:01:39.570> off<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.320> rip<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:41.400> bit

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
that light off because it can rip a bit

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.550 
that light off because it can rip a bit
rough<00:01:41.820> with<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.810> I've<00:01:42.960> got<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.350> now

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
rough with it but all I've got to do now

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
rough with it but all I've got to do now
is<00:01:43.590> put<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.270> seam<00:01:46.259> CR<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.670> piece<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
is put the seam CR on there the piece of

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.020 
is put the seam CR on there the piece of
tape<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.390> covers<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.530> joint<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.850> still

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
tape that covers the joint and I still

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.510 
tape that covers the joint and I still
do<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.299> same<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.780> inside<00:01:51.869> as<00:01:52.350> well<00:01:52.560> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
do the same on the inside as well and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.940 
do the same on the inside as well and
then<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.360> other<00:01:54.540> arm<00:01:54.689> todo<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.290> jobs<00:01:55.799> are

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
then the other arm todo and jobs are

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.750 
then the other arm todo and jobs are
Gordon<00:01:56.219> let's<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:56.939> hope<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.509> leak
