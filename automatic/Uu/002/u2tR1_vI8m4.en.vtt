00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.849
 pendrive of 4 gigs up one 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.809
 8 megabytes memory 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.900

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.910
 obviously a good ps2 below this 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.570
 video I leave a link where they go to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.570
 download this file 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:29.410
 they are going to decompress us and they will leave 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.430
 two folders one is the advance cache 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.490
 what the usb stream brings 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.670
 we're going to do that before that folder 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.800
 they are going to leave there and the other one that says is 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.170
 more and good web that will happen like this 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.380
 how are you going to pass it to a pendrive 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.980
 to the pendrive that they will use and the other 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.860
 folder that the havana 's are going to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.950
 leave on the computer desk 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.620

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:12.460
 seated in a file the launch ene efe 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.729
 that to be able to launch install this the 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.590
 cold that boat there is as shown by the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:22.469
 images is there they give him x 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.420
 and it's going to look like a configuration that 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.310
 is the configuration of the weight of the 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.909
 play good now they're going to tighten the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.250
 circle is going to take you to another one another 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.420
 screen there will appear in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.369
 files the msc but good for the where 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 says more than is the pendrive the usb and 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.619
 they tighten circle then there's going to show 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.000
 what they have in the pendrive that I in 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.880

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.979
 already anguished game that is the scarface 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 this already useful with the usb string 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.079
 good go to the web magic folder 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.950

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:09.899
 options says install more and point lf 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.730

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.170
 they are going to put in the point of the circle and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.090
 takes them to the cold program is good 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.110
 there they have several options above where 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.090
 first they go to land way they're going to go 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 to ms format 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.290
 well there they are going to format the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.200
 the memory will give him x after the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.450
 formative in ok and they will install version 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.940
 as a screen shows and they will give you 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.040
 x after formatting that and 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.910
 the installation begins 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.760
 well there we see already 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.420
 we already have installed in the configuration 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.050
 of things and have that ere the che 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.990

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.630
 we have the media player that is the sms the 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.470
 usb advance in the credit of your mountain 2 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.280
 ps2 the game boy is also pretty 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.100
 complete we go very complete good 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.440
 esteban the look and looks forward will 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.530
 see x 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.880
 they press x there and that's where the 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.880
 usb program advances 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.700
 this later when they already have 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.890
 flipped lean x have not motivated the 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.890
 game appears there appears the scarface 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.450
 always using the ps2 place too but 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.030
 in this configuration they have to put 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.860
 in the compilation of the play that 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.800
 started big and being matrix tighten a 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.390
 triangle and redon and circle the time and 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.020
 they put that configuration but it's not going to 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:50.910
 walk on that in the advance good usb 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.150
 we go to the folder of the abans open it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.450
 on the computer they will double click 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.850
 where it says usb stream and there it goes 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.390
 appear the good folder indicates the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.390
 the screen 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.510
 perfectly for the record they look for a 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.550
 game puts it on the disk afterwards and the 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.090
 dvd or cd after where they want it 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 save that -according to the good disc is 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.470
 where it says to leave me a good one there is 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.970
 put the name of the game give it to be and 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.190
 some questions 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.580
 this statement if you give yes and there 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.490
 start loading the game 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.460
 and good because they finished the 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.520
 folder where I keep them 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.889
 and there it appears 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.770
 the game let's tell you good those 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.449
 files so it looks good that they're going to 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.539
 copy on the pendrive so raw as 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.210
 this is how it is and what is good and after 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:50.020
 play with the usb string there we see the 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.030
 game that we see that looks perfect 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.420
 and good if you do not put that retirement in 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:59.390
 USB USB bandar abandon anything 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:02.180
 ok I hope this is my first post and 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.920
 Well I improve it a little bit because the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.920
 machine that I have is not that fast
