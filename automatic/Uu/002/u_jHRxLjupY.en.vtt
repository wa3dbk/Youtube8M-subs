 beauty 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:30.800
 good I did not even driver's something simple and 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.960
 fast, what is this tutorial? 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.660
 I had the idea of doing what I had 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.210
 problem yesterday with the pc it note that 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 encompass task manager not 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:53.239
 was active the four cores that my 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:01:00.469
 and 51 3473 want to see that showing the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:05.899
 my pc's settings and this one is 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:11.960
 saying that he gives using four is two 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:20.710
 strange nuclei that is paying more here 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:27.340
 of now the four lucrative but yesterday 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:31.790
 I saw that it had two cores activated and 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:36.530
 Then I got that thigh not causing 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.470
 everyone on the slap forcing hertha has a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.500
 team should do tutorial and researched 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.820
 I searched around the internet and 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.729
 sx wilson am going over to you 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.689
 Thanks to the person I've been doing here. 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:02:00.140
 helped in the preparation for you, which is the 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:05.390
 following yesterday that a keyboard and keyboard 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:07.280
 virtual is broken it does not matter only 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.200
 for demonstration purposes 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:16.570
 the keyboard will tighten the 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:20.750
 windows flag mas or 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:26.000
 boy this dialog box to this load 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.909
 of games does not believe it here msc 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.560
 config 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:38.269
 You take care of it , you click and then you go. 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.549
 avab other box already the largest this hotel 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.489
 on here 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.000
 that is a is a configuration of 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.400
 system has many useful functions here if 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.190
 You play and then you'll see 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.220
 It has a very rocks and the text is seen in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:02.810
 here from the top 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:04.450
 bad options advanced here that is 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.799
 the x of the question 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.650
 yesterday I noticed that the computer 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.560
 I was with two cores that way note 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.340
 here on this screen and that is why 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.450
 using both cores being has four 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.450
 with you can observe 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:32.690
 so I was like this 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:37.030
 do what is 14 core 2 core 8 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.730
 core has always been half in the nucleus 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:45.739
 will never be using speed 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.290
 maximum of what he can offer it 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.750
 greatly damages the computer that was 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.790
 forced to over and it can happen let's 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.549
 try and it's early in the morning and the iuni 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.510
 start computer start 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:05.510
 resumption of snow is much slower 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.400
 if you let it start in the default 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.069
 so I think it had really are 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:19.970
 Miguel and Mark and puts it in the case 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:28.280
 if I have the brace with 224 depending 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:33.550
 of mine here in 2011 and 5 of 4 70 I showed 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:37.340
 back then you guys go from okay just 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.949
 apply and ok 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.800
 to start only that in my case I will not 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.979
 do this procedure already done 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.840
 There you will restart the machine there. 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.639
 then he gets the machine 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.440
 I came here in itÃ¡ manager and 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.380
 let's see that its four cores are 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.490
 active 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.830
 good guys this tip and I had problem 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.810
 Yesterday friends back to have a 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:12.320
 considerable daisy and note that you are 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.560
 slow start that sometimes started 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:20.180
 thinking it is a visual and it is 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.360
 only this can help other people who 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:28.060
 They had the same problem here. 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:31.550
 so if that decay helped someone 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:39.699
 so help does not go as well 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.699
 favorite food 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.440
 the jewel in the oven 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.310
 the channel subscribes there will help a lot 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.310
 Hey you
