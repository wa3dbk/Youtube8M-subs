00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
also applying it to the cross door maybe

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.860 
also applying it to the cross door maybe
we<00:02:03.640> can<00:02:03.730> see<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.880> little<00:02:04.000> bit<00:02:04.180> of<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.390> rear<00:02:04.570> end

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
we can see a little bit of the rear end

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.750 
we can see a little bit of the rear end
and<00:02:05.110> some<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.830> features<00:02:06.070> from<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> reader

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
and some of the features from the reader

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.880 
and some of the features from the reader
of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:06.970> hour<00:02:07.120> so<00:02:07.780> also<00:02:08.110> on<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.470> rear<00:02:08.680> you'll

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
of the hour so also on the rear you'll

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.469 
of the hour so also on the rear you'll
note<00:02:09.070> that<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.490> we<00:02:09.940> gave<00:02:10.149> it<00:02:10.240> a<00:02:10.300> really

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
note that we we gave it a really

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.330 
note that we we gave it a really
aggressive<00:02:10.810> stance<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.620> make<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.920> more

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
aggressive stance to make it more

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.690 
aggressive stance to make it more
clearly<00:02:12.730> a<00:02:13.350> CUV<00:02:14.350> we've<00:02:15.220> done<00:02:15.400> things<00:02:15.550> to

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
clearly a CUV we've done things to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.340 
clearly a CUV we've done things to
enhance<00:02:16.090> visibility<00:02:16.300> like<00:02:16.960> making<00:02:17.260> a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
enhance visibility like making a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.680 
enhance visibility like making a
standard<00:02:17.860> rear<00:02:18.160> view<00:02:18.340> camera<00:02:18.700> now<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.120> every

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
standard rear view camera now on every

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.120 
standard rear view camera now on every
single<00:02:19.870> car<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:21.220> also<00:02:21.400> have<00:02:22.410> cd<00:02:23.410> under<00:02:23.710> under

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
single car we also have cd under under

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.580 
single car we also have cd under under
treatment<00:02:24.400> there<00:02:24.730> around<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.510> exhaust<00:02:25.600> just

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
treatment there around the exhaust just

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.520 
treatment there around the exhaust just
sort<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.980> makes<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:27.670> more<00:02:27.820> clearly<00:02:28.260> rugged<00:02:29.260> to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
sort of makes it more clearly rugged to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.650 
sort of makes it more clearly rugged to
people<00:02:29.830> when<00:02:30.010> they<00:02:30.100> look<00:02:30.250> at<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.580> of<00:02:31.450> course

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
people when they look at it of course

people when they look at it of course
the<00:02:31.780> crosstour<00:02:32.170> functionality<00:02:32.860> has<00:02:32.980> not

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
the crosstour functionality has not

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.430 
the crosstour functionality has not
changed

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.070 

we<00:02:38.950> still<00:02:39.190> have<00:02:39.340> a<00:02:39.370> very<00:02:39.940> generous<00:02:40.360> cargo<00:02:40.750> area

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
we still have a very generous cargo area

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.860 
we still have a very generous cargo area
very<00:02:41.710> well<00:02:41.800> appointed<00:02:42.280> with<00:02:42.640> very<00:02:43.450> nice<00:02:43.630> loop

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
very well appointed with very nice loop

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.730 
very well appointed with very nice loop
carpet<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:45.370> have<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.610> OneTouch<00:02:46.000> seat<00:02:46.270> fold

carpet we have the OneTouch seat fold
which<00:02:47.740> place<00:02:47.980> basically<00:02:48.250> lowers<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.910> seat

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
which place basically lowers the seat

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
using levers in the rear so you can do

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.310 
using levers in the rear so you can do
that<00:02:51.940> from<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.210> rear<00:02:52.570> end<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.900> don't<00:02:53.050> have<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
that from the rear end you don't have to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.470 
that from the rear end you don't have to
go<00:02:53.470> inside<00:02:53.740> of<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> car<00:02:54.400> exactly<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.360> if

it's a one piece of plastic you can
literally<00:03:16.000> put<00:03:16.270> cans<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.810> ice<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:16.960> use<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:17.770> as

literally put cans and ice and use it as

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.280 
literally put cans and ice and use it as
a<00:03:17.890> cooler<00:03:18.100> I<00:03:18.190> do<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.580> can<00:03:18.730> do<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:19.000> absolutely

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
something a little bit messy you can

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.510 
something a little bit messy you can
take<00:03:25.960> that<00:03:26.170> out

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.430 

flip<00:03:29.120> these<00:03:29.330> over<00:03:29.390> there<00:03:29.810> basically<00:03:30.080> mirror

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
flip these over there basically mirror

what I just showed you this as quick as
that<00:03:51.650> goes<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.790> it's<00:03:53.000> not<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.180> lot<00:03:53.360> of<00:03:53.420> that<00:03:54.290> a

that goes so it's not a lot of that a

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.100 
that goes so it's not a lot of that a
lot<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.590> rocket<00:03:54.890> science<00:03:55.220> involved<00:03:56.080> so<00:03:57.080> we

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:57.110 
lot of rocket science involved so we

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.440 
lot of rocket science involved so we
fifty<00:03:57.560> percent<00:03:57.860> and<00:03:58.430> you're<00:03:58.760> confident<00:03:59.270> but
