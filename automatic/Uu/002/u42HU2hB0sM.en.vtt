00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
is what it currently runs at and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.929 
is what it currently runs at and
obviously<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:41.909> not<00:01:42.270> playable<00:01:43.490> umm<00:01:46.939> fairly

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

good<00:01:48.180> for<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> ROM<00:01:49.399> showing<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.579> 3d<00:01:50.970> effects

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
good for a ROM showing the 3d effects

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.780 
good for a ROM showing the 3d effects
and<00:01:52.549> the<00:01:53.549> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.000> shows<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.350> potential

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
and the kind of shows the potential

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.899 
and the kind of shows the potential
where<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:56.969> citric<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.540> go<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.579> hopefully<00:01:59.579> in

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
where the citric can go and hopefully in

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.609 
where the citric can go and hopefully in
the<00:02:00.000> near<00:02:00.119> future<00:02:02.180> we<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.479> Pokemon<00:02:03.960> X<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
the near future we can get Pokemon X so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
the near future we can get Pokemon X so
I'm<00:02:05.130> gonna<00:02:05.399> talk<00:02:05.640> about<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:06.060> right<00:02:06.119> now<00:02:06.299> and

Pokemon X is it's a Nintendo encrypts
the<00:02:56.000> files<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.110> gonna<00:02:57.230> be<00:02:57.379> extremely

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
the files and it's gonna be extremely

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
hard to find out what the code is and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.000 
hard to find out what the code is and
recode<00:03:02.629> everything<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:03.709> playable

will be updates but for now I'm just

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.940 
will be updates but for now I'm just
gonna<00:03:12.319> show<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.620> how<00:03:13.099> to<00:03:13.160> get<00:03:13.639> this<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:15.769> run

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
gonna show you how to get this to run

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
gonna show you how to get this to run
smoothly<00:03:16.480> so<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.720> use<00:03:18.109> razor<00:03:18.380> cortex<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.790> can

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
smoothly so I use razor cortex you can

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.599 
smoothly so I use razor cortex you can
search<00:03:20.239> it<00:03:20.359> up<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.600> Google<00:03:20.959> it's<00:03:21.950> very<00:03:22.340> it

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
search it up on Google it's very it

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:26.199 
search it up on Google it's very it
still<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.109> it's<00:03:24.109> a<00:03:24.170> very<00:03:24.319> good<00:03:24.590> booster<00:03:25.209> FPS

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
still like it's a very good booster FPS

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.610 
still like it's a very good booster FPS
booster<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.560> I'm<00:03:27.650> willing<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:28.069> run<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:29.620> six

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
booster so I'm willing to run that six

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.530 
booster so I'm willing to run that six
row<00:03:30.859> six<00:03:31.489> RPT<00:03:31.910> file<00:03:32.440> with<00:03:33.880> game<00:03:34.880> booster<00:03:35.090> and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
row six RPT file with game booster and

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.150 
row six RPT file with game booster and
you're<00:03:36.200> gonna<00:03:36.349> do<00:03:37.099> a<00:03:37.130> manual<00:03:37.489> boost

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.920 

yeah<00:03:45.870> and<00:03:46.870> then<00:03:47.050> you're<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.470> defrag

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
yeah and then you're going to defrag

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.000 
yeah and then you're going to defrag
this<00:03:49.930> 6:4<00:03:50.530> file

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
this 6:4 file

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.160 
this 6:4 file
so<00:03:51.520> what<00:03:51.700> defragment<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.110> basically

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
so what defragment is is it's basically

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.650 
so what defragment is is it's basically
taking<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:55.180> razor<00:03:55.450> scans<00:03:56.020> all<00:03:56.350> the<00:03:56.860> files<00:03:57.130> and

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
taking the razor scans all the files and

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.010 
taking the razor scans all the files and
when<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:58.750> doesn't<00:03:58.930> kind<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.500> smoothes<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.310> down

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
when it doesn't kind of smoothes it down

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.440 
when it doesn't kind of smoothes it down
right<00:04:02.020> so<00:04:02.580> it'll<00:04:03.580> be<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:03.790> much<00:04:04.030> smoother

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
right so it'll be a much smoother

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.780 
right so it'll be a much smoother
gameplay<00:04:04.660> much<00:04:05.290> faster<00:04:05.860> gameplay<00:04:06.160> obviously

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
gameplay much faster gameplay obviously

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.140 
gameplay much faster gameplay obviously
because<00:04:07.510> your<00:04:07.690> this<00:04:08.530> automatically<00:04:09.220> removes

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
because your this automatically removes

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.810 
because your this automatically removes
some<00:04:10.420> files<00:04:10.720> from<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.170> command<00:04:11.470> prompt<00:04:11.830> not

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
some files from the command prompt not

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.060 
some files from the command prompt not
the<00:04:12.940> command<00:04:13.240> front<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.840> task<00:04:14.740> manager

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
the command front but the task manager

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.380 
the command front but the task manager
and<00:04:16.110> does<00:04:17.110> that<00:04:17.230> automatically<00:04:18.239> so<00:04:19.239> we're

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
and does that automatically so we're

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.630 
and does that automatically so we're
going<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.540> see<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> dramatic<00:04:19.840> difference<00:04:20.770> in

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
going to see a dramatic difference in

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.050 
going to see a dramatic difference in
fps<00:04:22.860> also<00:04:23.860> what<00:04:24.160> I'm<00:04:24.250> going<00:04:24.370> to<00:04:24.400> talk<00:04:24.580> about<00:04:24.760> is

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
fps also what I'm going to talk about is

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.010 
fps also what I'm going to talk about is

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
that's pretty much the sub goal for

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.930 
that's pretty much the sub goal for
switch<00:04:38.130> yeah<00:04:39.480> so<00:04:40.830> I'm<00:04:41.830> just<00:04:42.190> gonna<00:04:42.400> how<00:04:42.820> it's

subs I'm gonna put all their usernames

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.140 
subs I'm gonna put all their usernames
into<00:04:47.230> like<00:04:47.410> this<00:04:48.160> program<00:04:48.700> it's<00:04:49.030> gonna

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
into like this program it's gonna

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.720 
into like this program it's gonna
randomize<00:04:49.690> the<00:04:49.870> names<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.860> guess<00:04:51.580> the

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
randomize the names and I guess the

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.210 
randomize the names and I guess the
first<00:04:51.940> person<00:04:52.510> whose<00:04:53.110> name<00:04:53.290> pops<00:04:53.560> up<00:04:53.770> randomly
