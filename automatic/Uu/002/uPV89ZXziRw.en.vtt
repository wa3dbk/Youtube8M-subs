00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 Good day dear friends with 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.990
 you again perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.530
 I want to congratulate you all on the coming 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 2014 year 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.100
 and in honor of this we will play strange 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.619
 a game called santa claus who knows 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.830
 English clearly understood a little game 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.210
 words because this game translates as claws 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.039
 sandei they are santa claus so let's go 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 the trick is that evil santa claus 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.559
 for some reason he was angry with us all 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.469
 escaped from the workshop where he 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.899
 killed all elves and only one elf 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.660
 survived and must stop 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.820
 Santa's rebellion remember to give a simulator 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 janitor last where's santa 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 freaked out and killed all the elves 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.270
 here he flies into the city to destroy the city 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.890
 kill everyone but i have to stop me 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.039
 the last elf who can 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.219
 resist so i see two elves 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.340
 it's probably his spies and you guys 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.199
 spies I can throw snowballs of course 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 he himself you were a shotgun in me 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.500
 just snowballs but it's a little sad but 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:12.750
 they are cool and you want to kill my head 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.880
 ah you contagion maybe santa was not 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.630
 alone and with him were these evil elves 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.090
 who helped him in his evil deeds 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.630
 I do not know the way he hid already sorry 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.130
 izvedu 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.049
 you need to catch him and throw him off 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.540
 harness that somehow she flies 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.180
 without deer and by the way guys i want to go 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.400
 any interesting game please 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.759
 write your options that you can go and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.759
 we will go through then let's see what you 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.939
 choose if you like any 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.619
 write about this option but do not write a 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.270
 just like the likes under the comment 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.860
 one or another game that you 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.780
 liked it if someone is already up to you 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.320
 wrote hopefully I said enough 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.360
 it is clear though I did not understand anything 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.579
 guys do not recommend offering very 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.030
 popular games however I 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.210
 I'm afraid I'm afraid of being presented to me 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.190
 copyright holders that they say 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.319
 I am not the copyright holders and me 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.870
 banned and it will be a little sad i don't 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.120
 I want to not get banned so try 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.750
 this is to be avoided by the way santa is already flying away 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.170
 go here 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.510
 red scum pooh-pooh I have several 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.520
 Santa started throwing presents at me 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.370
 maybe 100 bomb really is 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.520
 there was a bomb a gift exploded and it was 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.100
 little sad lake elf elf and elf 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.110
 why these elves can't be with me 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.209
 elf i know you still have something 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.269
 elf is a real kind elf in 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.070
 him an insane face he will die okay just 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.930
 because he has a crazy face though 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.540
 kill humans or elves for what they 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.940
 crazy face is not very good i walk by 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.010
 the city has a lot of crazy people but I do not 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.200
 I approach each of them and do not kill them 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.650
 although if I killed me you were put in 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.050
 the prison 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.750
 there I would make a whole bunch of tattoos or 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.910
 would just become a rooster that they don't know 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.800
 even more likely I would have 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.900
 domes full back I would be cool 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.360
 would then become an authority and capture 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.739
 measures though all this dreams dreams dreams in 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.850
 prison is not good 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.870
 by the way santa santa santa 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.579
 easier there with gifts and he 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.170
 there was a health bar you can 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.790
 destroy captivity not finished snow 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.000
 hit did not hit did not take 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.570
 acceleration in the form of acceleration here lollipops 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.040
 so go here they run somewhere wrong 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.160
 maybe they didn't notice me and not 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.140
 noticed all the same does not want clamps 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.090
 stupid elves they run for the same 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.239
 trajectories that i was running it a little 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.329
 strange but okay apparently not just stupid 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:51.079
 where i am santa 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:53.549
 I see you bastard straight all the tree of infection 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.950
 why are there so many elves if not 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.329
 elves i would already kill santa honest word 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.260
 frets need to act more actively not 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.970
 catch up with santa 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 come here my little my little 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:10.349
 asshole santa 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.150
 about acceleration well then let's go Vincent 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.879
 begins to actively throw gifts 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.789
 it scares me a little if i have 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:19.410
 gone yes I hit a damn not 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:24.090
 turned up on the roof of the house needed there and 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:26.970
 stay well strip it happens 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.250
 fast enough and on the background of the moon can 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.620
 see in him claws both on health 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.660
 which he actually throws these 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.000
 presents 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.979
 if you walk down the street at night 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.380
 will feed Santana its buckles and 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.349
 throw you gifts don't catch them because 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.130
 that you just die if you catch one 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.090
 of these gifts 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.770

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.889
