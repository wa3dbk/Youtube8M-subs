00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
it actually has the be whatever these

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.310 
it actually has the be whatever these
things<00:02:25.210> are<00:02:25.480> called<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.750> can't<00:02:25.930> think<00:02:26.050> at<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
things are called I can't think at the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.800 
things are called I can't think at the
moment<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.990> screw<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.970> filter<00:02:30.970> lid<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
moment to screw the filter lid on and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.710 
moment to screw the filter lid on and
then<00:02:32.140> you're<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.310> drop<00:02:33.550> this<00:02:33.850> in<00:02:34.150> your

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
then you're going to drop this in your

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.590 
then you're going to drop this in your
water<00:02:34.900> bottle<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.910> should<00:02:37.240> sit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
water bottle like so and it should sit

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.310 
water bottle like so and it should sit
securely<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.560> does<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.490> just

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
securely and it does so you can just

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.610 
securely and it does so you can just
squeeze<00:02:41.320> it<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.770> here<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.470> you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
squeeze it in here and I think and you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.960 
squeeze it in here and I think and you
should<00:02:44.770> be<00:02:44.800> able<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.100> easily<00:02:45.130> pull<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.610> out<00:02:45.730> too
