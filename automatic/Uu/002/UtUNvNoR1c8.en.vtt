00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.760 
would stay behind and it's around that's
like<00:02:00.299> twenty<00:02:00.570> three<00:02:00.780> megabytes<00:02:01.170> it's<00:02:01.530> really

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
like twenty three megabytes it's really

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.530 
like twenty three megabytes it's really
not<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.950> big<00:02:02.130> deal<00:02:02.190> but<00:02:02.760> still<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.360> just
