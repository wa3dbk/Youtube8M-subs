00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.379
 saved students from spaceshames are 

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.799
 Dr. White we are here today with a new one 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:13.150
 video dedicated to fifa last 15 teams 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.100
 man of the match review 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.619
 finally this man of the match of 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.090
 this match man is on the market 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.130
 we are talking about alessandro matri 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.560
 striker owned by Milan 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.080
 loan to the juventus who decided the 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.510
 cup final Italy against Lazio 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.940
 keeping alive the dream of the treble for 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.890
 the juventus now misses only the final of 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.719
 champions league against barcelona 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.199
 from June 6 if I'm not mistaken in any case 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.309
 matri is not new to inform versions 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.260
 bar man of the match 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:43.239
 let's see how it behaves on which it does 15 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.079
 starting as usual with speed 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.370
 speed that is good is not an attacker 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.069
 fast so it is not doubtful but it is not 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.429
 not even a slow striker indeed if there 

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:57.280
 cava has a good acceleration to one 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.019
 good top speed with 80 certainly not 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.749
 think you can do all the field 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.819
 however in the last 25 meters it can hurt 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.760
 however to the opposing defenses 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.530
 good physical strength than this 79 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.150
 therefore an average value 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.480
 let's say from the physical point of view 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.400
 matri has no particular problems for 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.840
 as for the shot we see 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.080
 one of its main features is 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.090
 the finalization to 83 but in game 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.130
 looks higher because you see I did 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.930
 really many goals with him in seven 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.560
 matches I made 10 goals certainly exist 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.990
 easy goals because in any case matri da 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.960
 the distance never marks why not 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.610
 never scores to be 52 from shooting 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.860
 distance per capita that is to be used in 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.570
 penalty area though if we look for a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.120
 player who maybe concretizes 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.670
 the action with 23 balls he can do 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.800
 maybe two goals and one wrong matri 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.180
 can do for us 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.420
 good shooting power also 81 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.470
 the effect in a bit more scarce 71 however 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.940
 I also managed to score 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.620
 quietly 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.600
 the only small problem between the shooting 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 from the distance it could be the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.549
 so weak stars are three so vi 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.800
 advice to pull mainly of 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.380
 left right I advise you to avoid 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.600
 as for dribbling he has me 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.730
 amazed despite only two-star styles 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.340
 so you can't do skill has one 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.989
 fair agility with 77 considering that 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.560
 one meter and 83 to good control 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.930
 also this ball on the 77 in general if 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.870
 the peg does not think you have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.400
 in front of a fantastic player for 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.130
 as for the dribbling however you have 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.650
 since he often manages to jump 12 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.269
 men and I noticed that it is discreet too 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.340
 in passages despite the value on 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.750
 card is not particularly high only 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.060
 58 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.519
 I also did 3 assists of course not 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.190
 passages from 45 meters however can be 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.200
 useful maybe if the screen is unique 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.850
 as we will see later to pass the ball 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.870
 to outsiders 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.670
 as far as the physical is concerned 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.549
 we have said of physical strength on 79 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.950
 where it stands out in the elevation well 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.350
 89 that a really high value then 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.060
 it often happened to me that he and 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.040
 to dominate even people like Sergio 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.970
 ramos chiellini the problem what is that 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.160
 is not very precise head ok to 84 but 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.709
 head in a bit of effort me 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.190
 expect average but we know very well 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.230
 that on this scared head shots are 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.970
 been greatly weakened therefore it is 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.250
 really hard to score to pro 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.530
 I point out to you that if you wish 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.359
 also using here unique tip buffon 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.400
 maybe he makes a freshman raise 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.650
 elevation manages to spur the ball of 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.820
 head for an exterior anyway to do 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.530
 get on the team 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.079
 emissaries are recommended for this 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.060
 I would tell you player or soccer player 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.040
 engine because the speed maybe I 'm 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.170
 that many people especially in division 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.430
 1 desire of the most reactive players 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.720
 I used what I was of 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.989
 however, I found myself well 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.799
 just value two alternatives 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.480
 hunter increase at speed and shooting 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.609
 so maybe the shot for those who want to know 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.049
 be sure to always finalize 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.299
 maybe increase the power a little bit 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.370
 Throw engine to increase a little 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.319
 dribbling the passage they are so good 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.940
 as we have seen but not his own 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.230
 best features 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.150
 I have to use this player before 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.220
 so all low warcraft medium then 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.110
 is fine as a striker indeed 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.640
 to the only roles in which you can deploy it 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.200
 I can recommend them in a two-man attack 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.820
 points in this case accompanied by a 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.739
 very fast player 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.300
 I put tevez that is not ok 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.220
 very fast try to jump 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.200
 speed opponents in this case vi 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.900
 I can also recommend his 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.370
 app version with behind a little but that can 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.590
 solve the game we know with a 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.330
 shooting from distance then matri to one 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.280
 team that plays for him because one of the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.620
 its against and that needs so many 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.440
 players who play for him or in 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.960
 a 4 3 2 1 this is recommended we have 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.470
 seen matri tip single spits the ball 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:49.990
 for square gervinho they will have to be inserted 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.730
 can receive passes from the two externals 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.610
 and of the midfielders therefore in general 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:57.190
 I really liked matri as a tip 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.820
 he certainly has problems because he has 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.400
 problems, however, we see the pro speed 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.110
 it is discreet because it is neither too slow 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.640
 okay too fast though it's a 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.790
 right speed for the type of 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.190
 striker who is the finalizer 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.950
 perfect physical strength ok is a 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.680
 user has an ok shooting power is 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:20.460
 low cost because I got it at 12,700 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.270
 credits therefore a very low figure 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.479
 ingenando found around that 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.700
 figure the elevation it is not bad at all 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.560
 of against two stars this lineage 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.990
 the three foot stars can be annoying 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.760
 weak because maybe one wanted to have 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.900
 four so you can pull either right 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:40.030
 that of accident and the need to have 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.100
 a team behind that plays for him 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.710
 because it's difficult that maybe it's like 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.050
 ronaldo who takes the ball jumps 45 men 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.860
 and goes to the door mother needs maybe 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.960
 receive lots of balls maybe he passes 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.840
 but the ball is not that player who 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.400
 alone you solve matches and jump 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.560
 all pro is a player who is me 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.360
 liked it gets a nice 8 I will continue 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.040
 to use it so I really stayed 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.660
 Also pleased with issues you have 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.700
 tried but dream man of the match 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.700
 we will see each other soon
