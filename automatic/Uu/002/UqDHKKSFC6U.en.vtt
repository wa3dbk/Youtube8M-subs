actually yeah if you notice that the way

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.210 
actually yeah if you notice that the way
that<00:04:25.199> he<00:04:25.259> started<00:04:25.560> this<00:04:25.620> all<00:04:25.800> off<00:04:25.919> is<00:04:26.100> by

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
that he started this all off is by

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.159 
that he started this all off is by
jumping<00:04:26.490> in<00:04:26.759> and<00:04:27.090> not<00:04:27.479> getting<00:04:27.690> an<00:04:27.870> cieared
