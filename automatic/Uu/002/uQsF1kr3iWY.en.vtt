00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 now 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.269
 efe 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.789
 not because the xml code is in conditions 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.480
 the next who presides over his daughter to cancer and how soon carinthia israel 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.740
 nor the inverse to that and it can be that he 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.610
 to graze mention their store of Spain famous mint I do not think of 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.080
 nothing can and specificity for one or two because I was going to allow it to 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.400
 arise in quito is expected to continue 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.810
 what I am and I am happy that 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.350
 they are here 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.300
 for me this bonus the most important thing is that people enjoy 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.960
 a match not 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.210
 I do not know many of 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.670
 of the players that come 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.060
 and for me it's not being here with them 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.370
 the most important thing is that people enjoy a great match 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.720
 It is clear that there is a good team and that gives us the possibility of 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 d trains the week much better 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.520
 Maybe he's not even convenient this is the trip over this 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.270
 but you do not have to make better use of it and I think there was in Chile 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.579
 the world every day 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.590
 what a week menu with very good team and 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.700
 they made theirs and with all 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.770
 with all the seriousness of the prepares also for the party that a century 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.740
 throughout the game but 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.370
 with with 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.850
 with the idea of ​​d 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.790
 to keep working this month goes beyond forgetting about the oeia yet 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.120
 separate from that punctual cuts to 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.910
 we keep getting into 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.170
 the other goals 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 to the will face temples I think that as he said 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.100
 we know each other a long time ago we won championships together with a 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.140
