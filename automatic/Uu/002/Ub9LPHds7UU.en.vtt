all we thought we are going to play
something<00:02:30.959> else<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:32.160> then<00:02:32.370> we<00:02:32.670> looked<00:02:32.940> again

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
something else and then we looked again

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.640 
something else and then we looked again
at<00:02:33.299> this<00:02:33.450> line<00:02:33.690> was<00:02:33.840> Queen<00:02:34.049> d2<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.530> was

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
at this line was Queen d2 and it was

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.440 
at this line was Queen d2 and it was
looking<00:02:35.280> very<00:02:35.310> very<00:02:35.700> promising<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.329> we

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
looking very very promising and we

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.920 
looking very very promising and we
decided<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.379> play<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.910> we<00:02:38.910> analyzed<00:02:39.329> for<00:02:39.900> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
decided to play it and we analyzed for a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.360 
decided to play it and we analyzed for a
few<00:02:40.200> more<00:02:40.319> hours<00:02:40.379> and<00:02:40.920> they're<00:02:41.069> really<00:02:41.160> it's

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
few more hours and they're really it's

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.849 
few more hours and they're really it's
very<00:02:41.579> dangerous<00:02:41.730> for<00:02:41.970> black<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:43.650> hope<00:02:43.799> that

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
very dangerous for black so we hope that

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.400 
very dangerous for black so we hope that
he<00:02:44.220> will<00:02:44.310> go<00:02:44.459> into<00:02:44.609> it<00:02:45.019> how<00:02:46.019> do<00:02:46.109> you<00:02:46.170> feel<00:02:46.349> about

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
he will go into it how do you feel about

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.930 
he will go into it how do you feel about
the<00:02:46.739> alternative<00:02:46.859> you<00:02:47.280> have<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.609> take<00:02:47.760> only

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the alternative you have to take only

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.210 
the alternative you have to take only
five<00:02:48.239> of<00:02:48.810> course<00:02:49.109> and<00:02:49.380> many<00:02:49.709> people<00:02:49.859> look<00:02:50.069> at

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
five of course and many people look at

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.710 
five of course and many people look at
it<00:02:50.250> with<00:02:50.489> computer<00:02:50.940> what<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.269> your<00:02:51.480> opinion

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it with computer what is your opinion

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.259 
it with computer what is your opinion
right<00:02:52.049> now<00:02:52.079> let<00:02:52.500> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.849> position<00:02:54.180> is

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
right now let I think the position is

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.879 
right now let I think the position is
very<00:02:54.419> unclear<00:02:54.870> at<00:02:55.019> least<00:02:55.200> for<00:02:55.380> one<00:02:55.530> game<00:02:55.709> it

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:55.889 
very unclear at least for one game it

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:57.890 
very unclear at least for one game it
was<00:02:56.069> more<00:02:56.310> than<00:02:56.459> enough<00:02:56.750> now<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.870> course

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
was more than enough now of course

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.129 
was more than enough now of course
everybody's<00:02:58.440> analyzing<00:02:58.950> those<00:02:59.040> engines<00:02:59.489> so<00:03:00.480> I

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:01.139 
everybody's analyzing those engines so I

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.450 
everybody's analyzing those engines so I
think<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.739> unclear<00:03:02.099> ok<00:03:02.940> thank<00:03:03.419> you
