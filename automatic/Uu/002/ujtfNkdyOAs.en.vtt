00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.759
 good morning guys when we put the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.830
 driving a car is a lot 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.470
 important driving position 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 this because it allows us to have a 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.529
 less muscle fatigue and one 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.600
 better visibility what I do I go 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
 immediately to see the distance from the 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.369
 pedal board with the lever that I have under the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.990
 seat I can take it forward or 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 bring it back 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.399
 at this point I press all the way down with 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 the left foot the pedal of the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.890
 clutch and I have to have an angle to the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.350
 knee bent now I find the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 distance from the steering wheel thanks to 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.039
 numerous adjustments we have in 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.129
 equipment in the cars 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.320
 I can even recline the backrest 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.170
 with this lever I can carry it in 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.809
 vertical position while this lever 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.020
 allows me to lower or raise the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.660
 seat once again brought the backrest 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.060
 in a vertical position and remembering to 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.520
 keep the shoulder blades resting on it 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.080
 I carry the seat at the top 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.510
 of the steering wheel rim 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.920
 I must have a relaxed arm 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.619
 quite soft 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.390
 at this point I insert the thumbs 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.360
 within the same and do them 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 fall down on the breeds by lodging 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.470
 the thumbs inside the races this 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.960
 allows him to show how much 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 diametrically opposed hands succeed in 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.840
 turn the steering wheel more precisely 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.700
 and even the angle embraces 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 its importance precisely because me 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.759
 allows it to be fluid in any 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.759
 maneuver 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.409
 at this point we pass by the cell 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.970
 seat belt as I do the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.430
 I take the hook and go to bring the 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.950
 lower part adhering to the bones of the 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.170
 pelvis while the upper part must 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.530
 be close to the chest and I have to 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.810
 pull lengthwise from the bottom 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.520
 upwards I can also try ad 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.890
 go ahead with the taste for 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.349
 check that in this with this 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.310
 movement does not go nor too close to 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.019
 neck to slip under the shoulder not 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.049
 let's forget the regulation of the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.390
 headrest that must be lifted and carried 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.540
 in line with the top of the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.540
 head 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.390
 child seats go 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.190
 secured to the rear seats by following 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.300
 scrupulously the instructions for the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.160
 mounting 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.190
 even better if they are gifted 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.760
 safe and practical isofix attachments from 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.760
 mount
