the sport mode you're now going to have

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.820 
the sport mode you're now going to have
a<00:02:40.590> red<00:02:41.000> line<00:02:42.000> under<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.480> P<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.990> by<00:02:43.500> having

a red line under the P and by having
that<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.400> gonna<00:02:44.610> be<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:44.940> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.510> faster

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
that it's gonna be a little bit faster

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
traction control if your wheels are

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.170 
traction control if your wheels are
spinning<00:03:04.200> you'll<00:03:05.130> want<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.370> take<00:03:05.580> traction

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
spinning you'll want to take traction

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.300 
spinning you'll want to take traction
control<00:03:06.570> off<00:03:06.780> you're<00:03:07.290> gonna<00:03:07.410> see<00:03:07.739> that<00:03:07.980> right

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
control off you're gonna see that right

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.180 
control off you're gonna see that right
here<00:03:08.670> says<00:03:09.090> traction<00:03:09.600> control<00:03:09.930> off<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.410> then

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
here says traction control off and then

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.760 
here says traction control off and then
we're<00:03:11.370> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.520> use<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:12.450> gear<00:03:13.050> shifter<00:03:13.530> and

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
we're going to use this gear shifter and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.610 
we're going to use this gear shifter and
go<00:03:13.950> from<00:03:14.480> reverse<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.690> drive<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.170> reverse<00:03:16.440> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
go from reverse to drive to reverse the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.350 
go from reverse to drive to reverse the
drive<00:03:16.860> to<00:03:17.100> give<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.459> positive<00:03:18.030> momentum

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
drive to give the positive momentum

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.770 
drive to give the positive momentum
until<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.320> find<00:03:19.680> dry<00:03:19.980> or<00:03:20.190> pavement<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.570> make

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
until you find dry or pavement to make

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.890 
until you find dry or pavement to make
the<00:03:21.930> wheels<00:03:22.850> gradually<00:03:23.850> go<00:03:24.480> versus<00:03:25.140> spinning

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
the wheels gradually go versus spinning

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.170 
the wheels gradually go versus spinning
this<00:03:27.900> concludes<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.709> overall<00:03:29.220> inside<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
this concludes the overall inside of the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.810 
this concludes the overall inside of the
vehicle<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:30.989> to<00:03:31.500> what<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.739> wanted<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.250> go<00:03:32.400> over

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
vehicle as to what I wanted to go over

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.510 
vehicle as to what I wanted to go over
just<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.780> give<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> brief<00:03:34.500> overview<00:03:34.770> as<00:03:35.430> to

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
just to give you a brief overview as to

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.590 
just to give you a brief overview as to
what<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.150> can<00:03:36.300> expect<00:03:36.780> out<00:03:37.080> of<00:03:37.170> this<00:03:37.440> is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
what you can expect out of this is

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.030 
what you can expect out of this is
there's<00:03:39.600> two<00:03:39.810> other<00:03:40.020> features<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.920> go

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
there's two other features I want to go

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.880 
there's two other features I want to go
over<00:03:41.430> when<00:03:41.880> you're<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.450> manual<00:03:42.870> Drive<00:03:43.170> not

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
over when you're in the manual Drive not

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.830 
over when you're in the manual Drive not
only<00:03:44.220> can<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.549> use<00:03:44.579> the<00:03:44.910> gear<00:03:45.120> shifter<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.690> go

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
only can you use the gear shifter to go

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.660 
only can you use the gear shifter to go
up<00:03:45.989> and<00:03:46.200> down<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.190> choose<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.640> use

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
up and down but you can choose to use

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.280 
up and down but you can choose to use
the<00:03:48.060> paddle<00:03:48.450> shifters

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
the paddle shifters

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.720 
the paddle shifters
so<00:03:49.439> you're<00:03:49.560> not<00:03:49.680> having<00:03:49.920> to<00:03:50.069> remove<00:03:50.459> both

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
so you're not having to remove both

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.149 
so you're not having to remove both
hands<00:03:51.030> from<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.299> steering<00:03:51.629> well<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.799> over

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
hands from the steering well this over

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.490 
hands from the steering well this over
here<00:03:53.400> is<00:03:53.519> going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.790> be<00:03:53.909> a<00:03:54.120> downshift<00:03:54.540> being

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
here is going to be a downshift being

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.089 
here is going to be a downshift being
that<00:03:55.860> it<00:03:55.980> says<00:03:56.220> minus<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.989> plus<00:03:58.200> that

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that it says minus and the plus that

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.179 
that it says minus and the plus that
it's<00:03:59.310> going<00:03:59.489> to<00:03:59.640> be<00:03:59.790> for<00:04:00.239> up<00:04:00.360> shifting

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
it's going to be for up shifting

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.860 
it's going to be for up shifting
the<00:04:02.189> last<00:04:02.400> thing<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.700> wanted<00:04:02.939> to<00:04:03.030> go<00:04:03.150> over<00:04:03.180> is

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
the last thing I wanted to go over is

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.309 
the last thing I wanted to go over is
inside<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:05.459> armrest<00:04:05.819> you<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.510> two<00:04:07.049> USB

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
inside the armrest you have two USB

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.660 
inside the armrest you have two USB
ports<00:04:07.709> these<00:04:08.700> two<00:04:08.970> USB<00:04:09.420> ports<00:04:09.780> are<00:04:09.980> USB<00:04:10.980> 3

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
ports these two USB ports are USB 3

ports these two USB ports are USB 3
which<00:04:12.150> is<00:04:12.299> going<00:04:12.450> to<00:04:12.510> be<00:04:12.690> able<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:13.079> transfer

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
which is going to be able to transfer

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.550 
which is going to be able to transfer
the<00:04:13.650> data<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:14.190> lot<00:04:14.610> quicker<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.239> charge<00:04:15.840> either

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
the data a lot quicker and charge either

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.670 
the data a lot quicker and charge either
a<00:04:16.799> cell<00:04:17.100> phone<00:04:17.340> iPod<00:04:18.180> or<00:04:18.570> multiple<00:04:19.500> other
