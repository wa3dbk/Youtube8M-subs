00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
thighs driving his hip through to give

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.139 
thighs driving his hip through to give
him<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.750> nice<00:01:40.140> long<00:01:40.380> powerful<00:01:40.830> stride<00:01:41.399> so

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
him that nice long powerful stride so

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.029 
him that nice long powerful stride so
that's<00:01:42.330> what<00:01:42.530> Morgan's<00:01:43.530> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
that's what Morgan's going to have to

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:47.200 
that's what Morgan's going to have to
work<00:01:44.220> through<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:44.910> gets<00:01:45.090> older<00:01:45.770> this<00:01:46.770> sub

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
work through as he gets older this sub

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.490 
work through as he gets older this sub
definitely<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.330> gets<00:01:48.600> forced<00:01:48.899> into<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.320> ice

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
definitely it gets forced into the ice

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
definitely it gets forced into the ice
and<00:01:49.830> we<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.250> see<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.690> lawyer

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and we can see it I think it's lawyer

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.859 
and we can see it I think it's lawyer
this<00:01:52.860> feet<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.460> too<00:01:53.610> close<00:01:53.820> together<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.840> a

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this feet are too close together not a

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
good enough bed and not pops them

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.350 
good enough bed and not pops them
straight<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.630> he's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:58.080> in<00:01:58.259> control<00:01:59.360> now

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
straight out and he's not in control now

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.149 
straight out and he's not in control now
is<00:02:00.600> received<00:02:01.020> from<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.320> side<00:02:01.560> way<00:02:01.830> we<00:02:01.979> can

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
is received from the side way we can

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.609 
is received from the side way we can
really<00:02:02.189> start<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.820> see<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.200> skating

stride<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.220> getting<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.580> little<00:02:05.760> bit

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
stride is not getting a little bit

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.350 
stride is not getting a little bit
longer<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.140> see<00:02:07.380> more<00:02:08.010> activity

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
longer we like to see more activity

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.300

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
through sit down this but a little bit

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.380 
through sit down this but a little bit
more<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:13.830> his<00:02:14.040> leg<00:02:14.310> come<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.150> little

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
more to have his leg come out a little

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.720 
more to have his leg come out a little
bit<00:02:15.600> further<00:02:16.010> lengthening<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.250> skating

stride to give them those nice long
powerful<00:02:20.070> pushes<00:02:20.820> he's<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> lot<00:02:21.930> of

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
powerful pushes he's not a lot of

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.600 
powerful pushes he's not a lot of
movement<00:02:22.560> from<00:02:22.739> here<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.100> here<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:23.459> is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
movement from here to here which is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.970 
movement from here to here which is
pretty<00:02:23.850> good<00:02:24.120> what<00:02:24.269> we<00:02:24.299> like<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:24.600> see<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:25.650> now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
pretty good what we like to see this now

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
forward less arm swing and that way give

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.850 
forward less arm swing and that way give
it<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.709> more<00:02:31.890> force<00:02:32.340> up<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.180> ice<00:02:33.350> now<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.680> can

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
it a more force up the ice now as we can

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.130 
it a more force up the ice now as we can
see<00:02:35.070> Morgan<00:02:35.489> stop<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.820> we're<00:02:36.660> having<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
see Morgan stop it we're having it

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.699 
see Morgan stop it we're having it
easier<00:02:37.530> as<00:02:37.620> fundamentally<00:02:39.170> his<00:02:40.170> skates<00:02:40.530> are

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
easier as fundamentally his skates are

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.310 
easier as fundamentally his skates are
at<00:02:40.799> two<00:02:40.980> different<00:02:41.130> angles<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:42.079> they're<00:02:43.079> too

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
at two different angles and they're too

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.050 
at two different angles and they're too
close<00:02:43.500> together<00:02:43.829> they<00:02:44.340> should<00:02:44.370> be<00:02:44.760> about

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
close together they should be about

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.340 
close together they should be about
shoulder<00:02:45.590> width<00:02:46.590> apart<00:02:47.720> also<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> can<00:02:48.959> see

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
shoulder width apart also you can see

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.170 
shoulder width apart also you can see
that<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.829> way<00:02:50.190> his<00:02:50.430> upper<00:02:50.730> body<00:02:50.760> is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
that the way his upper body is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.360 
that the way his upper body is
positioned<00:02:51.590> it's<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.769> to<00:02:52.799> be<00:02:52.950> hard<00:02:53.190> because

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
positioned it's going to be hard because

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.920 
positioned it's going to be hard because
he's<00:02:53.610> trying<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:53.970> go<00:02:54.090> against<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.540> grain<00:02:54.570> with

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
he's trying to go against the grain with

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.479 
he's trying to go against the grain with
your<00:02:55.049> stop<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.500> you<00:02:55.560> tend<00:02:55.799> to<00:02:55.950> lean<00:02:56.190> you

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
your stop and you tend to lean you

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.039 
your stop and you tend to lean you
should<00:02:56.910> be<00:02:57.000> leaning<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.390> little<00:02:57.420> bit<00:02:57.780> against

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
should be leaning a little bit against

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.289 
should be leaning a little bit against
the<00:02:58.170> grain<00:02:58.530> so<00:02:58.769> his<00:02:59.280> upper<00:02:59.549> body<00:02:59.579> is

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
the grain so his upper body is

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.240 
the grain so his upper body is
fundamentally<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.350> little<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:01.980> twisted

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
fundamentally a little bit twisted

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.940 
fundamentally a little bit twisted
uncoordinated<00:03:02.970> too<00:03:03.450> much<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.319> what<00:03:04.470> happens

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
uncoordinated too much so what happens

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.480 
uncoordinated too much so what happens
as<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.250> was

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
as it was

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.660 
as it was
all<00:03:05.610> his<00:03:06.240> hands<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.630> forcing<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.470> his<00:03:08.400> right

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
all his hands up forcing this his right

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.510 
all his hands up forcing this his right
leg<00:03:08.880> here<00:03:09.240> into<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.020> ice<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.590> then<00:03:11.010> the<00:03:11.190> force

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
leg here into the ice and then the force

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.780 
leg here into the ice and then the force
actually<00:03:12.360> pops<00:03:12.630> back<00:03:12.930> into<00:03:13.290> his<00:03:13.440> body<00:03:13.790> forcing

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
actually pops back into his body forcing

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.480 
actually pops back into his body forcing
him<00:03:15.060> very<00:03:15.750> straight<00:03:16.200> up<00:03:16.440> and<00:03:16.710> not<00:03:17.160> enough

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
him very straight up and not enough

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
skiing straight ahead it's pretty good

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.820 
skiing straight ahead it's pretty good
it's<00:03:24.090> right<00:03:24.270> in<00:03:24.330> line<00:03:24.720> it's<00:03:25.260> got<00:03:25.440> pretty<00:03:25.770> good

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
it's right in line it's got pretty good

his<00:03:28.560> arm<00:03:28.860> swing<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.730> little<00:03:30.180> bit<00:03:30.330> too<00:03:30.510> great

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
his arm swing is a little bit too great

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
his arm swing is a little bit too great
there<00:03:31.110> that's<00:03:31.320> okay<00:03:32.130> he's<00:03:32.460> young<00:03:32.670> guy<00:03:32.850> he's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
there that's okay he's young guy he's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.310 
there that's okay he's young guy he's
definitely<00:03:33.360> got<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> little<00:03:33.630> bit<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.900> work<00:03:34.110> on

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
definitely got a little bit to work on

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.520 
definitely got a little bit to work on
as<00:03:34.500> his<00:03:34.650> legs<00:03:34.890> get<00:03:35.130> stronger<00:03:35.490> at<00:03:36.000> his<00:03:36.150> core

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
as his legs get stronger at his core

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.200 
as his legs get stronger at his core
Barry<00:03:37.530> up<00:03:37.770> between<00:03:38.130> his<00:03:38.340> shoulders<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.000> his

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
Barry up between his shoulders and his

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.940 
Barry up between his shoulders and his
knees<00:03:39.450> gets<00:03:39.780> a<00:03:39.870> lot<00:03:40.050> stronger<00:03:40.410> he's<00:03:40.740> going<00:03:40.890> to

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
knees gets a lot stronger he's going to

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.950 
knees gets a lot stronger he's going to
become<00:03:41.070> much<00:03:41.460> more<00:03:41.670> efficient<00:03:42.120> skater<00:03:42.480> but

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
become much more efficient skater but

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.750 
become much more efficient skater but
pretty<00:03:43.260> good<00:03:43.380> technique<00:03:43.860> definitely<00:03:44.640> has<00:03:44.730> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
pretty good technique definitely has a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.460 
pretty good technique definitely has a
few<00:03:45.030> things<00:03:45.210> he<00:03:45.420> could<00:03:45.600> he<00:03:45.810> has<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.110> work<00:03:46.290> on

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
few things he could he has to work on

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.530 
few things he could he has to work on
but<00:03:47.010> as<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.430> really<00:03:47.640> break<00:03:47.850> down<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.300> slow

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
but as you can really break down in slow

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.900 
but as you can really break down in slow
motion<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.410> can<00:03:49.560> see<00:03:49.830> some<00:03:50.490> of<00:03:50.520> some<00:03:50.820> of<00:03:50.850> his

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
motion you can see some of some of his

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.790 
motion you can see some of some of his
hips<00:03:51.210> start<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.630> go<00:03:51.810> a<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.050> bit<00:03:52.230> more<00:03:52.380> too

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
hips start to go a little bit more too

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.280 
hips start to go a little bit more too
much<00:03:53.040> side<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.700> side<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:54.240> as<00:03:54.660> he<00:03:54.810> pulls<00:03:55.080> into

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
much side to side and as he pulls into

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.150 
much side to side and as he pulls into
his<00:03:55.590> stop<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.430> could<00:03:56.580> see<00:03:56.850> how<00:03:57.090> his<00:03:57.920> his<00:03:58.920> legs

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
his stop you could see how his his legs

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.340 
his stop you could see how his his legs
are<00:03:59.370> uncorrelated<00:04:00.090> between<00:04:00.810> his<00:04:00.990> shoulder

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
are uncorrelated between his shoulder

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.120 
are uncorrelated between his shoulder
