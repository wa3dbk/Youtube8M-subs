00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.370 
later on so these are actually ten
millimeter<00:01:40.590> bolts<00:01:40.979> you're<00:01:41.579> going<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:41.939> to

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
millimeter bolts you're going to want to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.569 
millimeter bolts you're going to want to
disconnect<00:01:43.380> these<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.100> crisscross<00:01:44.369> pattern

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
disconnect these in a crisscross pattern

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.109 
disconnect these in a crisscross pattern
like<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> star<00:01:45.720> pattern<00:01:46.460> evenly<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.670> take<00:01:47.970> your

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
like a star pattern evenly and take your

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.999 
like a star pattern evenly and take your
time<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:49.049> already<00:01:49.380> taken<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.799> off

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
time with it I've already taken this off

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.230 
time with it I've already taken this off
and<00:01:50.310> I've<00:01:50.549> already<00:01:50.700> did<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> crisscross

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
and I've already did the crisscross

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.590 
and I've already did the crisscross
pattern<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> avoid<00:01:53.360> watching<00:01:54.360> me<00:01:54.450> do

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
pattern so just to avoid watching me do

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.999 
pattern so just to avoid watching me do
this<00:01:54.720> retighten<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.350> I've<00:01:55.740> already<00:01:55.890> done

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this retighten that I've already done

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:11.530 
this retighten that I've already done
that<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.520> go<00:01:57.360> ahead<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.570> pop<00:01:57.719> these<00:01:57.869> bolts<00:01:58.290> off

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.360 

and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.080> once<00:02:13.320> once<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.070> springs

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and then once once you get the springs

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.860 
and then once once you get the springs
in<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.580> bolts<00:02:14.820> all<00:02:14.970> completely<00:02:15.300> off<00:02:15.510> again

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
in the bolts all completely off again

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.000 
in the bolts all completely off again
and<00:02:15.990> that<00:02:16.110> crisscross<00:02:16.380> pattern<00:02:16.830> like<00:02:16.980> I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
and that crisscross pattern like I

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.220 
and that crisscross pattern like I
explained<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.610> this<00:02:18.300> this<00:02:18.660> housing<00:02:19.140> is

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
explained to you this this housing is

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.600 
explained to you this this housing is
going<00:02:19.260> to<00:02:19.410> come<00:02:19.590> as<00:02:19.830> cover<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.250> come<00:02:20.430> right

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
going to come as cover some come right

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.580 
going to come as cover some come right
off<00:02:20.640> be<00:02:21.540> careful<00:02:21.900> because<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.410> going<00:02:22.500> to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
off be careful because you're going to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.930 
off be careful because you're going to
find<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.360> sometimes<00:02:24.360> these<00:02:24.900> bearings<00:02:25.410> and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
find that sometimes these bearings and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
find that sometimes these bearings and
the<00:02:26.940> clutch<00:02:27.150> rod<00:02:27.540> will<00:02:27.780> come<00:02:27.960> out<00:02:28.110> with<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.470> and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the clutch rod will come out with it and

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.070 
the clutch rod will come out with it and
then<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.400> want<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:29.580> pull<00:02:29.880> this<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.210> straight

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
then you want to pull this out straight

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.480 
then you want to pull this out straight
out<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.440> there's<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> washer<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.160> behind

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
out and there's a washer right behind

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.110 
out and there's a washer right behind
here<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:33.090> this<00:02:34.580> there's<00:02:35.580> a<00:02:35.640> washer<00:02:36.000> this

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
here see this there's a washer this

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.610 
here see this there's a washer this
comes<00:02:36.330> off<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.660> there's<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.870> washer<00:02:37.200> here

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
comes off and there's a washer here

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.170 
comes off and there's a washer here
don't<00:02:37.920> lose<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.190> that's<00:02:38.700> got<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> go<00:02:39.000> back

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
don't lose that that's got to go back

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.060 
don't lose that that's got to go back
onto<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.690> when<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> put<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.110> back<00:02:40.230> together<00:02:40.410> so

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
onto it when you put it back together so

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.110 
onto it when you put it back together so
what<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.460> do<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.670> like<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.880> take<00:02:42.030> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
what I like to do is like to take the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.470 
what I like to do is like to take the
bike<00:02:42.300> apart<00:02:42.959> as<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.350> take<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.280> apart<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.090> steps

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
bike apart as I take it apart and steps

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.060 
bike apart as I take it apart and steps
and<00:02:45.720> put<00:02:46.200> everything<00:02:46.410> aside<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.980> I<00:02:47.040> can

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
and put everything aside so I can

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.370 
and put everything aside so I can
remember<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:47.670> put<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.910> back<00:02:47.970> together

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
remember how to put it back together

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.580 
remember how to put it back together
alright<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.910> unit<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.630> off<00:02:51.900> what

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
alright so now that unit that's off what

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.440 
alright so now that unit that's off what
we<00:02:52.650> need<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.860> do<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:52.980> now<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.550> remove<00:02:54.209> the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
we need to do right now is remove the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.910 
we need to do right now is remove the
the<00:02:57.450> friction<00:02:57.810> plates<00:02:58.050> and<00:02:58.320> the<00:02:58.380> solid<00:02:58.680> plates

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
the friction plates and the solid plates

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.090 
the friction plates and the solid plates
from<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.220> clutch<00:02:59.480> unit<00:03:00.480> basket<00:03:01.020> what<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.010> do

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
from the clutch unit basket what I do

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.890 
from the clutch unit basket what I do
here<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.520> remember<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:03.660> always<00:03:03.780> have

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
here is remember you always have

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.990 
here is remember you always have
friction<00:03:04.530> first<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.370> then<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.760> have<00:03:05.880> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
friction first and then you have the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.240 
friction first and then you have the
plate<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.450> there's<00:03:07.110> multitudes<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.920> these<00:03:08.040> in

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
plate and there's multitudes of these in

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.920 
plate and there's multitudes of these in
here<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.030> like<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.300> kind<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.600> pop<00:03:09.780> these

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
here so I like to just kind of pop these

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.320 
here so I like to just kind of pop these
all<00:03:10.110> out<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.730> you'll<00:03:11.730> notice<00:03:11.970> that<00:03:12.090> they're

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
all out and you'll notice that they're

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.880 
all out and you'll notice that they're
bad<00:03:12.510> because<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.140> friction<00:03:13.320> plates<00:03:13.650> will<00:03:13.800> be

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
bad because the friction plates will be

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.710 
bad because the friction plates will be
worn<00:03:14.130> or<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.550> metal<00:03:14.790> part<00:03:15.060> off<00:03:15.209> hearts<00:03:15.570> will

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
worn or the metal part off hearts will

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:40.710 
worn or the metal part off hearts will
be<00:03:15.810> discolored

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:59.330 

and<00:03:41.720> we're<00:03:41.959> almost<00:03:42.050> there

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.860 

okay<00:04:00.340> that's<00:04:00.640> the<00:04:00.790> last<00:04:00.820> that's<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.510> friction

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
okay that's the last that's the friction

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.270 
okay that's the last that's the friction
plate<00:04:02.080> starts<00:04:02.470> with<00:04:02.620> friction<00:04:02.830> ends<00:04:03.130> with

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
plate starts with friction ends with

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.270 
plate starts with friction ends with
friction<00:04:04.080> now<00:04:05.080> we<00:04:05.140> need<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.440> remove<00:04:05.740> this<00:04:05.920> unit

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
friction now we need to remove this unit

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.720 
friction now we need to remove this unit
this<00:04:06.730> is<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.910> thirty<00:04:07.270> millimeter<00:04:08.520> this<00:04:09.520> is<00:04:09.700> a

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
this is a thirty millimeter this is a

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.270 
this is a thirty millimeter this is a
thirty<00:04:09.970> millimeter<00:04:10.420> nut<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.980> get<00:04:12.130> this

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
thirty millimeter nut and to get this

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.170 
thirty millimeter nut and to get this
off<00:04:12.550> you're<00:04:12.940> going<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.120> need<00:04:13.210> an<00:04:13.330> impact<00:04:15.180> which

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
off you're going to need an impact which

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.560 
off you're going to need an impact which
I<00:04:16.330> ended<00:04:16.480> up<00:04:16.600> using<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:18.360> basically<00:04:19.360> what<00:04:19.540> I

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
I ended up using and basically what I

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.360 
I ended up using and basically what I
ended<00:04:19.840> up<00:04:19.930> doing<00:04:20.080> is<00:04:20.380> putting<00:04:20.920> the<00:04:21.040> impact

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
ended up doing is putting the impact

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.880 
ended up doing is putting the impact
down<00:04:21.520> here<00:04:21.990> just<00:04:22.990> like<00:04:23.140> this<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.560> used<00:04:23.740> a

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
down here just like this I used a

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.120 
down here just like this I used a
leather<00:04:24.100> glove<00:04:24.340> and<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.470> put<00:04:26.710> pressure<00:04:26.860> on

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
leather glove and and I put pressure on

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.550 
leather glove and and I put pressure on
here<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.150> burped<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.720> loose<00:04:28.930> with<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.440> air

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
here and I burped it loose with the air

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.950 
here and I burped it loose with the air
impact<00:04:29.980> I<00:04:30.250> believe<00:04:31.120> it's<00:04:31.330> around<00:04:31.420> 80<00:04:31.720> foot

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
impact I believe it's around 80 foot

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.510 
impact I believe it's around 80 foot
pounds<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.350> pressure<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:32.980> it<00:04:33.070> just<00:04:33.220> took<00:04:33.370> it

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
pounds of pressure but it just took it

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.510 
pounds of pressure but it just took it
off<00:04:33.640> with<00:04:33.850> no<00:04:34.060> problem<00:04:34.420> at<00:04:34.510> all<00:04:35.190> so<00:04:36.190> anyhow

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
off with no problem at all so anyhow

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.930 
off with no problem at all so anyhow
once<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.000> take<00:04:37.150> this<00:04:37.270> off<00:04:38.790> you're<00:04:39.790> going<00:04:39.880> to

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
once you take this off you're going to

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.100 
once you take this off you're going to
be<00:04:40.000> careful<00:04:40.270> now<00:04:40.540> because<00:04:40.690> you're<00:04:40.930> going<00:04:41.020> to

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
be careful now because you're going to

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.230 
be careful now because you're going to
keep<00:04:41.410> track<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.490> washers<00:04:42.970> because

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
keep track of the washers because

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.030 
keep track of the washers because
there's<00:04:43.420> a<00:04:43.480> couple<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.840> them<00:04:43.960> in<00:04:43.990> here<00:04:44.200> one's

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
there's a couple of them in here one's

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.950 
there's a couple of them in here one's
bigger<00:04:45.730> than<00:04:45.880> the<00:04:46.060> other<00:04:46.150> or<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.600> should<00:04:46.810> say

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
bigger than the other or I should say

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.960 
bigger than the other or I should say
that<00:04:47.110> wider<00:04:47.320> diameter<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.100> you<00:04:48.640> want<00:04:48.790> to<00:04:48.880> keep

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
that wider diameter and you want to keep

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.480 
that wider diameter and you want to keep
it<00:04:49.120> in<00:04:49.180> that<00:04:49.270> same<00:04:49.540> order<00:04:50.200> so<00:04:50.950> you<00:04:51.010> got<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.340> nut

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
it in that same order so you got the nut

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.980 
it in that same order so you got the nut
off<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:54.400> got<00:04:54.520> spline<00:04:54.970> here<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.540> matches<00:04:55.870> up

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
off you got spline here that matches up

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.180 
off you got spline here that matches up
washer<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.910> then<00:04:58.060> this<00:04:58.150> unit<00:04:58.500> slips<00:04:59.500> off<00:04:59.710> be

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
washer and then this unit slips off be

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.650 
washer and then this unit slips off be
careful<00:05:00.670> when<00:05:00.850> you<00:05:00.940> pull<00:05:01.120> it<00:05:01.240> off<00:05:01.360> with<00:05:01.510> your

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
careful when you pull it off with your

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.790 
careful when you pull it off with your
hand<00:05:01.840> or<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.050> think<00:05:02.170> if<00:05:02.290> you<00:05:02.380> are<00:05:02.560> going<00:05:02.740> to

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
hand or you think if you are going to

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.430 
hand or you think if you are going to
lose<00:05:03.060> sometimes<00:05:04.060> parts<00:05:04.390> will<00:05:04.540> come<00:05:04.780> out<00:05:04.900> or

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
lose sometimes parts will come out or

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.480 
lose sometimes parts will come out or
okay<00:05:05.680> there's<00:05:06.640> the<00:05:06.700> back<00:05:06.880> of<00:05:07.060> it<00:05:07.410> and<00:05:08.490> then

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
okay there's the back of it and then

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.770 
okay there's the back of it and then
here's<00:05:09.850> that<00:05:10.000> washer<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.390> was<00:05:10.480> telling<00:05:10.720> you

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
here's that washer I was telling you

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.810 
here's that washer I was telling you
about<00:05:10.980> sometimes<00:05:11.980> I've<00:05:12.280> heard<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.610> stories

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
about sometimes I've heard of stories

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.950 
about sometimes I've heard of stories
where<00:05:13.090> people<00:05:13.120> put<00:05:13.480> these<00:05:13.630> on<00:05:13.780> and<00:05:13.900> they

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960

forget or they put on the wrong side and

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.400 
forget or they put on the wrong side and
can<00:05:15.610> cause<00:05:15.790> problems<00:05:16.080> so<00:05:17.080> there<00:05:17.230> you<00:05:17.320> go<00:05:19.410> this

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
can cause problems so there you go this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.030 
can cause problems so there you go this
comes<00:05:20.740> off<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.250> you're<00:05:21.970> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.150> have<00:05:22.390> a

comes off and you're going to have a
collar<00:05:24.040> and<00:05:24.400> two<00:05:24.940> sets<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.360> bearings<00:05:25.930> they

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
collar and two sets of bearings they

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.730 
collar and two sets of bearings they
want<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.890> pop<00:05:27.100> off<00:05:27.280> with<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.760> which<00:05:28.000> is<00:05:28.150> fine

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
want to pop off with it which is fine

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.080 
want to pop off with it which is fine
that<00:05:29.740> comes<00:05:29.950> off<00:05:30.130> I<00:05:30.310> cut<00:05:30.700> them<00:05:30.850> out<00:05:30.970> of<00:05:31.030> the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
that comes off I cut them out of the

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.740 
that comes off I cut them out of the
Splane<00:05:31.450> there<00:05:31.690> just<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.380> show<00:05:32.440> you<00:05:33.600> one<00:05:34.600> of<00:05:34.630> the

Splane there just to show you one of the

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.030 
Splane there just to show you one of the
common<00:05:35.050> problems<00:05:35.080> if<00:05:35.560> you're<00:05:35.680> having<00:05:35.890> a

common problems if you're having a

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.220 
common problems if you're having a
rattling<00:05:36.460> noise<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.880> that<00:05:37.540> these<00:05:37.720> pinion

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:38.230 
rattling noise is that these pinion

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:42.659 
rattling noise is that these pinion
bearings<00:05:38.710> can<00:05:39.010> go<00:05:39.130> bad<00:05:39.870> or<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.800> collar<00:05:42.340> race

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
bearings can go bad or this collar race

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.440 
bearings can go bad or this collar race
can<00:05:43.660> be<00:05:43.690> will<00:05:43.990> excessively<00:05:44.590> worn<00:05:45.150> mines<00:05:46.150> seem

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
can be will excessively worn mines seem

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.870 
can be will excessively worn mines seem
to<00:05:46.540> be<00:05:46.630> just<00:05:46.840> fine<00:05:47.280> they<00:05:48.280> roll<00:05:48.460> good<00:05:48.669> so<00:05:48.820> I'm

going<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.060> clean<00:05:49.240> on<00:05:49.390> put<00:05:49.570> them<00:05:49.630> back<00:05:49.780> and<00:05:50.020> not

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
going to clean on put them back and not

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.050 
going to clean on put them back and not
replace<00:05:50.440> them<00:05:50.680> so<00:05:51.400> anyhow<00:05:51.669> that's<00:05:51.760> what<00:05:51.970> you

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.350 
replace them so anyhow that's what you
want<00:05:52.240> to<00:05:52.330> check<00:05:52.510> for<00:05:52.780> these<00:05:54.090> according<00:05:55.090> to<00:05:55.240> the
