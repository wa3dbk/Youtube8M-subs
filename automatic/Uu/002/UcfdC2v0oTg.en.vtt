00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.919
 and we have like these holy writers 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.720
 welcome to a video more with mystery 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.820
 of grand theft auto 5 and now I'm going to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.599
 show what I found in this sector 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.339
 map that surprised me and 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.039
 I'm going to say it's a ghost one 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.109
 appearance in grand theft auto 5 good 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.990
 from the map good the way that a little 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.369
 far that about this side I hope that 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.180
 be as a reference on the map not 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.670
 It is completely covered 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.369
 you have to go up and the 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.920
 matter is that at eleven o'clock at night 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.680
 a ghost appears on this side almost 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.340
 Looking at the lighthouse is always eleven 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.610
 at eleven according to your cell phone clock 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.800
 is good 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.920
 if you notice that an appearance 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.160
 something that is like floating kind of like 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.160
 ring 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.070
 and the truth is that this ghost is 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 an hour on this side of the cliff 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.340
 exactly one hour every day or 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.790
 soul now the oil that you have to 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.330
 when you approach as you are going to see 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.150
 disappears 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.460
 but no doubt about more than what 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 really is 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.690
 as mysterious and chilling 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.550
 to say it that way is that where it is it appears 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.810
 she says says 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.810
 I today here 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.320
 it is common 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:33.970
 jack jack but later because it 's me 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.500
 when you are far enough away 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 come back to look like if you're inside the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.650
 hour 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.240
 I will appear and if you do the operation 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.679
 you go in and you come out you go disappear 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.649
 but at a distance or so 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.950
 moderate reappears until or less 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.640
 until the clock is already as the 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 two is like here 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.960
 and here in two minutes 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.290
 and disappears 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.390
 and you when returning 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.240
 everything disappears until what is the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.520
 blood 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.040

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.040
 but 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.660
 Here in the search cell is 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.610
 they wait for me to say as I then put 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:26.740
 the seeker of the word I 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:30.270
 but nothing appeared since it was me 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.420
 in the common search engine like google 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:37.600

 when you look for you are looking to follow 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.280
 looking and said this page that says 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.030
 but here there was nothing but looking 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.600
 here where the characters say 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.990
 there is a banner that says blood to 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.670
 rocks 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.990

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.840
 that there is a piece of journal and it 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.390
 tragedy of the cliffs and if they can read 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.040
 well I do not know says it's about a young 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.000
 husband 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.330
 that I live yesterday already in 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 when he supposed that I from the cliff 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.540

 san andreas to be famous then 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.010
 this part of all the evidence that 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.110
 we found out that jack really 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.120
 murdered his wife here on the cliff 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.250
 because I wanted her in paragraph 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.799
 I did not want to leave not want to leave 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.750
 with him to san andreas to make a kilo 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.819
 her husband's dream and this is simply 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.379
 the killer according to what I can 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.239
 predict here so it's very interesting 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.519
 to arrest put these things all 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.640
 district in this in this game that 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.870
 there's really a lot and I'm going to try 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.010
 look for everything so if this leaves your 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.360
