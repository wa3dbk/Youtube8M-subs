00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
and i'm going to show you how to make a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.230 
and i'm going to show you how to make a
doorbell<00:00:06.240> in<00:00:06.420> your<00:00:06.569> home<00:00:06.720> this<00:00:07.680> isn't

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
doorbell in your home this isn't

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.950 
doorbell in your home this isn't
necessarily<00:00:09.240> an<00:00:09.780> aesthetic<00:00:11.719> decoration<00:00:12.719> but

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
necessarily an aesthetic decoration but

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.320 
necessarily an aesthetic decoration but
it<00:00:13.049> is<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> decoration<00:00:14.000> nonetheless<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:17.330> let's

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
it is a decoration nonetheless and let's

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.060 
it is a decoration nonetheless and let's
give<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> demonstration<00:00:18.779> first<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:24.949> and<00:00:25.949> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
give a demonstration first so and I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.609 
give a demonstration first so and I
added<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.340> little<00:00:26.400> jazz<00:00:27.269> down<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:28.410> i

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
added a little jazz down there because i

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
added a little jazz down there because i
accidentally<00:00:29.550> put<00:00:29.820> one<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.330> off<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
accidentally put one of them off the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.440 
accidentally put one of them off the
pitch<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.080> think<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.769> guy<00:00:32.040> right<00:00:32.250> here

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
pitch I think it's this guy right here

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.709 
pitch I think it's this guy right here
he's<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> culprit<00:00:33.980> but<00:00:35.270> i'll<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
he's the culprit but i'll just show you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.880 
he's the culprit but i'll just show you
if<00:00:36.840> i<00:00:36.989> watch<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:38.940> just<00:00:39.329> put<00:00:39.770> bit<00:00:40.770> of

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
if i watch this so I just put bit of

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.709 
if i watch this so I just put bit of
redstone<00:00:41.190> right<00:00:41.579> below<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.450> power

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
redstone right below because this power

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
redstone right below because this power
is<00:00:42.960> block<00:00:43.290> next<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:45.410> then<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.820> reversed

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is block next to it and then I reversed

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.600 
is block next to it and then I reversed
the<00:00:48.210> signal<00:00:50.660> because<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:52.230> would<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.219> reverse

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the signal because I would then reverse

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.870 
the signal because I would then reverse
it<00:00:53.820> again<00:00:54.620> leading<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.250> here<00:00:56.520> so

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:01.880 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.270 

there's<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:03.940> torch<00:01:05.230> right<00:01:06.370> here<00:01:07.370> it's<00:01:08.330> now<00:01:08.570> a

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
there's a torch right here it's now a

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.540 
there's a torch right here it's now a
big<00:01:10.280> no<00:01:10.460> leading<00:01:10.820> up<00:01:11.000> to<00:01:11.270> this<00:01:11.450> is<00:01:11.750> on<00:01:12.260> so<00:01:13.250> I<00:01:13.280> put

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
big no leading up to this is on so I put

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.640 
big no leading up to this is on so I put
that<00:01:13.700> there<00:01:13.910> this<00:01:14.300> powers<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.870> block<00:01:15.110> above

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
that there this powers the block above

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.870 
that there this powers the block above
and<00:01:17.260> well<00:01:18.260> done<00:01:18.500> powers<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.340> block<00:01:19.550> above

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
and well done powers of the block above

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.900 
and well done powers of the block above
because<00:01:20.090> it<00:01:20.300> reverses<00:01:20.720> birth<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.760> so<00:01:22.760> now

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
because it reverses birth and so now

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.670 
because it reverses birth and so now
this<00:01:23.060> is<00:01:23.210> unpowered<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.990> when<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:24.230> hate<00:01:24.500> this

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
this is unpowered and when I hate this

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:38.440 
this is unpowered and when I hate this
way<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:31.400> slides<00:01:31.700> up<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.390> song<00:01:35.600> toys<00:01:37.450> yay

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
and um making the I guess you're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.560 
and um making the I guess you're
wondering<00:01:45.710> what<00:01:45.860> this<00:01:45.920> dirty<00:01:46.490> is<00:01:46.640> here<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.180> so

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
wondering what this dirty is here for so

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.109 
wondering what this dirty is here for so
note<00:01:48.320> blocks<00:01:48.710> which<00:01:49.130> started<00:01:49.520> used<00:01:49.729> for<00:01:49.970> this

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
note blocks which started used for this

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.410 
note blocks which started used for this
I<00:01:50.360> need<00:01:51.200> one<00:01:51.710> block<00:01:52.100> above<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.700> breathing<00:01:53.270> room

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
I need one block above a breathing room

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.499 
I need one block above a breathing room
but<00:01:53.750> that's<00:01:53.960> what<00:01:54.259> you<00:01:54.380> could<00:01:54.560> put<00:01:54.740> them<00:01:55.509> like

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
but that's what you could put them like

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.719 
but that's what you could put them like
20<00:01:56.990> blocks<00:01:57.229> below<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:57.950> you<00:01:58.310> could<00:01:58.490> still

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
20 blocks below you and you could still

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.060 
20 blocks below you and you could still
hear<00:01:58.910> them<00:01:59.090> because<00:01:59.479> you<00:01:59.630> can<00:01:59.810> hear<00:02:00.020> them<00:02:00.170> from

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
hear them because you can hear them from

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.359 
hear them because you can hear them from
about<00:02:01.670> 40<00:02:02.330> blocks<00:02:02.660> away<00:02:03.170> no<00:02:03.530> matter<00:02:03.740> what<00:02:04.100> is

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
about 40 blocks away no matter what is

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.240 
about 40 blocks away no matter what is
between<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:06.050> think<00:02:06.740> that's<00:02:07.039> pretty

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
between you so I think that's pretty

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.220 
between you so I think that's pretty
cool<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.770> regarding<00:02:09.770> I<00:02:12.490> hired<00:02:13.490> this<00:02:14.230> it's

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
cool and regarding I hired this it's

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.870 
cool and regarding I hired this it's
basically<00:02:15.680> in<00:02:16.160> these<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.450> guess<00:02:18.730> it's<00:02:19.730> in

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
basically in these I guess it's in

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.280 
basically in these I guess it's in
series<00:02:20.240> I<00:02:20.360> guess<00:02:20.569> so<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.870> just<00:02:21.050> goes<00:02:21.230> through

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
series I guess so it just goes through

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.770 
series I guess so it just goes through
each<00:02:22.100> of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.430> note<00:02:22.640> box<00:02:22.910> individually<00:02:23.660> and

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
each of the note box individually and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.280 
each of the note box individually and
has<00:02:23.960> repeaters<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:24.470> between<00:02:24.950> them<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.290> these

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
has repeaters in between them and these

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.570 
has repeaters in between them and these
settings<00:02:27.830> next<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> each<00:02:28.550> of<00:02:28.819> the<00:02:30.250> note<00:02:31.250> blocks

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
settings next to each of the note blocks

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.470 
settings next to each of the note blocks
are<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.690> number<00:02:33.020> of<00:02:33.230> right<00:02:33.560> clicks<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.250> need

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
are the number of right clicks you need

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.120 
are the number of right clicks you need
to<00:02:35.620> already<00:02:36.620> had<00:02:36.920> it<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:38.560> create<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.709> certain

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
to already had it to create that certain

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.280 
to already had it to create that certain

G a G B C ok yeah that's what it is and

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.440 
G a G B C ok yeah that's what it is and
c<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.109> six<00:02:55.680> right<00:02:56.250> clicks<00:02:56.549> be<00:02:57.269> is<00:02:57.480> 5<00:02:58.790> g<00:02:59.790> is<00:03:00.030> one

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
c is six right clicks be is 5 g is one

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.640 
c is six right clicks be is 5 g is one
and<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:02.040> is<00:03:02.609> three<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.720> i<00:03:03.750> guess<00:03:04.109> if<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.379> wanted

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
and a is three so i guess if you wanted

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.420 
and a is three so i guess if you wanted
to<00:03:04.769> make<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.819> certain<00:03:08.389> set<00:03:09.389> up<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:10.430> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
to make this certain set up you can you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.339 
to make this certain set up you can you
could<00:03:11.579> do<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:13.500> repeaters<00:03:15.349> that

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
could do that the repeaters that

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.649 
could do that the repeaters that
determine<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.670> spacing<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.269> between<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
determine the spacing in between the

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.330 
determine the spacing in between the
notes<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.349> sort<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> have<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.950> play<00:03:20.159> with

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
notes you just sort of have to play with

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:28.179 
notes you just sort of have to play with
because<00:03:22.310> not<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:23.340> songs<00:03:24.019> that<00:03:25.019> we<00:03:25.139> know<00:03:25.379> are

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.429 

playing<00:03:29.189> straight<00:03:29.669> notes<00:03:30.269> though<00:03:30.629> often<00:03:31.200> play

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
playing straight notes though often play

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.979 
playing straight notes though often play
them<00:03:31.650> swung<00:03:32.159> you'll<00:03:33.000> know<00:03:33.209> about<00:03:33.510> that<00:03:33.720> if<00:03:33.870> you

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
them swung you'll know about that if you

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.580 
them swung you'll know about that if you
play<00:03:34.290> jazz<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.760> basically<00:03:36.180> have<00:03:36.659> to<00:03:36.959> do<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
play jazz so you basically have to do it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.280 
play jazz so you basically have to do it
by<00:03:37.799> ear<00:03:37.980> there's<00:03:38.220> no<00:03:38.430> certain<00:03:38.849> formula<00:03:39.659> if<00:03:39.870> you

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
by ear there's no certain formula if you

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.649 
by ear there's no certain formula if you
put<00:03:40.799> different<00:03:41.280> blocks<00:03:41.579> underground<00:03:42.389> shoot

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
put different blocks underground shoot

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:48.699 
put different blocks underground shoot
if<00:03:43.290> you<00:03:43.409> put<00:03:43.620> different<00:03:44.250> blocks<00:03:44.519> underneath

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:57.480 

it'll<00:03:49.709> change<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.159> sound

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.480 

if<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:57.880> could<00:03:58.060> do<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.300> at<00:03:58.660> all

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
if you could do that at all

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.150 
if you could do that at all
all<00:03:59.580> of<00:03:59.730> them<00:03:59.880> knows<00:04:00.090> the<00:04:00.210> place

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.470 

I<00:04:06.520> made<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.480> in<00:04:07.600> series<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.350> could<00:04:08.860> use<00:04:09.480> a

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
I made it in series but you could use a

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.010 
I made it in series but you could use a
pulse<00:04:11.170> circuit<00:04:11.770> like<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.130> have<00:04:12.340> here<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:13.020> just

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:14.020 
pulse circuit like I have here I just

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.690 
pulse circuit like I have here I just
didn't<00:04:14.350> want<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:14.710> it<00:04:14.860> because<00:04:14.980> I'm<00:04:15.340> not

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
didn't want to do it because I'm not

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.509 
didn't want to do it because I'm not
really<00:04:16.000> good<00:04:16.269> with<00:04:16.330> redstone<00:04:16.810> so<00:04:17.380> if<00:04:18.340> you

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
really good with redstone so if you

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.180 
really good with redstone so if you
figure<00:04:18.850> that<00:04:19.000> out<00:04:19.060> kudos<00:04:19.750> do<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.440> think

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
figure that out kudos do you think

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:31.870 
figure that out kudos do you think
that's<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:22.890> see<00:04:23.890> you<00:04:23.950> guys<00:04:24.070> later

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.940 

you
