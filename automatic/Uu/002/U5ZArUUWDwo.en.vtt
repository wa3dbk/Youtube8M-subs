strength of it definitely up front the
front<00:00:13.679> rows<00:00:13.980> may<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.490> huge<00:00:15.269> task<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.750> think

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
front rows may be a huge task I think

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.580 
front rows may be a huge task I think
getting<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.350> top<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.619> them<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.420> scrums<00:00:18.590> but

at first birth to Swansea and I got back
involved<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.980> three<00:00:55.250> years<00:00:55.280> ago<00:00:55.810> helping<00:00:56.810> up

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
involved so three years ago helping up

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.720 
involved so three years ago helping up
with<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.200> defense<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:57.920> Alaska<00:00:58.400> players<00:00:58.640> have

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
with the defense and Alaska players have

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.760 
with the defense and Alaska players have
been<00:00:58.790> helping<00:00:59.090> out<00:00:59.180> with<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> backs<00:01:00.440> of<00:01:00.680> the

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
been helping out with the backs of the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.790 
been helping out with the backs of the
culture

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
culture

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.889 
culture
and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.460> think<00:01:02.700> it's<00:01:02.969> been<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.300> one<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.540> it<00:01:03.780> was

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
and I think it's been out one of it was

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.390 
and I think it's been out one of it was
probably<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.500> best<00:01:04.739> season<00:01:05.129> I've<00:01:05.250> been

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
probably the best season I've been

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
probably the best season I've been
involved<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> rugby<00:01:06.630> club<00:01:06.900> with

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
involved with with the rugby club with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.740 
involved with with the rugby club with
my<00:01:07.110> cell<00:01:07.290> 10<00:01:07.530> years<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.180> people<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
my cell 10 years or so people because we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
my cell 10 years or so people because we
finished<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.140> highest<00:01:10.440> ever<00:01:11.040> enough<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
finished the highest ever enough the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.430 
finished the highest ever enough the
Premier<00:01:12.090> League<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.869> beating<00:01:13.110> Eureka

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
Premier League I think beating Eureka

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.609 
Premier League I think beating Eureka
way<00:01:13.650> he<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> good<00:01:14.550> highlight<00:01:15.440> we're<00:01:16.440> in<00:01:16.560> a

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
way he was a good highlight we're in a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.080 
way he was a good highlight we're in a
lot<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.860> our<00:01:16.950> home<00:01:17.130> games<00:01:17.369> has<00:01:17.550> been<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:17.940> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
lot of our home games has been good as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.420 
lot of our home games has been good as
well<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.509> think<00:01:19.229> nuoc<00:01:19.619> away<00:01:19.830> was<00:01:20.040> probably<00:01:20.280> one

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
well I think nuoc away was probably one

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.460 
well I think nuoc away was probably one
of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> highlights<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.060> me<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:22.020> colony

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
of the highlights for me the colony

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
of the highlights for me the colony
before<00:01:22.650> swing<00:01:23.070> either<00:01:23.190> I<00:01:23.580> probably<00:01:24.000> bristol<00:01:24.600> w

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
before swing either I probably bristol w

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
before swing either I probably bristol w
as<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> 20-odd<00:01:26.850> nailed<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.240> at

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
as well so 20-odd nailed down at

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.609
