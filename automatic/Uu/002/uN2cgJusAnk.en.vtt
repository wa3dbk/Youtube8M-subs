00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.350
 in stock update of the ipod line certainly the most product 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.480
 discussed was the new ipod nano 6g much smaller than the previous one 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.419
 model which leaves the wind buttons 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.490
 in favor of a multi-touch display the new graphic interface resumes 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:23.019
 very closely to ios so much so that in reality it looks like a portion fasts the 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.759
 flip through one, 5 inch displays to a square form factor 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.810
 therefore announcements go 4 icons with two columns two rows 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.750
 and ds perfusionist screen however are the classic fineco ones therefore 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.780
 mainly intended for music 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.320
 and and even within the minute network that the effect is very similar to that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.460
 of not device 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.520
 contacts 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.720
 as you advance the screens scroll 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.800
 towards the left precio will be enough to bring them to the right perry go back 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.040
 the overall size of the new ipod nano is certainly very small 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.010
 however anagni buttons are designed for the fingers and therefore in any case the use 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 it's pretty simple even for those with big hands 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.600
 another method to easily make to the main screen is to hold 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.720
 Press your finger on any part of the screen with this apple model 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.690
 in a way, it makes the ipod nano take a step backwards 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.290
 emule brings it closer its musical essence, so it seems 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.250
 plus a shampoo at the moment 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.110
 that the old ipod nano which in fact also had a room and some 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.640
 features regarding video distraction 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.860
 and video playback 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.710
 this function disappear into the. it 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.390
 maps remain some other typical features like the radio 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.909
 which clearly works only with connected headphones 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.390
 and call rds so it can read the names in the stations 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.520
 also the possibility to automatically search for all crisis stations 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.080
 they manage to take in our area 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.719
 possibly the chance to go hahaha 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.719
 to create a list of favorites 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.080
 you can also pause the playback of a station line 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.880
 radio and this that automatically a recording that then allows us to per 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.939
 start listening again 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.640
 delayed but without losing anything 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.219
 for the transmission that we previously paused 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.319
 knowing that this model cannot play video I tried to load 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.449
 a video of our podcast my first mac 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.039
 for this it is typically reproduced in the sense that the audio can be 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.409
 quietly listen while I envy you is replaced by one 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.869
 screen still then a static image but there are all the functions 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.799
 classics of the reduction of the caste pops and also the complete description 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.959
 however the square format would not have been 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.579
 the optimal earth the reproduction of videos and perhaps also for this reason it was 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.510
 eliminated this possibility 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.890
 and also for the images that can be downloaded on the nano instead 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.269
 the result is not great 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.040
 and that in any case there is a lot of space left on the right side below the second of the 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.909
 cutting of photography 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.489
 besides another particular thing that perhaps earth the small dimensions of the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.179
 screen 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:20.599
 was not introduced 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.120
 the functionality many traces of the pitch to zoom therefore remains as unique 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.659
 multitrack functionality of the screen rotation 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.649
 there is only one zoom level available and it is obtained with a double cut 

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:36.309
 the possibility remains to easily create a photo slideshow 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:38.469
 by pressing the button 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.769
 hey iberia musical world does not come automatically chased therefore not 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.919
 we selected is preventively 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:47.230
 very nice automatic mf token mars 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.710
 antalya, however, the images are always conspicuous because of the 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.629
 transformer 4 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.329
 in addition to radio podcast images set all related functions 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.509
 to music 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.779
 we finally have also 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:05.310
 the fitnesse icon that now takes us inside a pedometer that 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.369
 it would basically be a pedometer 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.700
 and this works with the accelerometer of which 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.560
 this ipod is therefore equipped with an addition compared to the past 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.549
 finally there is the clock function 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.120
 with this aspect, every analogical type that has made many think of brings together the 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.979
 watch it 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:29.219
 eh there is also the stopwatch and the timer is missing the alarm for glasses not mind 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.939
 having 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.959
 a speaker would have been useless 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.300
 throughout the new ipod line 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.490
 apple auto the bad idea in my opinion to insert earphones normans without 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:45.810
 microphone controls the nano is no exception but instead tries to insert 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.919
 the earpiece with a microphone at the bottom of ehm shows that one appears 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.270
 new icon it is the voice memos that work exactly like 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.629
 on the other 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:00.110
 while wearing nicholas sparks earphones 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.219
 on a structural level this new ipod nano e 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:08.949
 really excellent and very very light about 20 grams yet it appears 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:10.279
 it really exists 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:12.850
 the only physical buttons are 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:17.230
 22 volume keys, which also here very closely recall the 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.689
 ios device graphics 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.699
 pen and then the power off button 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:27.360
 the painting is also very very resistant, the well appears to be well constructed 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.499
 Display rotation is the only refusion in hunting areas 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.139
 the effects the device also an accelerometer so it would have been 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.979
 You can make it rotate automatically however having been 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.680
 designed as a wearable device 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.030
 this feature was not inserted because it would have created 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.340
 more problems than anything else 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.729
 and in this way it can be delayed at will 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.080
 as I have already said this new ipod nano is particularly close to 1 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.789
 chaffeur both for its very compact dimensions -enter earth its classic 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:05:58.730
 many 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.259
 ie on the back 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:03.680
 however, it adds many more controls to the greater capacity 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.169
 and in any case other functions such as the radiolabel nietzsche 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.790
 in some ways this new ipod returns to its origins 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:15.180
 it is purely musical as all of you going forward would expect time to 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.599
 functions rather than a loss 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:22.470
 emu however I understand that some ways the choice of apple since 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.150
 decent ipod nano 5g was 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.590
 to also full of possibilities and also with the sea-oak capacity of 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.419
 record midi anthropology is the reproduction of the same 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.360
 m currently add more possibilities that dwarf 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.060
 it would have led to an invitation for Pontaccio pads which, however, without it 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.860
 car really 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.189
 pop sense for this reason I think it is tried to radicalize them 

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:50.550
 difference wanting to give an abortion or to the new ipod nano 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.490
 sisi without considering the price I would say 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.600
 a 4 star half because all in all really well built terracotta 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.780
 functional lawn with beautiful in short 

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.270
 a product that is worth 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:06.289
 however going instead to touch the costs 169 euros required for the version from 8 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:07.100
 giga byte 

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.240
 they really think that it may be better to add only 70 euros for 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.050
 pass high accept that offers a range of possibilities really on another 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.719
 planet 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.259
 and this is the reason why reluctantly I can't dream more than 3 

00:07:20.259 --> 00:07:21.319
 star price 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:24.529
 however, I invite you to read the full review on block where I have 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:28.379
 could better investigate some of the high product features 

00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:30.659
 considerations in the 

00:07:30.659 --> 00:07:31.639
 See you soon 

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.259
 season
