00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 he got to his camp

 the royal family of the Pharaohs she is very 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.270
 good at magic and i think it and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 quality is very useful to us in the search 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.440
 new hybrid 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.719
 the goddess of chaos won the hunter artifact 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 I was really surprised, especially since 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.960
 the choice was already made so I could 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.360
 just utter 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:07.090
 Well, you girls give den hybrids 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.909

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 mixes day and night good and evil 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.950
 the guiding will help us to get there 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.229
 star osirisa which i can call with 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.390
 using spells, that's just the way there 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.060
 they are close and we need transportation 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.430
 naturally fitting to the royal ladies 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.530
 to get there 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.900
 Hunter although not possessed magic but 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.549
 got on well with nature and knew how 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.460
 talking animals and birds 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.250
 so it was for him 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.149
 it's easier than that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 whistle 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.530
 as the sky rustled something and already through 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.289
 moment next to her 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.140
 landed a huge triphon are you satisfied 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:52.470
 your majesty with a little mockery 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.210
 asked the hunter about you leshi girls code 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.819
 in one voice 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.340
 Claudine exhaled and sticking for several days 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.000
 hunter claudine and cleo spent astride 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.600
 griffin 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 and I think the guiding star of osrisa legs 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.140
 the land of the city and the people had to see 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.900
 many adventures and hurricanes they had 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.569
 survive but it all just brought together 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.910
 carpenters and they confidently approached 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:26.610
 the cherished goal on the edge of the earth the ocean fell 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.410
 waterfall nowhere and further beyond the abyss 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.080
 and the shred was empty 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.280
 lands with huge scary gates in 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.050
 lilac mist but we got 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.380
 whispered cleo breaking into grave 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.910
 silence only occasionally break from strokes 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.010
 huge wings griffin 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.010
 the gates were unlocked and no three entered 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.440
 in them and fell into the abyss of these 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.290
 moments of free fall seemed 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.360
 for them forever and they said goodbye 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.480
 lives but not cool 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.460
 she managed to cast a spell not 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.760
 hung above the surface just in 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:08.640
 I have a few inches from it 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.860
 the heart did not jump out the hearts exclaimed 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.590
 Claudine you could not warn in advance 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.050
 if i knew i wouldn't 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.770
 would warn it was so cool 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.770
 friend
