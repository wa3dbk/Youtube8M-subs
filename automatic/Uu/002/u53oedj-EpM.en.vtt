00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.009
 the rarest animals in the world that do not 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:24.040
 you knew they existed are ready good 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.720
 first of all we have to the sil that this 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.359
 beautiful and amazing bird that is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.180
 too soft and especially fluffy 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.640
 the chip that have a plumage with the 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.160
 texture of silk if that does not seem like 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.680
 rare we can add that your skin and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.199
 bones are black the lobes of their 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.690
 blue ears unlike chickens 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.629
 common with four fingers on each leg 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.989
 the Incas have five fingers in each 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.989
 paw 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.030
 but do not be surprised because in 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.359
 second position we have the galio piteco 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.219
 also known as the flying lemur 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:04.399
 although ironically neither is it from moore nor 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.399
 fly goes from tree to tree gliding 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.130
 and jumping an expert climber but 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.229
 incompetent in the soil that inhabits 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.610
 southeastern asia indonesia thailand 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 malaysia and singapore 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.950
 in position number 3 we have the doll in 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.229
 this beautiful wild dog that looks like a 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.020
 fox but really it's just a dog 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.180
 wild of india they live in big 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.640
 clans but they are divided into groups for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.159
 hunting are so brave that they attack until 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.299
 large and dangerous animals like 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.299
 boars 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.520
 water buffalo and even tigers but 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.409
 before the human they become helpless and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.780
 fearful 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.939
 but if you think you've seen everything 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.729
 you are very wrong since also 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.579
 we have the raccoon dog good in 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.500
 reality seems more map boy dog 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.170
 but they have no relationship with the 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.179
 Raccoon is classified as a canid 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.179
 unique and they are very good climbers 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.210
 but talking about climbing trees and nobody 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.399
 the flat-nosed monkey wins its tail 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.370
 It can be longer than the length of 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.920
 his whole body and his nose is so short 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.790
 that it seems that only had the graves 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.769
 nasal exposed good friends these are 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.560
