00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
to switch it to my right so what I do is

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.480 
to switch it to my right so what I do is
I<00:02:32.250> jam<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.910> shaft<00:02:33.240> into<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.230> snow<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.710> ice<00:02:34.860> so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
I jam the shaft into the snow and ice so

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.220 
I jam the shaft into the snow and ice so
that<00:02:35.520> my<00:02:35.730> axe<00:02:35.910> has<00:02:36.120> held<00:02:36.330> firm<00:02:36.570> by<00:02:36.810> this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that my axe has held firm by this

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.850 
that my axe has held firm by this
and<00:02:37.800> what<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:37.980> can<00:02:38.190> do<00:02:38.340> is<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.150> can<00:02:39.210> loop<00:02:39.660> or<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.680> can

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
and what I can do is I can loop or I can

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.160 
and what I can do is I can loop or I can
hook<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.130> loop<00:02:41.610> around<00:02:41.970> my<00:02:42.330> ass

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
hook that loop around my ass

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.070 
hook that loop around my ass
pull<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.400> my<00:02:44.640> hand<00:02:44.880> comes<00:02:45.120> free<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.690> that's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
pull and my hand comes free and that's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.570 
pull and my hand comes free and that's
very<00:02:46.410> important<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:46.950> when<00:02:47.340> you're<00:02:47.430> up

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
very important because when you're up

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.160 
very important because when you're up
there<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:47.850> it's<00:02:48.090> really<00:02:48.480> cold<00:02:48.690> you've<00:02:49.020> got

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
there and it's really cold you've got

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
there and it's really cold you've got
high<00:02:49.350> high<00:02:49.560> winds<00:02:49.860> you're<00:02:50.490> gonna<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.790> wearing

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
high high winds you're gonna be wearing

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.600 
high high winds you're gonna be wearing
you<00:02:51.750> know<00:02:51.780> very<00:02:52.230> thick<00:02:52.560> knits<00:02:52.860> very<00:02:53.310> thick

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you know very thick knits very thick

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.280 
you know very thick knits very thick

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
able to manipulate something like this

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.510 
able to manipulate something like this
type<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.390> Slipknot<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.130> can<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.370> it

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
type of Slipknot so you can do it

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.160 
type of Slipknot so you can do it
one-handed<00:03:00.060> that's<00:03:00.420> another<00:03:00.630> important

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
one-handed that's another important

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.770 
one-handed that's another important
thing<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.920> your<00:03:02.250> axe<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.670> jammed<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.180> you

thing that your axe is jammed in you

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.960 
thing that your axe is jammed in you
just<00:03:03.989> reach<00:03:04.170> over<00:03:04.410> hook<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.610> your<00:03:05.760> hand

your other hands you put that through

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.190 
your other hands you put that through
the<00:03:10.410> loop<00:03:10.550> your<00:03:11.550> tongue<00:03:11.760> firmly<00:03:12.090> and<00:03:12.480> you've

so<00:03:17.190> very<00:03:18.120> useful<00:03:18.239> features<00:03:18.989> having<00:03:19.769> this<00:03:19.920> loop

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
so very useful features having this loop

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.900 
so very useful features having this loop
here

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
here

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.790 
here
another<00:03:21.450> important<00:03:22.140> thing<00:03:22.170> with<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.470> loop<00:03:22.650> is

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
another important thing with the loop is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.160 
another important thing with the loop is
that<00:03:22.830> it's<00:03:23.070> not<00:03:23.250> metal<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.300> if<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.540> had<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that it's not metal so if you had to you

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.050 
that it's not metal so if you had to you
could<00:03:25.350> grab<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.650> with<00:03:25.920> your<00:03:25.950> teeth<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.940> don't

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
could grab it with your teeth you don't

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.940 
could grab it with your teeth you don't
have<00:03:27.209> to<00:03:27.300> worry<00:03:27.480> about<00:03:27.630> you<00:03:28.290> know<00:03:28.320> freezing

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
have to worry about you know freezing

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.590 
have to worry about you know freezing
your<00:03:29.100> lips<00:03:29.340> or<00:03:29.640> actually<00:03:30.120> having<00:03:30.269> your<00:03:30.360> lip

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
your lips or actually having your lip

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.259 
your lips or actually having your lip
stick<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:31.019> it<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.350> it's<00:03:31.530> not<00:03:31.680> metal<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.269> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
stick to it because it's not metal and I

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.150 
stick to it because it's not metal and I
imagine<00:03:34.110> that's<00:03:34.200> probably<00:03:34.320> happened<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.040> at

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
imagine that's probably happened to at

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.620 
imagine that's probably happened to at
least<00:03:35.310> one<00:03:35.489> person<00:03:35.970> that's<00:03:36.120> probably<00:03:36.450> why

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
least one person that's probably why

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.270 
least one person that's probably why
Black<00:03:36.870> Diamond<00:03:37.110> made<00:03:37.800> it<00:03:37.950> at<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.070> wedding

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
Black Diamond made it at a wedding

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.289 
Black Diamond made it at a wedding
another<00:03:39.209> nice<00:03:39.420> feature<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.800> it's<00:03:41.760> got<00:03:42.239> a

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
another nice feature is that it's got a

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.050 
another nice feature is that it's got a
webbing<00:03:43.019> attachment<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:44.040> not<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.519> carabiner

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
webbing attachment it's not a carabiner

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.090 
webbing attachment it's not a carabiner
so<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.510> not<00:03:45.630> metal<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.680> don't<00:03:46.890> have<00:03:47.010> to

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
so it's not metal you don't have to

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.890 
so it's not metal you don't have to
worry<00:03:47.250> about<00:03:47.370> anything<00:03:47.700> damaging<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.780> head

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
worry about anything damaging the head
