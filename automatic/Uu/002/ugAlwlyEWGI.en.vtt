00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
on the mini-map it's usually brown but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.840 
on the mini-map it's usually brown but
depending<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:49.980> think<00:00:50.219> depending<00:00:50.550> on<00:00:50.670> what

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
depending on I think depending on what

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.130 
depending on I think depending on what
kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.149> city<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.809> might<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
kind of city you have it might be a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.200 
kind of city you have it might be a
different<00:00:52.469> color<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.520> default<00:00:53.699> city<00:00:54.090> is

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
different color but the default city is

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.619 
different color but the default city is
brown<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.910> let's<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.969> daily<00:00:57.149> Arkansas

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
brown and let's the daily Arkansas

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.209 
brown and let's the daily Arkansas
shouldn't<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.050> too<00:00:58.230> difficult<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.739> find<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
shouldn't be too difficult to find and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.709 
shouldn't be too difficult to find and
you<00:00:59.850> should<00:00:59.969> go<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.420> customization<00:01:00.840> bench

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
you should go to the customization bench

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.509 
you should go to the customization bench
so<00:01:03.719> there<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.650> I<00:01:04.680> already<00:01:04.979> have<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> weapon

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so there you go I already have a weapon

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
so there you go I already have a weapon
here<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:05.939> if<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.570> don't<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> weapon

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
here but if you don't have a weapon

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.750 
here but if you don't have a weapon
i'ma<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:09.470> move<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.650> weapon<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.520> maybe

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
i'ma just move this weapon here maybe

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.760 
i'ma just move this weapon here maybe
over<00:01:12.090> here<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.510> think<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.960> resets<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> there

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
over here I think that resets it there

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.410 
over here I think that resets it there
we<00:01:13.860> go<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:14.729> there's<00:01:14.970> no<00:01:15.150> weapon

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
we go so right now there's no weapon

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.969 
we go so right now there's no weapon
this<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.600> how<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.900> looks<00:01:16.110> when<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.409> click<00:01:16.860> on

this is how it looks when you click on

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.539 
this is how it looks when you click on
it<00:01:17.130> first

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
it first

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.969

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
then apply to the weapon but before that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
then apply to the weapon but before that
I<00:01:46.530> quickly<00:01:46.860> want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> go<00:01:47.340> over<00:01:47.670> these<00:01:47.820> spirit

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
doesn't it appear over here and why

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.030 
doesn't it appear over here and why
can't<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.820> apply<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.299> weapon<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.960> we<00:01:55.860> have

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
can't I apply to my weapon well we have

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.300 
can't I apply to my weapon well we have
to<00:01:56.159> check<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.549> power<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.299> your<00:01:57.810> weapon<00:01:58.310> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to check the power of your weapon so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
to check the power of your weapon so
right<00:01:59.549> now<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.939> sword<00:02:00.240> right<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.869> power

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
right now this sword right here is power

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.740 
right now this sword right here is power
20<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.070> that<00:02:02.100> means<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.000> apply<00:02:03.299> all

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
20 so that means that I can apply all

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.219 
20 so that means that I can apply all
the<00:02:04.469> spirit<00:02:04.860> stones<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:05.549> power<00:02:05.969> 10<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the spirit stones that are power 10 to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.089 
the spirit stones that are power 10 to
power<00:02:07.590> 20<00:02:08.690> but<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.989> power<00:02:10.229> 9<00:02:10.530> or<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:10.979> it's

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
power 20 but if it's power 9 or if it's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.650 
power 20 but if it's power 9 or if it's
powered<00:02:11.340> 25<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:12.060> cannot<00:02:12.390> apply<00:02:12.780> those

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
powered 25 I cannot apply those

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.630 
powered 25 I cannot apply those
so<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.990> can<00:02:14.200> only<00:02:14.440> apply<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.890> spirit<00:02:15.370> stones

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
so you can only apply the spirit stones

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.750 
so you can only apply the spirit stones
that<00:02:15.850> have<00:02:16.060> or<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.840> same<00:02:17.110> level<00:02:17.560> as<00:02:17.760> your

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that have or the same level as your

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.210 
that have or the same level as your
weapon<00:02:19.150> or<00:02:20.490> or<00:02:22.320> everything<00:02:23.320> under<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.740> until

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
weapon or or everything under that until

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.010 
weapon or or everything under that until
10:00<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:25.090> if<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.450> makes<00:02:25.660> a<00:02:25.780> little<00:02:25.930> bit

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
10:00 and if that makes a little bit

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.390 
10:00 and if that makes a little bit
sense<00:02:26.320> but<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:28.480> your<00:02:28.810> weapon<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.620> level<00:02:29.950> 20<00:02:30.250> or

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
sense but if your weapon is level 20 or

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.830 
sense but if your weapon is level 20 or
power<00:02:30.790> level<00:02:31.150> 20<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:34.240> just<00:02:34.270> do<00:02:34.510> minus

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
power level 20 you can you just do minus

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.930 
power level 20 you can you just do minus
10<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.710> case<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.160> 10<00:02:36.370> power<00:02:36.700> level

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
10 so in that case it's 10 power level

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.150 
10 so in that case it's 10 power level
10<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.780> then<00:02:37.990> all<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.590> spirit<00:02:38.920> stones

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
10 and so then all the spirit stones

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.890 
10 and so then all the spirit stones
from<00:02:39.280> power<00:02:39.550> level<00:02:39.820> 10<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.150> power<00:02:40.360> level<00:02:40.630> 20

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
from power level 10 to power level 20

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660 
from power level 10 to power level 20
you<00:02:41.020> can<00:02:41.170> apply<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> your<00:02:41.590> weapon<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.130> all<00:02:42.400> the

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
you can apply to your weapon and all the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.370 
you can apply to your weapon and all the
stuff<00:02:42.910> that<00:02:42.940> is<00:02:43.300> not<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.720> between<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.200> you

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
stuff that is not in between that you

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.180 
stuff that is not in between that you
cannot<00:02:44.680> apply

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
cannot apply

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.810 
cannot apply
so<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.320> recap<00:02:47.560> here<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.130> have<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.460> bunch<00:02:48.700> of

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
so just to recap here I have a bunch of

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.310 
so just to recap here I have a bunch of
spirit<00:02:49.180> stones<00:02:49.450> as<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.690> can<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:49.960> I<00:02:49.990> cannot

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
spirit stones as you can see I cannot

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470 
spirit stones as you can see I cannot
apply<00:02:50.710> these<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.130> my<00:02:51.250> swords<00:02:51.550> because<00:02:51.970> some<00:02:52.450> of

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
apply these to my swords because some of

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.420 
apply these to my swords because some of
these<00:02:52.690> at<00:02:52.900> least<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.650> one<00:02:53.860> for<00:02:54.040> example<00:02:54.130> is

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
these at least this one for example is

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.160 
these at least this one for example is
level<00:02:54.640> 24<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:55.330> it's<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.510> little<00:02:55.630> bit<00:02:55.810> too<00:02:55.960> high

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
level 24 so it's a little bit too high

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.210 
level 24 so it's a little bit too high
this<00:02:57.010> one's<00:02:57.220> 6<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.610> 160<00:02:58.210> and<00:02:58.300> 6<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.660> 1<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.890> can't

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
this one's 6 to 160 and 6 to 1 you can't

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.210 
this one's 6 to 160 and 6 to 1 you can't
you<00:03:00.790> can<00:03:01.120> sorry<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.530> have<00:03:02.680> multiple

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
you can sorry if you have multiple

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.860 
you can sorry if you have multiple
spirit<00:03:03.730> stones<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.120> can<00:03:04.150> actually<00:03:04.450> upgrade

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
spirit stones you can actually upgrade

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.830 
spirit stones you can actually upgrade
one<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.650> for<00:03:05.830> example<00:03:06.190> here<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.760> have<00:03:07.060> 2<00:03:07.540> I

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
one so for example here I have 2 I

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.060 
one so for example here I have 2 I
spirits<00:03:08.770> level<00:03:09.160> power<00:03:09.730> 61<00:03:10.630> but<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.740> two<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
spirits level power 61 but I have two of

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:14.370 
spirits level power 61 but I have two of
them<00:03:12.220> so<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.910> means<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.270> can<00:03:13.450> convert<00:03:13.870> these

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
them so that means I can convert these

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.380 
them so that means I can convert these
two<00:03:14.710> into<00:03:15.610> one<00:03:15.960> of<00:03:16.960> a<00:03:17.170> higher<00:03:17.470> power<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.610> here<00:03:19.360> I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
two into one of a higher power so here I

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.050 
two into one of a higher power so here I
have<00:03:19.450> two<00:03:19.750> power<00:03:20.200> 61<00:03:20.740> if<00:03:20.890> I<00:03:20.980> right-click<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.520> it

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
have two power 61 if I right-click it it

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.470 
have two power 61 if I right-click it it
pops<00:03:22.360> up<00:03:22.570> over<00:03:22.690> here<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.230> now<00:03:24.100> it's<00:03:24.460> only<00:03:25.060> one

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
pops up over here and now it's only one

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.400 
pops up over here and now it's only one
of<00:03:25.630> them<00:03:25.750> but<00:03:26.110> its<00:03:26.230> power<00:03:26.410> 62<00:03:27.960> now<00:03:28.960> when<00:03:29.260> it's

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
of them but its power 62 now when it's

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.980 
of them but its power 62 now when it's
lower<00:03:29.620> levels<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.390> power<00:03:31.390> five<00:03:31.660> it's<00:03:31.930> going

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
lower levels like power five it's going

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.500 
lower levels like power five it's going
to<00:03:32.170> multiply<00:03:32.560> faster<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.330> higher

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
to multiply faster but if it's higher

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.110 
to multiply faster but if it's higher
level<00:03:34.870> it<00:03:35.080> only<00:03:35.290> multiplies<00:03:35.860> by<00:03:35.890> or<00:03:36.700> it<00:03:36.940> adds

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
level it only multiplies by or it adds

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.020 
level it only multiplies by or it adds
only<00:03:37.420> one<00:03:37.750> power<00:03:38.050> level<00:03:38.410> every<00:03:38.590> time<00:03:39.030> but

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
only one power level every time but

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.520 
only one power level every time but
that's<00:03:40.330> that<00:03:40.480> kind<00:03:40.690> of<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:41.050> give<00:03:41.200> you<00:03:41.290> guys<00:03:41.410> an

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
that's that kind of to give you guys an

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.110 
that's that kind of to give you guys an
idea<00:03:41.620> about<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.160> power<00:03:42.400> levels<00:03:42.760> I<00:03:42.850> know<00:03:42.910> it's

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
idea about the power levels I know it's

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.790 
idea about the power levels I know it's
a<00:03:43.150> little<00:03:43.360> bit<00:03:43.450> complicated<00:03:44.080> to<00:03:44.410> understand

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
a little bit complicated to understand

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.660 
a little bit complicated to understand
maybe<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.160> way<00:03:45.280> I<00:03:45.310> explained<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.850> but<00:03:47.490> you<00:03:48.490> can

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
maybe the way I explained it but you can

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.370 
maybe the way I explained it but you can
only<00:03:48.880> apply<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.300> spirit<00:03:49.780> stones<00:03:50.050> that<00:03:50.350> are

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
only apply the spirit stones that are

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.890 
only apply the spirit stones that are
the<00:03:51.100> level<00:03:51.490> of<00:03:51.670> your<00:03:52.060> weapon<00:03:53.820> until<00:03:54.820> the<00:03:55.180> lower

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
the level of your weapon until the lower

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.830 
the level of your weapon until the lower
level<00:03:56.320> of<00:03:56.350> your<00:03:56.530> weapon<00:03:56.830> -<00:03:56.980> 10<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:58.090> for<00:03:58.360> example

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
level of your weapon - 10 so for example

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.230 
level of your weapon - 10 so for example
here<00:03:59.050> I've<00:03:59.170> got<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> dagger<00:03:59.680> level<00:04:00.190> 63<00:04:00.580> that

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:01.240 
here I've got a dagger level 63 that

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.120 
here I've got a dagger level 63 that
means<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.540> can<00:04:01.690> apply<00:04:01.930> all<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.650> spirit<00:04:02.950> stone

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
means I can apply all the spirit stone

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.990 
means I can apply all the spirit stone
at<00:04:03.370> our<00:04:03.490> level<00:04:03.700> 53<00:04:04.510> to<00:04:04.780> 63

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
at our level 53 to 63

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.170 
at our level 53 to 63
hopefully<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.180> makes<00:04:08.300> sense<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:10.030> let's<00:04:11.030> talk

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
hopefully that makes sense so let's talk

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.020 
hopefully that makes sense so let's talk
about<00:04:11.240> actually<00:04:12.160> adding<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.190> cubes<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.820> can

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
about actually adding the cubes you can

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.240 
about actually adding the cubes you can
use<00:04:14.180> your<00:04:14.270> middle<00:04:14.540> mouse<00:04:14.660> if<00:04:15.620> you<00:04:15.860> click<00:04:16.130> and

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
use your middle mouse if you click and

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.530 
use your middle mouse if you click and
hold<00:04:16.310> your<00:04:16.519> middle<00:04:16.790> mouse<00:04:16.880> you<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.269> rotate

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
hold your middle mouse you can rotate

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.170 
hold your middle mouse you can rotate
the<00:04:17.930> weapon<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:19.400> place<00:04:19.610> the<00:04:19.760> blocks<00:04:20.000> on

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
the weapon to place the blocks on

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.410 
the weapon to place the blocks on
different<00:04:20.510> areas<00:04:20.930> and<00:04:21.170> you<00:04:21.490> can<00:04:22.490> place<00:04:23.030> these

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
different areas and you can place these

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.230 
different areas and you can place these
spirit<00:04:24.290> stone<00:04:24.500> blocks<00:04:25.370> which<00:04:25.640> actually<00:04:26.090> give

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
spirit stone blocks which actually give

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.900 
spirit stone blocks which actually give
you<00:04:26.360> extra<00:04:26.900> power<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.260> your<00:04:27.590> weapon<00:04:28.010> or<00:04:28.130> you

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
you extra power to your weapon or you

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.150 
you extra power to your weapon or you
can<00:04:29.120> have<00:04:29.360> iron<00:04:29.840> cubes<00:04:30.290> now<00:04:30.470> iron<00:04:30.770> cubes<00:04:31.100> you

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
can have iron cubes now iron cubes you

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.460 
can have iron cubes now iron cubes you
can<00:04:31.370> collect<00:04:31.610> them<00:04:31.790> from<00:04:32.030> like<00:04:32.240> mines<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:33.050> have

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
can collect them from like mines I have

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.560 
can collect them from like mines I have
many<00:04:33.830> of<00:04:33.920> them<00:04:34.160> you<00:04:34.790> can<00:04:34.970> collect<00:04:35.300> iron

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
many of them you can collect iron

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.480 
many of them you can collect iron
nuggets<00:04:36.020> from<00:04:36.200> iron<00:04:36.560> deposits<00:04:37.040> you<00:04:37.130> can<00:04:37.280> find

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
nuggets from iron deposits you can find

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.710 
nuggets from iron deposits you can find
them<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:37.700> bit<00:04:37.880> everywhere<00:04:38.180> around<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.690> world

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
them a bit everywhere around the world

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.050 
them a bit everywhere around the world
in<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.290> dark<00:04:39.650> mine<00:04:40.010> areas<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:40.850> if<00:04:41.000> you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
in like dark mine areas and then if you

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.900 
in like dark mine areas and then if you
go<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.510> furnace<00:04:41.900> you<00:04:42.530> can<00:04:42.740> smelt<00:04:43.640> those

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
go to the furnace you can smelt those

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.600 
go to the furnace you can smelt those
into<00:04:44.330> iron<00:04:44.570> cubes<00:04:45.050> and<00:04:45.290> if<00:04:45.950> you<00:04:46.100> smelt<00:04:46.370> many

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
into iron cubes and if you smelt many

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.060 
into iron cubes and if you smelt many
sometimes<00:04:47.150> you<00:04:47.270> get<00:04:47.390> lucky<00:04:47.600> you<00:04:47.750> get<00:04:47.960> to<00:04:48.230> RN

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
sometimes you get lucky you get to RN

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.240 
sometimes you get lucky you get to RN
cubes<00:04:49.370> for<00:04:49.610> one<00:04:49.850> iron<00:04:50.060> nugget<00:04:50.420> or<00:04:50.600> even<00:04:50.840> four

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
cubes for one iron nugget or even four

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.180 
cubes for one iron nugget or even four
so<00:04:52.450> yep<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:54.050> can<00:04:54.200> have<00:04:54.380> those<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.770> decorate

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
so yep you can have those to decorate

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.830 
so yep you can have those to decorate
your<00:04:55.370> iron<00:04:55.610> cube<00:04:55.910> now<00:04:56.060> these<00:04:56.240> don't<00:04:56.510> have<00:04:56.660> any

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
your iron cube now these don't have any

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.390 
your iron cube now these don't have any
power<00:04:57.110> levels<00:04:57.470> so<00:04:57.560> they<00:04:57.680> just<00:04:57.890> work<00:04:58.070> on<00:04:58.220> any

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
power levels so they just work on any

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.560 
power levels so they just work on any
weapon<00:04:58.810> and<00:05:00.550> but<00:05:01.550> they<00:05:01.670> don't<00:05:01.850> actually<00:05:02.060> do

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
weapon and but they don't actually do

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.120 
weapon and but they don't actually do
anything<00:05:03.050> to<00:05:03.140> your<00:05:03.260> weapon<00:05:03.590> they're<00:05:03.710> purely

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
anything to your weapon they're purely

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.640 
anything to your weapon they're purely
there<00:05:04.520> aesthetically<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.930> know<00:05:06.050> to<00:05:06.110> decorate

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
there aesthetically you know to decorate

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.350 
there aesthetically you know to decorate
your<00:05:06.770> weapon<00:05:07.100> but<00:05:07.280> they<00:05:07.700> don't<00:05:07.880> actually<00:05:08.030> do

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
your weapon but they don't actually do

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.650 
your weapon but they don't actually do
anything<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.670> so<00:05:10.670> hopefully<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.270> using

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
anything to it so hopefully like using

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.290 
anything to it so hopefully like using
that<00:05:11.750> idea<00:05:12.520> you<00:05:13.520> can<00:05:13.669> just<00:05:13.820> click<00:05:14.030> on<00:05:14.120> these

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:14.300 
that idea you can just click on these

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.670 
that idea you can just click on these
add<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:15.020> anywhere<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.890> weapon<00:05:17.440> let's<00:05:18.440> say

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
add it anywhere to the weapon let's say

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.350 
add it anywhere to the weapon let's say
oops<00:05:18.890> let's<00:05:19.520> say<00:05:19.640> you<00:05:19.700> want<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:20.030> here<00:05:20.210> in<00:05:20.270> the

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
oops let's say you want it here in the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.590 
oops let's say you want it here in the
middle<00:05:21.550> or<00:05:22.550> maybe<00:05:22.730> on<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.000> side<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.240> can<00:05:23.450> do

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
middle or maybe on the side you can do

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.070

you want to call that or even at the
bottom<00:06:36.419> like<00:06:36.780> this<00:06:36.990> maybe<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.850> makes<00:06:38.850> it

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
bottom like this maybe that makes it

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.420 
bottom like this maybe that makes it
look<00:06:39.150> a<00:06:39.240> little<00:06:39.330> bit<00:06:39.539> better<00:06:40.250> but<00:06:41.250> yeah<00:06:41.340> you

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430
