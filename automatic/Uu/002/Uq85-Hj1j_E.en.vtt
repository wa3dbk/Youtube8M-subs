00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.160
 If I remember, we were talking about 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500
 football and we were talking about what 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.020
 was the economic angle of football if 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.009
 remember we had also presented in 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.869
 our previous chapter in the previous 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.000
 delivery to say it in this way what 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.130
 it was the positioning of football 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.890
 European the great numbers of football 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.500
 European and also what were we say 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.390
 the leagues of the leagues are now going to 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.260
 go into more details about the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.360
 football and if we talked in the previous 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.280
 delivery of what is the growth of the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.450
 European football let's make a brief 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.010
 comparison between what we were commenting on 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.140
 economic growth and what 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.050
 we talked about football growth 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:58.250
 as you can see remembering remembering 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:01.789
 those images from the previous delivery 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.399
 this was the economic growth of 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.550
 great countries think well that these 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.770
 large countries go in free fall due 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.530
 to the economic situation due to the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.220
 economic situation between as much as 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.800
 we can appreciate European football 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.920
 what we commented is going to invoice every time 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.190
 more now we enter a small nuance 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.070
 the little nuance would be to see between the 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.800
 big leagues what they billed and the rest 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.110
 of European football we will remember that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.040
 the big leagues are the premier league 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:40.390
 English the Bundesliga German League 1 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.620
 French the Italian legacalcio series and 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.220
 the league of the stars 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:48.790
 our league bbv if we add these five 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:52.990
 leagues we have 6500 million five 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:58.600
 big leagues 6.065 all the rest of the 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:04.210
 European football 7,014 6,586 five big 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.400
 leagues seven thousand 727 six thousand 873 seven 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.679
 great forgiveness seven or five great 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.759
 leagues almost 8,000 million rest the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.110
 European football 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.959
 seven thousand 756 million this means 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.780
 that the money that goes to football has brought 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.210
 so it would be the call so 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.770
 would that wick 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.300
 What is the footballing passion saturates 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.820
 fundamentally in what are the 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.340
 big leagues who are in the 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.540
 big leagues the big clubs so 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.790
 both of them are somehow the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.830
 recipients of this income that are going 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.630
 towards the world of soccer 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.000
 note that remembering what the other 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.780
 We were talking here, we met 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.290
 with what would be an increase in everything 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.290
 that number of years that would be 25% is 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.780
 say from the 2005-2006 season up 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.050
 2008-2009 we are talking about a 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.260
 increase of 25 percent and here they are 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.480
 the icons the symbols of each of 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.460
 these big leagues the premier league the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.880
 professional soccer league bundesliga 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:15.670
 legacalcio series a and the French league 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.890
 this would be therefore the economic drawing 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.780
 of the great European football if we enter 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.940
 now in the percentages based on what 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.950
 that we just saw we can see 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.730
 that the big leagues are always 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.800
 absorbing 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.290
 50 percent of the income 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.709
 while all the rest of football 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.750
 European does not reach 50%, therefore the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.150
 football money goes towards the big 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.220
 leagues and this is surely the first 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.230
 aspect that we have to specify also 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.720
 remember that while our 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.000
 economy was not quite right see here 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.700
 how it is falling how it is falling how it is going 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.790
 falling down falls down is like the bull 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.909
 truth that hooks us there is Spain 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.579
 that has a ipc in freefall the 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.299
 question would be how is football going and that 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.640
 we are going right but before going I 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:10.629
 I would like to make a precision surely 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.480
 you must be a fan of the fc 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:17.139
 barcelona you must surely be a 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.600
 You can eat it or maybe I'll say it no longer 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.330
 I'm from Barça but I recognize that the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.699
 Barca is doing very well because 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.490
 so what I'm going to do is 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:31.000
 use that great club that is the barça 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.970
 as a paradigm of what he would be 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.610
 of economic model that's why I like it 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.830
 say that we have changed what it was 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.280
 neighborhood football and we have evolved 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 to the current football industry and the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:48.100
 Barça is the great paradigm of what 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.770
 it would be this change let's see it and from what 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.530
 look carefully here is a 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.380
 symbol in what would be let's say the 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:59.500
 blaugrana devotion devotion culé 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:02.200
 would be ladislao kubala here is an old 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.380
 peseta you were a happy man with the 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.720
 peseta a woman let's not say she was 

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.700
 in fullness with the peseta truth that 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.090
 our lives with the peseta worked 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.880
 very very very good well now with the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.310
 peseta work that way but 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.560
 we also have to keep in mind that 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.930
 came a month and then came the 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.770
 euros and this is the drawing that we 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.960
 presents precisely the fc.barcelona 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.560
 I think it's worth it in this 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.620
 let's do 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.350
 a small interruption a small 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.970
 interruption because like this way 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:40.460
 we take the opportunity to go to the bathroom 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.010
 take something and we'll come back immediately 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.590
 yes do not leave is the small interruption 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.590
 for the advice of our friends
