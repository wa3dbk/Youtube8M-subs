00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.210
 yeah 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.590
 aaa 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.100
 m 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.490
 here 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.440
 we 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.460
 here 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.460
 at 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.150
 for everyone 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.550
 yes go ahead 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800
 1 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.420
 governed last friendly pre-season match 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.660
 no result against rounds including feeling 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.660
 on this match 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 feelings 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.390
 mixed between interesting things we 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.019
 takes a mutant and things a little 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:20.989
 less and then a second half down 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.780
 no one is happy simply 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.919
 no nothing the balloon recovery and I 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.280
 not even talk about using the 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.950
 balloon we have nothing we did not propose 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.620
 we only suffered 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:37.520
 we have been passive in a lot of 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.290
 a lot of domains so here is a 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.090
 second half invites to quickly forget 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.190
 it's with the first half was 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.160
 overall satisfactory both the pavement 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.660
 had the game comment explains this 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.880
 difference between years and a half in the 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.030
 tired 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.250
 if the tiredness everything will have resumed the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.330
 monopoly of the balloon we impossible to the 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:02.900
 go out after we were very focused what 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:04.630
 reason a form of nervousness also on 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.630
 dancing in certain areas 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:11.530
 So here we have forgotten the essentials of 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.000
 playing football and we were concerned 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.820
 again I repeat counting in 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.610
 the football begins to think to believe dead 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.800
 is there we were concerned about each other what 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.000
 who was doing good or not good and that 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.810
 snowballed and then it got 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.419
 made a copy 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.639
 a copy more than average in second mi 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.590
 time you were expecting that for this 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.930
 last friendly match where something from 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.229
 more consistent more homogeneous on everything 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.510
 the game 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.940
 we never expect that we aspire on 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.350
 hope it was the last rehearsal 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.229
 last friendly match 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.539
 here is to repeat things of what we 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.280
 could do during the whole preparation 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.300
 we did it in a proper way 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.669
 half-time and half-time 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.840
 no, this is the moment the 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:57.830
 reasons i will watch the video 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.479
 discussions at the end of the match between us 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.479
 this is to explain may 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.400
 but good quiet quiet 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.090
 quiet 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.410
 there are still reasons for 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.030
 satisfaction especially on the first 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.040
 Half time in the game there were things 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:16.950
 interesting 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.150
 yes, but hey we do not play a mi 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:22.290
 hard times the infinite starts to match a 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.670
 uncomplicated they are much better 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.010
 returned that we learn took over the 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.330
 match thread the goal we scored that 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:31.200
 we did good it's true but good 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:33.360
 here we have to call a cat a cat the 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:34.940
 polo that makes you two three stops from 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.640
 three important stops 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.020
 it's always the same thing so 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:44.430
 here is some work you have to work 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.830
 so we'll say we defended well 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.860
 all in all we had 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:53.610
 situations but hey it's because 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:56.670
 I'm waiting for my team going into the game 

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.070
 in we must we must do a lot 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:00.390
 better if you had to do a balance the end 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.710
 of his pre-season matches 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.280
 week of kickoff championship 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.830
 what would it be 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.210
 the bottom line is that I think we have 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:11.600
 worked well I think we have better 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.860
 worked that last season 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.170
 in many areas the appearance 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.300
 technical mental tactics preparation 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.800
 athletic we have very few injuries so 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.230
 it proves that we did very well 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:24.050
 worked I think we were in the 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.510
 good in the right tempo and then there 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.950
 oddly less well at 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.120
 contrary of the young people who played the 

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.810
 two matches in the week when were 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.980
 presented they were good here it's going 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.600
 also lead me to think too if they 

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:39.770
 think that because we're actually two 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.170
 teams and we are in play time 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:47.020
 important to the players they believe that 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:47.020
 it's gone low they're going to be wrong so 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.170
 I told them I did not satisfy you 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.200
 what they still produced in two mi 

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.200
 time
