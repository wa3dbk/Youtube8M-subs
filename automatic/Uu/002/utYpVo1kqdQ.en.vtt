00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.500
 hello my name is julian I am 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.180
 florist in paris in the 7th 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.410
 borough and today I'm going 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.889
 explain to you how to win a 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.019
 plant 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.910
 it's important not to win 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.920
 plant at any time and 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.470
 for any occasion a 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.210
 plant must be potted only 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.830
 that between skin becomes too small for 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.260
 she or that the earth has totally 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.330
 gone to realize if the pot 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.519
 is too small for a plant 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.250
 realizes that the roots are starting to 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.400
 go out through the hole that lies below 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.650
 pot or they start running at 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.790
 above the shot at that moment you 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.670
 can make the decision of the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 repot to do this it is not enough 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.640
 to buy a pot of size much more 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.400
 great 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.350
 logically we take one to size at 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.909
 above the existing bridge 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.089
 we get clay soil 9 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.309
 to create a drainage at the bottom of the pot and 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.199
 at that moment we can repot it so 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.059
 here we go to potting 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.769
 of this plant in this pot that is 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.239
 slightly bigger to start 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.030
 we will make sure that the weight 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.729
 is well pierce and place there clay 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.530
 which are small earth balls that 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.420
 will allow to do some drainage and 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.500
 prevent the plant from being in contact 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.500
 permanent to humility 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.000
 after having therefore performed a braking 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:24.649
 a few centimeters 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.079
 we will spend a first layer 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:30.070
 of new compost that will bring 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.070
 food to the plant 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.830
 before putting your plant in his 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.730
 new pot it is important to good 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.440
 well water it well 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.170
 so we're going to say that delicately 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.740
 from his pot we read him but rj lamothe 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.620
 completely in water so 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.660
 that the old earth face sticks with the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.370
 new once they were fine 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.920
 drain it is positioned in its 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.950
 new pot and we just leave at the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950
 height 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.540
 then we will complete the quarters 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.540
 with potting soil 9 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.010
 packed enough for more than there is 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.840
 to take in the roots the pot and the 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.639
 earth pay attention to the test a 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.709
 edge of a centimeter so as to 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.749
 can water your plant without risk 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.799
 and the water overflows and you 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.260
 were everywhere in your kitchen 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.450
 once repotting finished think about 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.099
 well watered the plant and here you are 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.790
 know my way of doing things 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.790
 repot a plan
