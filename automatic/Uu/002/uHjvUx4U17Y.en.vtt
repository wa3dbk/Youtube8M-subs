all<00:00:20.039> right<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.430> morning<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:20.970> going<00:00:21.150> to

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
all right so this morning I'm going to

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.759 
all right so this morning I'm going to
do<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> real<00:00:21.750> brief<00:00:22.050> introduction<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
do a real brief introduction to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
do a real brief introduction to
dissolved<00:00:23.369> oxygen<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.150> say<00:00:24.390> brief<00:00:24.720> because

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
dissolved oxygen and I say brief because

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.420 
dissolved oxygen and I say brief because
it's<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> subject<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.099> could<00:00:26.220> probably

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it's a subject that you could probably

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.779 
it's a subject that you could probably
write<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> book<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.260> down<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> road<00:00:28.560> I'll

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
write a book on down the road I'll

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.790 
write a book on down the road I'll
definitely<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.939> some<00:00:30.210> more<00:00:30.990> lecture<00:00:31.500> type

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
definitely do some more lecture type

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
definitely do some more lecture type
talks<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:33.149> lot<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> these<00:00:33.989> subjects<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.510> for

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
talks on a lot of these subjects but for

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.910 
talks on a lot of these subjects but for
right<00:00:36.630> now<00:00:36.690> we're<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.890> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
right now we're just going to do a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.250 
right now we're just going to do a
really<00:00:38.160> quick<00:00:38.399> introduction<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.360> all<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.140> our

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
really quick introduction for all of our

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
really quick introduction for all of our
YouTube<00:00:40.680> folks<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.790> when<00:00:41.969> you're<00:00:42.090> designing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
YouTube folks so when you're designing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.810 
YouTube folks so when you're designing
aquaponic<00:00:43.170> systems<00:00:43.590> or<00:00:43.800> aquaculture<00:00:44.129> systems

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
aquaponic systems or aquaculture systems

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.180 
aquaponic systems or aquaculture systems
really<00:00:45.120> anything<00:00:45.570> having<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.079> with

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
really anything having to do with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
really anything having to do with
aquatic<00:00:47.190> organisms<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.390> need<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.870> consider

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
aquatic organisms you need to consider

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.060 
aquatic organisms you need to consider
very<00:00:49.980> carefully<00:00:50.210> dissolved<00:00:51.210> oxygen<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> when

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
very carefully dissolved oxygen so when

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.560 
very carefully dissolved oxygen so when
we<00:00:53.219> talk<00:00:53.399> about<00:00:53.430> dissolved<00:00:54.000> oxygen<00:00:54.149> we're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we talk about dissolved oxygen we're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.270 
we talk about dissolved oxygen we're
talking<00:00:54.870> about<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.260> oxygen<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.100> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
talking about the oxygen that is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.250 
talking about the oxygen that is
actually<00:00:56.789> soluble<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.660> dissolved<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
actually soluble that is dissolved in

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
actually soluble that is dissolved in
the<00:00:58.320> water<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.920> available<00:00:59.270> to<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> fish

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the water that's available to the fish

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.509 
the water that's available to the fish
to<00:01:00.989> your<00:01:01.820> crayfish<00:01:02.820> our<00:01:03.090> prawns<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:04.049> your

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
to your crayfish our prawns to your

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.460 
to your crayfish our prawns to your
microbes<00:01:05.519> even<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:06.390> nitrifying<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.320> all

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
microbes even that our nitrifying to all

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.710 
microbes even that our nitrifying to all
of<00:01:07.650> these<00:01:07.740> different<00:01:07.950> organisms<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.630> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of these different organisms and it's a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
of these different organisms and it's a
really<00:01:09.990> important<00:01:10.380> subject<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> lot<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
really important subject that a lot of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
really important subject that a lot of
people<00:01:11.670> overlook<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.510> don't<00:01:12.659> really<00:01:12.840> think

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
people overlook and don't really think

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.830 
people overlook and don't really think
about<00:01:13.740> when<00:01:13.920> they're<00:01:14.070> designing<00:01:14.250> systems<00:01:15.000> so

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
about when they're designing systems so

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
about when they're designing systems so
a<00:01:16.530> lot<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> time<00:01:17.850> you'll<00:01:18.060> see<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
a lot of the time you'll see the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.359 
a lot of the time you'll see the
dissolved<00:01:19.350> oxygen<00:01:19.790> abbreviated<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.909> deal<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
dissolved oxygen abbreviated as deal and

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
dissolved oxygen abbreviated as deal and
it<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.729> basically<00:01:23.970> describes<00:01:24.600> how<00:01:24.810> much

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
it just basically describes how much

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.740 
it just basically describes how much
oxygen<00:01:25.229> is<00:01:25.710> dissolved<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> water<00:01:26.909> at<00:01:27.420> any

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
oxygen is dissolved in the water at any

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.160 
oxygen is dissolved in the water at any
one<00:01:28.020> time<00:01:28.049> so<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> interesting<00:01:30.960> thing<00:01:31.140> about

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
one time so the interesting thing about

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.710 
one time so the interesting thing about
dissolved<00:01:31.860> oxygen<00:01:32.009> is<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> responds<00:01:33.659> to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
dissolved oxygen is that it responds to

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.149 
dissolved oxygen is that it responds to
a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.049> different<00:01:34.320> variables<00:01:34.590> including

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
a lot of different variables including

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.399 
a lot of different variables including
salinity<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.509> amount<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.840> salt<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
salinity so the amount of salt in the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.590 
salinity so the amount of salt in the
water<00:01:37.560> that's<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.640> usually<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> problem<00:01:39.329> for

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
water that's not usually a problem for

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.149 
water that's not usually a problem for
most<00:01:39.720> aquaponics<00:01:40.439> folks<00:01:40.650> because<00:01:41.009> you're

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
most aquaponics folks because you're

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.120 
most aquaponics folks because you're
dealing<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.460> fairly<00:01:42.030> fresh<00:01:42.270> water<00:01:42.570> low

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
dealing with fairly fresh water low

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.090 
dealing with fairly fresh water low
salinity<00:01:44.130> water<00:01:44.750> but<00:01:45.750> also<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.680> biggie<00:01:47.009> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
salinity water but also the biggie is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.569 
salinity water but also the biggie is
temperature<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.189> one<00:01:50.340> thing

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
temperature so and this is one thing

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.480 
temperature so and this is one thing
that<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.970> lot<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> folks<00:01:51.600> will<00:01:52.320> mention<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.130> well

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that a lot of folks will mention is well

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
that a lot of folks will mention is well
when<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> weather<00:01:54.659> warms<00:01:54.930> up<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.259> my

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
when when the weather warms up when my

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.709 
when when the weather warms up when my
water<00:01:55.530> gets<00:01:55.829> hot<00:01:55.979> my<00:01:56.610> fish<00:01:56.820> start<00:01:57.030> gasping<00:01:57.540> for

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
water gets hot my fish start gasping for

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.670 
water gets hot my fish start gasping for
air<00:01:57.750> or<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> fish<00:01:58.560> kill<00:01:59.000> and<00:02:00.259> that<00:02:01.259> has

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
air or I get a fish kill and that has

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.319 
air or I get a fish kill and that has
everything<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.520> dissolved<00:02:03.149> oxygen

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
everything to do with dissolved oxygen

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.219 
everything to do with dissolved oxygen
so<00:02:03.990> if<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.490> about<00:02:05.670> dissolved<00:02:06.210> oxygen<00:02:06.390> we

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
so if we think about dissolved oxygen we

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.369 
so if we think about dissolved oxygen we
know<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.459> know<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.910> if<00:02:09.720> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.259> the

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
know that you know if if this is the

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
know that you know if if this is the
amount<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.739> dissolved<00:02:11.039> oxygen<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.910> there's<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
amount of dissolved oxygen and there's a

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.330 
amount of dissolved oxygen and there's a
whole<00:02:12.360> bunch<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.599> different<00:02:12.690> units

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
whole bunch of different units

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.210 
whole bunch of different units
can<00:02:13.430> use<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.890> temperature

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
can use for this and this is temperature

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.040 
can use for this and this is temperature
okay<00:02:16.819> as<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:19.190> temperature<00:02:19.640> rises<00:02:20.150> dissolved

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
okay as the temperature rises dissolved

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.290 
okay as the temperature rises dissolved
oxygen<00:02:21.230> okay

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
oxygen okay

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.479 
oxygen okay
becomes<00:02:23.780> less<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.260> less<00:02:24.319> soluble<00:02:24.709> so<00:02:25.280> as<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
becomes less and less soluble so as the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.990 
becomes less and less soluble so as the
temperature<00:02:25.879> rises<00:02:26.269> there<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:26.840> less<00:02:27.440> what

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
temperature rises there can be less what

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.589 
temperature rises there can be less what
oxygen<00:02:29.000> in<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.360> water<00:02:30.879> also<00:02:31.879> associated<00:02:32.510> with

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
oxygen in the water also associated with

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.970 
oxygen in the water also associated with
that<00:02:32.690> is<00:02:32.870> as<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.170> temperature<00:02:33.319> rises<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that is as the temperature rises the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.710 
that is as the temperature rises the
metabolism<00:02:34.819> of<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.000> lot<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.239> organisms

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
metabolism of a lot of organisms

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.380 
metabolism of a lot of organisms
increases<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.010> get<00:02:37.519> a<00:02:37.549> lot<00:02:37.760> more<00:02:37.790> oxygen

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
increases so you get a lot more oxygen

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.750 
increases so you get a lot more oxygen
consumption<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.560> combine<00:02:39.950> those<00:02:40.190> two<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
consumption so you combine those two and

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.580 
consumption so you combine those two and
you<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:40.970> kind<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.269> have<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.480> have<00:02:42.019> a<00:02:42.140> bit<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.470> a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you can kind of have a have a bit of a

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.920 
you can kind of have a have a bit of a
deadly<00:02:42.980> reaction<00:02:43.580> there<00:02:43.790> another<00:02:44.510> thing<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
deadly reaction there another thing to

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.140 
deadly reaction there another thing to
remember<00:02:44.959> is<00:02:45.470> with<00:02:45.650> with<00:02:46.040> your<00:02:46.250> fish<00:02:46.489> size<00:02:46.760> k

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
remember is with with your fish size k

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.100 
remember is with with your fish size k
smaller<00:02:47.930> sit<00:02:48.290> fish<00:02:48.530> consume<00:02:49.040> much<00:02:49.340> more

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
smaller sit fish consume much more

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.319 
smaller sit fish consume much more
dissolved<00:02:51.110> oxygen<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:51.799> if<00:02:51.920> this<00:02:52.069> is<00:02:52.329> do

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
dissolved oxygen so if this is do

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.540 
dissolved oxygen so if this is do
consumption

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.150 

and<00:02:56.640> this<00:02:57.420> is<00:02:57.840> your<00:02:58.230> fish<00:02:58.590> size

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.930 

as<00:03:02.220> those<00:03:03.030> fish<00:03:03.330> get<00:03:03.570> bigger<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.110> they<00:03:04.620> get

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
as those fish get bigger as they get

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.730 
as those fish get bigger as they get
older<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.120> they<00:03:06.270> get<00:03:06.420> larger<00:03:06.740> they're

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
older as they get larger they're

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.190 
older as they get larger they're
consuming<00:03:08.220> less<00:03:08.460> and<00:03:08.820> less<00:03:09.150> dissolved<00:03:09.960> oxygen

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
consuming less and less dissolved oxygen

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.220 
consuming less and less dissolved oxygen
so<00:03:10.890> as<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.640> function<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.270> weight<00:03:12.540> okay<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:12.900> this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
so as a function of weight okay so this

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.110 
so as a function of weight okay so this
would<00:03:13.410> be<00:03:13.530> like<00:03:13.650> milligrams<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.640> dissolved

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
would be like milligrams of dissolved

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.920 
would be like milligrams of dissolved
oxygen<00:03:16.070> per<00:03:17.070> kilogram<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.640> fish<00:03:18.300> something

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
oxygen per kilogram of fish something

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.870 
oxygen per kilogram of fish something
like<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.370> per<00:03:20.370> hour<00:03:20.550> or<00:03:21.000> by<00:03:21.750> some<00:03:21.990> time<00:03:22.230> unit

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
like that per hour or by some time unit

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.450 
like that per hour or by some time unit
so<00:03:23.880> our<00:03:24.240> small<00:03:24.570> fish<00:03:24.870> they<00:03:25.260> consume<00:03:25.740> very<00:03:26.100> high

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
so our small fish they consume very high

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.060 
so our small fish they consume very high
amounts<00:03:26.940> of<00:03:27.030> oxygen<00:03:27.570> as<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.830> function<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:28.920> their

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
amounts of oxygen as a function of their

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.190 
amounts of oxygen as a function of their
body<00:03:29.280> weight<00:03:29.400> our<00:03:29.730> larger<00:03:30.330> fish<00:03:30.540> consume<00:03:30.960> less

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
body weight our larger fish consume less

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.910 
body weight our larger fish consume less
so<00:03:31.890> if<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.430> say<00:03:32.880> 10<00:03:33.150> pounds<00:03:33.660> of

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
so if you have say 10 pounds of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.440 
so if you have say 10 pounds of
fingerlings<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.340> tank<00:03:35.580> compared<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.210> 10

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
fingerlings in a tank compared to 10

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.540 
fingerlings in a tank compared to 10
pounds<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:36.930> mature<00:03:37.260> fish<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.040> oxygen

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
pounds of mature fish the oxygen

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.490 
pounds of mature fish the oxygen
consumption<00:03:38.940> is<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.660> much<00:03:39.990> much

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
consumption is going to be much much

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.380 
consumption is going to be much much
higher<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.400> that's<00:03:41.550> really<00:03:41.790> important<00:03:42.300> to

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
higher so that's really important to

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.430 
higher so that's really important to
remember<00:03:42.480> when<00:03:42.930> you're<00:03:43.050> setting<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.380> your

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
remember when you're setting up your

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.110 
remember when you're setting up your
systems<00:03:43.950> especially<00:03:44.220> at<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.670> beginning<00:03:45.000> when

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
systems especially at the beginning when

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.640 
systems especially at the beginning when
everyone's<00:03:45.480> starting<00:03:45.840> off<00:03:45.990> with<00:03:46.200> with

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
everyone's starting off with with

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.250 
everyone's starting off with with
fingerlings<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.600> basically<00:03:48.780> want

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
fingerlings so you just basically want

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.620 
fingerlings so you just basically want
to<00:03:49.380> minimize<00:03:52.700> minimize<00:03:53.700> all<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.120> kind<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
to minimize minimize all of kind of the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.630 
to minimize minimize all of kind of the
negative<00:03:54.840> variables<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.800> can<00:03:56.070> impact<00:03:56.430> your

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
negative variables that can impact your

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.920 
negative variables that can impact your
dissolved<00:03:57.060> oxygen<00:03:57.210> whether<00:03:57.690> that's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
dissolved oxygen whether that's

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.440 
dissolved oxygen whether that's
consumption<00:03:58.590> okay<00:03:58.860> and<00:03:59.100> small<00:03:59.820> fish<00:04:00.150> whether

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.680 
consumption okay and small fish whether
that<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:01.010> really<00:04:02.010> high<00:04:02.190> temperatures<00:04:02.790> or<00:04:03.330> even

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
that is really high temperatures or even

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.360 
that is really high temperatures or even
you<00:04:03.840> know<00:04:03.870> choosing<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> right<00:04:04.680> kind<00:04:04.980> of<00:04:05.160> fish

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you know choosing the right kind of fish

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.800 
you know choosing the right kind of fish
for<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.700> kind<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.060> variables<00:04:06.540> you're<00:04:06.660> going

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
for the kind of variables you're going

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.670 
for the kind of variables you're going
to<00:04:06.870> see<00:04:07.050> now<00:04:07.590> fortunately<00:04:08.100> fish<00:04:08.700> like<00:04:08.880> tilapia

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
to see now fortunately fish like tilapia

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.100 
to see now fortunately fish like tilapia
because<00:04:10.680> they<00:04:11.130> have<00:04:11.700> adapted<00:04:12.360> to<00:04:12.600> warm<00:04:12.870> water

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
because they have adapted to warm water

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.400 
because they have adapted to warm water
they<00:04:13.950> are<00:04:14.660> adapted<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.690> consuming<00:04:16.230> less

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
they are adapted to consuming less

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.740 
they are adapted to consuming less
dissolved<00:04:17.100> oxygen<00:04:17.280> so<00:04:17.910> they<00:04:18.150> can<00:04:18.330> they<00:04:18.570> can

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
dissolved oxygen so they can they can

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.870 
dissolved oxygen so they can they can
live<00:04:19.080> at<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.620> low<00:04:19.980> levels<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.459> dissolved

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
live at very low levels of dissolved

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.840 
live at very low levels of dissolved
oxygen<00:04:21.000> compared<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.840> other<00:04:21.989> fish<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:23.160> all<00:04:23.640> of

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
oxygen compared to other fish but all of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.040 
oxygen compared to other fish but all of
these<00:04:23.970> things<00:04:24.180> are<00:04:24.300> important<00:04:24.690> to<00:04:24.720> realize

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
these things are important to realize

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.500 
these things are important to realize
and<00:04:25.320> remember<00:04:25.350> if<00:04:25.950> you<00:04:26.400> consistently<00:04:27.300> have

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
and remember if you consistently have

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.100 
and remember if you consistently have
fish<00:04:27.780> gasping<00:04:28.320> at<00:04:28.440> the<00:04:28.560> top<00:04:28.740> of<00:04:28.950> the<00:04:29.430> water

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
fish gasping at the top of the water

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.020 
fish gasping at the top of the water
either<00:04:31.110> you're<00:04:31.350> over<00:04:31.650> stocked<00:04:32.130> okay<00:04:32.669> or

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
either you're over stocked okay or

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.070 
either you're over stocked okay or
you're<00:04:33.300> overfeeding

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
you're overfeeding

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.190 
you're overfeeding
we've<00:04:34.410> got<00:04:34.710> too<00:04:35.040> much<00:04:35.540> decaying<00:04:36.540> matter<00:04:36.990> in

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
we've got too much decaying matter in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.290 
we've got too much decaying matter in
your<00:04:37.230> system<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.950> all<00:04:38.160> decaying<00:04:39.000> all

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
your system so all decaying all

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.320 
your system so all decaying all
digestion<00:04:39.960> all<00:04:40.520> metabolism<00:04:41.520> requires<00:04:41.970> oxygen

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
digestion all metabolism requires oxygen

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.159 
digestion all metabolism requires oxygen
and<00:04:43.220> if<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.490> have<00:04:44.730> fish<00:04:45.360> gasping<00:04:45.900> if<00:04:46.020> you've

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
and if you have fish gasping if you've

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.530 
and if you have fish gasping if you've
got<00:04:46.320> low<00:04:46.590> levels<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.280> dissolved<00:04:47.730> oxygen<00:04:47.850> there

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
got low levels of dissolved oxygen there

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.230 
got low levels of dissolved oxygen there
is<00:04:48.570> always<00:04:49.080> something<00:04:49.410> wrong<00:04:49.970> so<00:04:50.970> that's

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
is always something wrong so that's

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.900 
is always something wrong so that's
that's<00:04:52.050> just<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.710> quick<00:04:52.919> intro<00:04:53.280> to<00:04:53.310> dissolved

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
that's just the quick intro to dissolved

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.000 
that's just the quick intro to dissolved
oxygen<00:04:54.150> I'll<00:04:54.750> definitely<00:04:55.410> be<00:04:55.530> talking<00:04:55.710> about

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
oxygen I'll definitely be talking about

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.540 
oxygen I'll definitely be talking about
it<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.310> lot<00:04:56.460> more<00:04:56.700> as<00:04:56.880> time<00:04:57.090> goes<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:58.130> if<00:04:59.130> you
