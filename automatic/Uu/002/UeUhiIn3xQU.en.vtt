one<00:03:26.690> would<00:03:26.959> think<00:03:26.989> that<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:27.620> would<00:03:27.770> have

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
one would think that you would have

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.740 
one would think that you would have
spent<00:03:28.130> more<00:03:28.760> time<00:03:30.760> researching<00:03:31.760> this<00:03:32.330> episode

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
spent more time researching this episode

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.309 
spent more time researching this episode
of<00:03:32.780> making<00:03:33.200> sure<00:03:33.380> that<00:03:33.590> it<00:03:33.709> wasn't<00:03:34.010> offensive

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
of making sure that it wasn't offensive

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.420 
of making sure that it wasn't offensive
but<00:03:36.319> then<00:03:36.440> again<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.739> would<00:03:37.010> be<00:03:37.160> wrong<00:03:37.370> for

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
but then again you would be wrong for

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.800 
but then again you would be wrong for
this<00:03:37.819> episode<00:03:39.970> what<00:03:40.970> am<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.150> talking<00:03:41.420> about

well here are some of the problems with

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.979 
well here are some of the problems with
it<00:03:44.380> there<00:03:45.380> is<00:03:45.590> no<00:03:46.100> distinction<00:03:46.730> between

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989
