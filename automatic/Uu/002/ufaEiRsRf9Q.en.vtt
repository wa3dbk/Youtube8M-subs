00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the staff here the show and bringing 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.819
 you the third league tutorial 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.830
 Legends today I'll explain a little 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.019
 about the top lenny that is located in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.700
 top of the map are Jorge 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 in this way that many believe to be 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 easy to play but actually it is well 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 complicated and you will understand why 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.060
 lenny for the top is usually the deigned 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.760
 single champion usually being of the type 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.920
 fighter tank that has as crankcase 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 feature a great physical defense 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 and lots of hp and its 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.759
 medium offensive capability since the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.410
 Tank focus is not your killer but yes 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.090
 a walking wall that will protect the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.000
 your team at all costs 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.820
 When you go to play top we go 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.480
 say yes but the top goes from 2 on top 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.030
 no, man 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.399
 For God's sake , do not make it any bigger. 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.379
 stupid will do because if you do 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.660
 this you go without andrÃ© will lose 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.219
 playing on the top with two because the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.129
 certain is that sharing your meeting lore 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.230
 and the top priority is the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.899
 farmville you should avoid approaching 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.399
 your opponent at the beginning since there is no 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 beginning of the game is capabilities 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.920
 offensive are really not very 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.439
 powerful 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 however some top chances that are not 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.320
 so weak offensively at first 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.450
 ary as Rene such as vi 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.640
 you will see in the video it also in 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.119
 beginning of the game is very strong with the attack 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.650
 but avoid even attacking the guy right on the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.479
 start give a little on them you had 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.360
 some long-range ability like 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.670
 they are watching pantheon doing there but it is 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.650
 if you are not very sure of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.350
 head teaching advance but if you have 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.990
 against 1 old darius gets excited 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.610
 tower and wait for a million to arrive 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 begins to kill the boys there and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.530
 avoid being pulled by some that the dodo 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.439
 had an enemy since many days if several 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.600
 others can pull you and inec him 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.590
 advance this study and it will 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.020
 the word I am these these details I 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.149
 I 'm not talking, I'm going to explain here from home. 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 had because there are many top champions 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.780
 understood me it's me, I'm not going 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.420
 explain why they already have several channels 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.500
 have often explained 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.479
 champions and such 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.829
 so I will not talk about them 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.150
 individually or speak only of the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.640
 general function of the touch is a 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.890
 Let's continue here after 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
 achieve the three initial skills 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 After a lot of bad talk and you 're going 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.409
 get some items also in the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.420
 beginning you managed to form straight 

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.230
 avoid the corners of the birthday and 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.700
 such 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.739
 you can adopt a more 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.780
 aggressive against your opponent but 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.060
 avoids much advance at the initial levels 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.069
 because the angle exit of the river has a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.530
 witch who is the perfect place for 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:39.739
 played before you lied to me 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.780
 then place an order on this breach case 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.400
 the first cacao tower here also in 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.709
 guide is positioned midway 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.609
 before the tower from there it also comes 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.799
 can get 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.480
 whenever you are having difficulty piece 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.639
 help of your duty because it is so goes 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.139
 be easier you defeat the enemy 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.849
 so it is difficult that it does not encourage the 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.859
 enemy in the city of hangu 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.109
 element surprise will be lost is 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.269
 I forgot to say also when you go 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.579
 Farmar tries to hit yes when he 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.470
 have a minimum of life understood later 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.470
 I understood that you received me very well not only 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.569
 to punch him and kills him to only give 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.099
 west ridiculous last hit 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.160
 you will only matter to the blow as 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.290
 the tanks characters rarely have 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.389
 high attack speed then no 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.720
 you need to get potato beating fast fast 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:26.209
 does not give you the world is usually a 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.980
 then half a second from the other and gave 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.440
 even slower than judging by 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.109
 Example, alert to hell, then hit. 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.629
 gives only last rites for a minimum stay 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.000
 very weak and give a blow and in the end only 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.530
 to take the life of a being to receive 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.900
 The same amount called him as if he had 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.970
 killed him giving a lot of paul 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.889
 when you destroy the first tower 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.409
 have the most essential items of your 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:50.690
 bild begins to pull out the other laws 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.120
 giving an aid to your game 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.790
 so talk to the enemy lose the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.139
 focus on the top and so you could lead to 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.919
 a second round later in 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:02.389
 easier you take his attention will 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:05.299
 take to the other legends the guy goes 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:08.030
 leave it unprotected territory 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.669
 You go there with the button and then back. 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.340
 you leave a million shapes to the famous ball 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.739
 snow or sweat tells me when together 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.440
 montermini themselves to overthrow the 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.269
 actor alone with the tank you should 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.539
 put resistance sambil and increase 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.389
 of hp if there is a type 1a ter 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.249
 very powerful 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.499
 make a magical resistance to power 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:30.539
 to resist his spells more is to create a 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:32.610
 opening of your team can eliminate 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.710
 while he focuses on you playing as 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.520
 tanks, the main duty is to protect the 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.069
 your team 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.189
 Anyway, you should always position yourself 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:43.409
 front of cdc and assassins and magicians 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.300
 also to protect them by becoming a focus 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:47.039
 the enemy facilitating the realization of 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.569
 maneuvers for your team, avoiding 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.300
 enemies can pass you by 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.050
 understood the moment someone ok the show on 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.779
 foot 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.939
 despite the focus of the tank the defense to hp 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.800
 must have at least one other item 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.349
 offensive to be able to cause damage already 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.210
 with a fighter type tank and so 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.370
 so I usually lay understands hurt 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.349
 physical and other criticism the easy rest 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.300
 defense of life in this way but he 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.310
 not work with the sampa only that it is not 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.069
 all of them that same April works for 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.960
 some of them have different styles and if 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.629
 makes it a cool game even though you play 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.509
 always the same map there are other 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.550
 But what makes this legal business 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:25.289
 face is that if you create combinations 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.849
 different for each character each 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.560
 have your own style and you will not 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.939
 put the same item for everything 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.620
 for possessing great capacities 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.629
 defensive 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.819
 The tanks can withstand native 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:37.770
 police towers of the point of the game when 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.080
 already strong enough for this 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.289
 takes advantage of this ability to help 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.629
 your team to get a kilo or is 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.629
 to tear down even tankan towers of you 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:49.860
 to get what 's very simple you 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:51.960
 arrives near the tower and draws attention 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.589
 Give it to you and she'll give it a shot. 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.870
 in you 

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:57.120
 while the team passes and kills that face 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.339
 hid underneath it saw when not 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.110
 there are mini the next actor you do 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:03.149
 their role down and leading 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.080
 shot and your allies in lipstick and you go 

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:06.149
 beating too 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.719
 but this is a well- scratched move 

00:06:06.149 --> 00:06:11.520
 so I thought it was cool that only hp defense 

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:13.830
 be a great present the damage 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.169
 of the tower as the tower owner increases 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.089
 to each type of it is that you at the time of 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.889
 kill the baron is the first to attack 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.479
 to receive the owner of the attacks avoiding 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.680
 that their science and ordering 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.439
 not necessary 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.659
 So that's it folks I hope I 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.270
 has helped you this basic tutorial 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:32.189
 You play in the top line next month, let's go. 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.560
 finally reach the end of the authorities 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:36.419
 where I will explain about django and 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.940
 menezes 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:41.889
 wish luck because the game is fucking guy 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.470
 It's very complicated to talk about this place. 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:46.479
 full of cunning tricks truck 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.120
 I hope I can explain everything from a 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:52.120
 a very coherent way for you even more 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.870
 secular who favors to be enrolled 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:07:00.340
 on the channel if you are not yet registered 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:03.000
 along and that's it, I'm going there, bj
