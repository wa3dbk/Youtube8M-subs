but<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> shirt<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> fit<00:01:00.059> I

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
but I like the shirt I like the fit I

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.340 
but I like the shirt I like the fit I
think<00:01:00.359> they<00:01:00.449> fit<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:00.899> better<00:01:01.050> than

think they fit a little bit better than
usual<00:01:01.739> supreme<00:01:02.129> shirts<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:06.380> think<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
usual supreme shirts and a I think that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899
