00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:09.750
 Kenner undercuts the 2000 euro limit 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 for a full- dslr the new ios 6d 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 Dissolves 20 megapixels and offers 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.300
 housing that is robustly processed 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 Solid fails and that is handy 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.820
 lets grab a nikon has a similar 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.109
 channel rausgebracht the Nikon d 600 also 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.880
 about 2000 euro 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.289
 Of course this raises the question where are 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.359
 because the differences in the cameras 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.120
 what are the specialties of the canon sixth 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.370
 now as already said the image sensor triggers 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 only 20 megapixels on something less than 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.120
 in the nikon for it then synonymous 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.450
 higher photosensitivity possible for 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.129
 selections are iso 100 to iso 25.600 if 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.700
 you then go the advanced mode 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 it is even iso 2800 they are 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.789
 can adjust very advanced 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.890
 presents itself at the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.890
 equipment is in the eu six 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.079
 the wlan and gps a gps that existed 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 so far only in SLR cameras from 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.280
 sony is now synonymous with canon 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.170
 and thus they get geo tagging their 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.439
 Recorded helpful feature like me 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.970
 find 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.280
 the route can be so beautiful 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.560
 understand also plugged in here 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.979
 they perform various functions 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.590
 On the one hand, you can control the camera remotely 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.400
 from the computer or the smartphone you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.229
 can send pictures directly 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.759
 You can also watch TV 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.990

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.970
 autofocus system 9 measuring fields thereof 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.430
 cross sensor series images creates the eos 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.500
 6d in full resolution at around 45 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 pictures per second 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.180

 instant for recording parameters 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.340
 have stopped and therefore have the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.170
 five familiar keys from others 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.729
 professional canon cameras with those

 Over a million picture points for the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.459
 Presentation of the 14 contrastive and

 you can see it in a good mood 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.820

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.239
 features like a spirit level at the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.360

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.250
 bright and also a big picture the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.280
 cover but this is only at 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 97 percent 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.390
 who thanks canon has just now 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.160
 in the eos 650 the one touchscreen 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.870
 presented which is still movable 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.880
 now this feature offers the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 professional oriented he sex 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.180
 not every tenth if not available 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.090
 These are special points on the 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.450
 Image sensor the live autofocus 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.580
 Keller should be pursued with 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.250
 the 6d an exciting concept one 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.519
 Full format dslr for less than 2000 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.500

 functions that are for home use 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.600
 perfectly adequate nonetheless 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.519
 in direct comparison with the 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.900
 competitor of nikon falls on here 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.580
 and there it is a little bit 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.470
 more restrained and equipped 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.930
 been calculated with pointed pencil 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.830
 for that on the other side has canon 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.600
