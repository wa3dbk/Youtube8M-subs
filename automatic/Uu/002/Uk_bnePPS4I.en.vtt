but that seems to suit you it does

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.019 
but that seems to suit you it does
indeed<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.679> warmer<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:30.219> is<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.520> better<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.880> is

00:01:31.019 --> 00:01:31.029 
indeed the warmer it is the better it is

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:33.989 
indeed the warmer it is the better it is
for<00:01:31.090> me<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.600> really<00:01:32.139> love<00:01:32.319> days<00:01:32.590> when<00:01:33.549> it's<00:01:33.670> it's

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999

sunny<00:01:34.329> there's<00:01:34.689> no<00:01:34.959> wind<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.529> I<00:01:35.770> think<00:01:35.829> that

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
sunny there's no wind and I think that

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.679 
sunny there's no wind and I think that
could<00:01:36.340> be<00:01:36.490> an<00:01:36.639> advantage<00:01:36.880> that<00:01:37.209> i<00:01:37.270> have<00:01:37.450> over

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
could be an advantage that i have over

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:39.029 
could be an advantage that i have over
some<00:01:37.959> of<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.079> other<00:01:38.229> racers<00:01:38.409> who<00:01:38.709> like<00:01:38.859> it<00:01:38.979> a
