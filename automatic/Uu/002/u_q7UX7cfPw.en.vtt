either<00:01:46.240> way<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.640> cross<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.300> border

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
on a daily basis that's it definitely

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.590 
on a daily basis that's it definitely
makes<00:01:51.520> sense<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:52.680> divide<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.830> annual<00:01:54.600> sticker

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
makes sense to divide the annual sticker

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.060 
makes sense to divide the annual sticker
that<00:01:55.870> goes<00:01:56.050> on<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.350> car<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:58.600> as<00:01:58.870> you<00:01:59.110> might

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
that goes on the car but as you might

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.720 
that goes on the car but as you might
notice<00:02:00.850> that<00:02:01.000> this<00:02:01.150> is<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.920> rush<00:02:02.920> hour<00:02:03.130> and<00:02:03.430> even

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
notice that this is a rush hour and even

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.680 
notice that this is a rush hour and even
like<00:02:04.330> I<00:02:04.450> said<00:02:04.630> before<00:02:04.810> this<00:02:05.260> express<00:02:06.010> lane<00:02:06.250> is

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
like I said before this express lane is

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.190 
like I said before this express lane is
quite<00:02:07.690> busy<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.830> traffic

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
quite busy the traffic

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.990 
quite busy the traffic
so<00:02:10.800> far<00:02:11.069> from<00:02:11.250> home<00:02:11.610> I've<00:02:12.090> already<00:02:13.040> been<00:02:14.040> spent

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
so far from home I've already been spent

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.730 
so far from home I've already been spent
and<00:02:15.090> spent<00:02:15.330> about<00:02:15.390> 45<00:02:15.840> minutes<00:02:15.990> already<00:02:16.530> just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
and spent about 45 minutes already just

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.199

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
to get to this point so we haven't even

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:42.250 
to get to this point so we haven't even
cross<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.660> bridge<00:02:18.870> on<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.740> US<00:02:20.430> idea
