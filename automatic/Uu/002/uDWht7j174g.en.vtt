00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.100
 they have a point in common 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello like footage chistorra verdict 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.240
 I wanted to make myself a dishonest politician sandwich but then I gave myself 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.399
 mind that he had too little bread 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.599
 for such purpose 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:18.919
 so I've decided to make a stew 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.929
 it is very simple the first thing we have to do stellar and chop an onion 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.869
 you do not have to be very precise because this is then on the floor and it looks good 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.760
 we also foresee a couple of green peppers 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 four cloves of garlic and pepper 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.150
 despite sometimes up to now little medium with a splash of olive oil 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.749
 while frying, let's peel and chop 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.790
 a tomato 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.040
 I think that in the past this tomato was also brought to me from Navarre and it is 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.040
 huge recommended that you put - tomatoes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.360
 once the traces that he loses 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.660
 merino we remove and let it pass 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.310
 while we have a couple of kicks 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.960
 after we go well 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.940
 if we are going to see them on the floor 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.990
 breaking the already you know that when you break the potato you get that loose 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.780
 more starch and so the sauce has more consistency 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.670
 p 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.360
 p 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.150
 now we cover it with water is not necessary much because the vegetables 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:06.520
 result 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520
 yours 

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.189
 but let's measure in 2011 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:21.349
 you can add it directly but it's always better if you offer them 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.049
 seconds the trickle of olive oil is to be careful 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.970
 so that it does not burn us as soon as it changes its color it withdraws it 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.970
 to the ground 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.800
 do not 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.320
 and now the last touch is thriving is the txistorra 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:57.739
 the oil in a pan does not need to add oil because they will loose their 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.499
 fat and when he welcomed color with them 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:04.569
 in this way the current say that but for them all this race 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:10.269
 and the nose to the stew, as soon as the potatoes are ready, you can remove it 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.269
 so easy to prove san jose that correct eating 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.299
 but he has shown in hug until then 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.109
 efe 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:27.469
