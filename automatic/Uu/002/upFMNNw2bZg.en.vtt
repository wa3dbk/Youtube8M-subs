00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
okay so first I'm going to make a

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.580 
okay so first I'm going to make a
teardrop<00:00:16.680> shape<00:00:17.420> to<00:00:18.420> make<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.660> flame<00:00:19.199> shape

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
teardrop shape to make the flame shape

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.529 
teardrop shape to make the flame shape
and<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.460> know<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> kind<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> fast<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.420> we

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I know this is kind of fast so we

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.990 
and I know this is kind of fast so we
rewind<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.619> I<00:00:22.650> show<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.189> slo-mo

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you'll see how I'm making several short

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.689 
you'll see how I'm making several short
strokes<00:00:27.740> because<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.980> try<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.220> draw<00:00:29.519> it<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
strokes because if I try to draw it in

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.490 
strokes because if I try to draw it in
one<00:00:29.910> single<00:00:30.150> line<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.779> wouldn't<00:00:31.050> look<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.289> nice

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
one single line it wouldn't look as nice

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
one single line it wouldn't look as nice
and<00:00:31.769> curved<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.969> try<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.540> that<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:34.140> you

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and curved so try using that when you

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.400 
and curved so try using that when you
are<00:00:34.530> drawing<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:35.610> flame<00:00:35.940> shape<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:37.230> here<00:00:37.350> we

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
help help characters look cute so that's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.969 
help help characters look cute so that's
pretty<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.500> now<00:01:22.590> all<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> have<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
pretty much it and now all you have to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.120 
pretty much it and now all you have to
do<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> outline<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> I'm<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.890> start

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
do is outline and I'm going to start

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.740 
do is outline and I'm going to start
from<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.369> top<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> slowly<00:01:27.090> work<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.479> way<00:01:27.720> down

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
from the top and slowly work my way down

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
from the top and slowly work my way down
this<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.350> point<00:01:28.829> where<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.220> going<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this is the point where I'm going to

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.149 
this is the point where I'm going to
have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.820> use<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.360> single<00:01:30.869> stroke<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> have

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
have to use a single stroke and have

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.510 
have to use a single stroke and have
more<00:01:32.369> control<00:01:32.520> over<00:01:32.909> my<00:01:33.479> wrist<00:01:33.659> movement<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
more control over my wrist movement and

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.069 
more control over my wrist movement and
then<00:01:35.520> as<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:35.970> closer<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.869> little

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
then as I get closer in it's a little

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.910 
then as I get closer in it's a little
bit<00:01:37.200> easier<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:39.470> little<00:01:40.470> bit<00:01:40.590> smaller

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bit easier because a little bit smaller

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
bit easier because a little bit smaller
and<00:01:41.720> then<00:01:42.720> last<00:01:43.020> mouth<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.189> eyes<00:01:44.750> now<00:01:45.750> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
and then last mouth and the eyes now I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.480 
and then last mouth and the eyes now I
want<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.290> put<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> little<00:01:46.680> bit<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> reflection

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
want to put a little bit of a reflection

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
want to put a little bit of a reflection
on<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.390> eye<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.049> getting<00:01:49.200> my

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
on the eye so I'm getting my

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
on the eye so I'm getting my
medium-sized<00:01:50.040> pin<00:01:50.369> instead<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.850> my<00:01:50.939> Sharpie

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
medium-sized pin instead of my Sharpie

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.080 
medium-sized pin instead of my Sharpie
so<00:01:51.600> draw<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> really<00:01:52.350> small<00:01:52.619> circle<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
so draw a really small circle on the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.450 
so draw a really small circle on the
upper<00:01:54.689> right<00:01:54.899> side<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.189> eye<00:01:56.610> there<00:01:58.460> and

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
upper right side of the eye there and

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.130 
upper right side of the eye there and
