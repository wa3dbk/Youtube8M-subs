when you do it wrong it doesn't let you
in<00:04:27.990> so<00:04:28.380> I<00:04:28.980> must<00:04:29.370> have<00:04:29.520> been<00:04:29.670> a<00:04:29.940> desk<00:04:30.480> with

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
in so I must have been a desk with

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.350 
in so I must have been a desk with
podcasting<00:04:31.520> there<00:04:32.520> we<00:04:32.760> go<00:04:33.050> okay<00:04:35.090> so<00:04:36.090> there<00:04:36.240> you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
podcasting there we go okay so there you

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.820 
podcasting there we go okay so there you
go<00:04:36.390> so<00:04:36.840> if<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:36.990> guess<00:04:37.230> that<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.530> too<00:04:37.710> many

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
go so if you guess that it too many

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.450 
go so if you guess that it too many
times<00:04:38.540> wrong<00:04:39.540> incorrectly<00:04:40.380> on<00:04:40.650> your<00:04:41.250> account

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460

locks<00:04:41.790> down<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.300> you<00:04:42.420> need<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.810> admin<00:04:43.350> to

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
locks down and you need the admin to

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.560 
locks down and you need the admin to
unlock<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.160> there's<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.490> special<00:04:44.760> file<00:04:45.120> on<00:04:45.390> the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
unlock it there's a special file on the

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.830 
unlock it there's a special file on the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
on the server down locker so so that's

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.140 
on the server down locker so so that's
how<00:04:48.960> that<00:04:49.020> works<00:04:49.140> and<00:04:49.920> it's<00:04:50.310> pretty<00:04:50.760> cool

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
how that works and it's pretty cool

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.880 
how that works and it's pretty cool
