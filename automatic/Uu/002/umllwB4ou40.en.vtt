people are running sort of aftermarket

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.980 
people are running sort of aftermarket
electronics<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.120> sort<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.420> know<00:02:19.540> hop<00:02:19.780> up

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
electronics so sort of you know hop up

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
electronics so sort of you know hop up
parts<00:02:20.020> and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
parts and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.789

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.500 
movements over the stock electronics
that<00:02:23.799> exists<00:02:24.280> because<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.700> open<00:02:24.849> source<00:02:25.180> so

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that exists because it's open source so

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.670 
that exists because it's open source so
people<00:02:25.659> are<00:02:25.810> able<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:26.079> take<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.349> original

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
people are able to take the original

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.640 
people are able to take the original
designs<00:02:27.180> improve<00:02:28.180> on<00:02:28.390> them<00:02:28.599> get<00:02:29.079> electronics

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.649 
designs improve on them get electronics
made<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.189> then<00:02:30.310> sell<00:02:30.579> them<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:31.360> know<00:02:31.480> really

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:31.659 
made and then sell them you know really

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.130 
made and then sell them you know really
cheaply<00:02:32.049> twenty<00:02:32.439> thirty<00:02:32.620> dollars<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.989> that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
cheaply twenty thirty dollars so that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.449 
cheaply twenty thirty dollars so that
you<00:02:35.230> can<00:02:35.409> you<00:02:35.680> know<00:02:35.769> keep<00:02:35.950> these<00:02:36.159> old<00:02:36.370> machines

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
you can you know keep these old machines

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.280 
you can you know keep these old machines
going<00:02:37.000> even<00:02:37.239> after<00:02:37.299> they're<00:02:37.540> not<00:02:37.720> supported

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
going even after they're not supported

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.619 
going even after they're not supported
and<00:02:38.530> original<00:02:39.010> parts<00:02:39.310> aren't<00:02:39.700> available<00:02:40.000> and

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
and original parts aren't available and

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.119 
and original parts aren't available and
then<00:02:40.840> there's<00:02:41.019> Jordan<00:02:41.319> Miller<00:02:41.530> who<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.829> taking

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
then there's Jordan Miller who is taking

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:43.589 
then there's Jordan Miller who is taking

ground up and the open source community
and<00:03:25.720> science<00:03:26.169> they're<00:03:26.440> very<00:03:26.709> compatible<00:03:27.400> so

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
and science they're very compatible so

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.559 
and science they're very compatible so

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
everything in science is open anyway so

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.000 
everything in science is open anyway so
it's<00:03:31.569> really<00:03:31.780> good<00:03:32.169> it's<00:03:32.349> been<00:03:32.500> a<00:03:32.530> good<00:03:32.739> merge

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
it's really good it's been a good merge

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.500 
it's really good it's been a good merge
of<00:03:33.280> communities

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.750 

so<00:03:38.049> I've<00:03:38.140> printed<00:03:38.379> three<00:03:38.920> other<00:03:39.189> printers

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
so I've printed three other printers

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.020 
so I've printed three other printers
with<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.390> creature<00:03:40.860> yeah<00:03:42.030> self-replicating

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
with this creature yeah self-replicating

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.300 
with this creature yeah self-replicating
so<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.390> museum<00:03:43.720> of<00:03:43.810> science<00:03:44.079> has<00:03:44.409> worn<00:03:44.709> now<00:03:44.920> I

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
so the museum of science has worn now I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.339 
so the museum of science has worn now I
printer<00:03:45.909> one<00:03:46.030> for<00:03:46.209> my<00:03:46.299> brother<00:03:46.599> and<00:03:46.959> I<00:03:47.049> printed

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
printer one for my brother and I printed

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.199 
printer one for my brother and I printed
the<00:03:47.439> second<00:03:47.799> one<00:03:47.890> for<00:03:48.069> me<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.519> got<00:03:48.970> a<00:03:49.000> buddy

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
the second one for me I got a buddy
