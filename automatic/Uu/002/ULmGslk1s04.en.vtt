00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:38.320 

I<00:02:31.290> am

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.500 

all<00:02:39.330> right<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.540> what<00:02:42.540> comes<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.080> base<00:02:43.290> knob

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
all right so what comes with a base knob

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.810 
all right so what comes with a base knob
and<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.600> bass<00:02:45.810> knob<00:02:46.080> has<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> clipping<00:02:46.980> indicator

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
and a bass knob has a clipping indicator

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.070 
and a bass knob has a clipping indicator
and<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.930> also<00:02:49.140> shows<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.890> voltage<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:51.080> I

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
and it also shows your voltage and I

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.680 
and it also shows your voltage and I
think<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:53.100> has<00:02:53.280> an<00:02:53.520> on/off<00:02:53.760> switch<00:02:54.330> for<00:02:54.360> the

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
think it has an on/off switch for the

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:55.160 
think it has an on/off switch for the
amp

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
amp

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:13.330 
amp
I'm<00:02:55.710> not<00:02:55.920> sure<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.400> think<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.700> does

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.850 

yeah<00:03:14.060> I<00:03:14.300> think<00:03:14.660> you<00:03:14.780> push<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.230> volume<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.800> it

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
yeah I think you push the volume and it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.320 
yeah I think you push the volume and it
turns<00:03:16.099> it<00:03:16.250> off<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:20.030> has<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> voltage<00:03:21.140> meter

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
turns it off so has a voltage meter

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.080 
turns it off so has a voltage meter
clipping<00:03:23.330> indicator<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:25.489> power<00:03:25.760> light

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
clipping indicator and a power light

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.339 
clipping indicator and a power light
shows<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> your<00:03:27.020> amp<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.349> on<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:29.080> I'm<00:03:30.080> pretty

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
shows that your amp is on and I'm pretty

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:32.670 
shows that your amp is on and I'm pretty
sure<00:03:30.590> that<00:03:30.830> if<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.130> push<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.849> turns<00:03:32.120> it<00:03:32.300> off

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
sure that if you push it it turns it off

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.380 
sure that if you push it it turns it off
has<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:34.099> click<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.760> when<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.150> push

grounds<00:05:09.090> one<00:05:09.750> remote<00:05:10.790> right<00:05:11.790> in<00:05:11.910> the<00:05:11.970> middle

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.660 

the<00:05:15.630> other<00:05:15.660> thing<00:05:16.050> I<00:05:16.170> like<00:05:16.350> about<00:05:16.410> this<00:05:16.890> is<00:05:17.520> the

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
the other thing I like about this is the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:23.270 
the other thing I like about this is the
set<00:05:18.120> screws<00:05:18.540> or<00:05:19.580> Phillip<00:05:20.580> head<00:05:21.980> so<00:05:22.980> you<00:05:23.040> don't

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
set screws or Phillip head so you don't

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.020 
set screws or Phillip head so you don't
need<00:05:23.400> to<00:05:23.490> go<00:05:23.640> digging<00:05:23.910> for<00:05:24.060> allen<00:05:24.540> wrenches

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
need to go digging for allen wrenches

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.880 
need to go digging for allen wrenches
as<00:05:27.030> your<00:05:27.420> speaker<00:05:27.690> output<00:05:28.550> terminals<00:05:29.550> now<00:05:30.890> the

as your speaker output terminals now the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.920 
as your speaker output terminals now the
problem<00:05:32.460> with<00:05:32.610> my<00:05:32.790> Rockford<00:05:33.270> amps<00:05:33.630> were<00:05:35.930> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
problem with my Rockford amps were the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.440 
problem with my Rockford amps were the
power<00:05:37.170> and<00:05:37.410> grounds<00:05:37.920> were<00:05:38.100> inset<00:05:38.760> inside<00:05:39.300> of

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
power and grounds were inset inside of

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.110 
power and grounds were inset inside of
the<00:05:39.540> amp<00:05:39.750> so<00:05:40.140> it<00:05:40.620> created<00:05:41.130> problems<00:05:41.190> for<00:05:41.700> me

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
the amp so it created problems for me

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.310 
the amp so it created problems for me
these<00:05:42.630> are<00:05:44.210> outset<00:05:45.210> I<00:05:45.420> guess<00:05:45.780> you<00:05:45.960> could<00:05:46.110> say

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 
these are outset I guess you could say

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:54.340 
these are outset I guess you could say
but<00:05:49.790> this<00:05:50.790> thing<00:05:51.030> is<00:05:51.240> beautiful<00:05:52.970> beautiful

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
but this thing is beautiful beautiful

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:02.619 
but this thing is beautiful beautiful
get<00:05:55.350> that<00:05:55.770> out<00:05:55.890> of<00:05:55.920> the<00:05:56.010> way

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:08.050 

and<00:06:03.629> this<00:06:03.870> then<00:06:04.110> you<00:06:04.319> got<00:06:04.500> all<00:06:04.530> your<00:06:06.229> games

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
and this then you got all your games

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
seven thousand watts but we all know

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:37.040 
seven thousand watts but we all know
this<00:06:31.440> is<00:06:31.710> way<00:06:31.919> off<00:06:32.539> way<00:06:33.539> underrated<00:06:36.050> so

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
this is way off way underrated so

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.219 
this is way off way underrated so
this<00:06:37.259> video<00:06:37.590> is<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> little<00:06:37.979> long<00:06:38.270> but<00:06:39.270> give<00:06:40.080> you

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:40.229 
this video is a little long but give you

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.610 
this video is a little long but give you
a<00:06:40.259> good<00:06:40.500> idea<00:06:41.810> there's<00:06:42.810> the<00:06:43.139> instruction

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
a good idea there's the instruction

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.920 
a good idea there's the instruction
manual

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
manual

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.240 
manual
there's<00:06:45.930> nobody<00:06:46.139> apply<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:46.650> can<00:06:46.919> look<00:06:47.129> at

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
there's nobody apply you can look at

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:52.629 
there's nobody apply you can look at
that<00:06:48.860> so<00:06:49.860> there's<00:06:50.400> another<00:06:50.729> good<00:06:50.819> idea<00:06:51.030> of<00:06:51.569> how

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
that so there's another good idea of how

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.619 
that so there's another good idea of how
how<00:06:53.639> big<00:06:53.940> this<00:06:54.090> thing<00:06:54.150> is

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:54.629 
how big this thing is

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:58.779 
how big this thing is
I<00:06:55.340> mean<00:06:56.340> it's<00:06:56.550> a<00:06:56.669> lot<00:06:56.879> of<00:06:57.090> power<00:06:57.300> right<00:06:57.449> there<00:06:57.690> a

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
I mean it's a lot of power right there a

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:02.930 
I mean it's a lot of power right there a
lot<00:06:59.789> of<00:06:59.819> power<00:07:01.009> and<00:07:02.009> we'll<00:07:02.159> be<00:07:02.280> putting<00:07:02.610> that

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
lot of power and we'll be putting that

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:10.040 
lot of power and we'll be putting that
to<00:07:03.210> them<00:07:03.449> a<00:07:04.969> lot<00:07:05.969> of<00:07:06.150> power<00:07:06.479> going<00:07:06.750> to<00:07:06.870> them<00:07:09.050> so

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
to them a lot of power going to them so

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:15.790 
to them a lot of power going to them so
we'll<00:07:10.229> see<00:07:10.469> how<00:07:10.710> they<00:07:10.889> do

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.860 

so<00:07:16.800> the<00:07:17.040> next<00:07:17.250> video<00:07:17.940> is<00:07:18.300> I'm<00:07:18.540> going<00:07:18.630> to<00:07:18.720> wire

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
so the next video is I'm going to wire

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.890 
so the next video is I'm going to wire
this<00:07:19.110> amp<00:07:19.380> up<00:07:19.700> to<00:07:20.700> my<00:07:20.850> to<00:07:20.910> kinetics<00:07:21.600> right<00:07:21.780> here

this amp up to my to kinetics right here

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.680 
this amp up to my to kinetics right here
just<00:07:24.900> make<00:07:25.080> sure<00:07:25.230> everything<00:07:25.620> turns<00:07:25.650> on<00:07:26.690> no

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:27.690 
just make sure everything turns on no

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.710 
just make sure everything turns on no
problems<00:07:28.760> because<00:07:29.760> I'd<00:07:29.880> hate<00:07:30.060> to<00:07:30.120> install

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 
problems because I'd hate to install

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.180 
problems because I'd hate to install
