00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:05.170
 all this is my vip competition like 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.050
 I knew the videos 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.150
 I showed Benelli this is the 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.039
 great science engine 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:22.599
 because then here it is all offered 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:25.929
 the block here is this block not 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.179
 I knew I didn't know how he could 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:32.950
 still work I don't know why it is 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:35.020
 the piston was really bad 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.160
 where to change them hallucinated now 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 he was pulled away because that's all 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.940
 ruined to change 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.890
 from the 22 automatic marches and to a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.790
 kiss tested in toto to that disk 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.210
 disk of a function as you see it all 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:01:01.500
 the wine of which apple tree is to be thrown away and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:05.590
 there is a 50 cylinder in three sets 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.789
 therefore not surprised by it 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.590
 to save 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:16.440
 this instead they buy everything clean it 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:21.000
 black here and there cardan 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:24.240
 out of the electrical system like 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.910
 see here front czech people 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:37.740
 player yes 16 12 12 goes out to card 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:40.350
 tank all missing carter mufflers 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.590
 for that also changes because the right one 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:51.180
 broken flat holes in short, of everything and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.310
 the extractor was needed to extract the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.660
 fly in April block in two because i 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.270
 pedals, as you can see, then turn empty 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.650
 and you forget the engine you're like 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.920
 here in there is something moving 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.170
 like a spring and so I want to open the 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.070
 block in two and look at relationship limit 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.230
 here and put a site again is a 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.080
 new clutch disc because while 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.380
 he went there and put himself to it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.880
 then turned on and pushed the wheel 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.980
 but immediately the wheel on the stand 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.380
 he went to the 30 per hour he mentions 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.390
 march with mortgages at 30 per hour seen 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.130
 that all broke do cold 50 something 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.330
 but nothing you broke 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.330
 you ca n't do anything 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.920
 then there was the disc working and that's it 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.920
 his video
