00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 our goal now is to fill the 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.019
 corners here of this cube with the green color 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.030
 that our central color here is then 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.690
 how am I going to do this search? 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.140
 First I'll look down here. 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.650
 some green color on the side 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.080
 I found here I already have a small 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.599
 green side issue could be in 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 anywhere and I 'll bring this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.949
 green apple that is here with the color 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.219
 orange 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.450
 I'm going to get one side of the cube that is 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.660
 the orange color is already ready 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 here and I is always the center orange 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 my green part is on the side of here 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.980
 now notice the following I want to bring 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.949
 This vertical piece upwards is easy, right? 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.379
 it's just to do so, just happened to me 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.680
 I took my green little 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.550
 I was already in position to put this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.770
 here in the place 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.140
 I do not want this to happen then the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.200
 What I'm going to do, I'm going to take this piece. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.590
 green that I'm going to get her out of here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.049
 I turned her there now I come here 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:19.830
 underneath and fetch this 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:23.520
 Now I can bring you up there without 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.740
 take off that piece that's okay position let's 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.240
 in the face that another piece to be able to do 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 the same thing 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.920
 good already has here two more pieces in the case 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 I 'll choose this one from here. 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:40.500
 then I'm going to turn here until 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 get on the red side of the hub the chat 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 Stitch I got here on the red side 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.939
 of the body and the same story 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.430
 I'm going to turn here but I do not want to take it 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.759
 that piece that the position I 'm going to make 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.140
 I'm going to take this piece out of this plan. 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.670
 here to spin was not in this 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.159
 that is generating staff then 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.590
 I'm going to take this part out of that plan that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.159
 turns out I came here for now I can 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.310
 to move here the will to take this 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.200
 goal is so verde.La position it and 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.160
 to return everybody here to the place 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.740
 right 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:18.980
 Let's do the same thing with this 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.980
 This green apple is green. 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.720
 I want to bring this piece up here. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.040
 Okay, I'll do the same, I'll go. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.470
 take her here on my interest plan 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.620
 I'm going down there 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.820
 I look that's how I wanted it and now 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.310
 Can I bring everyone who passes? 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.850
 now I only needed this little thing that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.880
 I'll take you to the orange side. 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.330
 because the plan of interest that in the case 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.450
 It's this plan from here so I want to generate 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.460
 this piece accordingly much 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.930
 person's attention because you could 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.970
 to imagine 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.700
 and this movement here but here it goes 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.970
 Bring orange in then it does not work 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 in my plan of interest in the case is this 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.980
 hence I want to bring this piece here 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.710
 Up beauty then let me go back 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.070
 here with a place I'm going to take this piece 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.740
 here is my plan of interest I go there 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.560
 down 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.590
 I look for my green pectin and take it 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.830
 Up there, then, there's already a 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.650
 side fully sells and if you observe 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.440
 here on the side I'll have a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.320
 letter t at this time is so I have one 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.330
 at least one letter t on all sides 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.580
 until the red can have one here 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.990
 letter t 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.970
 white also orange too then it has 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:56.090
 all sides here of my first 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.650
 layer of my body are straight 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.970
 Now I'll show you another one. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.400
 situation 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:05.310
 to complete that the songs to me 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.680
 I went back here, it's still there. 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.020
 a little piece of cake that happens 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.320
 green here unlike the others 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:16.170
 situations that we saw earlier 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.870
 She is not here on the side anymore. 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.320
 it's on the underside of it in my bucket 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.080
 so I can not bring her to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.790
 here with the only turn I would have to give 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.280
 two turns to 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.560
 this piece and I 'm going to mess up the 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.890
 two sides is not the best plus two 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:37.800
 pieces here on my hub good then like 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.170
 I'll do to get this piece that is 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.290
 down here 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.870
 good first thing to do is in case 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:49.410
 that if it is misaligned in the case 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.320
 that rate have this side and I want 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:54.720
 Bring it there then, the first thing that 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.930
 I'll do is align this piece from here 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:04.080
 it is under the position where I 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:09.660
 I want to bring it there, I'm going to escape this piece. 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:15.680
 here in the plan 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:19.880
 I'll bring her back here . 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:23.040
 now it's already in the lateral position 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.590
 How I wish I did too? 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.280
 take it and take it out of my plan 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:32.220
 of interest will play back and forth going 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.400
 upload a set here 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.190
 I'm going to die here following that one. 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.040
 rule in that I have white and the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.620
 blue whiting here choose the white center 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.230
 now I go in that same rule I go 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.070
 take her here on the plane of interest 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.870
 I'm going down the taste of my play 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.870
 and bring it back
