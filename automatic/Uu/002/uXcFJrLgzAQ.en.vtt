flat<00:00:13.320> iron<00:00:13.760> I'm<00:00:14.760> going<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.719> take<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.619> small

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
flat iron I'm going to take a small

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.389 
flat iron I'm going to take a small
section<00:00:18.200> starting<00:00:19.200> in<00:00:19.290> the<00:00:19.410> front<00:00:22.399> holding

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
section starting in the front holding

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.700 
section starting in the front holding
some<00:00:23.610> of<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.849> back<00:00:24.149> I'm<00:00:24.390> using<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.869> CD<00:00:25.439> iron

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
some of this back I'm using a CD iron

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.569 
some of this back I'm using a CD iron
today<00:00:26.149> I'm<00:00:27.149> going<00:00:27.540> to<00:00:27.869> start<00:00:28.680> at<00:00:29.009> the<00:00:29.250> root<00:00:29.399> of

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
today I'm going to start at the root of

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.040 
today I'm going to start at the root of
the<00:00:29.700> hair<00:00:30.259> running<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.380> iron<00:00:31.619> over<00:00:32.099> it

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
the hair running the iron over it

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.160 
the hair running the iron over it
quickly<00:00:34.609> and<00:00:35.609> slowly<00:00:35.969> bringing<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:36.929> to

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
quickly and slowly bringing it down to

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.540 
quickly and slowly bringing it down to
the<00:00:37.260> ends<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:40.559> very<00:00:40.800> important<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.460> you're

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
doing this that you take small sections

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.270 
doing this that you take small sections
to<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.350> optimal<00:00:46.859> amount<00:00:47.039> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
to get the optimal amount of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.110 
to get the optimal amount of
straightness<00:00:47.969> for<00:00:48.839> the<00:00:48.929> hair<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.670> really

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
straightness for the hair and you really
