00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560
 welcome to a group that we serve and this time ten reigns a week in the 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.640
 facts about the solar system number ten the gravity of the sun is the 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.400
 greatest power in a radius of two years of life and that is half of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.859
 distance to the nearest strong the number 9 there exist 5 2 planets c'est 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.109
 mutoh mackay go smoothly and there is 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.410
 so was a non-existent dwarf planet that was conceived for the fuss 

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:25.669
 when he explains it in the job of mercury 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:29.829
 the guard jupiter the yaris and then they can all have unfortunately these are 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.309
 to do and on too dark to see from the earth they show no less than 53 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.250
 moons of which two can be found in 7 number seven the job and salary of 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.770
 Saturn is also his lawyer that water management works everything 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 this is caused by the gravity of saturn and the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.120
 underground victory in this way number six there are around 535,000 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.100
 mini-planets with a diameter of one kilometer or less every month are introduced 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.720
 around 3,000 from each member of monty paid and named after themselves again in the summer 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.290
 and continue with number five 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.320
 we actually live in the atmosphere of the sun this becomes one 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.840
 Ordinary called the north lies here is the proof of this lies mainly 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.940
 caused by solar winds number four 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.350
 it was collaris there is a crater of 13 100 kilometers in diameter that created 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.580
 is a giant meteorite impact on mercury the shock waves twisted 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.120
 other side of the pole meter making it just as powerful number three 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.610
 mercury is not the hottest a week for our solar system because the 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.730
 absence of an atmosphere prevents heat from being retained 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.440
 fer is on the other hand have reached the temperature of 465 degrees celsius 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.910
 number two sometimes volckaert asteroids and stones can march to the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.840
 earth swinging these normally come on antartica or in the sahara 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.890
 rightly the oldest ever found is 45 billion years old and then you walk in with it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 the earth revolves around its axis at 450 meters per second revolves around the sun at 30 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.250
 kilometers per second and sways around in the center of the solar system with a 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.070
 speed of 220 kilometers per second 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.820
 one sailing trip a day about 21 million 639 1744 kilometers throughout 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.560
 ensemble them again 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.630
 so you the top ten non-existent countries exist I have a list of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.010
 made and I see this video below while this video the app you 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.440
 phone or tablet then turn on your device to view the songs 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.600
 the description look for more mind-boggling fact opwijk analyst sees 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.209
 your next time goodbye
