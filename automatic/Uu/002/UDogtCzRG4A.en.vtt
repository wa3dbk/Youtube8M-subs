00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello I show in this video 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.420
 how to make an extension like 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.250
 this one to do this we will need 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.809
 of an electrical outlet so we will have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.740
 recovered per year on a washing machine 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.120
 a TV or others with both sons 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.590
 so we will cut the cable both 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.520
 son that we will have lines d for example 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.390
 thanks to a multifunctional clamp like 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.680
 those who is able to do it 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.250
 then we will need a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.880
 screwdriver for him that's the whole system 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.440
 is a case like those offering 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.440
 so a female electrical outlet 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:43.680
 so when we look at the system of 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 boxes we have there we see two entries 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 possible 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 this is this one so just 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.879
 unscrew the two vices this one is 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.360
 that there that keep the wires 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 normally the interior with the time of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:11.670
 visit just now this is like 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:17.909
 this to put one of the two cables in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.439
 the ain and the second in the other and 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.970
 of course according to the system of housings 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 you do not just have to connect 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.920
 son to the system one must also think about 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.479
 insert the fluid into the housing as 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.210
 this one we can see this belly 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.439
 so we pass the wire inside 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.729
 like that and sannois 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.240
 once the cable has passed into the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.600
 case we put the first cable in the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.030
 stricter rookie here and then we 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.470
 screw they see us the first haye 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.290
 well screwed cable that holds one has more than 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.600
 to connect the second son 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:00.119
 identically to this milestone there then 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:02.640
 elvis and so we hold an extension in 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.350
 spare parts but already functional 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.429
 ie granted and sectors 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.250
 so if I plugged that side I 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.930
 can get current here just 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.989
 so to close the case that here he 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.780
 we still have to screw up seven screws and 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.950
 this one in the name of what then a 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.190
 homemade extension is operational 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190
 see you soon
