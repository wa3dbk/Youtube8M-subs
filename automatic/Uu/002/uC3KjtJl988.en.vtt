00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this video is to answer the question

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.030 
this video is to answer the question
what<00:00:03.240> is<00:00:03.449> that<00:00:03.810> thing<00:00:04.110> attached<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.830> bar

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
what is that thing attached to the bar

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.789 
what is that thing attached to the bar
while<00:00:05.310> you're<00:00:05.460> lifting<00:00:05.960> it's<00:00:06.960> the<00:00:07.200> gym<00:00:07.560> aware

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
while you're lifting it's the gym aware

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.930 
while you're lifting it's the gym aware
unit<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:09.110> monitors<00:00:10.110> bar<00:00:10.469> speed<00:00:10.940> power

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
unit that monitors bar speed power

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.680 
unit that monitors bar speed power
output<00:00:12.480> force<00:00:13.080> all<00:00:13.799> sorts<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.340> data<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
output force all sorts of data and you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.599 
output force all sorts of data and you
can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:16.890> from<00:00:17.130> my<00:00:17.250> squat

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
can see this this is from my squat

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.179 
can see this this is from my squat
session<00:00:18.029> last<00:00:18.510> week<00:00:18.630> we've<00:00:19.619> been<00:00:19.770> using<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
session last week we've been using the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.330 
session last week we've been using the
ECC<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.720> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> what<00:00:22.410> results<00:00:22.859> heavy

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
ECC to do a lot of what results heavy

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.359 
ECC to do a lot of what results heavy
speed<00:00:24.000> work<00:00:25.099> basically<00:00:26.099> have<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:27.289> velocity

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
speed work basically have a velocity

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.349 
speed work basically have a velocity
threshold<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.580> as<00:00:29.699> long<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:30.029> you're<00:00:30.179> staying

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
threshold and as long as you're staying

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.620 
threshold and as long as you're staying
with<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.949> can<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.040> be<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.189> fan<00:00:32.460> first<00:00:33.360> rep

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
with that can you be a fan first rep

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.000 
with that can you be a fan first rep
there<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.870> hit<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.410> can<00:00:34.530> see<00:00:34.620> highlighted

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there I hit it you can see highlighted

see this is my last workout here's a
graph<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.979> last<00:01:17.220> set<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.939> saw

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
graph of the last set that you just saw

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
graph of the last set that you just saw
it's<00:01:19.020> mean<00:01:19.200> power<00:01:19.470> output<00:01:19.890> lower<00:01:20.580> right-hand

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

of those force and vertical distance and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.330 
of those force and vertical distance and
this<00:01:30.180> next<00:01:30.420> one<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> velocity<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.009> vertical

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
this next one is velocity and vertical

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
this next one is velocity and vertical
distance<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.939> numerous<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.900> we<00:01:34.079> can

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
distance there's numerous that we can

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
distance there's numerous that we can
pull<00:01:34.470> them<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.740> at<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> primarily<00:01:35.610> we're

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pull them look at it primarily we're

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.230 
pull them look at it primarily we're
using<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.360> instantaneous<00:01:37.079> feedback<00:01:37.290> and

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
using the instantaneous feedback and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.219 
using the instantaneous feedback and
thresholds<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.479> set<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> guide<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
thresholds we have set to guide the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.940 
thresholds we have set to guide the
workouts<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.540> every<00:01:43.049> lifter<00:01:43.680> so

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
workouts but we do have every lifter so

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
workouts but we do have every lifter so
I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.399> 100<00:01:44.549> plus<00:01:44.909> lifters<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.329> our<00:01:45.570> database

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
I think 100 plus lifters in our database

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.609 
I think 100 plus lifters in our database
from<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.100> database<00:01:47.340> we<00:01:47.700> can<00:01:47.820> run<00:01:48.000> reports<00:01:48.149> on

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
from that database we can run reports on

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.609 
from that database we can run reports on
projected<00:01:49.619> max<00:01:50.329> peak<00:01:51.329> performance<00:01:51.869> times<00:01:52.170> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
projected max peak performance times and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.109 
projected max peak performance times and
maxes<00:01:53.520> as<00:01:53.810> well<00:01:54.810> as<00:01:55.250> really<00:01:56.250> dial<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.729> people's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
maxes as well as really dial in people's
