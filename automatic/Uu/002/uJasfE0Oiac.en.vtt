it<00:00:04.650> is<00:00:04.890> quite<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.220> big<00:00:05.580> and<00:00:05.760> intense<00:00:06.270> program

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
it is quite a big and intense program

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.759 
it is quite a big and intense program
it's<00:00:07.680> over<00:00:08.220> three<00:00:08.550> years<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.269> first<00:00:09.960> year<00:00:10.349> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
it's over three years the first year the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.100 
it's over three years the first year the
majority<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.460> what<00:00:11.760> students<00:00:12.450> are<00:00:12.509> doing<00:00:12.570> is

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
majority of what students are doing is

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.120 
majority of what students are doing is
theory<00:00:13.919> although<00:00:14.459> they<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:15.590> 200<00:00:16.590> practice

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
theory although they have 200 practice

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.800 
theory although they have 200 practice
hours<00:00:17.340> then<00:00:17.910> in<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.150> second<00:00:18.690> year<00:00:18.780> it's<00:00:19.530> about

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
hours then in the second year it's about

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.960 
hours then in the second year it's about
50/50<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.410> third<00:00:22.740> year<00:00:23.099> it's<00:00:23.340> pretty

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
50/50 and in the third year it's pretty

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.790 
50/50 and in the third year it's pretty
much<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.420> practice<00:00:25.019> worth<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.439> several

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
much all practice worth with several

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.439 
much all practice worth with several
large<00:00:26.010> assignments<00:00:26.340> for<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> students<00:00:27.300> to

large assignments for the students to

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.870 
large assignments for the students to
get<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.779> it's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.590> four-year<00:00:28.859> degree<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.609> it's

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
get in it's a four-year degree but it's

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.140 
get in it's a four-year degree but it's
run<00:00:30.179> over<00:00:30.660> three<00:00:30.990> calendar<00:00:31.619> years<00:00:31.650> long<00:00:32.250> years

the<00:00:33.720> students<00:00:34.080> start<00:00:34.320> at<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.620> end<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.070> January

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
the students start at the end of January

the students start at the end of January
and<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:35.790> work<00:00:35.940> right<00:00:36.150> through<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
and they work right through to the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.720 
and they work right through to the
middle<00:00:36.720> of<00:00:36.810> December<00:00:37.040> we<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.430> some

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
middle of December we do have some

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
middle of December we do have some
breaks<00:00:39.060> aligned<00:00:39.810> with<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> primary<00:00:40.470> school

holidays<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:41.970> really<00:00:42.120> times<00:00:42.450> for

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
holidays but they're really times for

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000 
holidays but they're really times for
students<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> catch<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.620> their<00:00:43.770> work

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
students to catch up on their work

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.120 
students to catch up on their work
rather<00:00:44.430> than<00:00:44.580> actual<00:00:45.060> holiday<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.710> any<00:00:46.890> one

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
rather than actual holiday and any one

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.980 
rather than actual holiday and any one
week<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.730> student<00:00:47.970> probably<00:00:48.390> works<00:00:48.810> at

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:48.990 
week at the student probably works at

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.710 
week at the student probably works at
least<00:00:49.200> 40<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.740> 50<00:00:50.070> hours<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.880> when<00:00:51.420> they're<00:00:51.600> on

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
least 40 to 50 hours and when they're on

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.990 
least 40 to 50 hours and when they're on
call<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.380> they're<00:00:52.530> maybe<00:00:52.710> at<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> booth<00:00:53.220> then

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
call and they're maybe at a booth then

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.670 
call and they're maybe at a booth then
it's<00:00:54.390> quite<00:00:54.540> likely<00:00:54.630> that<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.140> might<00:00:55.290> go<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.470> to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
it's quite likely that it might go up to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.280 
it's quite likely that it might go up to
about<00:00:55.830> 60<00:00:56.310> years<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.630> quite<00:00:57.810> variable

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
about 60 years so it's quite variable

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.470 
about 60 years so it's quite variable
and<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:59.040> little<00:00:59.280> bit<00:00:59.370> difficult<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.850> identify

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and a little bit difficult to identify

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.660 
and a little bit difficult to identify
each<00:01:00.510> week<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.170> planned<00:01:01.530> each<00:01:01.980> week<00:01:02.220> what<00:01:02.520> it's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
each week or planned each week what it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
each week or planned each week what it's
going<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.409> mainly<00:01:04.409> because<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going to be like mainly because of the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.920 
going to be like mainly because of the
on-call<00:01:05.309> air<00:01:05.549> speed

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.530 

our<00:01:09.470> program<00:01:09.920> is<00:01:10.160> a<00:01:10.190> four-year<00:01:10.790> degree<00:01:11.090> which

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
our program is a four-year degree which

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.840 
our program is a four-year degree which
we<00:01:11.720> delivered<00:01:12.320> in<00:01:12.410> three<00:01:12.650> years<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:13.550> deliver

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
we delivered in three years we deliver

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.910 
we delivered in three years we deliver
it<00:01:14.000> by<00:01:14.450> process<00:01:14.870> of<00:01:14.990> blended<00:01:15.320> learning<00:01:15.350> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
it by process of blended learning and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.320 
it by process of blended learning and
what<00:01:16.010> that<00:01:16.160> means<00:01:16.370> is<00:01:16.580> that<00:01:16.610> students<00:01:17.120> can

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
what that means is that students can

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.670 
what that means is that students can
actually<00:01:17.480> stay<00:01:17.810> at<00:01:17.930> home<00:01:18.140> while<00:01:18.500> they<00:01:18.620> do

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
actually stay at home while they do

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.110 
actually stay at home while they do
their<00:01:18.920> degree<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:19.550> they<00:01:19.700> don't<00:01:19.880> have<00:01:20.000> to

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
their degree so they don't have to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.030 
their degree so they don't have to
uplift<00:01:20.450> their<00:01:20.600> family<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.230> move<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.620> Dunedin

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
uplift their family and move to Dunedin

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.190 
uplift their family and move to Dunedin
for<00:01:22.220> three<00:01:22.400> years<00:01:22.760> and<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.600> way<00:01:23.690> we<00:01:23.840> do<00:01:24.020> there

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
for three years and the way we do there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.050 
for three years and the way we do there
is<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.830> series<00:01:25.490> of<00:01:25.520> satellites

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
is we have a series of satellites

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.460 
is we have a series of satellites
throughout<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:26.450> country<00:01:26.840> Whanganui

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
throughout the country Whanganui

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.530 
throughout the country Whanganui
Palmerston<00:01:28.400> North<00:01:28.430> Wellington<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.480> the

Palmerston North Wellington and the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.800

North Island Dunedin Central Otago in

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.160 
North Island Dunedin Central Otago in
and<00:01:32.990> Vacarro<00:01:33.380> in<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.560> South<00:01:33.800> Island<00:01:34.010> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
and Vacarro in the South Island and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.960 
and Vacarro in the South Island and
students<00:01:36.170> really<00:01:36.320> apply<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.010> which<00:01:37.730> he<00:01:37.880> was

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
students really apply to which he was

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.270 
students really apply to which he was
satellites<00:01:38.480> is<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.170> closest<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.860> where<00:01:40.130> they

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
satellites is the closest to where they

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.760 
satellites is the closest to where they
live<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.600> the<00:01:41.750> idea<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.170> the<00:01:42.350> students

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
live so the idea is that the students

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.800 
live so the idea is that the students
can<00:01:43.010> sit<00:01:43.610> at<00:01:43.730> home<00:01:43.910> for<00:01:44.210> a<00:01:44.240> lot<00:01:44.330> of<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.600> work

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
can sit at home for a lot of the work

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.660 
can sit at home for a lot of the work
it's<00:01:45.170> a<00:01:45.260> flexible<00:01:45.740> model<00:01:46.040> which<00:01:46.220> means<00:01:46.490> they

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
it's a flexible model which means they

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.910 
it's a flexible model which means they
can<00:01:46.820> choose<00:01:47.090> when<00:01:47.360> they<00:01:47.390> want<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:48.530> work<00:01:48.710> around

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
can choose when they want to work around

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.520 
can choose when they want to work around
childcare<00:01:49.490> or<00:01:49.790> other<00:01:49.970> work<00:01:50.210> commitments<00:01:50.780> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
childcare or other work commitments and

processes the blended learning is a just
a<00:01:55.610> combination<00:01:55.910> of<00:01:56.570> different<00:01:57.050> ways<00:01:57.260> of

a combination of different ways of

a combination of different ways of
looking<00:01:58.070> at<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.060> content<00:01:59.480> that's<00:01:59.660> required

looking at the content that's required
in<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.350> program<00:02:00.800> we've<00:02:01.190> gone<00:02:01.400> through<00:02:01.460> and

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
in the program we've gone through and

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.240 
in the program we've gone through and
we've<00:02:02.120> worked<00:02:02.300> out<00:02:02.540> what<00:02:03.500> can<00:02:03.650> students<00:02:04.010> learn

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
we've worked out what can students learn

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.120 
we've worked out what can students learn
online<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:05.030> their<00:02:05.180> own<00:02:05.530> what<00:02:06.530> do<00:02:06.680> they<00:02:06.800> need<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
online on their own what do they need to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.190 
online on their own what do they need to
be<00:02:07.250> doing<00:02:07.400> in<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.760> discussion<00:02:08.200> reflective

practice and so on in a small group in
what<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.380> they<00:02:12.500> need<00:02:12.710> to<00:02:12.830> be<00:02:12.860> doing<00:02:13.100> face<00:02:13.459> to

what do they need to be doing face to
face<00:02:13.790> in<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.090> larger<00:02:14.450> group<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.930> this<00:02:15.700> bringing

face in a larger group and this bringing

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.790

all<00:02:16.940> of<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.239> together<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.900> really<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> blended

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
all of it together is really the blended

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.660 
all of it together is really the blended
program<00:02:19.570> we<00:02:20.570> have<00:02:20.810> intensive<00:02:21.770> so<00:02:22.130> it's<00:02:22.400> face

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
program we have intensive so it's face

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.760 
program we have intensive so it's face
to<00:02:22.880> face<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.510> then<00:02:23.720> we<00:02:23.900> also<00:02:24.080> have<00:02:24.440> a<00:02:24.470> lot<00:02:24.739> of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
to face and then we also have a lot of

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.880 
to face and then we also have a lot of
online<00:02:25.670> learning<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.600> online<00:02:26.810> lectures<00:02:27.590> and

online learning and online lectures and
then<00:02:28.130> practice<00:02:28.550> based<00:02:29.060> experience<00:02:29.690> so<00:02:29.840> you're

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
then practice based experience so you're

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.540 
then practice based experience so you're
in<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.170> community<00:02:30.650> working<00:02:31.220> with<00:02:31.370> the

doing<00:02:33.680> placements<00:02:34.400> it's<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.760> really<00:02:34.970> good

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
doing placements it's a really good

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.850 
doing placements it's a really good
blended<00:02:35.420> model

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.740 

the<00:02:38.430> biggest<00:02:38.760> advantages<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.600> it's

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the biggest advantages that it's

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.450 
the biggest advantages that it's
flexible<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.440> people<00:02:40.680> can<00:02:40.890> stay<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.250> home

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
flexible in that people can stay at home

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.820 
flexible in that people can stay at home
and<00:02:41.700> their<00:02:41.850> home<00:02:42.030> town<00:02:42.660> where<00:02:43.140> they<00:02:43.350> love<00:02:43.530> and

and their home town where they love and

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.950 
and their home town where they love and
not<00:02:44.220> have<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.490> move<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.790> Dunedin<00:02:45.240> and<00:02:45.390> ideally

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
going to end up practicing in the

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.510 
going to end up practicing in the
communities<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.320> they<00:02:49.470> live<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.400> they

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
communities that they live in so they

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.340 
communities that they live in so they
get<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:50.970> midwives<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:51.840> women<00:02:52.140> in<00:02:52.230> the

quite a lot you know the hours are quite

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.770 
quite a lot you know the hours are quite
irregular<00:03:28.710> and<00:03:29.100> it's<00:03:29.910> a<00:03:30.000> little<00:03:30.210> bit<00:03:30.330> hard<00:03:30.600> to

irregular and it's a little bit hard to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.420 
irregular and it's a little bit hard to
know<00:03:30.930> what<00:03:31.440> would<00:03:31.530> be<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:31.800> average<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.340> would

hours a week probably but there would be
