there<00:03:51.410> cuz<00:03:51.650> she'd<00:03:51.799> be<00:03:51.920> entitled<00:03:53.079> good<00:03:54.079> luck

with<00:03:54.350> her<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:55.010> know<00:03:55.130> working<00:03:55.370> on<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.670> base

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
with her you know working on that base

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.910 
with her you know working on that base
it<00:03:56.630> looks<00:03:56.810> like<00:03:56.930> a<00:03:56.959> good<00:03:57.110> big<00:03:57.290> wide-open<00:03:57.470> space

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
it looks like a good big wide-open space

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.140 
it looks like a good big wide-open space
which<00:03:58.130> is<00:03:58.160> probably<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.579> limitation<00:03:59.060> of

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
which is probably the limitation of

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.009 
which is probably the limitation of
coming<00:03:59.420> from<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.690> side<00:04:00.640> okay<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:02.750> next<00:04:02.840> one

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
coming from the side okay the next one

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.600 
coming from the side okay the next one
is<00:04:03.380> going<00:04:03.620> to<00:04:03.769> be

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610

is going to be
hypercity<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.770> so<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.010> play<00:04:08.370> is<00:04:08.430> Hypercity

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
hypercity and so the play is Hypercity

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:19.270 
hypercity and so the play is Hypercity
so<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.810> look<00:04:09.990> hyp<00:04:10.740> hyp<00:04:12.620> e<00:04:14.120> rc8<00:04:16.669> and<00:04:17.930> the

to protect your gold and your town hall

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.420 
to protect your gold and your town hall
it's<00:04:48.900> very<00:04:49.020> easy<00:04:49.290> it's<00:04:49.710> relatively<00:04:50.100> easy<00:04:50.160> to

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
it's very easy it's relatively easy to

take one or the other protecting both is

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.230 
take one or the other protecting both is
difficult<00:04:53.460> and<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.700> reason<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.150> won't

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240

hard<00:06:09.989> father<00:06:10.349> for<00:06:10.769> wards<00:06:11.009> so<00:06:11.729> let<00:06:12.179> me<00:06:12.239> go

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
hard father for wards so let me go

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.509 
hard father for wards so let me go
through<00:06:12.509> the<00:06:12.599> good<00:06:12.749> things<00:06:12.929> and<00:06:13.369> things<00:06:14.369> i

through the good things and things i

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.399 
through the good things and things i
think<00:06:14.610> probably<00:06:14.909> need<00:06:15.119> to<00:06:15.209> improve<00:06:15.509> so

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
think probably need to improve so

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.919 
think probably need to improve so
firstly<00:06:17.189> these<00:06:18.179> won't<00:06:18.449> be<00:06:18.539> very<00:06:18.689> effective

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:18.929 
firstly these won't be very effective

00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:21.469 
firstly these won't be very effective
because<00:06:19.469> the<00:06:19.949> wall<00:06:20.550> break<00:06:20.729> is<00:06:20.879> now<00:06:21.029> our<00:06:21.209> splash

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
because the wall break is now our splash

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:22.999 
because the wall break is now our splash
damage<00:06:21.719> they'll<00:06:22.110> take<00:06:22.319> out<00:06:22.529> both<00:06:22.769> of<00:06:22.919> those

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:23.009 
damage they'll take out both of those

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.070 
damage they'll take out both of those
pieces<00:06:23.249> at<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.550> same<00:06:23.789> time<00:06:23.999> what<00:06:24.809> I've<00:06:24.899> seen

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
pieces at the same time what I've seen

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.359 
pieces at the same time what I've seen
quite<00:06:25.319> a<00:06:25.439> lot<00:06:25.589> is<00:06:26.539> squares<00:06:27.539> with<00:06:27.839> a<00:06:27.869> space<00:06:28.249> in<00:06:29.249> a

00:06:29.359 --> 00:06:29.369 
quite a lot is squares with a space in a

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:31.189 
quite a lot is squares with a space in a
corner<00:06:29.699> because<00:06:29.879> the<00:06:30.419> splash<00:06:30.719> damage<00:06:30.929> doesn't
