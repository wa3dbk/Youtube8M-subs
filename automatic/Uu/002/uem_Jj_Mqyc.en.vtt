he's got a nice yeah he's got his hips
and<00:02:22.160> its<00:02:22.340> basis<00:02:23.060> therefore<00:02:23.390> she<00:02:23.750> strives<00:02:24.080> on

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
and its basis therefore she strives on

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.110

coordination<00:02:26.540> so<00:02:26.750> when<00:02:26.960> I<00:02:26.990> throw<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.290> ball

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
coordination so when I throw the ball

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160 
coordination so when I throw the ball
he's<00:02:28.640> an<00:02:28.790> accountant<00:02:29.240> throw<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.630> back<00:02:29.780> just<00:02:29.990> as

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
he's an accountant throw it back just as

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.330 
he's an accountant throw it back just as
if<00:02:30.290> there's<00:02:30.470> an<00:02:30.590> opening<00:02:30.950> if<00:02:31.010> he's<00:02:31.130> throwing

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
if there's an opening if he's throwing

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.910 
if there's an opening if he's throwing
shots<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.540> it's<00:02:33.170> really<00:02:33.320> putting<00:02:33.680> everything

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
shots so it's really putting everything

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.220 
shots so it's really putting everything
together<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.580> mean<00:02:35.120> a<00:02:35.150> lot<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.360> trainers<00:02:35.720> focus

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
together I mean a lot of trainers focus

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.980 
together I mean a lot of trainers focus
on<00:02:37.090> fundamentals<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.210> mechanics<00:02:38.630> and<00:02:38.780> stuff

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
on fundamentals and mechanics and stuff

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.650 
on fundamentals and mechanics and stuff
as<00:02:39.470> far<00:02:39.680> as<00:02:39.710> body<00:02:39.980> mechanics<00:02:40.520> go<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:41.450> them

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
as far as body mechanics go with them

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.930 
as far as body mechanics go with them
exercises<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.380> conditioning<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.310> like<00:02:43.820> to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
exercises and conditioning but I like to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.700

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
work with a lot of coordination I think

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.830 
work with a lot of coordination I think
that's<00:02:45.830> kind<00:02:46.070> of<00:02:46.130> data<00:02:46.420> aspect<00:02:47.420> of<00:02:47.540> fighting

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
that's kind of data aspect of fighting

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.810 
that's kind of data aspect of fighting
that<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.590> too<00:02:48.740> many<00:02:48.770> trainers<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.640> put

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820
