00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.959
 but where as this 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.849
 the amazing and spiderman one of 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.070
 the most famous superheroes of marvel the 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.680
 bite from a radioactive spider gave 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.230
 peter parker amazing superpowers 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.630
 as super activities and strength sutras 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.640
 a valid instinct that warns you of the 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.400
 dangers and in some versions in the 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.269
 history the ability to challenge cobwebs 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.390
 of your dolls but what happens in life 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.290
 real when there overflowed by a 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.040
 radioactive 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:45.320
 the truth is that not much really or 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.630
 rather not much of the symptoms 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.030
 usual symptoms that occur when being bitten 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.430
 for an arachnid began a 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.340
 redness or swelling and in 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.590
 some occasions depending on the type 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.260
 of spider that await you some 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.190
 more serious symptoms including losses 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.130
 of conscience or death 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.180
 power the radioactivity because it would be 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.270
 Irrelevant 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.580
 the world is flooded with radiation every 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.220
 year we are exposed to more or less 3 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:18.320
 millisieverts mostly coming 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.380
 of the sun and thanks to managers 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.270
 natural as radon price without taking 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.560
 account the dose of procedures 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.470
 doctors like tomographies 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 computerized that equals 6 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.580
 Milisieverts mammograms that are 0.4 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.760
 milisievert are x-rays is 10 points 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.770
 2016 even things as normal as a 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.369
 flight to nobody to be able to give you a dose 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:47.409
 of 0.01 millisieverts and a smoker 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.079
 regular would receive 53 milisievers per year 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.920
 the amount of radiation contained in the 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:58.090
 money from a spider would contain 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:01.539
 80,000 03 milisievers an amount 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.459
 practically negligible is in fact 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.799
 the same amount of radiation as 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.990
 absorbs salt eat a banana which 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.459
 contains the radioactive isotope potassium 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.160
 40 still the reductive creatures if 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.930
 there is particularly the forests that 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 They are in the vicinity of 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.989
 recognized damaged of chernobil in 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.730
 ukraine as well as in sweden and finland 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.750
 where the radiation levels fell 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.720
 after the incident of 1916 here is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.299
 to make a distinction 6 radiator 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.910
 exposed to radiation is not the same 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.730
 that is radioactive which means that you 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.739
 body contains radioactive material 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.680
 but even one reactive creature more 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.810
 big as for example a bear a wolf 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.209
 I would not have enough radioactivity 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.230
 in your system as to mean 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:56.680
 a risk to your health although I am not 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.959
 quite dangerous in your life even more 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.110
 common is that animals or assets 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:04.629
 radioactive plants which absorb 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.390
 radioactive waste from air or water 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:09.280
 polluted from the subsoil although the 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.769
 Bite of an insect will not tire you 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.290
 radioactive poisoning consume 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.650
 too much contaminated flora and fauna and 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.840
 he will do it in Belarus and ukraine cows and 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.030
 contaminated steers moments heals 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.790
 never until the concentrations of 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.780
 dangerous isotopes their bodies are going to 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.980
 levels below the threshold intended 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.410
 recently a population of with their 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.569
 games to love the hunters the serious 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.720
 when they presented higher levels of 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.940
 radiation than the acceptable average after 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.220
 that they ate mushrooms with high 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.500
 radiation concentration 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.260
 radioactive animals present a 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.930
 highest birth defect rate 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.030
 than the usual birds that live near 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.370
 Chernobyl has presented more brains 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.920
 small that their counterparts in others 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.460
 habitats and insects frequently 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:03.790
 in colored oil even so even the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.280
 sotos by the tenth most powerful the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.220
 unstable forms of strontium coupons 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.190
 cesium and iodine are not able to cause 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.370
 spectacular mutations at the level of 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.590
 tribes presents marvel 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.799
 since the radiation is very much 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.989
 more effective to kill cells for 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.950
 transfigure them in some way that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.750
 prove useful 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.790
 reports of people who have been 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.020
 bitten by radioactive animals 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.610
 large in three cases however states 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.980
 a few years ago a man who 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.140
 worked cleaning the vicinity of 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.080
 Chernobyl was attacked by a dog 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:44.070
 radioactive street man had to 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.070
 be hospitalized immediately 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.199
 guilt of rage 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.780
 and since there is no header in the 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:54.080
 newspaper of the amazing man but 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.639
 rescuing children from burning houses 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.610
 we can assume that that was something nice 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:03.620
 that transcended the case many times 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.699
 forever 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.699
 we will see in the future 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.400
