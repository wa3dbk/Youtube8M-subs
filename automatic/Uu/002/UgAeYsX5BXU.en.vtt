00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
from saving a life and I think there's a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.609 
from saving a life and I think there's a
loyalty<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.910> comes<00:00:27.180> back<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.960> because

just think that more people should get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.230 
just think that more people should get
out<00:01:27.720> there<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.110> rescue<00:01:28.470> an<00:01:28.979> animal<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.700> think

out there and rescue an animal I think

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
out there and rescue an animal I think
that<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.600> reason<00:01:30.630> why<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.079> organization<00:01:31.979> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that the reason why this organization is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580 
that the reason why this organization is
so<00:01:32.310> good<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.079> people<00:01:34.200> get

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
so good is because a lot of people get

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.170 
so good is because a lot of people get
overwhelmed<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.520> search<00:01:35.790> when<00:01:36.060> they're

overwhelmed in their search when they're

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.120 
overwhelmed in their search when they're
looking<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> specific<00:01:36.990> thing<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.920> this
