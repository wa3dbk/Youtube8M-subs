00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
nose tackle position I think it should

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
nose tackle position I think it should
be<00:00:18.630> also<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.170> note<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:19.890> not<00:00:20.039> just<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.600 
wallace gilberry had played last year

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and then eventually am on Gordon had

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.760 
and then eventually am on Gordon had
taken<00:00:32.910> over<00:00:33.000> for<00:00:33.329> late<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.140> season<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
taken over for late in the season to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.590 
taken over for late in the season to
play<00:00:34.950> next<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.340> Allen<00:00:35.670> Bailey<00:00:36.059> along<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
play next to Allen Bailey along the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600 
play next to Allen Bailey along the
defensive<00:00:36.719> line<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.440> specific<00:00:37.860> defense

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
defensive line in that specific defense

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.459 
defensive line in that specific defense
but<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.870> probably<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
but there's probably going to be a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.380 
but there's probably going to be a
rotation<00:00:40.710> during<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> season<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.239> will

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
rotation during the season but it will

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.729 
rotation during the season but it will
be<00:00:42.420> interesting<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.110> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.469> end<00:00:43.500> of

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
be interesting to see at the end of

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.830 
be interesting to see at the end of
training<00:00:44.040> camp<00:00:44.340> who's<00:00:44.910> taken<00:00:45.360> over<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
training camp who's taken over as the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.160 
training camp who's taken over as the
first<00:00:46.289> team<00:00:46.860> guy<00:00:47.129> in<00:00:47.430> both<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.210> those<00:00:48.360> defenses

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
first team guy in both of those defenses

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.690 
first team guy in both of those defenses
and<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.739> think<00:00:49.950> it'll<00:00:50.100> be<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.460> news<00:00:50.670> for

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
and I think it'll be good news for

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
and I think it'll be good news for
Chiefs<00:00:51.180> fans<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:52.230> car<00:00:52.440> repo<00:00:52.739> beats<00:00:53.129> out<00:00:53.309> am

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
on Gordon that could mean really special

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
on Gordon that could mean really special
things<00:00:56.039> for<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.370> defense<00:00:56.820> if<00:00:57.000> Dontari<00:00:57.420> Poe

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
things for this defense if Dontari Poe

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.750 
things for this defense if Dontari Poe

Siler<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> Jovan<00:01:06.840> Belcher<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.560> think<00:01:08.100> Brandon

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
Siler and Jovan Belcher I think Brandon

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.609 
Siler and Jovan Belcher I think Brandon

sylars torn Achilles injury in the
preseason<00:01:11.040> last<00:01:11.400> year's<00:01:11.670> kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.030> gotten

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
preseason last year's kind of gotten

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
preseason last year's kind of gotten
lost<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.860> know<00:01:13.950> we<00:01:14.070> had<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.220> huge

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
lost as you know we had the huge

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
lost as you know we had the huge
injuries<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> ACL<00:01:15.720> crew<00:01:16.080> last<00:01:16.710> season

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
injuries with the ACL crew last season

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
injuries with the ACL crew last season
with<00:01:17.159> Tony<00:01:17.430> Moeaki<00:01:17.759> Eric<00:01:18.390> Berry<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> Jamaal

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with Tony Moeaki Eric Berry and Jamaal

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
with Tony Moeaki Eric Berry and Jamaal
Charles<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.740> think<00:01:19.860> Tyler's<00:01:20.820> injury<00:01:21.210> may

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Charles so I think Tyler's injury may

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.020 
Charles so I think Tyler's injury may
have<00:01:21.689> gotten<00:01:21.900> lost<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.470> little<00:01:22.619> bit<00:01:22.830> but<00:01:23.549> I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
have gotten lost a little bit but I

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.380 
have gotten lost a little bit but I
think<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> if<00:01:25.830> he's<00:01:26.280> healthy<00:01:26.549> he<00:01:27.000> does<00:01:27.210> have

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
think that if he's healthy he does have

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.030 
think that if he's healthy he does have
a<00:01:27.420> role<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:27.960> defense<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:28.799> when<00:01:28.950> he

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
a role in this defense I think when he

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.950 
a role in this defense I think when he
was<00:01:29.159> brought<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.520> last<00:01:29.729> year<00:01:30.000> he<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.900> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
was brought in last year he was going to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.960 
was brought in last year he was going to
kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.259> have<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:32.070> coverage<00:01:32.520> ability

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
kind of have that that coverage ability

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
kind of have that that coverage ability
from<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> linebacker<00:01:33.689> position<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.409> Javon

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
from the linebacker position that Javon

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.340 
from the linebacker position that Javon
Belcher<00:01:35.210> doesn't<00:01:36.210> necessarily<00:01:36.810> have<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.200> he's

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Belcher doesn't necessarily have is he's

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
Belcher doesn't necessarily have is he's
more<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.770> run-stuffing<00:01:38.430> guy<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.659> do

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
more of a run-stuffing guy but I do

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.020 
more of a run-stuffing guy but I do
think<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.890> should<00:01:41.189> be<00:01:41.250> worth<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.670> noting

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
think that it should be worth of noting

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.330 
think that it should be worth of noting
that<00:01:42.180> if<00:01:42.720> Javon<00:01:43.229> Belcher<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> lose

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that if Javon Belcher is going to lose

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.010 
that if Javon Belcher is going to lose
his<00:01:44.610> starting<00:01:44.820> position<00:01:45.119> Brandon<00:01:45.720> Sylas

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
his starting position Brandon Sylas

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.929 
his starting position Brandon Sylas
going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.200> take<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.560> over<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:47.070> not<00:01:47.579> just

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
going to take that over it's not just

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.910 
going to take that over it's not just
the<00:01:48.060> physical<00:01:48.240> abilities<00:01:48.990> on<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.439> field<00:01:49.740> that

the physical abilities on the field that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.800

battling<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.130> know<00:02:47.250> on<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.430> same<00:02:47.640> team<00:02:47.940> for

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
battling you know on the same team for

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.509 
battling you know on the same team for
that<00:02:48.780> starting<00:02:49.140> position<00:02:49.560> for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.069> Chiefs<00:02:50.370> I

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
that starting position for the Chiefs I

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.860 
that starting position for the Chiefs I
think<00:02:50.730> it's<00:02:50.850> great<00:02:50.970> news<00:02:51.180> for<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> Chiefs

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
think it's great news for the Chiefs

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.170 
think it's great news for the Chiefs
because<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.800> can't<00:02:53.069> have<00:02:53.280> too<00:02:53.519> much<00:02:53.670> depth<00:02:54.000> in

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
because you can't have too much depth in

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.940 
because you can't have too much depth in
a<00:02:54.269> secondary<00:02:54.720> when<00:02:54.989> got<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.410> have<00:02:55.530> guys<00:02:55.680> like

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
a secondary when got you have guys like

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.590 
a secondary when got you have guys like
Peyton<00:02:56.310> Manning<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.670> philip<00:02:56.970> rivers<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.480> your

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
Peyton Manning and philip rivers in your

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.390 
Peyton Manning and philip rivers in your
division<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.410> can<00:02:58.560> never<00:02:58.650> have<00:02:58.920> enough<00:02:59.190> good

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
division you can never have enough good

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.550 
division you can never have enough good
quality<00:02:59.880> defensive<00:03:00.330> backs<00:03:00.569> I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.410> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
quality defensive backs I think the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.070 
quality defensive backs I think the
recent<00:03:01.950> arrest<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.910> Donald<00:03:03.269> Washington<00:03:03.810> may

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
recent arrest of Donald Washington may

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.009 
recent arrest of Donald Washington may
not<00:03:05.069> necessarily<00:03:05.190> affect<00:03:06.180> those<00:03:06.569> two<00:03:06.870> guys

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
not necessarily affect those two guys

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.600 
not necessarily affect those two guys
but<00:03:07.319> it<00:03:07.470> does<00:03:07.620> free<00:03:07.890> up<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.130> little<00:03:08.370> bit<00:03:08.489> of

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
but it does free up a little bit of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.610 
but it does free up a little bit of
competition<00:03:08.850> in<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.510> defensive<00:03:09.900> backfield<00:03:09.930> I

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
competition in the defensive backfield I

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.990 
competition in the defensive backfield I
don't<00:03:10.799> think<00:03:10.860> Donald<00:03:11.310> Washington's<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:11.940> to

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
don't think Donald Washington's going to

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000 
don't think Donald Washington's going to
make<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.269> team<00:03:12.420> after<00:03:12.630> this<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.890> think

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
make the team after this and I think

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.729 
make the team after this and I think
between<00:03:14.459> minzy<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.329> arenas<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.650> know

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
between minzy and arenas you know

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.440 
between minzy and arenas you know
competing<00:03:17.040> for<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.459> starting<00:03:17.820> position<00:03:18.209> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
competing for that starting position and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.270 
competing for that starting position and
then<00:03:18.780> having<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.049> quality<00:03:19.470> depth<00:03:19.709> guy<00:03:19.920> behind

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
then having a quality depth guy behind

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.770 
then having a quality depth guy behind
them<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.640> think<00:03:20.910> that<00:03:21.000> means<00:03:21.180> good<00:03:21.329> things<00:03:21.390> for

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
them I think that means good things for

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.530 
them I think that means good things for
the<00:03:21.810> defensive<00:03:22.230> backfield<00:03:22.350> and<00:03:22.940> another<00:03:23.940> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540

he was in college or does he find a
specific<00:05:16.090> position<00:05:16.510> work<00:05:17.140> there<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.980> know

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
specific position work there you know

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.800 
specific position work there you know
for<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.340> most<00:05:18.400> for<00:05:19.060> most<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.360> his<00:05:19.480> reps

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
for the most for most of his reps

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.900 
for the most for most of his reps
because<00:05:20.260> there<00:05:20.650> wasn't<00:05:21.040> just<00:05:21.190> during<00:05:21.700> the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
because there wasn't just during the

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.760 
because there wasn't just during the
season<00:05:22.360> that<00:05:22.480> Jeff<00:05:22.660> Allen<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:23.440> know<00:05:23.560> at

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
season that Jeff Allen you know at

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:25.620 
season that Jeff Allen you know at
Illinois<00:05:24.160> last<00:05:24.460> year<00:05:24.610> played<00:05:24.910> left<00:05:25.540> tackle

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
Illinois last year played left tackle

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.260 
Illinois last year played left tackle
left<00:05:26.229> guard<00:05:26.470> right<00:05:26.860> guard<00:05:27.100> right<00:05:27.370> tackle<00:05:27.820> it

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
left guard right guard right tackle it

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.450 
left guard right guard right tackle it
was<00:05:28.450> in<00:05:28.570> this<00:05:28.660> it<00:05:28.900> was<00:05:28.990> on<00:05:29.110> same<00:05:29.620> series<00:05:30.190> they

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
was in this it was on same series they

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.040 
was in this it was on same series they
moved<00:05:30.700> him<00:05:30.820> all<00:05:31.030> over<00:05:31.060> the<00:05:31.390> place<00:05:31.600> from<00:05:31.780> play

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
moved him all over the place from play

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.500 
moved him all over the place from play
to<00:05:32.080> play<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:33.430> think<00:05:33.490> that<00:05:33.669> versatility<00:05:34.240> is

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
to play and I think that versatility is

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.790 
to play and I think that versatility is
gonna<00:05:34.660> be<00:05:34.750> great<00:05:34.870> for<00:05:35.140> the<00:05:35.229> Chiefs<00:05:35.470> but<00:05:35.710> it

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
gonna be great for the Chiefs but it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.140 
gonna be great for the Chiefs but it
will<00:05:35.950> be<00:05:36.040> interesting<00:05:36.250> to<00:05:36.460> see<00:05:36.700> where<00:05:36.970> he's

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
will be interesting to see where he's

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.240 
will be interesting to see where he's
taking<00:05:37.510> his<00:05:37.630> snaps<00:05:37.900> once<00:05:38.229> the<00:05:38.500> twins<00:05:38.919> training

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
taking his snaps once the twins training

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.310 
taking his snaps once the twins training
camp<00:05:39.460> begins<00:05:39.820> so<00:05:40.510> that<00:05:40.780> is<00:05:40.870> definitely<00:05:40.900> a

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
camp begins so that is definitely a

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.560 
camp begins so that is definitely a
battle<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:41.800> look<00:05:41.919> out<00:05:42.100> for<00:05:42.130> but<00:05:42.880> I<00:05:43.060> assume<00:05:43.540> that

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
battle to look out for but I assume that

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.510 
battle to look out for but I assume that
Ryan<00:05:44.470> Lil's<00:05:44.680> is<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.040> win<00:05:45.160> that<00:05:45.310> battle

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
Ryan Lil's is going to win that battle

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.370 
Ryan Lil's is going to win that battle
and<00:05:45.760> you're<00:05:45.850> going<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.000> see<00:05:46.240> with<00:05:46.900> Jeff<00:05:47.200> Allen
