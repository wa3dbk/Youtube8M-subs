not really need Wystan like that

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.669 
not really need Wystan like that
so<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.999> also<00:02:05.210> good<00:02:05.659> just<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.109> have<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.319> on<00:02:06.649> a

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
so it's also good just to have it on a

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.059 
so it's also good just to have it on a
slightly<00:02:07.149> you<00:02:08.149> know<00:02:08.269> I'm<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.890> know<00:02:10.009> it

slightly you know I'm you know it

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.309 
slightly you know I'm you know it
doesn't<00:02:10.310> mean<00:02:10.399> to<00:02:10.580> be<00:02:10.610> so<00:02:10.849> wide<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:12.140> has<00:02:12.290> a

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
doesn't mean to be so wide it has a

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.559 
doesn't mean to be so wide it has a
metal<00:02:12.650> rod<00:02:12.890> on<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.220> back<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.730> allow<00:02:14.209> you<00:02:14.269> to

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
so it's a little my blog right here the

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.320 
so it's a little my blog right here the
build<00:02:22.040> quality<00:02:22.099> on<00:02:22.489> this<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.910> really<00:02:23.150> well

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
build quality on this is really well

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.330 
build quality on this is really well
done<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.959> not<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.349> good<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.739> as<00:02:25.160> it

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
done it is not really good but as it

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.550 
done it is not really good but as it
would<00:02:25.610> look<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.299> so<00:02:26.870> i'll<00:02:26.959> go<00:02:27.170> like<00:02:27.349> the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
would look to it so i'll go like the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.619 
would look to it so i'll go like the
look<00:02:27.799> and<00:02:28.069> design<00:02:28.340> just<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.239> look<00:02:29.360> at<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
look and design just to look at the

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.530 
look and design just to look at the
overall<00:02:29.900> case<00:02:30.230> for<00:02:31.010> Stan<00:02:31.310> but<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.269> bad<00:02:32.390> thing

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
overall case for Stan but the bad thing

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.880 
overall case for Stan but the bad thing
about<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.780> stand<00:02:32.989> like<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.170> said<00:02:33.349> is<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.680> size

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
about the stand like I said is the size

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.890 
about the stand like I said is the size
somewhat<00:02:34.370> might<00:02:34.580> throw<00:02:34.790> some<00:02:34.940> people<00:02:35.090> off<00:02:35.330> me

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
somewhat might throw some people off me

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.940 
somewhat might throw some people off me
it's<00:02:36.049> not<00:02:36.110> a<00:02:36.170> problem<00:02:36.379> because<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:36.860> is

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
it's not a problem because this is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.979 
it's not a problem because this is
something<00:02:37.069> i'm<00:02:37.340> using<00:02:37.610> my<00:02:37.640> house<00:02:37.910> not<00:02:38.599> at<00:02:38.780> work

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530
