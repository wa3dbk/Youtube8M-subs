00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
did but I just remember I had an issue

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.370 
did but I just remember I had an issue
knock<00:01:41.320> back<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.860> few<00:01:41.890> times

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.830 

and<00:01:44.670> once<00:01:45.670> he's<00:01:45.820> dead<00:01:46.329> I'm<00:01:46.390> gonna<00:01:46.509> move<00:01:46.719> to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and once he's dead I'm gonna move to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.779 
and once he's dead I'm gonna move to
this<00:01:46.990> door<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.560> then<00:01:48.399> you're<00:01:48.520> just<00:01:48.579> going<00:01:48.729> to

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789 
this door and then you're just going to

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:50.100 
this door and then you're just going to
run<00:01:48.969> straight<00:01:49.149> for<00:01:49.329> it<00:01:49.539> make<00:01:49.750> sure<00:01:49.780> the<00:01:49.899> game

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
run straight for it make sure the game

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.969 
run straight for it make sure the game
saves<00:01:50.439> but<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:52.000> run<00:01:52.210> straight<00:01:52.720> forward<00:01:53.140> now

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
saves but just run straight forward now

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.230 
saves but just run straight forward now
you<00:01:54.039> can<00:01:54.250> take<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.460> rubber<00:01:54.700> band<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.119> your

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
you can take a rubber band to your

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.950 
you can take a rubber band to your
controller<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:57.000> rubber<00:01:58.000> band<00:01:58.270> it<00:01:58.390> forward<00:01:58.840> I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
controller and rubber band it forward I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.940 
controller and rubber band it forward I
guess<00:01:59.229> you<00:01:59.350> could<00:01:59.469> tape<00:01:59.679> it<00:01:59.970> good<00:02:00.970> at<00:02:01.090> taping

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
guess you could tape it good at taping

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.980 
guess you could tape it good at taping
and<00:02:02.950> put<00:02:03.490> something<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.090> heavy<00:02:04.270> but<00:02:04.780> you're

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
and put something on it heavy but you're

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.210 
and put something on it heavy but you're
just<00:02:05.140> going<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.289> want<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:05.560> keep<00:02:05.710> running

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
just going to want to keep running

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.770 
just going to want to keep running
forward<00:02:06.670> and<00:02:06.880> that<00:02:07.750> it'll<00:02:08.019> show<00:02:08.050> you<00:02:09.269> you<00:02:10.269> just

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
forward and that it'll show you you just

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.440 
forward and that it'll show you you just
keep<00:02:11.080> getting<00:02:11.370> force<00:02:12.370> points<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.180> pretty

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
keep getting force points it's pretty

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.180 
keep getting force points it's pretty
slow<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.260> isn't<00:02:14.410> something<00:02:14.769> that<00:02:14.950> you

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
slow so this isn't something that you

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.729 
slow so this isn't something that you
can<00:02:15.220> just<00:02:15.630> leave<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.690> for<00:02:16.840> five<00:02:17.140> minutes<00:02:17.410> and

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
can just leave it for five minutes and

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.320 
can just leave it for five minutes and
come<00:02:17.890> back<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.340> have<00:02:18.519> all<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:18.760> force<00:02:18.970> powers

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
come back and have all the force powers

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.610 
come back and have all the force powers
this<00:02:19.540> will<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.959> probably<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
this will take you probably like a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.490 
this will take you probably like a
couple<00:02:20.950> hours<00:02:21.069> to<00:02:21.340> get<00:02:21.610> all<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.880> them<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.500> think

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
couple hours to get all of them I think

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.400 
couple hours to get all of them I think
over<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> course<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.760> an<00:02:24.849> hour<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.060> got<00:02:25.410> 40,000

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
over the course of an hour I got 40,000

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.490 
over the course of an hour I got 40,000
points<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.360> if<00:02:28.780> you're<00:02:28.989> going<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.349> school

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
points so if you're going to school

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.870 
points so if you're going to school
you're<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:29.950> sleep<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.519> something

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
you're going to sleep this is something

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.930 
you're going to sleep this is something
you<00:02:30.970> can<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:32.110> uh<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:33.370> you're<00:02:33.549> tried<00:02:33.760> this

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
you can do but uh if you're tried this

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.280 
you can do but uh if you're tried this
already<00:02:34.090> then<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.630> know<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.780> you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
already then you will know that you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.309 
already then you will know that you
don't<00:02:35.470> want<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.709> put<00:02:35.860> your<00:02:35.980> controller<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.640> a

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
don't want to put your controller on a

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.300 
don't want to put your controller on a
table<00:02:38.319> or<00:02:38.440> anything<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.860> want<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.069> put<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.250> on

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
table or anything you want to put it on

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.789 
table or anything you want to put it on
something<00:02:39.549> soft<00:02:39.849> because<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.269> vibrates<00:02:40.959> or

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
something soft because it vibrates or

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.920 
something soft because it vibrates or
you<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.069> to<00:02:42.130> turn<00:02:42.220> vibrations<00:02:42.790> off<00:02:42.970> it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
you want to turn vibrations off it's

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.589 
you want to turn vibrations off it's
good<00:02:44.049> idea<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:45.370> that's<00:02:46.060> pretty<00:02:46.209> much<00:02:46.329> it
