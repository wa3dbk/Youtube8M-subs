so<00:06:25.080> he<00:06:25.259> and<00:06:25.409> Duane<00:06:25.589> I<00:06:26.279> guess<00:06:26.669> a<00:06:26.699> couple<00:06:26.939> of

00:06:27.109 --> 00:06:27.119 
so he and Duane I guess a couple of

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:28.369 
so he and Duane I guess a couple of
other<00:06:27.209> brothers<00:06:27.599> in<00:06:27.749> the<00:06:27.839> Lord<00:06:27.869> and<00:06:28.169> play
