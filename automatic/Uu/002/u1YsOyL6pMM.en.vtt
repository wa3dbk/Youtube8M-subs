get<00:01:18.990> near<00:01:19.229> one<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.619> hear<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.280> it's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
get near one and hear one I think it's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090 
get near one and hear one I think it's
probably<00:01:20.729> their<00:01:20.970> best<00:01:21.210> advertisement<00:01:22.200> so

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
probably their best advertisement so

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.109 
probably their best advertisement so
let's<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.369> into<00:01:23.549> some<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> facts<00:01:23.939> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.570 
these are 2 ohm resistance I think you
look<00:02:43.560> at<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.800> front<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> have<00:02:44.430> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
look at in front of you so if you have a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.940 
look at in front of you so if you have a
factory<00:02:45.180> head<00:02:45.660> unit<00:02:45.690> that's<00:02:46.080> 2<00:02:46.320> ohm<00:02:46.470> you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
factory head unit that's 2 ohm you

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.050 
factory head unit that's 2 ohm you
should<00:02:47.160> be<00:02:47.280> set<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.489> roll<00:02:47.700> if<00:02:47.850> you<00:02:47.910> have<00:02:48.000> an

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
should be set to roll if you have an

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000 
should be set to roll if you have an
aftermarket<00:02:48.690> head<00:02:48.989> unit<00:02:49.290> also<00:02:49.500> putting<00:02:49.890> out

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
aftermarket head unit also putting out

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.350 
aftermarket head unit also putting out
to<00:02:50.190> them<00:02:50.370> these<00:02:50.580> are<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.820> work<00:02:50.880> with<00:02:51.209> it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
to them these are going to work with it

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.910 
to them these are going to work with it
so<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:52.080> know<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.350> resistance<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
so you know the resistance of the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.080 
so you know the resistance of the
speaker<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> very<00:02:53.580> important<00:02:53.970> sometimes

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
speaker is very important sometimes

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.490 
speaker is very important sometimes
gonna<00:02:54.360> be<00:02:54.450> hard<00:02:54.630> once<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.870> start<00:02:55.080> mixing<00:02:55.230> and

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
gonna be hard once you start mixing and

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.870 
gonna be hard once you start mixing and
matching<00:02:55.620> things<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.160> find<00:02:56.370> speakers<00:02:56.760> going

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
matching things to find speakers going

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.580 
matching things to find speakers going
to<00:02:56.940> work<00:02:57.120> with<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.330> specific<00:02:57.540> head<00:02:58.019> unit<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.500> if

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
to work with a specific head unit so if

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.530

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
so again in terms of installation like I

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.690 
so again in terms of installation like I
said<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.740> can<00:05:07.919> range<00:05:08.010> anywhere<00:05:08.190> from<00:05:08.460> one<00:05:08.669> to

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
quickly but I think most of you looking

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.480 
quickly but I think most of you looking
to<00:05:52.020> do<00:05:52.140> just<00:05:52.380> a<00:05:52.440> simple<00:05:52.650> speaker<00:05:53.160> upgrade

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
to do just a simple speaker upgrade

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.700 
to do just a simple speaker upgrade
should<00:05:54.090> be<00:05:54.270> able<00:05:54.390> to<00:05:54.540> get<00:05:54.780> this<00:05:54.900> done<00:05:55.110> quickly

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
should be able to get this done quickly

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.680 
should be able to get this done quickly
and<00:05:55.830> because<00:05:56.729> these<00:05:57.000> speakers<00:05:57.270> play<00:05:57.479> nicely

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
and because these speakers play nicely

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
the factory Harley stuff if you decide

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.340 
the factory Harley stuff if you decide
you<00:05:59.729> want<00:05:59.910> a<00:05:59.940> later<00:06:00.240> upgrade<00:06:00.750> into<00:06:01.050> it<00:06:01.169> into

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
you want a later upgrade into it into

more<00:06:02.040> hog<00:06:02.370> tune<00:06:02.669> stuff<00:06:02.970> everything<00:06:03.510> plugs<00:06:03.840> and

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
more hog tune stuff everything plugs and

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.659 
more hog tune stuff everything plugs and
plays<00:06:04.169> really<00:06:04.410> nicely<00:06:04.530> so<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.220> think<00:06:05.460> it's<00:06:05.640> a

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:05.669 
plays really nicely so I think it's a

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
the ease of installation my opinion is

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
the ease of installation my opinion is
not<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.540> only<00:06:09.750> one<00:06:09.870> that<00:06:09.960> matters<00:06:10.200> though
