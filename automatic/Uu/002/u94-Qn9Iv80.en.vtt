 greenpeace games 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.709
 gold and credits 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.920
 mmo gaming specialist with fighting prizes 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.509
 euro truck simulator 2 1 like me 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.520
 like to change Feierabendbierchen game 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.770
 because you can simply annoy is 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.660
 take a hand on via sd and then do 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.510
 Let's start this calendar with other churches 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.920
 can hold and then I leave 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.230
 I'm not so emulators find that though 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 somehow I find the game already 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.420
 slightly interesting, especially because you 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.620
 but it can build a lot of shit 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.989
 also pretty serious 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.690
 has had during the proof of demo 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.489
 pretty desperate because I am 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.159
 constantly driven against somewhere 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.530
 have fun and had so there went 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:54.890
 I sometimes broke and there were 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.780
 also a tolerant end result so it 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.949
 is guaranteed even better than 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.839
 actually a lot of fun 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:05.059
 also cool as they are the so 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.159
 have designed the environment or even the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.960
 vehicles 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.310
 I really liked that but I did 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.040
 I have to say something I do not like 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.680
 actually is the partial 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.660
 So unrealistic is when you look at yourself 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.970
 now too far with the so if you 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.450
 Now the car is driving back 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.430
 put as perpendicular and with the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.620
 cab drives you closer and closer 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.300
 actually no water can hold so 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.090
 no follower from there comes either 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.640
 or so is currently experiencing so 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.470
 I think that's just unrealistic 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 but seen more realistic simulators 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 other liquid has a lot to his team 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.440
 fun it can then recommend anyone 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.690
 hayes and authors play or just 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.510
 only shelled would answer massively 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.380
 wants to drive through the area 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.300
 I think it's outrageous if that 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.300
 player would cost more than 25 euros 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.680
 but below that is a blog price me 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.590
 But that's why I wanted it for that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.150
 Buy price though not now 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.700
 buy or buy a buy recommendation 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.869
 symbol authors alone alone right 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.030
 I had three fun 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.590
 months so one day is enough from 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.630
 dancing I can already now 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.979
 no longer bother about the game 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.930
 music was strong in the restaurant 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.890
 So then led that mock dolls and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.780
 for you the next time you shoot norm 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.780
 from 10 on you have fun
