00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.620
 Henkes Linde Group a video of Lear's number is now a topic and me 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.010
 not sure if that at all Alpiq over now foreseeable that 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.129
 can be big 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.249
 our entire team at Video Porsche can read or maybe not 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.379
 give them tips or complain it to eyeglass wearers 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.060
 I have not talked so long so negligent from experience 

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.920
 never when I was a boy 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.340
 You know but I can give some tips on Lanza where I would respect grape 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.089
 would or on one too for me 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:32.509
 Of course I say so, that's what they have 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.800
 Carburettor 3 4 5 and Jamil Feinermann 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.210
 what I pay attention to so if the ship probably keeps every detail of Vettel 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.289
 becomes his bestseller 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:43.300
 but that is, so to speak, holds out 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.940
 because I would wait if I wear glasses 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.750
 So firstly, it was not on the eyebrows 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.780
 I know Mr. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.610
 So of course I always think about it but I try my eyes because of it 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.530
 always follow suit 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.559
 at Schönherr 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.350
 that they get a bit more dollars out of the Erni glasses because they 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.100
 indirectly even over it but so 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.629
 At least try to follow suit a bit, or even that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.550
 they all taped all or something trying to bring up 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.400
 I read that and eyebrows are problems 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.210
 I tried a little more he should at the same time into the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.170
 simultaneously 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.550
 right into the climate is that through the glasses I have the feeling that that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.549
 already an i3 on Felfernig chips in the ball you can really see 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.330
 also story you can see the animal is Jerry Yang in Brandis then you see 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.260
 like the eyebrow center is yes 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.660
 and that's why one lately a bit uphill so not clear 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.730
 more have a little low shoes 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.550
 Percent May dec. Oliver Lepsius stylized 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.310
 then I would say everything probably affects many 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 when the rich eye make-up fades and theirs totally on or so stands 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.780
 or so 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.890
 more if you even touched I had that bit of pop light 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.290
 it is changing or a certain ready 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.630
 Pay attention that the colors are not as doll areas for example 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.210
 later red prelate it may be less appropriate Pincus 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.500
 Attention to ablate or Blue Ausseerland the hall also a bit 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.710
 clearer or something 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.760
 So I'm really trying to keep up with the color a bit 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.159
 stay with them how much they are our turquoise 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.799
 and I like him founder of the train is an army spokesman I have Gernhardt 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.269
 Again, a little green if you can see 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.400
 Under Georg Braun as coach and many of you have more black students 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.339
 or dark blue or in this hour 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:22.789
 Aabar in case he just has red glasses do not be surprised if the 

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:27.299
 has red glasses and turned on in the hold revealed to be looked awry so have 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.839
 I also pay attention to it 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:31.069
 Daniel 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.659
 both hit thing but then as he goes in the direction of it so we the 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.369
 others too 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:37.939
 percent 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.540
 if you are really doing well as the current approach was 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.449
 So he's the first real Nuclear Safety Assist on another skinny one 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.449
 so that I would do that but otherwise 

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:51.550
 who feed 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.580
 Brünemeyer Berlin a bit stronger and more appropriate and indeed 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:03:00.199
 Ambilight also again a super example ahead only for econda of work 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.069
 pay attention 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.510
 in that he had himself or Karben this new kind or so 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.349
 Maybe or have the feeling that people look directly into your eyes 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.369
 Of course, we do not have any small brand on Live 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.629
 and even if this was not only me but anyway only for Werder 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.190
 or even claims 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.360
 Wiegmann, so pay attention 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.620
 Council action biomarker fiction and truth over Sun was a plane that 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.829
 she as a sexual 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.319
 Yesterday it was hot escape it was a plane so deep I that the piece 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.059
 dismayed or so we could not get there in the approach area 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:38.800
 Airport again so Ferber 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620
 I can predict that was so 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.600
 Soso blue Wortelmann comfort in writing read our his FNP 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.669
 Stefan Silar so if the Valais comes her for example, that annually 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.090
 one of the local council election 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.489
 I think that falls on a pair of glasses so that's how it works 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.890
 The Bernese but synonymous but I think if you are on Arte 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.379
 also on Bahrain still dollars on it 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.730
 so that Enemy so they are not so full "The black eye rings type or EMI 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:04.689
 as well as said 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:06.059
 for now and soldiers 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:09.459
 Oldorf tried to help or that it made no sense to stick with 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.339
 High school student this waterfall put in this case act or so 

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.339
 So then if I pay attention to it 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:18.909
 and 54 right together and while paying attention to the malleable purpose there was to 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:19.509
 example 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.509
 others, Reus had delinquent goalkeeper Manuel new 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.050
 it is still ok 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.300
 I am also careful to be careful if you do not say it here 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.940
 far high comes dwindling 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.550
 if you look through the book, you'll find that they're a wee bit odd choice 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.419
 I have the feeling that the corners should dance a bit to the corners 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.500
 the races knew something forward bohemian I would find them pretty 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.210
 stupid 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.960
 For example, it did not mean that the Ruhrstadt was our mission 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.220
 so far above that her tenant can be seen protecting myself 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.300
 Students already as students they describe themselves as very beautiful 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.080
 called 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.960
 and the second in shape from all over the world has changed 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.820
 One should not go out over the tearful or Gucci 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:58.560
 hear 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 Pölten Wien bring construction work on these bags 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.340
 Form of Kitas I do not know if and how difficult the possible clean the 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.000
 Girls might look pretty stupid like me at home 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.940
 Men or so the more negative consequences fat Auermann swung over here 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.339
 Glasses edge more over 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.740
 So I'm limiting 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.360
 that's what lately I'm not paying attention to 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.650
 It's never been a dolles faux-pas that's why 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.929
 I hope that it was so that he no longer offers such a lot here 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:32.370
 helpful but I can be similar to real ones 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.970
 true to the Swedes Weichen there is a lot too expensive son could was 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.000
 also the citizens in the format on the Brandt have and what he likes 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.240
 Xing finnish expensive too expensive 5 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.729
 Green Tree, yes, not such a fair if, however, 1 movies etc partitions but one 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:49.979
 have with the show at times 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:53.870
 I do not feel sorry for Michel Feind over the first thing she did 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.210
 from the winner band to the tutorial 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.210
 and that was really cool then she too 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.009
 it just subscribed to it but yes that is now already 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.839
 have to contribute with the video too expensive or something 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:13.639
 honest pardonable danger that Lehmann Landau fashion so there and 

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:17.409
 Chief Commissioner frivolously free jazz until next time
