the<00:01:57.479> sng<00:01:58.049> is<00:01:58.770> more<00:01:59.219> meant<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.740> tactical<00:02:01.740> use

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
the sng is more meant for a tactical use

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.389 
the sng is more meant for a tactical use
I<00:02:02.829> like<00:02:03.460> self-defense<00:02:03.939> or<00:02:04.630> maybe<00:02:05.560> soldiers

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
I like self-defense or maybe soldiers

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.100 
I like self-defense or maybe soldiers
use<00:02:06.759> because<00:02:08.880> it<00:02:09.880> doesn't<00:02:10.239> add<00:02:10.420> up<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.840> lot<00:02:10.989> of

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
use because it doesn't add up a lot of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.280 
use because it doesn't add up a lot of
way<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.349> the<00:02:11.819> already<00:02:12.819> heavy<00:02:13.920> equipment<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
way to the already heavy equipment that

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.880 
way to the already heavy equipment that
so<00:02:17.290> there<00:02:17.530> might<00:02:18.160> be<00:02:18.220> carrying<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.620> it's<00:02:20.620> very

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
so there might be carrying and it's very

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.120 
so there might be carrying and it's very
comfortable<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.030> pocket<00:02:22.060> because<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:22.900> it

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
comfortable in the pocket because of it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.470 
comfortable in the pocket because of it
slim<00:02:24.130> profile<00:02:26.130> it's<00:02:27.130> really<00:02:27.430> too<00:02:27.640> easy<00:02:28.209> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
slim profile it's really too easy to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.759 
slim profile it's really too easy to
slide<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:30.630> it's<00:02:31.630> secure<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.440> really

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
slide in but it's secure and really

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.539 
slide in but it's secure and really
tight<00:02:33.069> in<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.489> pocket<00:02:33.880> if<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:36.130> pull<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.430> out

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
tight in the pocket if to pull it out

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:39.780 
tight in the pocket if to pull it out
you<00:02:36.790> need<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.450> little<00:02:37.780> bit<00:02:37.930> over<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.790> snap

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
you need a little bit over a snap

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.789 
you need a little bit over a snap
because<00:02:40.780> this<00:02:41.470> part<00:02:41.799> that<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.519> see<00:02:43.530> will<00:02:44.530> hold

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
because this part that you see will hold

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.440 
because this part that you see will hold
on<00:02:44.980> your<00:02:45.160> own<00:02:45.370> garage<00:02:45.580> plug<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.209> really

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
tightly which is good and at the same

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.750 
tightly which is good and at the same
time<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.739> CC<00:02:51.250> version<00:02:51.459> doesn't<00:02:52.319> rip<00:02:53.319> your

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
time the CC version doesn't rip your

time the CC version doesn't rip your
pocket<00:02:56.010> cloth<00:02:57.010> off<00:02:58.319> that's<00:02:59.319> why<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.440> chose<00:02:59.709> this

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
pocket cloth off that's why I chose this

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:05.820 
pocket cloth off that's why I chose this
one<00:03:00.100> but<00:03:00.400> i<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:03.280> i<00:03:03.459> will<00:03:03.819> try<00:03:04.180> out<00:03:04.830> double

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
actually i'm selling these on the forums

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.870 
actually i'm selling these on the forums
and<00:03:19.350> if<00:03:20.350> it<00:03:20.500> doesn't<00:03:20.769> sell<00:03:20.950> itself<00:03:21.010> it's<00:03:21.670> fine

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
and if it doesn't sell itself it's fine

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.800 
and if it doesn't sell itself it's fine
because<00:03:22.120> i<00:03:22.420> really<00:03:22.959> like<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:23.260> knife<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
because i really like this knife and

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.720 
because i really like this knife and
i'll<00:03:25.810> probably<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.380> it<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:27.250> profiled<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:29.350> our

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
i'll probably have it we profiled to our

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.759 
i'll probably have it we profiled to our
mirror<00:03:32.400> h<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:35.319> it's<00:03:35.560> more<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:36.069> a<00:03:36.359> utilitarian

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
mirror h so it's more of a utilitarian

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.699 
mirror h so it's more of a utilitarian
than<00:03:39.060> tactical<00:03:40.319> right<00:03:41.319> now<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.560> really

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
than tactical right now it's really

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.640 
than tactical right now it's really
tactical<00:03:42.280> because<00:03:42.579> uh<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:43.840> thing<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.109> it's

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
tactical because uh the thing is it's

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.430 
tactical because uh the thing is it's
sharp<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.459> it's<00:03:45.700> not<00:03:45.819> like<00:03:46.540> her<00:03:46.810> shin<00:03:47.079> sharp

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
sharp but it's not like her shin sharp

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.150 
sharp but it's not like her shin sharp
and<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.840> my<00:03:50.019> daily<00:03:50.500> use<00:03:50.859> i<00:03:51.220> really<00:03:51.790> prefer<00:03:52.150> our

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160

and for my daily use i really prefer our
very<00:03:54.160> sharp<00:03:54.459> knife<00:03:54.519> although<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.480> might<00:03:55.630> not

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
very sharp knife although it might not

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.940

keep<00:03:56.109> its<00:03:56.410> edge<00:03:56.680> as<00:03:57.220> long<00:03:57.579> as<00:03:58.260> as<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.299> but

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
keep its edge as long as as this one but

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.090 
keep its edge as long as as this one but
