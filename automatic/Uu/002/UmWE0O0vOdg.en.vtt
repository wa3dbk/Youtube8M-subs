00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello my name is Victoria and in this 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.770
 video i want to tell you about how 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.840
 you can make a very fast so know 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.670
 casserole 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.790
 when guests are already going to her literally 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.619
 little time is required here and this in 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 mainly for those who love different 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.140
 kinds of cabbage such as cauliflower 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.619
 and the Brussels Savoy 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 principle 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.330
 what we need for this is obtained 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.429
 I will use in this case 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.120
 cauliflower 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.690
 Further, as the basis go, eggs, milk, salt 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 pepper as you like to taste and cheese 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.250
 what is now the very first thing that I will 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.969
 do with the first thing you need to send 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.469
 our cabbage in a double boiler here for this I 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.270
 I will divide it now on the inflorescence 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 the size of the cold is small well and basically 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.460
 I'll put literally minutes probably on 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.039
 ten fifteen 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.809
 so that it becomes soft and tender in 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.449
 principle that's what I did like 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.880
 You see the size here is different but in general, here 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:15.030
 this is no bigger than this 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.740
 what is it I immediately the whole boiler will be all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.650
 she starts cooking mom next you need 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.970
 just make an omelet 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.900
 so take the bowl and you need to estimate 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.340
 it turns out that cabbage accommodate 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.299
 when the form is laid out 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.159
 somewhere snuggle up 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.020
 and need to be calculated not by means under 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.390
 how much will you need your form 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.439
 omega my form will be like this 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.750
 small rectangle i probably 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.750
 I'll take about 4 5 eggs 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:52.890
 further usual shi is being prepared for me i am so 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 I think that it is absolutely easy to side 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.190
 funny different some big white 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.909
 little brown as i said 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.479
 earlier i have a village come i don't 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.540
 I'm afraid because a trusted person 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:20.200
 women are not very few well and then just 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:22.000
 I will beat it all up thoroughly and then 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.239
 hold the dishes and then slowly pour in 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.720
 allochku like carefully stir everything and 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.970
 cut the side 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.050
 for some time while preparing 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.330
 directly cabbage so well here 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.450
 It turns out that she wanted to milk more 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.850
 say milk add so much well 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.709
 rather, how much you like it if you 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.380
 want casseroles she was more 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.709
 so thick then less milk and if 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.120
 In principle, more so exactly dairy addition 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.030
 can be more milk 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.000
 I want if the milk will be a little harder 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.440
 a little bit to understand how she is ready 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.820
 or not she stays like this more 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.780
 that is why that 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.650
 lover show 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.110
 well let's say omelet I'm ready for him 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.040
 I put aside and while there is still 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.320
 time you need to rub the cheese she and here 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.989
 Naturally it seems to me well, I do n’t know how 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.590
 among which not to move that's why 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:24.220
 just rub on the usual farts fine 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.940
 grater many many many cheese here well 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.489
 about somewhere for how many there are for five 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.530
 minutes before the casserole has one 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.329
 cauliflower casserole will be ready in 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.880
 double boiler should probably be included 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.260
 the oven so that it first heat up 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.720
 so as not to waste your 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.600
 precious time but i will continue 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.910
 interesting 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.430
 so I have cauliflower already 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.269
 she prepared herself here she's just 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.980
 gentlest literally here i say there 14 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.849
 minutes, maybe even less than a 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.470
 after such a time as oils come in but 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:08.670
 by chance so i'm doing this oven 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.670
 included here we just shift everything to 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:16.599
 our some capacity in which we will 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:21.750
 stew it bum out here , look all 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:21.750
 this is already ending inventory 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:30.130
 all laid as you see I'm here a crust 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.539
 cheese nature here but i want how do i 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.220
 I want to first pour the bake and then 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:36.520
 at the end pour cheese so he was 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.580
 less fry I want to say if 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.729
 you don't want to bother about 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.590
 steamers and cauliflower then I advise 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.050
 don't bother at all with this grout 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.940
 but I'm a long time once I'm done 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.860
 in raw and honestly baked 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.040
 extracted baked I baked on all 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:02.090
 left raw to build 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.960
 the second layer is why we only do well 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:08.690
 and others who cook Brussels sprouts 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.050
 then I advise her to better boil it from 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:18.530
 grieve everything now I will have a peak 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:22.840
 peak in general put in the oven and then on 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:27.290
 last couple of minutes fall asleep with games 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.240
 that's what I did like them 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.220
 hot but very i will cut off a piece now 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.230
 to show you because of the lighting 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:38.300
 even the time is the sun outside the window 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.650
 disappeared regret 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.570
 use this artificial 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:46.540
 lighting everything is appetizing like that 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:51.080
 I would advise not 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.150
 see all that cheese say so 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.150
 green onions but I unfortunately have him 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.290
 sastra green onion it will be 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:02.180
 leek here and 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:07.130
 served hot casserole 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:09.230
 so here with cold sour cream all 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.650
 bon appétit i wishing parts 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.650
