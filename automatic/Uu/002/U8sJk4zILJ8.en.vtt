details to go along the key thing about
this<00:00:37.489> is<00:00:37.550> if<00:00:37.879> you<00:00:37.970> compare<00:00:38.330> it<00:00:38.420> to<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.750> pen

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
this is if you compare it to the pen

series which has gone down very well a

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.610 
series which has gone down very well a
lot<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.449> feedback<00:00:41.720> was<00:00:42.170> there<00:00:42.409> were<00:00:42.470> one<00:00:42.589> or

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
lot of feedback was there were one or

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.740 
lot of feedback was there were one or
two<00:00:42.739> things<00:00:42.860> that<00:00:43.400> the<00:00:43.879> real<00:00:44.180> enthusiast

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
two things that the real enthusiast

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.420 
two things that the real enthusiast
would<00:00:45.290> have<00:00:45.409> preferred<00:00:45.799> to<00:00:45.830> see<00:00:46.129> it<00:00:46.190> on<00:00:46.339> the

would have preferred to see it on the
pen<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.449> they've<00:00:47.720> launched<00:00:48.140> essentially

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
pen so they've launched essentially

what's a new range which called the om-d

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.329 
what's a new range which called the om-d
and<00:00:52.610> this<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.909> the<00:00:53.030> first<00:00:53.059> one<00:00:53.479> that<00:00:54.080> covers<00:00:54.949> a

and this is the first one that covers a

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:56.979 
and this is the first one that covers a

on the pen this has it built in best one

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.289 
on the pen this has it built in best one
yet<00:01:05.140> it's<00:01:06.140> faster<00:01:07.130> against<00:01:07.490> fastest<00:01:08.090> will

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
yet it's faster against fastest will

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.100 
yet it's faster against fastest will
focus<00:01:08.540> on<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:08.840> market<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:10.220> has<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.390> best

quality that we've done so far we'll

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.150 
quality that we've done so far we'll
talk<00:01:16.700> about<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:17.000> sensor<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.360> little<00:01:17.570> bit<00:01:17.660> later

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
talk about the sensor a little bit later

it's<00:01:19.160> dust<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.880> splash-proof<00:01:20.210> which<00:01:21.080> comes

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
it's dust and splash-proof which comes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.990 
it's dust and splash-proof which comes
from<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> e<00:01:21.680> system<00:01:22.160> that's<00:01:22.610> something<00:01:22.970> that

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
from the e system that's something that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.550 
from the e system that's something that
a<00:01:23.120> lot<00:01:23.180> of<00:01:23.330> people<00:01:23.480> are<00:01:23.750> requested<00:01:24.290> it's

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
a lot of people are requested it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
a lot of people are requested it's
surprisingly<00:01:25.460> popular<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.090> if<00:01:26.150> you're<00:01:26.300> going

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
surprisingly popular but if you're going

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.880 
surprisingly popular but if you're going
to<00:01:26.480> make<00:01:26.540> a<00:01:26.600> camera<00:01:26.930> small<00:01:27.140> and<00:01:27.320> portable<00:01:27.470> then

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
to make a camera small and portable then

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.620 
to make a camera small and portable then
you<00:01:27.980> want<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:28.160> take<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.460> outside<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:29.450> makes

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
you want to take it outside it makes

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.680 
you want to take it outside it makes
logical<00:01:29.870> sense<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.590> do<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.690> we've

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
logical sense to do that and we've

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.120 
logical sense to do that and we've
improved<00:01:33.050> massively<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.920> image

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
improved massively the image

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.770 
improved massively the image
stabilisation<00:01:34.640> and<00:01:35.000> that's<00:01:35.270> something<00:01:35.570> we

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
stabilisation and that's something we

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.090 
stabilisation and that's something we
pioneered<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.410> built-in<00:01:36.950> image

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
pioneered the built-in image

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.470 
pioneered the built-in image
stabilization<00:01:37.490> we<00:01:37.909> talked<00:01:38.060> a<00:01:38.090> little<00:01:38.300> bit

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
stabilization we talked a little bit

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.450 
stabilization we talked a little bit
more<00:01:38.960> about<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.409> later<00:01:39.440> but<00:01:39.830> it<00:01:40.010> has<00:01:40.159> a<00:01:40.190> new

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
more about it later but it has a new

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.570 
more about it later but it has a new

world's first five axis image stabilizer
built<00:01:43.850> into<00:01:44.120> it<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.930> all<00:01:45.080> in<00:01:45.200> all<00:01:45.290> it<00:01:45.680> gives<00:01:45.890> you

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
built into it so all in all it gives you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.490 
built into it so all in all it gives you
what<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.450> pen<00:01:47.630> gives<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.050> terms<00:01:48.290> of

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
what the pen gives you in terms of

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.380 
what the pen gives you in terms of
portability<00:01:49.250> but<00:01:49.640> that<00:01:49.790> little<00:01:50.000> bit<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.270> extra

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
portability but that little bit of extra

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.630 
portability but that little bit of extra
performance<00:01:50.810> I've<00:01:51.290> got<00:01:51.470> I<00:01:51.710> think<00:01:52.190> reasonably

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
performance I've got I think reasonably

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.880 
performance I've got I think reasonably
average-sized<00:01:53.180> house<00:01:53.479> and<00:01:53.900> I<00:01:54.140> know<00:01:54.200> their

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
average-sized house and I know their

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.770 
average-sized house and I know their
hands<00:01:55.220> do<00:01:55.430> vary<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:56.150> we<00:01:56.240> take<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.420> look<00:01:56.510> at

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
hands do vary so if we take a look at

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.520 
hands do vary so if we take a look at
the<00:01:56.870> PL<00:01:57.110> three<00:01:57.440> it<00:01:58.340> it<00:01:58.880> fits<00:01:59.180> quite<00:01:59.360> well<00:01:59.530> but

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
the PL three it it fits quite well but

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.399 
the PL three it it fits quite well but
some<00:02:01.100> some<00:02:02.060> people<00:02:02.479> would<00:02:02.900> prefer<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.229> have<00:02:03.320> a

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
some some people would prefer to have a

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.500 
some some people would prefer to have a
grip<00:02:03.680> some<00:02:04.100> people<00:02:04.430> would<00:02:04.580> prefer<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
grip some people would prefer that the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.910 
grip some people would prefer that the
buttons<00:02:05.960> on<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.110> back<00:02:06.260> were<00:02:06.470> bigger<00:02:06.680> there's

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
buttons on the back were bigger there's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.020 
buttons on the back were bigger there's
all<00:02:07.010> sorts<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.310> things<00:02:07.370> there's<00:02:07.760> always<00:02:08.000> a

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
all sorts of things there's always a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.270 
all sorts of things there's always a
trade-off<00:02:08.330> so<00:02:08.780> like<00:02:09.409> for<00:02:09.649> like<00:02:09.769> they're

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
trade-off so like for like they're

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.800 
trade-off so like for like they're
similar<00:02:10.519> sizes<00:02:10.879> but<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.330> has<00:02:11.450> just<00:02:11.599> got<00:02:11.690> a

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
similar sizes but this has just got a

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.039 
similar sizes but this has just got a
little<00:02:12.019> bit<00:02:12.319> more<00:02:12.500> for<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.640> guess<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.720> sort<00:02:14.959> of

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
little bit more for I guess the sort of

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.869 
little bit more for I guess the sort of
user<00:02:15.290> who's<00:02:15.560> used<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.890> having<00:02:15.980> water<00:02:16.610> hang

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
user who's used to having water hang

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.930 
user who's used to having water hang
onto

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
onto

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.910 
onto
but<00:02:18.060> they've<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:18.750> really<00:02:19.110> tried<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.740> get

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
but they've really really tried to get

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.830 
but they've really really tried to get
to<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.130> stage<00:02:20.370> where<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:21.180> bigger<00:02:21.750> than

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to the stage where it's not bigger than

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.600 
to the stage where it's not bigger than
it<00:02:22.020> needs<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.320> be<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.770> if<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.950> put<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.190> pancake

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
it needs to be so if we put the pancake

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.030 
it needs to be so if we put the pancake
lens<00:02:23.790> on<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.240> as<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:25.380> illustrations

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
lens on just as little illustrations

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.580 
lens on just as little illustrations
show<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.310> how<00:02:26.400> big<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:27.450> small<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:28.260> camera

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
show you how big and small the camera

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.120 
show you how big and small the camera
can<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:29.420> then<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:31.200> genuinely<00:02:31.710> will<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:32.010> in

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
can be then that genuinely will go in

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.740 
can be then that genuinely will go in
your<00:02:32.250> coat<00:02:32.370> pocket<00:02:32.400> without<00:02:33.120> too<00:02:33.420> much<00:02:33.540> for

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
your coat pocket without too much for

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.840 
your coat pocket without too much for
problem<00:02:34.080> but<00:02:34.740> there<00:02:35.040> are<00:02:35.160> occasions<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
problem but there are occasions and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.610 
problem but there are occasions and
there<00:02:35.970> are<00:02:36.150> people<00:02:36.510> who<00:02:36.630> prefer<00:02:36.960> a<00:02:37.230> little<00:02:37.470> bit

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
there are people who prefer a little bit

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.840 
there are people who prefer a little bit
more<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.890> hold<00:02:38.070> onto<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:38.520> is<00:02:38.610> one<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
more to hold onto and this is one of the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.010 
more to hold onto and this is one of the
things<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.300> best<00:02:39.570> is<00:02:39.810> they've

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
things I like the best is they've

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.140 
things I like the best is they've
supplied<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.590> grip<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.100> two<00:02:41.400> parts<00:02:41.880> and

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
supplied the grip in two parts and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.870 
supplied the grip in two parts and
suddenly<00:02:42.510> it<00:02:42.570> becomes<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:43.400> product<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.490> looks

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
suddenly it becomes a product that looks

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.710 
suddenly it becomes a product that looks
and<00:02:45.180> feels<00:02:45.380> a<00:02:46.380> bit<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:46.650> conventional<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> in

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
and feels a bit more conventional and in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.880 
and feels a bit more conventional and in
probably<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> couple<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.140> months<00:02:49.200> time<00:02:49.590> we'll

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
probably a couple of months time we'll

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.280 
probably a couple of months time we'll
probably<00:02:50.130> announce<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.640> launch<00:02:50.760> date<00:02:51.150> of<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
probably announce the launch date of the

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.860 
probably announce the launch date of the
75<00:02:53.360> 18<00:02:54.360> which<00:02:54.990> is<00:02:55.140> effectively<00:02:55.590> 150<00:02:56.280> ml<00:02:56.870> 1.86

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
75 18 which is effectively 150 ml 1.86

portrait<00:02:58.410> lens<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.520> you'll<00:02:59.700> start<00:02:59.940> to

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
portrait lens and that you'll start to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.940 
portrait lens and that you'll start to
see<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.300> system<00:03:00.510> building<00:03:01.110> from<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:01.830> is

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
see the system building from that so is

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.080 
see the system building from that so is
that<00:03:01.980> there's<00:03:02.280> obviously<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.730> built-in

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
that there's obviously not a built-in

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.210 
that there's obviously not a built-in
flash<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.780> camera<00:03:03.870> there<00:03:04.350> isn't<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.040> that

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
flash on the camera there isn't and that

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:08.540 
flash on the camera there isn't and that
was<00:03:05.540> again<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.750> space<00:03:07.020> decision<00:03:07.680> but<00:03:08.280> what<00:03:08.430> we

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
was again the space decision but what we

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.950 
was again the space decision but what we
have<00:03:08.700> done<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.090> there's<00:03:09.330> a<00:03:09.390> flash<00:03:09.600> supplied

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
have done is there's a flash supplied

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.870 
have done is there's a flash supplied
with<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.320> alright<00:03:10.890> so<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.610> little

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
it's not big but it is in the box which

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.630 
it's not big but it is in the box which
some<00:03:30.060> people<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.480> missed<00:03:31.080> out<00:03:31.370> this<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.489> this

some people have missed out this is this

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.100 
some people have missed out this is this
is<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.790> first<00:03:33.030> weatherproof<00:03:33.570> microphone

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
is the first weatherproof microphone

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.229 
is the first weatherproof microphone
please<00:03:34.290> yeah<00:03:34.739> camera<00:03:35.340> can<00:03:35.580> it<00:03:35.700> is<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.970> same

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
please yeah camera can it is the same

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
please yeah camera can it is the same
level<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.570> weather<00:03:36.750> proofing<00:03:37.140> as<00:03:37.380> some<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.100> the

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
level of weather proofing as some of the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.910 
level of weather proofing as some of the
basic<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.880> same<00:03:39.090> as<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.330> EFI<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.989> designed

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
basic the same as the EFI it's designed

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.070 
basic the same as the EFI it's designed
to<00:03:41.040> be<00:03:41.160> able<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.370> take<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:42.630> average<00:03:42.750> rain

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
to be able to take the average rain

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.870 
to be able to take the average rain
storm<00:03:43.380> without<00:03:43.530> too<00:03:43.800> much<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> problem<00:03:44.280> to

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.770 
purple all the ceiling in a body of this
side<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:47.100> quite<00:03:47.550> an<00:03:47.640> achievement<00:03:47.730> let's<00:03:48.690> talk

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
side is quite an achievement let's talk

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.850 
side is quite an achievement let's talk
about<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.019> lens<00:03:49.170> like<00:03:49.290> is<00:03:49.410> one<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.650> reason

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
about the lens like is one of the reason

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.560 
about the lens like is one of the reason
other<00:03:49.950> things<00:03:50.220> about<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.519> lens<00:03:50.790> is<00:03:51.180> that<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
other things about this lens is that it

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.770 
other things about this lens is that it
you<00:03:51.750> could<00:03:51.930> aid<00:03:52.160> as<00:03:53.160> a<00:03:53.190> manual<00:03:53.670> zoom<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.150> an

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
you could aid as a manual zoom and an

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.970 
you could aid as a manual zoom and an
electronic<00:03:55.230> zoom<00:03:55.440> depending<00:03:55.830> where<00:03:55.950> they

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
electronic zoom depending where they

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.650 
electronic zoom depending where they
shooting<00:03:56.280> stills<00:03:56.489> or<00:03:56.700> video<00:03:56.790> haven't<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.180> so

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
shooting stills or video haven't you so

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.440 
shooting stills or video haven't you so
wonder<00:03:57.989> when<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.260> ring<00:03:58.680> is<00:03:58.709> pulled<00:03:59.070> back<00:03:59.450> it's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
wonder when the ring is pulled back it's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.620 
wonder when the ring is pulled back it's
unconventional<00:04:01.290> manual<00:04:01.890> zoom<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:03.209> pull<00:04:03.540> it

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
unconventional manual zoom just pull it

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.140 
unconventional manual zoom just pull it
forward<00:04:03.870> one<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:05.070> becomes<00:04:05.310> electronic

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
forward one and it becomes electronic

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.990 
forward one and it becomes electronic
there<00:04:06.690> are<00:04:06.840> video<00:04:07.290> autumn

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
there are video autumn

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.660 
there are video autumn
rising<00:04:08.710> and<00:04:09.710> then<00:04:09.890> as<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.040> position<00:04:10.490> further

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
rising and then as a position further

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.950 
rising and then as a position further
forward<00:04:10.970> still<00:04:11.150> isn't<00:04:11.360> there<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.600> macro

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
forward still isn't there in a macro

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.920 
forward still isn't there in a macro
it's<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.320> great<00:04:12.410> kit<00:04:12.740> lens<00:04:12.920> because<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.930> the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
it's a great kit lens because the the

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.199 
it's a great kit lens because the the
downside<00:04:15.680> of<00:04:15.710> earlier<00:04:16.100> lenses<00:04:16.940> was<00:04:17.090> the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
downside of earlier lenses was the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.870 
downside of earlier lenses was the
focusing<00:04:17.690> mechanism<00:04:17.810> was<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.440> bit<00:04:18.650> noisy<00:04:18.880> I

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
focusing mechanism was a bit noisy I

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.400 
focusing mechanism was a bit noisy I
think<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.450> was<00:04:20.570> pointed<00:04:20.840> out<00:04:20.959> on<00:04:21.170> some<00:04:21.320> of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
think that was pointed out on some of

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.050 
think that was pointed out on some of
the<00:04:21.470> early<00:04:21.739> micro<00:04:22.010> four-thirds<00:04:22.220> cameras<00:04:22.880> that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the early micro four-thirds cameras that

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.520 
the early micro four-thirds cameras that
when<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.390> was<00:04:23.480> focusing<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.960> could<00:04:24.080> hear<00:04:24.350> it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
when it was focusing you could hear it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.610 
when it was focusing you could hear it
so<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:25.520> launched<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.910> MSC<00:04:26.390> that's<00:04:27.260> movie

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
so we launched the MSC that's movie

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.500 
so we launched the MSC that's movie
stills<00:04:27.890> range<00:04:29.020> about<00:04:30.020> 18<00:04:30.320> months<00:04:30.440> ago<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:31.510> all

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
stills range about 18 months ago and all

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.690 
stills range about 18 months ago and all
subsequent<00:04:33.290> lenses<00:04:33.860> have<00:04:33.950> become<00:04:34.220> MSC<00:04:34.670> and

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
subsequent lenses have become MSC and

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.820 
subsequent lenses have become MSC and
that<00:04:35.030> means<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.630> they're<00:04:35.870> focusing<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.650> very

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
that means that they're focusing is very

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.860 
that means that they're focusing is very
quiet<00:04:37.160> speaking<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.940> movie<00:04:38.270> what's<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.750> is<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
quiet speaking of movie what's the is a

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.340 
quiet speaking of movie what's the is a
full<00:04:39.140> 1080<00:04:39.470> yeah<00:04:40.040> as<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.550> TCH<00:04:41.000> deal<00:04:41.350> they've

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
full 1080 yeah as a TCH deal they've

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.210 
full 1080 yeah as a TCH deal they've
actually<00:04:42.500> gone<00:04:42.710> back<00:04:42.890> to<00:04:43.010> mov<00:04:43.400> ok<00:04:44.090> because<00:04:45.220> CHD

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
actually gone back to mov ok because CHD

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.370 
actually gone back to mov ok because CHD
it's<00:04:46.490> slightly<00:04:46.970> filia<00:04:47.450> tube<00:04:47.660> to<00:04:47.960> work<00:04:48.140> with

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
it's slightly filia tube to work with

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.870 
it's slightly filia tube to work with
because<00:04:48.440> you've<00:04:48.620> got<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.830> import<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.190> file<00:04:49.370> so

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
because you've got to import the file so

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.250 
because you've got to import the file so
we<00:04:50.150> give<00:04:50.330> you<00:04:50.390> the<00:04:50.480> option<00:04:50.630> now<00:04:50.870> move<00:04:51.110> in

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
we give you the option now move in

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.040 
we give you the option now move in
motion<00:04:51.680> jpeg<00:04:51.860> or<00:04:52.220> MOV<00:04:52.790> file<00:04:53.030> but<00:04:53.600> I<00:04:53.690> genuinely

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
motion jpeg or MOV file but I genuinely

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.900 
motion jpeg or MOV file but I genuinely
think<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:54.860> they've<00:04:55.100> got<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.669> nice

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
think that they've got a nice

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.909 
think that they've got a nice
combination<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:57.080> facilities<00:04:57.590> with<00:04:57.770> this

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
combination of facilities with this

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.530 
combination of facilities with this
camera<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.490> ton<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.790> ergonomics<00:04:59.360> that

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
camera and a ton of the ergonomics that

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.320 
camera and a ton of the ergonomics that
make<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.840> appeal<00:05:00.110> too<00:05:00.290> much<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.800> wider<00:05:01.160> audience

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
make it appeal too much a wider audience

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.460 
make it appeal too much a wider audience
and<00:05:02.330> you've<00:05:02.600> got<00:05:02.750> to<00:05:02.900> look<00:05:03.050> at<00:05:03.169> it<00:05:03.290> from<00:05:03.350> the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
and you've got to look at it from the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.990 
and you've got to look at it from the
point<00:05:03.650> of<00:05:03.800> view<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.100> what<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.370> can<00:05:04.580> do<00:05:04.790> rather

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
point of view of what it can do rather

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.970 
point of view of what it can do rather
than<00:05:05.060> what<00:05:05.180> it<00:05:05.390> can't<00:05:05.600> and<00:05:05.930> I<00:05:06.140> think<00:05:06.830> one<00:05:06.950> of

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
than what it can't and I think one of

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.460 
than what it can't and I think one of
the<00:05:07.130> things<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.400> frustrates<00:05:07.940> us<00:05:08.120> a<00:05:08.390> lot<00:05:09.110> is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
the things that frustrates us a lot is

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.500 
the things that frustrates us a lot is
when<00:05:09.950> people<00:05:10.520> pick<00:05:10.700> it<00:05:10.850> up<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.120> say<00:05:11.240> what<00:05:11.419> it

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
when people pick it up and say what it

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.060 
when people pick it up and say what it
can't<00:05:11.750> do<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.110> same<00:05:12.290> thing<00:05:12.530> as<00:05:12.620> a<00:05:12.650> full-frame

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
can't do the same thing as a full-frame

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.040 
can't do the same thing as a full-frame
camera<00:05:13.130> well<00:05:13.610> it's<00:05:13.880> not<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.270> full<00:05:14.510> round<00:05:14.630> camera

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
camera well it's not a full round camera

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.680 
camera well it's not a full round camera
it's<00:05:15.530> designed<00:05:15.710> to<00:05:16.010> be<00:05:16.130> smaller<00:05:16.940> for<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.300> reason

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
it's designed to be smaller for a reason

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.350 
it's designed to be smaller for a reason
yeah<00:05:18.110> and<00:05:18.350> it<00:05:19.340> does<00:05:19.550> what<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.820> does<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.180> does<00:05:20.330> it

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
yeah and it does what it does it does it

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.660 
yeah and it does what it does it does it
very<00:05:20.479> well
