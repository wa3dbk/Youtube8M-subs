to the PC and x1 and um he said the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
to the PC and x1 and um he said the
increase<00:01:07.320> is<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.040> twenty<00:01:08.430> percent<00:01:08.510> now

different bills that came off of unreal

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.880 
different bills that came off of unreal
4<00:01:20.070> um<00:01:20.840> he<00:01:21.840> was<00:01:21.869> able<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> get<00:01:22.320> his<00:01:22.470> hands<00:01:22.710> on

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
4 um he was able to get his hands on

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.160 
4 um he was able to get his hands on
early<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> play<00:01:24.150> with<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.420> tools<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> stuff

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
early and play with the tools and stuff

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.390 
early and play with the tools and stuff
like<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.590> see<00:01:25.890> what<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:26.100> could<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> with

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like that and see what he could do with

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.819 
like that and see what he could do with
them<00:01:26.700> um<00:01:27.049> he's<00:01:28.049> saying<00:01:28.290> there's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.560> twenty

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
them um he's saying there's a twenty

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.789 
them um he's saying there's a twenty
percent<00:01:29.130> increase<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.079> frames<00:01:31.079> per<00:01:31.350> second

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
percent increase in frames per second

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.550 
percent increase in frames per second
and<00:01:31.950> such<00:01:32.759> when<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.720> comes<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> PC

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and such when it comes to the PC

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
and such when it comes to the PC
basically<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.390> 20-percent<00:01:36.390> boost<00:01:36.600> in

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
basically a 20-percent boost in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.039 
basically a 20-percent boost in
performance<00:01:37.040> now<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.610> x1<00:01:39.090> he<00:01:39.869> actually

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
performance now with the x1 he actually

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.550 
performance now with the x1 he actually
says<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.890> higher<00:01:41.400> than<00:01:41.820> twenty<00:01:42.420> percent<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
says it's higher than twenty percent for

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.700 
says it's higher than twenty percent for
his<00:01:43.740> game<00:01:44.040> now<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> reason<00:01:45.270> being<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
his game now the reason being is the

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.880 
his game now the reason being is the
hardware<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.790> pc<00:01:48.270> he<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:49.020> accommodate

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
hardware on the pc he has to accommodate

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.780 
hardware on the pc he has to accommodate
for<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.280> different<00:01:50.850> types<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.350> setups<00:01:52.350> for

being the same in terms of hardware

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.570 
being the same in terms of hardware
there<00:02:06.390> was<00:02:06.509> actually<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> bigger<00:02:07.469> increase<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
there was actually a bigger increase in

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.770 
there was actually a bigger increase in
performance<00:02:08.940> um<00:02:09.979> using<00:02:10.979> DirectX<00:02:11.610> 12

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780

you<00:02:12.900> know<00:02:13.020> compared<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.800> pc<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:15.240> don't

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you know compared to the pc now I don't

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.330 
you know compared to the pc now I don't
want<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.959> guys<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.380> crazy<00:02:16.680> excited<00:02:17.220> or

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.000 
yeah I gotta say yo that this this
limited<00:05:00.700> edition<00:05:00.760> console<00:05:01.500> um<00:05:02.500> probably

possibly worst ever that I have seen and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.430 
possibly worst ever that I have seen and
just<00:05:06.730> because<00:05:07.030> it<00:05:07.150> has<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.330> Star<00:05:07.840> Wars<00:05:08.110> tag
