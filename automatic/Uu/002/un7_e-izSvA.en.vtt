the<00:01:22.619> laser<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.400> three<00:01:23.759> shots<00:01:24.030> glued

means is that connecting the Gemini

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

start out with top man and there's

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.310 
start out with top man and there's
certainly<00:02:17.360> nothing<00:02:17.510> wrong<00:02:17.750> with<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.080> I

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
prefer doing this short loop first

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.550 
prefer doing this short loop first
though<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.750> I<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.990> walk<00:02:21.110> away<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:21.530> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
though so I can walk away with the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.320 
though so I can walk away with the
Gemini<00:02:21.950> layers<00:02:22.160> or<00:02:22.340> needle<00:02:22.640> cannon<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.180> rush
