of<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.750> beat-down<00:00:55.320> in<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.860> sense<00:00:56.100> but<00:00:56.430> let's

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of like a beat-down in a sense but let's

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.709 
of like a beat-down in a sense but let's
begin<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.410> off<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.649> page<00:00:58.980> 1<00:00:59.969> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.420> didn't

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
begin so it's off a page 1 if you didn't

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.250 
begin so it's off a page 1 if you didn't
know<00:01:00.930> they<00:01:01.890> used<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.879> cure<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.300> dr.<00:01:03.629> Connors<00:01:04.049> it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
know they used a cure on dr. Connors it

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.880 
know they used a cure on dr. Connors it
reverted<00:01:04.830> him<00:01:05.100> back<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> normal<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.970> body<00:01:06.930> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
reverted him back to normal and body but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.179 
reverted him back to normal and body but
in<00:01:08.130> mind<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:09.030> still<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.270> lizard<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.189> then

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
in mind is still a lizard and then

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
in mind is still a lizard and then
basically<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.479> Morbius<00:01:13.409> he's<00:01:13.710> not<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
basically you know Morbius he's not a

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.420 
basically you know Morbius he's not a
vampire<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.479> traditional<00:01:16.439> sense<00:01:16.680> but<00:01:16.920> he

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
vampire in a traditional sense but he

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
vampire in a traditional sense but he
still<00:01:17.580> has<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> lot<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:18.390> things<00:01:18.450> like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
still has a lot of the same things like

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.399 
still has a lot of the same things like
blood<00:01:19.470> cravings<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> whatnot<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.049> lizard

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
blood cravings and whatnot so the lizard

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
blood cravings and whatnot so the lizard
sees<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.950> notice<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.939> uses<00:01:24.180> that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.930 
does is and the horizon scientists a guy
his<00:04:06.609> name<00:04:06.819> is<00:04:07.019> Modell<00:04:08.019> so<00:04:08.739> basically<00:04:09.609> they're

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
his name is Modell so basically they're

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.729 
his name is Modell so basically they're
they're<00:04:10.389> getting<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.750> control<00:04:11.230> group<00:04:11.410> ready

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
they're getting a control group ready

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.620 
they're getting a control group ready
because<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.549> know<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.760> do<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.239> when<00:04:13.480> you're

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
because you know you do that when you're

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.430 
because you know you do that when you're
testing<00:04:14.079> something<00:04:14.560> and<00:04:15.479> basically<00:04:16.479> during

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
testing something and basically during

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.199 
testing something and basically during
that<00:04:17.590> though<00:04:17.799> dr.<00:04:18.190> Connors<00:04:18.549> injects<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
that though dr. Connors injects the

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.390 
that though dr. Connors injects the
lizard<00:04:19.510> formula<00:04:19.959> back<00:04:20.140> into<00:04:20.470> himself

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
lizard formula back into himself

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.990 
lizard formula back into himself
but<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.810> guess<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.410> thing<00:04:23.979> that<00:04:24.040> Morbius<00:04:24.699> used

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
but I guess the thing that Morbius used

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.909 
but I guess the thing that Morbius used
on<00:04:25.150> him<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.509> serum<00:04:25.840> it's<00:04:26.229> keeping<00:04:26.680> it<00:04:26.770> from

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
on him that serum it's keeping it from

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.280 
on him that serum it's keeping it from
being<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.310> full<00:04:27.550> reaction<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.630> he<00:04:28.960> is<00:04:29.080> actually

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
being a full reaction so he is actually

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.320 
being a full reaction so he is actually
regrown<00:04:29.860> his<00:04:30.070> arm<00:04:30.220> now<00:04:30.430> but<00:04:30.729> he<00:04:30.820> won't<00:04:30.970> turn<00:04:31.150> to

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
regrown his arm now but he won't turn to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.810 
regrown his arm now but he won't turn to
lizard<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.440> instead<00:04:32.889> what<00:04:33.130> he<00:04:33.340> does<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.789> he

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
lizard so instead what he does is he

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.730 
lizard so instead what he does is he
injects<00:04:34.449> it<00:04:34.690> into<00:04:34.979> modo<00:04:35.979> and<00:04:37.380> with<00:04:38.380> that<00:04:38.500> being

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
injects it into modo and with that being

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.580 
injects it into modo and with that being
said<00:04:38.889> he<00:04:39.310> turns<00:04:39.550> Modell<00:04:40.030> into<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.960> lizard-like

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
said he turns Modell into a lizard-like

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.560 
said he turns Modell into a lizard-like
creature<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.930> then<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.289> odd<00:04:44.710> heat<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.789> guess

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
creature and then it's odd heat I guess

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.279 
creature and then it's odd heat I guess
since<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.289> lizard<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:47.889> guess<00:04:48.520> lizard<00:04:49.330> is<00:04:49.720> still

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
since the lizard I guess lizard is still

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.610 
since the lizard I guess lizard is still
in<00:04:50.530> control<00:04:50.949> of<00:04:51.070> Connor's<00:04:51.550> body<00:04:51.820> so<00:04:52.690> he<00:04:53.110> eats<00:04:53.410> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
in control of Connor's body so he eats a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.040 
in control of Connor's body so he eats a
rat<00:04:53.919> which<00:04:54.340> to<00:04:54.970> me<00:04:55.180> I'm<00:04:55.360> like<00:04:55.389> I've<00:04:55.780> never

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
rat which to me I'm like I've never

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.170 
rat which to me I'm like I've never
really<00:04:56.470> I<00:04:56.650> don't<00:04:57.340> understand<00:04:57.699> why<00:04:57.820> he'd<00:04:58.000> eat<00:04:58.150> a

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
really I don't understand why he'd eat a

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.629 
really I don't understand why he'd eat a
rat<00:04:58.510> really<00:04:58.990> in<00:04:59.169> Connors<00:04:59.979> body<00:05:00.220> it's<00:05:00.520> not

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
rat really in Connors body it's not

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.770 
rat really in Connors body it's not
going<00:05:00.760> to<00:05:00.850> really<00:05:01.030> do<00:05:01.240> much<00:05:01.389> for<00:05:01.660> him

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
going to really do much for him

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
going to really do much for him
especially<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.500> live<00:05:02.889> rat<00:05:03.460> or<00:05:04.240> mouse<00:05:04.630> but<00:05:05.050> yeah

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
especially a live rat or mouse but yeah

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.040 
especially a live rat or mouse but yeah
that's<00:05:05.979> where<00:05:06.280> we<00:05:06.400> go<00:05:06.580> with<00:05:06.789> this<00:05:07.479> issue<00:05:07.720> I

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
that's where we go with this issue I

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.960 
that's where we go with this issue I
give<00:05:08.289> it<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.470> ninety-two<00:05:08.889> percent<00:05:08.970> overall

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
give it a ninety-two percent overall

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.330 
give it a ninety-two percent overall
because<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.780> do<00:05:10.900> enjoy<00:05:11.350> kind<00:05:11.889> of<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.070> plot

in<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:14.889> lizard<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.460> maybe<00:05:15.940> it's<00:05:16.090> just

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
in the lizard and maybe it's just

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.850 
in the lizard and maybe it's just
because<00:05:16.270> I'm<00:05:16.449> a<00:05:16.510> big<00:05:16.690> spider-man<00:05:17.199> fan<00:05:17.470> really
