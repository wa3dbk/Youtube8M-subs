00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
on my neck so that's where I'm really

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.469 
on my neck so that's where I'm really
focusing<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.030> wife<00:01:21.240> she's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
focusing but you know my wife she's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
getting her legs and underarms done and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.940 
getting her legs and underarms done and
it's<00:01:24.090> simple<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:24.900> my<00:01:25.200> last<00:01:25.409> procedure<00:01:25.590> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's simple I think my last procedure it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's simple I think my last procedure it
took<00:01:26.100> five<00:01:26.400> minutes<00:01:26.790> five<00:01:27.210> minutes<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.780> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
took five minutes five minutes in and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.109 
took five minutes five minutes in and
out<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.439> every<00:01:29.130> time<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.430> go<00:01:29.579> you're<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
out and every time you go you're that

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.700 
out and every time you go you're that
much<00:01:30.240> closer<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.720> being<00:01:30.900> hair<00:01:31.049> free<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
