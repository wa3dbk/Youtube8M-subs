00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:17.180
 welcome everyone with you podcasts and in 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.160
 today then the turrets I will show how 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.390
 make hidden in the wall portal to hell 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.849
 the mechanism came up I did not link to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.970
 the original video in the description 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.239
 let's get down to building in 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.870
 first behind the wall we build the portal itself 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:38.150
 Buttons are placed in this way here 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.820
 quarter here we break two blocks set 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.210
 sticky pistons and it is possible to return 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.610
 blocks 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.180
 so make the day this extra block under 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.280
 button 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.699
 more precisely under the unit on which the demand for 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.010
 button set the block with a piece of red stone 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.440
 here we make the generator short 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.000
 impulses with a repeater to it we put 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 sticky piston with a block here 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.299
 we have a torch palace under it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.740
 block and just the same from 2 will go 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:15.619
 strongly to this distribution q &amp; a from the first 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.960
 torch to the first distribution q so here 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.590
 we put a repeater on this delay in 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.350
 1 click 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.210
 here we again put the generator short 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.829
 pulses 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.189
 who connect to this hand out 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.909
 check 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:33.079
 delay on this i'm already confused on this 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:37.460
 repeaters delay in 3 clicks here we are 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:42.759
 put the block through it another 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.759
 follower to blog again 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.969
 here side with a piece of redstone and two 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.969
 short pulse generator 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.869
 because this distribution needs to be twice 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.280
 give a signal so put blocks here 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.159
 repeater without delay here 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.299
 repeater delayed 2 clicks 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.869
 26 by itself well and the main part of us 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.869
 is ready 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:18.990
 here the portal is lit and reprimand fuck 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.140
 so immediately put the sticky piston 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.300
 hard labor cycle is to close our portal 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.130
 so now you need to file in some way 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.410
 signal on the lower pistons put this here 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.670
 way two blocks 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.260
 a piece of redstone repeater unit here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.920
 the blocks there that way the lines 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 rotary follower further 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:48.090
 we make a line of blocks more precisely we will make here 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:54.750
 we put a small such platform here 2 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.150
 block here redstone and repeater so 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.470
 here is time 2 follower Norwegian three 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.630
 click on this in 1 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.690
 so after that we need to carry on 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.150
 by this block the signal is on these blocks 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:15.980
 obsidian where from the back we 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.980
 we can say the same thing 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:25.770
 so here 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.650
 on so 2 repeater delay 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:33.010
 three clicks delay one click. redstone 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.980
 and I donâ€™t even remember everything 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.980
 mechanism ready left 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.980
 to push 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.440
 it remains to understand that something is here 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:52.180
 wrong working so we fly off on 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.860
 Just a second, I forgot if here 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.909
 this way not to hold roadstone 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.159
 through block 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:04.260
 then this mechanism starts to short 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:04.260
 she does not work that is so 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:18.840
 we will do so for us 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:21.989
 popped up here is something unclean like 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.389
 on a cushion with a delay for i'm all 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.990
 confused so on this one click delay 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:34.440
 on this in 3 clicks it happens sometimes 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:38.250
 let's try again that's great here 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:43.160
 the whole mechanism works but almost works 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.160
 why don't they work 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.180
 Well, as always, there is a delay of two clicks and 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.360
 And there was a clean delay on repeat 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.360
 lyakh 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:03.029
 so well that's the whole mechanism it works from 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:07.839
 me all the link to the original video in 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:09.969
 description for this video subscribe to 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.619
 channel comment put the huskies wait 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.459
 the following tutorials 

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:14.459
