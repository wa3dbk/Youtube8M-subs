vulture<00:01:59.009> droid<00:01:59.430> now<00:01:59.790> this<00:02:00.149> I'm<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> fan<00:02:01.229> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
vulture droid now this I'm not a fan of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
vulture droid now this I'm not a fan of
this<00:02:01.530> set<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.520> don't<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
this set I'm like I don't like it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.030 
this set I'm like I don't like it
because<00:02:03.570> every<00:02:03.750> time<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:03.990> pick<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.409> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
because every time I pick it up the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.630 
because every time I pick it up the
wings<00:02:05.520> fall<00:02:05.820> off<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.630> like<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.350> to

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
wings fall off and it like I have to

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.500 
wings fall off and it like I have to
rebuild<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.849> almost<00:02:09.500> but<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.800> an<00:02:11.310> okay<00:02:11.700> set<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
rebuild it almost but it's an okay set I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.420 
rebuild it almost but it's an okay set I
I<00:02:12.540> guess<00:02:12.750> next<00:02:13.439> I<00:02:13.680> have<00:02:13.830> to<00:02:14.040> corporate

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
I guess next I have to corporate

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.990 
I guess next I have to corporate
alliance<00:02:14.549> droid<00:02:15.390> tanks<00:02:15.840> and<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:17.099> actually<00:02:17.640> have

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
alliance droid tanks and I actually have

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.880 
alliance droid tanks and I actually have
a<00:02:18.030> third<00:02:18.269> one<00:02:18.480> but<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.780> not<00:02:18.930> built<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.560> that's

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
a third one but it's not built so that's

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.289 
a third one but it's not built so that's
why<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.129> don't<00:02:20.310> see<00:02:20.519> it<00:02:20.780> next<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.959> have<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:23.299> 8a

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
why you don't see it next I have the 8a

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.470 
why you don't see it next I have the 8a
a<00:02:24.510> team<00:02:24.989> right<00:02:25.560> here<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.819> I<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:27.209> got<00:02:27.360> this

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
a team right here and I just got this

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.240 
a team right here and I just got this
set<00:02:27.720> not<00:02:27.900> too<00:02:28.170> longer<00:02:28.349> like<00:02:28.590> two<00:02:28.799> weeks<00:02:28.920> ago

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
set not too longer like two weeks ago

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.430 
set not too longer like two weeks ago
and<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.629> say<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:30.930> nice<00:02:31.260> that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and I have to say it's really nice that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680 
and I have to say it's really nice that
I've<00:02:31.560> never<00:02:31.769> had<00:02:32.040> an<00:02:32.340> AAT<00:02:32.579> so<00:02:33.120> I<00:02:33.420> don't<00:02:33.569> really

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
I've never had an AAT so I don't really

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.750 
I've never had an AAT so I don't really
know<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.319> I<00:02:34.500> can't<00:02:34.739> really<00:02:34.920> compare<00:02:35.280> this

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
know like I can't really compare this

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.660 
know like I can't really compare this
one<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.239> any<00:02:36.510> of<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.870> past<00:02:37.310> 80s<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.579> I've

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
one to any of the past 80s that I've

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.300 
one to any of the past 80s that I've
been<00:02:38.790> released<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:39.900> in<00:02:40.260> my<00:02:40.650> opinion<00:02:40.799> it's<00:02:41.220> a

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
been released so in my opinion it's a

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.449 
been released so in my opinion it's a
great<00:02:41.519> set<00:02:41.849> good<00:02:42.359> detail<00:02:42.810> good<00:02:43.590> functions<00:02:44.099> so

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
great set good detail good functions so

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.589 
great set good detail good functions so
that's<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.840> then<00:02:46.019> this<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:47.010> got<00:02:47.540> about<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
that's that and then this I got about a

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.349 
that's that and then this I got about a
year<00:02:48.989> ago<00:02:49.079> actually<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.129> the<00:02:50.609> Droid<00:02:50.909> gunship

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
year ago actually is the Droid gunship

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.910 
year ago actually is the Droid gunship
and<00:02:51.629> it's<00:02:51.780> pretty<00:02:52.019> dusty<00:02:52.230> because<00:02:52.620> it's<00:02:52.769> been

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
and it's pretty dusty because it's been

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.309 
and it's pretty dusty because it's been
sitting<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> shelf<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> while<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.200> I

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
sitting on a shelf for a while because I

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.080 
sitting on a shelf for a while because I
haven't<00:02:55.530> used<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.920> since<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.250> built<00:02:56.609> my<00:02:56.790> sheet

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
haven't used it since I built my sheet

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.750 
haven't used it since I built my sheet
MOC<00:02:57.269> well<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:58.109> was<00:02:58.290> like<00:02:58.500> last<00:02:58.980> June<00:02:59.430> or

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
MOC well which was like last June or

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.440 
MOC well which was like last June or
July<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.920> great<00:03:02.069> set<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> think<00:03:02.549> the

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
July but it's a great set I think the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.259 
July but it's a great set I think the
only<00:03:03.599> my<00:03:03.870> only<00:03:04.049> complaint<00:03:04.379> is<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.310> wish

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
only my only complaint is like I wish

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.720 
only my only complaint is like I wish
the<00:03:06.750> flick<00:03:07.170> missiles<00:03:07.560> down<00:03:07.980> here<00:03:08.370> were<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
the flick missiles down here were a

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.110 
the flick missiles down here were a
little<00:03:09.060> bit<00:03:09.500> less<00:03:10.500> loose<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.730> wish<00:03:11.879> like

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
little bit less loose and I wish like

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.449 
little bit less loose and I wish like
this<00:03:12.389> was<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> little<00:03:13.139> bit<00:03:13.260> better<00:03:13.530> built<00:03:13.950> so

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
this was a little bit better built so

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.979 
this was a little bit better built so
that's<00:03:14.849> like<00:03:15.000> my<00:03:15.060> only<00:03:15.420> complaints<00:03:15.900> about

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
that's like my only complaints about

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.080 
that's like my only complaints about
these<00:03:16.260> sets<00:03:16.590> other<00:03:17.459> than<00:03:17.699> that<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:17.849> mean<00:03:17.910> I

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
these sets other than that I mean I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.150 
these sets other than that I mean I
guess<00:03:18.299> all<00:03:18.810> these<00:03:19.139> droid<00:03:19.709> sets<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.099> have

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
guess all these droid sets that I have

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.390 
guess all these droid sets that I have
are<00:03:20.879> pretty<00:03:21.419> good<00:03:21.690> but<00:03:22.530> once<00:03:22.889> again<00:03:23.040> here's

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
are pretty good but once again here's

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.539 
are pretty good but once again here's
just<00:03:23.549> like<00:03:23.639> an<00:03:23.730> overview<00:03:24.299> of<00:03:24.560> my<00:03:25.560> droid<00:03:26.129> army<00:03:26.400> I

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
just like an overview of my droid army I

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.460 
just like an overview of my droid army I
know<00:03:26.639> it's<00:03:26.910> not<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.269> big<00:03:27.449> but<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:28.199> will<00:03:28.319> be

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
know it's not that big but it will be

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.159 
know it's not that big but it will be
growing<00:03:28.680> because<00:03:29.069> as<00:03:29.609> I<00:03:29.790> make<00:03:29.940> mocks<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.540> as<00:03:30.959> I

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
growing because as I make mocks and as I

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.619 
growing because as I make mocks and as I
buy<00:03:31.319> sets<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.040> will<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.639> gaining<00:03:32.879> a<00:03:33.299> lot<00:03:33.569> of

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
buy sets I will be gaining a lot of

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.259 
buy sets I will be gaining a lot of
droids<00:03:33.959> for<00:03:34.319> my<00:03:34.410> Geno's<00:03:34.739> this<00:03:34.919> Mach<00:03:35.549> alone<00:03:35.879> I'm

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
droids for my Geno's this Mach alone I'm

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.319 
droids for my Geno's this Mach alone I'm
gonna<00:03:36.599> need<00:03:36.810> about<00:03:37.019> 50<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.980> 60<00:03:38.010> more<00:03:38.669> of<00:03:38.940> these

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
gonna need about 50 to 60 more of these

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.339 
gonna need about 50 to 60 more of these
Geno's<00:03:39.840> as<00:03:40.019> droids<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.739> that'll<00:03:41.549> expand<00:03:42.120> my

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:42.349 
Geno's as droids so that'll expand my

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.479 
Geno's as droids so that'll expand my
army<00:03:43.349> quite<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.620> bit<00:03:43.829> but<00:03:43.949> I'm<00:03:44.040> gonna<00:03:44.129> try<00:03:44.310> and

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
army quite a bit but I'm gonna try and

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.920 
army quite a bit but I'm gonna try and
do<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.760> like<00:03:44.970> next<00:03:45.299> year<00:03:45.359> around<00:03:45.599> the<00:03:45.750> same

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
do this like next year around the same
