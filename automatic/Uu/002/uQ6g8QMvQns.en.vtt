00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.750

 And it was the guy that this is referred to as the villagers 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.640

 In Mog that appear in there Kedomo Well I can something of a zone that lined it is home 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:58.000
 In the PC version, I open the door without permission and live in the village all the time 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.510
 However still of the villagers in this pocket edition 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.530

 In but still this little Barker 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.880
 First of all, I can not open the door by myself or stay in the village all the time. 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.520
 Oops I 'm sorry I'm going to Murata 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.880

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.080

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.790
 Look also at how well 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:46.740
 If you close the door like this, you will usually chat without permission 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.850
 It opens and comes out, but it is the present update of unko In the situation 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.680
 Oh 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.690
 Good luck 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 Back 1 Oh does not open by yourself 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.170
 Because 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.280
 Oh man is a really village 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.420
 to be able to 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:12.350
 I'm a freely Tussauds but I think that soon loose 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:15.050
 Although it occurs in the village but not in the village, the village where the villagers live 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.050
 If you want to keep 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.510
 What 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.110
 I have to cover this village with stones 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.350
 The villagers it will do so Zehnder 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.590
 7 day 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.300
 Well leave two people alone 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.569
 Soon as this 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.960
 Villagers say that if you don't go past the villagers will soon run away 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.150
 Because it is a situation 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.439
 It is quite difficult 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.730
 I may say in what what is this guy this small in 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:51.670
 Is it something to increase ? 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.980
 It is still villagers 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:03.190
 If you can not increase the number of villagers but you can increase the number of villagers 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:06.220

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:22.110
 It is quite awkward creature that is not always in the village, so be careful 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.050
 Have a survival bracelet 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:32.700
