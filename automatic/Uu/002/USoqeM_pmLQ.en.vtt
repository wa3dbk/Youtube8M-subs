00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
happen if this show you know if the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.340 
happen if this show you know if the
writer<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.530> wants<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.460> do<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.350> maybe

but i believe so i can obviously say no

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.950 
but i believe so i can obviously say no
but<00:01:55.710> then<00:01:55.890> again<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.460> sega<00:01:57.240> usually<00:01:57.630> doesn't

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
but then again it's sega usually doesn't
