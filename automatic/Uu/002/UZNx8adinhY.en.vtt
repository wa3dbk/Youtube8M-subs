00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:14.610
 water is more kids kids in this one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 new retro flash are hand and today there 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'll talk about metal gear solid 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.920
 the konami title was released in 1998 for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.689
 playstation 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.670
 many of us think that this is the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 first chapter of the saga while in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.439
 reality is the third 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.090
 actually there were two others before 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.480
 initially released no initially 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.489
 exited vernes called metal gear e 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 metal gear solid snake where in 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.190
 we will build for the very first time 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.820
 bigboss 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.920
 in both here instead the bosses is already one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 figure in quotes also known 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.579
 if it is explained to us later, it is in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.140
 reality in the following chapters 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.640
 but let's not digress too much about this 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.890
 topic would be like talking for hours 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.280
 metal gear goodies kind m from dr a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.360
 action stealth and a bit gameplay 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.520
 particularly because it wasn't much 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 very intuitive intuitive 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.650
 he was quite a lot of wood and but 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.040
 like all metal gear it is also those 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 those of today are long plays 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.510
 quite tedious of cable is a bit of a 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.510
 this trademark 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.950
 this style of play for example for fa 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.200
 to give you an example launch one 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.030
 grenade is not as simple as throwing it in 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.000
 a call of duty that you press a button e 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.040
 the spear throw it must aim you must 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.620
 throw you have to hope for gods 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.100
 witches who spits nothing into you 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.480
 make decree like an animal 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.780
 so it was a rethinking device that makes 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.479
 what's this 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.430
 you didn't have to go around shooting 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.030
 oh well then if you sgam the comely 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.030
 guards and injuries you feel you are not 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.380
 you could have scaramelli di dio have me 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.990
 called must hide all the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.000
 box and nobody can find them anymore 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 totally bastards that need to be adapted to 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.640
 also kick the rocks to see there is 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.300
 behind 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 so also the difficulty was a lot 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.950
 high and still today it is a lot 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.120
 high in metal gear and above all 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.790
 when they catch you ltt they find that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.610
 when when you're at the stage when 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.620
 they're on patrol at the guards tend 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.080
 to not 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.500
 don't dig yourself if you're good at hiding yourself 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.940
 boys for a splendid title 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 spectacular for the characters 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.680
 every character in the game is studied 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.560
 to perfection it is characterized in one 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.299
 epic manner from a character to 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.120
 tell you I know 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:55.769
 psycho mantis is a boss who appears alone 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.769
 in the first chapter to appear also in the 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:01.920
 fourth but still as a cameo that has 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:05.579
 made the boss story a boss you 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.310
 read the playstation data because 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.519
 with the excuse that he reads in his mind 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.379
 it is precisely the protagonist linked 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.090
 really brilliant if you don't have 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.920

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.230
