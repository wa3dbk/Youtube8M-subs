00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 we are again in the 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 phone foundation because this time 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.820
 we have been invited to the festival of 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.710
 animation called imagine in its second 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.179
 edition so if you want to know more or 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.290
 less what is it that we can find 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.290
 here come with me 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.710
 the animation is a beautiful tool 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.840
 expressive is born of creativity 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.660
 nourishes the imagination and generates 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.240
 sensitivity well to spread this 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.059
 wonderful visual art the festival 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.670
 international animation imagines in his 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.860
 second edition invited us to fantasize 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.110
 a little with the great projections 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.030
 that can be explored from the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.430
 technological evolution that has gone 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.470
 Experiencing in time 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.870
 well basically we promote 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.270
 all that is art and new media 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.520
 and in this sense we are very interested in 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.200
 animation because the animation of some 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.450
 way also encourages the development 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.880
 technological and we are interested too 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.790
 encourage exhibition spaces for 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.460
 artists who do more work author 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.030
 it's not important it seems to me that 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.940
 let us encourage these spaces so that 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.800
 the boys are also encouraged to encourage and 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.080
 is that in this festival you can 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.050
 find expressions that go much more 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.390
 beyond mere audiovisual pieces and 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.610
 that we can also find talks 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.710
 and conferences that allow you to understand 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:29.040
 to the attendees the great job 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.200
 creative that involves an animation 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.850
 good they will find exhibitions are going to 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.030
 find the first animation 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.770
 quality so much animation clearly 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.640
 digital like what we present in the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.160
 exhibition render that is with artists 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.930
 international will also have 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.360
 different feature film screenings 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.060
 and short films told us also 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.010
 that there are different techniques that have been 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.080
 used in these animations by 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.210
 example there are some that have to do 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.250
 with motion capture there are some that are 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.170
 stop motion tell us a little about 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.020
 this we have the nose 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.790
 It's a 3-D job but it's done 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.950
 with this separation of colors that is the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.899
 old that we saw with the lenses milestones 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 in animation techniques too 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.250
 traditional there is stop motion as you say 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.250
 there the animation in plasticine 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.800
 certainly the exhibitions 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.930
 international between the animations and 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.360
 the feature films are really 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.730
 shocking but national art 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.290
 it also has a very important space 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.370
 in this festival 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.980
 basically the animation in Peru that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330
 has been working here for many years 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.020
 I did a lot of animation for television 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.060
 for the little short say or wedges 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.800
 non-commercial television 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 that has been the path that has always 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.660
 followed the animation for advertising 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.900
 but let's say what animation is 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.660
 artistic there is still a lot to do 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.610
 but they are the guys are working 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.890
 is breaking this myth say the 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.269
 work alone but they are 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.810
 forming teams because the end of 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:07.090
 animation is a team work and a 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.670
 clear example of this teamwork 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.090
 this this talented set of guys 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.220
 well animated normalities of yesterday and 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 then it is also presented here 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.580
 demonstrating that Peru holds its own 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.459
 this genre 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.370
 the project animated abnormalities 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.410
 basically it's just the union of 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.170
 these artists the plastic artists 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.580
 with an animator and the representation of 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.099
 these figures 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.959
 that were previously two-dimensional now 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.760
 enter normality is animated is divided 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.050
 in two shorts that are to mutate and 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.890
 dying and cockroach season 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.030
 one is about cockroaches that 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.340
 they scare a guy who has a dream 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.040
 press and the other short film that is 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.630
 to kill and die is about 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.690
 beheaded they represent as the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.450
 society and it's a bit more gloomy 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.940
 this is definitely a must-see 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.250
 opportunity to explore knowing and 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.090
 enjoy about this genre that creates 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.090
 Realities 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.440
 to see why they will continue to be surprised 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.620
 like me that there is very good quality in the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.850
 jobs and each one different and I think that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.040
 It is a space and an opportunity to 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.660
 all artists that come and can see it 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.030

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.940
