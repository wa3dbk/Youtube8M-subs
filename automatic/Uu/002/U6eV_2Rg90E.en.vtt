to play that much I kind of just get

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.230 
to play that much I kind of just get
squished<00:01:50.320> no<00:01:50.469> numbers<00:01:50.829> by<00:01:51.820> the<00:01:51.880> way<00:01:51.939> there's

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
squished no numbers by the way there's

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.679 
squished no numbers by the way there's
that<00:01:52.390> first<00:01:52.600> time<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:56.369> saw<00:01:57.369> a<00:01:57.399> video<00:01:57.579> on<00:01:57.939> YouTube

because he had to control the AI person

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
because he had to control the AI person
best<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.860> control<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.310> eight<00:02:39.459> AI<00:02:39.700> people<00:02:40.150> it
