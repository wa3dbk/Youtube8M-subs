hi<00:00:04.770> it's<00:00:04.950> mr.<00:00:05.190> Andersen<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.640> in<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:05.910> podcast

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.430 
hi it's mr. Andersen and in this podcast
we're<00:00:06.810> going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:06.990> be<00:00:07.080> talking<00:00:07.379> about

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
we're going to be talking about

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.220 
we're going to be talking about
osmoregulation<00:00:08.809> before<00:00:09.809> we<00:00:09.900> get<00:00:09.990> into

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
osmoregulation before we get into

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.720 
osmoregulation before we get into
osmoregulation<00:00:10.559> we<00:00:11.280> should<00:00:11.429> define<00:00:11.670> what

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
osmoregulation we should define what

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.509 
osmoregulation we should define what
osmosis<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.750> remember<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.620> diffusion<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
osmosis is remember that is diffusion of

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.480 
osmosis is remember that is diffusion of
water<00:00:14.580> across<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.690> semipermeable<00:00:15.839> membrane<00:00:16.490> so

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
water across a semipermeable membrane so

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
water across a semipermeable membrane so
let's<00:00:17.670> start<00:00:17.850> right<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.539> u

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
let's start right here we have this u

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.660 
let's start right here we have this u
tube<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.680> side<00:00:19.920> we<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.340> high

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
tube and on this side we have a high

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.609 
tube and on this side we have a high
molarity<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.359> water<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.199> sugar<00:00:22.529> on

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
molarity of water so a lot of sugar on

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.349 
molarity of water so a lot of sugar on
this<00:00:22.920> side<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.400> this<00:00:23.580> side<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.939> don't<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.240> as

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
this side on this side we don't have as

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.660 
this side on this side we don't have as
much<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.439> basically<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.130> sugar<00:00:26.400> would

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
much and so basically the sugar would

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.670 
much and so basically the sugar would
love<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.180> spread<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.660> but<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.109> can't<00:00:28.410> because

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
love to spread out but it can't because

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.200 
love to spread out but it can't because
the<00:00:28.920> sugar<00:00:29.220> can't<00:00:29.580> fit<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
the sugar can't fit through the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.510 
the sugar can't fit through the
semipermeable<00:00:30.449> membrane<00:00:31.349> but<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.219> can

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
semipermeable membrane but the water can

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.190 
semipermeable membrane but the water can
so<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> water<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.570> flow<00:00:33.809> from<00:00:34.050> an

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
so the water is going to flow from an

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.500 
so the water is going to flow from an
area<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> high<00:00:34.829> water<00:00:35.160> concentration<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.300> low

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
area of high water concentration to low

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.810 
area of high water concentration to low
water<00:00:36.719> concentration<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:38.219> basically<00:00:38.610> if

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
water concentration and so basically if

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.220 
water concentration and so basically if
you<00:00:38.850> were<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> watch<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.809> couldn't<00:00:40.079> see

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you were to watch this you couldn't see

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.930 
you were to watch this you couldn't see
the<00:00:40.379> sugar<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.370> water<00:00:41.579> on<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.879> side

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
the sugar but the the water on this side

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.330 
the sugar but the the water on this side
would<00:00:42.239> mysteriously<00:00:42.780> raise<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.770> lower<00:00:43.800> on

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
would mysteriously raise and lower on

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.190 
would mysteriously raise and lower on
this<00:00:44.550> side<00:00:44.789> would<00:00:45.059> require<00:00:45.420> no<00:00:45.690> energy

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
this side would require no energy

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200 
this side would require no energy
if<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.010> were<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.399> opposite<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> that

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
if you were to do the opposite of that

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.180 
if you were to do the opposite of that
so<00:00:48.570> if<00:00:48.660> you<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.140> reverse<00:00:49.739> osmosis

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
so if you were to do reverse osmosis

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.860 
so if you were to do reverse osmosis
we'd<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> squeeze<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.750> this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we'd have to squeeze it in this

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.330 
we'd have to squeeze it in this
direction<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.440> could<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.710> pure<00:00:52.949> water<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
direction we could get pure water and

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.040 
direction we could get pure water and
that's<00:00:53.489> how<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.699> actually<00:00:53.969> purify<00:00:54.420> water<00:00:54.809> if

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that's how you actually purify water if

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.450 
that's how you actually purify water if
you<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.469> water<00:00:55.680> bottle<00:00:55.980> it'll<00:00:56.280> say

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
you look on your water bottle it'll say

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.209 
you look on your water bottle it'll say
reverse<00:00:57.180> osmosis<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:59.070> how

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
reverse osmosis a lot of the time so how

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
reverse osmosis a lot of the time so how
does<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.489> impact<00:00:59.850> cells<00:01:00.420> because<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:01.109> plant

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
does this impact cells because in plant

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.770 
does this impact cells because in plant
cells<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.190> okay<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.270> movement

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
cells it's okay for there to be movement

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.939 
cells it's okay for there to be movement
of<00:01:03.870> water<00:01:04.049> because<00:01:04.260> they<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> cell<00:01:04.769> well

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of water because they have a cell well

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
of water because they have a cell well
but<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.309> us<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:05.970> much<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:06.990> basically

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
but for us not so much and so basically

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.050 
but for us not so much and so basically
if<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> were<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.799> take<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.010> red<00:01:08.280> blood<00:01:08.520> cell<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
if you were to take a red blood cell and

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.330 
if you were to take a red blood cell and
have<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.390> sit<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.840> an<00:01:09.990> isotonic<00:01:10.650> environment

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
have it sit in an isotonic environment

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
have it sit in an isotonic environment
in<00:01:11.460> other<00:01:11.610> words<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:12.000> environment<00:01:12.720> where<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
in other words an environment where the

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.960 
in other words an environment where the
concentration<00:01:13.890> in<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.100> blood<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.610> outside

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
concentration in the blood and outside

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
concentration in the blood and outside
the<00:01:15.090> blood<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> same<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
the blood is the same you're going to

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.070 
the blood is the same you're going to
get<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> movement<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.700> water<00:01:17.970> but<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.570> blood

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
get a movement of water but the blood

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.450 
get a movement of water but the blood
cells<00:01:19.350> are<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.740> happy<00:01:20.100> like<00:01:20.130> they're

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
cells are going to be happy like they're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.460 
cells are going to be happy like they're
pictured<00:01:20.790> right<00:01:20.970> here<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.020> put<00:01:22.200> them<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
pictured right here if you put them in a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.289 
pictured right here if you put them in a
hypertonic<00:01:23.070> area<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.939> put<00:01:24.090> them<00:01:24.180> in

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
hypertonic area so if you put them in

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.240 
hypertonic area so if you put them in
sugary<00:01:24.659> water<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.200> water<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.740> going<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:25.920> flow

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
sugary water then water is going to flow

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.249 
sugary water then water is going to flow
out<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.659> red<00:01:27.810> blood<00:01:27.990> cells

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
out you can see that the red blood cells

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.350 
out you can see that the red blood cells
are<00:01:28.320> going<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.530> shrivel<00:01:29.040> up<00:01:29.159> likewise<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
are going to shrivel up likewise if you

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.399 
are going to shrivel up likewise if you
were<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> put<00:01:30.689> them<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.869> distilled<00:01:31.290> water

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
were to put them in distilled water

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
were to put them in distilled water
water<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> flow<00:01:32.549> in<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> they're

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
water is going to flow in and they're

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
water is going to flow in and they're
going<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> pop<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.170> they're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> lyse

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
going to pop or they're going to lyse

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
going to pop or they're going to lyse
and<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.610> important<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
and so it's really important to the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.980 
and so it's really important to the
cells<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> our<00:01:37.170> body<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.680> they<00:01:38.220> remain

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
cells in our body that they remain

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
cells in our body that they remain
isotonic<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.820> what<00:01:41.820> are<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.000> two<00:01:42.150> life

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
isotonic so what are the two life

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.300 
isotonic so what are the two life
strategies<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:43.560> life<00:01:43.770> strategies

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
strategies well the two life strategies

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.700 
strategies well the two life strategies
are<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:45.210> organisms<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.259> decided

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
are some organisms have just decided

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
are some organisms have just decided
this<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> too<00:01:47.130> much<00:01:47.250> effort<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:47.850> what<00:01:48.420> they

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
this is too much effort and so what they

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.020 
this is too much effort and so what they
are<00:01:48.600> call<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.079> Osmo<00:01:49.710> conformers<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:50.939> an

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
are call is Osmo conformers and so an

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
are call is Osmo conformers and so an
Osmo<00:01:51.360> conformer<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> octopus<00:01:52.740> right

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
Osmo conformer like this octopus right

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.450 
Osmo conformer like this octopus right
here<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:54.270> osmolarity<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.920> osmolarity

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
here the osmolarity and so osmolarity

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.499 
here the osmolarity and so osmolarity
remember<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.119> going<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.390> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
remember is going to be the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
remember is going to be the
concentration<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.350> solutes<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.070> water<00:01:59.280> is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
concentration of solutes to water is

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.609 
concentration of solutes to water is
going<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.119> be<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> same<00:02:00.570> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.869> outside<00:02:01.320> as

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
going to be the same on the outside as

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
going to be the same on the outside as
it<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> inside<00:02:02.490> in<00:02:02.969> other<00:02:03.119> words

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
it is on the inside in other words

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.310 
it is on the inside in other words
they're<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:03.600> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.960> be<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> same

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
they're just going to be the same

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.920 
they're just going to be the same
osmolarity<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:05.219> their<00:02:05.430> surroundings<00:02:06.060> it's

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
osmolarity as their surroundings it's

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.479 
osmolarity as their surroundings it's
nice<00:02:07.229> because<00:02:07.560> they<00:02:07.740> don't<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.129> regulate

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
nice because they don't have to regulate

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.440 
nice because they don't have to regulate
that<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
that the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
that the
thing<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.080> you're<00:02:10.200> going<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.500> big

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
thing is that you're going to get big

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.559 
thing is that you're going to get big
swings<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.580> affect<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> rest<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
swings that can affect the rest of the

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.170 
swings that can affect the rest of the
organism<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:14.099> a<00:02:14.129> lot<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.430> organisms<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:15.060> what

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
organism so a lot of organisms are what

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.600 
organism so a lot of organisms are what
are<00:02:15.269> called<00:02:15.420> Osmo<00:02:15.810> regulators<00:02:16.410> great<00:02:17.099> example

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
are called Osmo regulators great example

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.250 
are called Osmo regulators great example
of<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:17.819> would<00:02:18.030> be<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> brine<00:02:18.569> shrimp<00:02:18.599> that

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
of this would be the brine shrimp that

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.220 
of this would be the brine shrimp that
are<00:02:19.319> found<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.800> saltwater<00:02:20.280> brine<00:02:21.150> shrimp<00:02:21.269> and

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
are found in saltwater brine shrimp and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.449 
are found in saltwater brine shrimp and
we<00:02:22.379> would<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.650> some<00:02:22.860> like<00:02:23.069> in<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.280> Great

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
we would have some like in the Great

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.059 
we would have some like in the Great
Salt<00:02:23.670> Lake<00:02:23.930> basically<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:25.410> do<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.620> they

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
Salt Lake basically what they do is they

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.740 
Salt Lake basically what they do is they
have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.400> regulate<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.180> amount<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.510> water

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
have to regulate the amount of water

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.620 
have to regulate the amount of water
inside<00:02:28.170> them<00:02:28.470> so<00:02:28.709> they<00:02:28.950> live<00:02:29.280> in<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.819> salt<00:02:30.360> water

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
inside them so they live in a salt water

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.410 
inside them so they live in a salt water
environment<00:02:31.340> so<00:02:32.340> think<00:02:32.670> about<00:02:32.760> where<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
environment so think about where the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.720 
environment so think about where the
water<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:34.170> going<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.380> flow<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:35.670> to

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
water is going to flow is it going to

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.780 
water is going to flow is it going to
want<00:02:35.880> to<00:02:35.940> flow<00:02:36.150> into<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.810> or<00:02:37.049> ab<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.440> em

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
want to flow into them or ab of em

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.100 
want to flow into them or ab of em
that's<00:02:38.790> right<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.239> going<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.420> flow<00:02:39.599> out<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that's right it's going to flow out of

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.630 
that's right it's going to flow out of
them<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.560> they're<00:02:40.709> going<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.860> water<00:02:41.459> is

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
them so they're going to water is

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.070 
them so they're going to water is
constantly<00:02:41.790> going<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.450> lost<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:42.959> they're

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
constantly going to be lost so they're

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.780 
constantly going to be lost so they're
going<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.650> do<00:02:43.739> a<00:02:43.769> lot<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.130> effort<00:02:44.580> in

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
going to have to do a lot of effort in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.930 
going to have to do a lot of effort in
fact<00:02:45.120> 30<00:02:45.450> percent<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.260> their<00:02:46.799> metabolism<00:02:47.130> just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
fact 30 percent of their metabolism just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.229 
fact 30 percent of their metabolism just
goes<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.420> regulating<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.260> balance<00:02:49.950> of

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
goes to regulating this balance of

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.150 
goes to regulating this balance of
osmolarity<00:02:51.239> if<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.230> about<00:02:52.349> fish<00:02:52.799> or

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
osmolarity if we think about fish or

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.500 
osmolarity if we think about fish or
fish<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.640> live<00:02:53.849> in<00:02:54.090> a<00:02:54.180> freshwater

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
fish that live in a freshwater

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.210 
fish that live in a freshwater
environment<00:02:55.319> versus<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> saltwater

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
environment versus a saltwater

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.890 
environment versus a saltwater
environment<00:02:56.880> if<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.120> really<00:02:57.450> understand

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
environment if you really understand

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.199 
environment if you really understand
Osmos<00:02:58.230> as'<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.709> easy<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.160> think<00:02:59.280> about<00:02:59.400> if

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
Osmos as' this is easy to think about if

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.460 
Osmos as' this is easy to think about if
your<00:03:00.390> official<00:03:00.780> living<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.200> freshwater

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
your official living in a freshwater

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.449 
your official living in a freshwater
environment<00:03:02.370> where<00:03:02.849> is<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:04.049> saltier<00:03:04.680> area

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
environment where is the saltier area

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.550 
environment where is the saltier area
it's<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.000> inside<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.540> fish<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.019> so

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
it's going to be inside the fish and so

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.140 
it's going to be inside the fish and so
basically<00:03:08.010> they're<00:03:08.430> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.670> keep<00:03:08.910> having

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
basically they're going to keep having

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750 
basically they're going to keep having
water<00:03:09.569> flow<00:03:10.019> into<00:03:10.620> them<00:03:10.799> and<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.250> they<00:03:11.430> don't

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
water flow into them and so they don't

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.910 
water flow into them and so they don't
drink<00:03:12.209> water<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.170> blue<00:03:13.410> here

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
drink water that's the blue here

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.370 
drink water that's the blue here
basically<00:03:14.549> they<00:03:15.000> eat<00:03:15.239> food<00:03:15.569> but<00:03:16.049> they<00:03:16.200> have

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
basically they eat food but they have

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.280 
basically they eat food but they have
urine<00:03:16.950> that<00:03:17.069> is<00:03:17.130> really<00:03:17.519> really<00:03:17.700> dilute<00:03:18.389> and

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
urine that is really really dilute and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.420 
urine that is really really dilute and
that's<00:03:19.500> just<00:03:19.859> because<00:03:19.980> they're<00:03:20.280> going<00:03:20.370> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
that's just because they're going to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.430 
that's just because they're going to
have<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.639> net<00:03:20.940> influx<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.690> water<00:03:21.959> due<00:03:22.260> to

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
have a net influx of water due to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.830 
have a net influx of water due to
osmosis<00:03:22.590> if<00:03:23.579> you<00:03:23.790> move<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.180> saltwater<00:03:24.569> fish

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
osmosis if you move to a saltwater fish

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.780 
osmosis if you move to a saltwater fish
so<00:03:25.470> in<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.709> saltwater<00:03:26.010> fish<00:03:26.220> we're<00:03:26.609> going<00:03:26.730> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
so in a saltwater fish we're going to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.879 
so in a saltwater fish we're going to
have<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.000> opposite<00:03:27.510> problem<00:03:27.569> now<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
have the opposite problem now now the

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.590 
have the opposite problem now now the
saltwater<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.670> going<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:29.850> be<00:03:30.000> have<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.329> higher

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
saltwater is going to be have a higher

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.360 
saltwater is going to be have a higher
solute<00:03:31.109> concentration<00:03:31.139> and<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.130> we're<00:03:32.250> going

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
solute concentration and so we're going

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.710 
solute concentration and so we're going
to<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.519> water<00:03:32.730> that's<00:03:33.120> going<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.510> keep

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
to have water that's going to keep

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
to have water that's going to keep
flowing<00:03:34.019> out<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.470> them<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:34.829> so<00:03:35.010> they<00:03:35.190> have<00:03:35.220> to

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
flowing out of them and so they have to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.270 
flowing out of them and so they have to
actually<00:03:36.030> drink<00:03:36.420> saltwater<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.319> their<00:03:37.920> urine

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
actually drink saltwater and their urine

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.080 
actually drink saltwater and their urine
is<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.579> be<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:38.970> really

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is going to be really really

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.019 
is going to be really really
concentrated
