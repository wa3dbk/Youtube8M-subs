that<00:00:37.559> was<00:00:37.649> an<00:00:37.739> issue<00:00:37.829> until<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> did<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> previous

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
that was an issue until I did a previous

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.280 
that was an issue until I did a previous
take<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> realized<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> didn't<00:00:39.870> work<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.170> all

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
take and realized it didn't work at all

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.910 
take and realized it didn't work at all
so<00:00:40.980> um<00:00:41.309> hey<00:00:42.030> hey<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.420> can<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.200> we're

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
so um hey hey what can we do so we're

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
so um hey hey what can we do so we're
actually<00:00:44.100> going<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.399> use<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.960> we're<00:00:45.960> actually

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
actually going to use it we're actually

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.250 
actually going to use it we're actually
going<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.379> use<00:00:46.410> 1210<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.309> make<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.260> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
going to use 1210 to make this and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
going to use 1210 to make this and then
we're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> use<00:00:50.059> toy<00:00:51.059> following<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
we're going to use toy following the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.910 
we're going to use toy following the
computer<00:00:52.110> via<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.219> CD<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.649> probably

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
computer via a CD I think it's probably

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.189 
computer via a CD I think it's probably
the<00:00:56.250> best<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> 12<00:00:58.829> 12<00:00:59.219> 10<00:00:59.930> grab<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> iso

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the best of it so 12 12 10 grab the iso

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
the best of it so 12 12 10 grab the iso

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is going to support 64-bit but even if

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
is going to support 64-bit but even if
it<00:01:39.720> came<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.110> 32-bit<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.490> still<00:01:41.790> support

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it came for 32-bit it can still support

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.420 
it came for 32-bit it can still support
64-bit<00:01:42.840> even<00:01:43.619> though<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:43.890> days<00:01:44.130> that's<00:01:44.310> not

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
64-bit even though these days that's not

64-bit even though these days that's not
so<00:01:44.640> common<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.210> I'm<00:01:45.869> obviously<00:01:46.259> I've<00:01:47.220> got<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.850> 64

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.440 
thing also about to say about a Bunter
is<00:01:55.560> if<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.920> need<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.280> run<00:01:56.430> 32-bit<00:01:56.939> but<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is if you need to run 32-bit but you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
is if you need to run 32-bit but you
have<00:01:57.780> more<00:01:58.170> than<00:01:58.350> four<00:01:58.530> gigs<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.890> ram<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.579> can

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
have more than four gigs of ram you can

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.760 
have more than four gigs of ram you can
run<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> PE<00:02:00.119> acre<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.960> think<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.290> called<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
run a PE acre I think it's called and

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
run a PE acre I think it's called and
what<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.700> does<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.880> basically<00:02:03.180> utilizes

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
what that does is basically utilizes

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.319 
what that does is basically utilizes
around<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> 32-bit<00:02:04.950> system<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:06.149> is

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
around on a 32-bit system and that is

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.180 
around on a 32-bit system and that is
one<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.750> reasons<00:02:07.079> i<00:02:07.200> really<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.860> linux

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
one of the reasons i really like linux

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.130 
one of the reasons i really like linux
because<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.879> run<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.869> run<00:02:10.020> up

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
because you can run all you can run up

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.770 
because you can run all you can run up
to<00:02:10.200> stupid<00:02:10.950> amounts<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.280> ram<00:02:11.489> on<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.300> 32-bit

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
to stupid amounts of ram on a 32-bit

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.730 
to stupid amounts of ram on a 32-bit
processor

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
processor

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.790 
processor
really<00:02:14.430> nice<00:02:14.550> feature<00:02:14.960> anyway<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.020> 1210<00:02:16.650> we're

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
really nice feature anyway so 1210 we're

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.010 
really nice feature anyway so 1210 we're
going<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.980> show<00:02:17.220> you<00:02:17.280> how<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:17.430> created<00:02:17.850> a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
going to show you how to created a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.350 
going to show you how to created a
persistence<00:02:19.020> step<00:02:19.560> 3<00:02:19.830> this<00:02:20.760> tells<00:02:21.060> you

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
persistence step 3 this tells you

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.060 
persistence step 3 this tells you
basically<00:02:21.540> it's<00:02:22.380> like<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.650> little<00:02:22.770> file

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
basically it's like a little file

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.220 
basically it's like a little file
storage<00:02:23.370> system<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.240> sort<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.780> stores<00:02:25.080> all

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
storage system and it sort of stores all

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.930 
storage system and it sort of stores all
your<00:02:25.350> user<00:02:25.560> preferences<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.460> all<00:02:26.550> your<00:02:26.700> files

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
your user preferences and all your files

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.910 
your user preferences and all your files
on<00:02:27.270> the<00:02:27.510> USB<00:02:27.540> stick<00:02:28.110> at<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> same<00:02:28.500> time<00:02:28.710> I

on the USB stick at the same time I

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.830 
on the USB stick at the same time I
don't<00:02:29.340> really<00:02:29.700> find<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.030> benefit<00:02:30.510> as<00:02:30.660> I'm

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
don't really find that benefit as I'm

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.660 
don't really find that benefit as I'm
only<00:02:30.990> using<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.590> install<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.400> I'm<00:02:32.550> not

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
only using it to install so I'm not

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.430 
only using it to install so I'm not

is creating files on the USB key I do

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810 
is creating files on the USB key I do
that<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.250> obviously<00:02:41.340> get<00:02:41.610> rid<00:02:41.760> of

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
that and you can obviously get rid of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.580 
that and you can obviously get rid of
them<00:02:41.940> either<00:02:42.420> by<00:02:42.660> formatting<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.260> memory

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
them either by formatting the memory

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.900 
them either by formatting the memory
stick<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:44.100> copying<00:02:44.490> all<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> files

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
stick and then copying all the files

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.150 
stick and then copying all the files
back<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.330> you<00:02:45.420> have<00:02:45.600> any<00:02:45.840> or<00:02:46.050> by<00:02:46.830> showing

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
back if you have any or by showing

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
Kingdom files and folders and just

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.360 
Kingdom files and folders and just
deleting<00:02:48.780> them<00:02:49.070> finding<00:02:50.070> them<00:02:50.160> obviously

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
deleting them finding them obviously

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.790 
deleting them finding them obviously
burns<00:02:50.880> accidental<00:02:51.570> deletion<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.200> there

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
burns accidental deletion because there

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.610 
burns accidental deletion because there
are<00:02:52.980> quite<00:02:53.190> a<00:02:53.250> lot<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.610> files<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.500> format<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
are quite a lot of files and format the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.060 
are quite a lot of files and format the
USB<00:02:55.650> key<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.700> fat32<00:02:57.710> doing<00:02:58.710> that<00:02:58.830> if<00:02:58.980> you

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
USB key to fat32 doing that if you

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.850 
USB key to fat32 doing that if you
really<00:02:59.460> need<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.940> if<00:03:00.930> its<00:03:01.140> most<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.710> time

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
really need to if its most of the time

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.170 
really need to if its most of the time
that<00:03:02.010> already<00:03:02.370> thats<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:02.850> don't<00:03:03.030> need<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that already thats you don't need to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.730 
that already thats you don't need to
bother<00:03:03.300> formatting<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.020> that<00:03:04.170> if<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.320> just

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
bother formatting it that if you just

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.290 
bother formatting it that if you just
want<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:04.950> clear<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.160> day<00:03:05.430> trough<00:03:05.760> and<00:03:06.060> you're

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
want to clear the day trough and you're

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.820 
want to clear the day trough and you're
not<00:03:06.420> really<00:03:06.570> bothered<00:03:06.750> anymore<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.710> get

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
not really bothered anymore just get

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.470 
not really bothered anymore just get
that<00:03:07.860> quick<00:03:08.130> format<00:03:08.520> I'm<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.300> going<00:03:09.420> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
that quick format I'm not going to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.570 
that quick format I'm not going to
bother<00:03:09.570> with<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:09.840> I'm<00:03:10.140> just<00:03:10.440> going<00:03:10.710> to<00:03:10.800> hit

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
bother with that I'm just going to hit

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.580 
bother with that I'm just going to hit
the<00:03:11.610> Lightning<00:03:12.150> icon<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.840> continue<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
the Lightning icon and continue with the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.560 
the Lightning icon and continue with the
installation<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.910> when<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.090> clean<00:03:15.300> all

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
installation so that when I clean all

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.970 
installation so that when I clean all
the<00:03:15.780> other<00:03:15.930> previous<00:03:16.320> installations<00:03:16.860> are

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
the other previous installations are

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.970 
the other previous installations are
broken<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.820> of<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.180> and<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.740> now

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
broken off of that and it will now

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.820 
broken off of that and it will now
basically<00:03:20.670> extract<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.180> iso<00:03:21.330> key<00:03:21.960> of<00:03:22.170> 12<00:03:22.620> 10

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
basically extract the iso key of 12 10

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.470 
basically extract the iso key of 12 10
to<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.370> memory<00:03:23.670> stick<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:24.060> when<00:03:24.300> it's<00:03:24.420> done

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
to the memory stick and when it's done

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.990 
to the memory stick and when it's done
that<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.990> will<00:03:25.590> boot<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.950> up<00:03:26.010> on<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.250> laptop<00:03:26.460> sub

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
that I will boot it up on my laptop sub

that I will boot it up on my laptop sub
a<00:03:27.660> little<00:03:28.110> bit<00:03:28.290> of<00:03:28.590> some<00:03:29.130> trickery<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:30.000> I'm

a little bit of some trickery that I'm

a little bit of some trickery that I'm
going<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.360> use<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:31.200> i'm<00:03:31.590> actually<00:03:31.740> going

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
going to use because i'm actually going

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.160 
going to use because i'm actually going
to<00:03:32.070> use<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> VNC<00:03:32.550> server<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.870> show<00:03:34.110> you

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
to use a VNC server to show you

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.780 
to use a VNC server to show you
everything<00:03:34.620> that<00:03:34.860> I'm<00:03:34.920> doing<00:03:34.950> on<00:03:35.280> there<00:03:35.430> on<00:03:35.640> my

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790

everything that I'm doing on there on my
desktop<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.470> rather<00:03:37.470> than<00:03:37.670> having<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.820> set

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
desktop here rather than having to set

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.520 
desktop here rather than having to set

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
inside windows so even if i go to

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.050 
inside windows so even if i go to
something<00:05:19.290> else<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.740> we<00:05:19.860> hit<00:05:20.040> continue<00:05:20.370> we

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
something else and we hit continue we

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.480 
something else and we hit continue we
can<00:05:21.300> see<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.600> there<00:05:22.110> is<00:05:22.140> a<00:05:22.260> very<00:05:22.530> plain<00:05:23.010> gap

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
can see that there is a very plain gap

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.010 
can see that there is a very plain gap
of<00:05:23.700> free<00:05:24.210> space<00:05:24.510> there<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:26.810> wait<00:05:27.810> for<00:05:27.930> it<00:05:27.990> to

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
of free space there and wait for it to

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.840 
of free space there and wait for it to
low<00:05:28.200> they<00:05:28.350> go<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.740> that's<00:05:29.370> where<00:05:29.670> it<00:05:29.760> all

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
low they go and that's where it all

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.580 
low they go and that's where it all
automatically<00:05:30.450> install<00:05:30.870> basically<00:05:31.410> was

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
automatically install basically was

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.560 
automatically install basically was

going to do the good thing about this is

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:07.580 
going to do the good thing about this is
is<00:07:06.750> if<00:07:06.900> you're<00:07:07.020> running<00:07:07.350> the<00:07:07.440> live

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
is if you're running the live

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.499 
is if you're running the live
environment<00:07:08.060> and<00:07:09.060> you've<00:07:09.180> got<00:07:09.300> enough

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:09.509 
environment and you've got enough

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:11.390 
environment and you've got enough
bandwidth<00:07:09.870> of<00:07:10.020> your<00:07:10.199> USB<00:07:10.650> basically<00:07:11.130> you<00:07:11.250> can

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
bandwidth of your USB basically you can

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.740 
bandwidth of your USB basically you can

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
play around with the live system whilst

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.060 
play around with the live system whilst
it's<00:07:12.990> installing<00:07:13.350> as<00:07:13.620> long<00:07:13.740> as<00:07:13.830> you<00:07:13.889> don't

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:20.760 
you can look through the software

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.010 
you can look through the software
there's<00:07:21.120> quite<00:07:21.270> a<00:07:21.300> lot<00:07:21.510> of<00:07:21.630> software<00:07:21.930> that

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 
there's quite a lot of software that

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.590 
there's quite a lot of software that
comes<00:07:22.320> without<00:07:22.650> the<00:07:22.830> box<00:07:23.070> and<00:07:23.370> all<00:07:24.360> this<00:07:24.449> the

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
comes without the box and all this the

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.540 
comes without the box and all this the
other<00:07:24.750> operating<00:07:25.590> systems<00:07:25.740> will<00:07:26.160> have<00:07:26.280> more

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:26.550 
other operating systems will have more

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.120 
other operating systems will have more
but<00:07:26.940> don't<00:07:27.690> expect<00:07:27.780> a<00:07:28.229> great<00:07:28.470> deal<00:07:28.800> through

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
but don't expect a great deal through

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.330 
but don't expect a great deal through
something<00:07:30.030> like<00:07:30.060> this<00:07:30.210> and<00:07:30.889> it's<00:07:31.889> just<00:07:32.160> very

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
something like this and it's just very

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.689 
something like this and it's just very
jam-packed<00:07:33.030> so<00:07:33.449> where<00:07:33.960> I<00:07:33.990> wait<00:07:34.770> now<00:07:35.400> until

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 
jam-packed so where I wait now until

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:39.529 
jam-packed so where I wait now until
it's<00:07:36.330> some<00:07:36.599> fish<00:07:37.500> basically<00:07:38.190> okay<00:07:38.940> so<00:07:39.000> after

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220
