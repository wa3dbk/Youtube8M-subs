00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.699
 for today's recipe we have chosen a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.370
 very sugary particular comic e 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.989
 from the unusual consistency the khaki that 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.430
 we find on the fruit counters in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.649
 months of October and November 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.660
 generally this fruit being a lot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 sweet is consumed as a dessert as well 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.160
 today, however, we will prepare you semifreddo from 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.870
 serve with a delicious sauce 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 chocolate 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.050
 ingredients for 6 people for the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:02.270
 kaki cream fresh sugar semifreddo of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.910
 lemon cane and macaroons for the sauce 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.220
 water chocolate sift the persimmons 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.130
 add the sugar and the juice 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.440
 half a lemon then mix well if 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.710
 like we add to the mixture also 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:20.130
 some finely crumbled macaroons in 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 a large bowl we whip the cream e 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 it is very important to consume the persimmons 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 when they are ripe, choose them with 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.590
 the thin intact skin almost 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.990
 transparent to the touch must be firm 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
 and integrate if you buy them that are not 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 still perfectly ripe you can 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.770
 help in aging by putting them 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.130
 next to me the works we add the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 whipped cream with persimmon mixture 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.900
 we incorporate mixing thoroughly 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.630
 from the bottom upwards we pour the cream 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.850
 and single portion molds and freeze for 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.590
 at least five hours 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.979
 we remove about 15 minutes from the freezer 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.630
 before serving the best month for i 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.369
 persimmon and November because it is a fruit 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.869
 very delicate should be kept in 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.770
 refrigerator is consumed in two or three 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.420
 days 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.670
 if you have chosen the soft pulp quality 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.619
 just cut it in half and eat it with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.979
 a teaspoon with the hard pulp yes 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.459
 they can eat like an apple for the 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.959
 salsa let's break the chocolate into pieces 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.980
 let's put them in a pan and cover them with 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.980
 thread with water 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.080
 let it dissolve by stirring up to 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.520
 get a fairly liquid sauce 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.060
 we serve the semifreddo with the sauce of 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.680
 chocolate that macaroon crumbs 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.080
 chocolate very special relationship 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.760
 with water if it melts 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.260
 it comes into contact with a few drops 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.210
 will immediately make lumps 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.340
 if instead the amount of water will be 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.350
 greater will begin to melt 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.840
 becoming fluid and homogeneous 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.820
 see you at the next episode e 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.820
