- which is sort of I guess limited in
its<00:04:30.150> capabilities<00:04:30.419> I<00:04:31.080> guess<00:04:31.289> from<00:04:31.469> a<00:04:31.620> ram<00:04:31.919> and

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:32.189 
its capabilities I guess from a ram and

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.390 
its capabilities I guess from a ram and
from<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.779> processor<00:04:33.779> perspective<00:04:34.560> but<00:04:34.740> really

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
from a processor perspective but really
