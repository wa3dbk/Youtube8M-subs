hard<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.260> build<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.769> they're<00:00:31.920> not<00:00:32.070> exactly

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
hard to build like they're not exactly

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.380 
hard to build like they're not exactly
the<00:00:34.020> easiest<00:00:34.100> deck<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.250> make<00:00:35.430> here<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:35.940> uh<00:00:35.969> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the easiest deck to make here but uh I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.709 
the easiest deck to make here but uh I
gave<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.380> shot<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.160> I've<00:00:38.940> tested<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> out

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
gave it a shot and I've tested it out

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.490 
gave it a shot and I've tested it out
and<00:00:39.930> it<00:00:40.050> works<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.530> well<00:00:41.149> I<00:00:42.149> don't<00:00:42.690> run<00:00:43.110> any

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
and it works very well I don't run any

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.440 
and it works very well I don't run any
of<00:00:44.010> those<00:00:44.190> new<00:00:44.579> rituals<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> see<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:46.500> I

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
the level that's required for the ritual

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.800 
the level that's required for the ritual
monster<00:04:57.090> and<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:58.650> link<00:04:58.830> which<00:04:58.949> is<00:04:59.130> level<00:04:59.460> one

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
monster and the link which is level one

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.260 
monster and the link which is level one
so<00:05:00.810> I'd<00:05:01.800> have<00:05:01.860> to<00:05:02.069> run<00:05:02.190> level<00:05:02.340> one<00:05:02.639> monsters<00:05:03.120> to

be able to use contract with
relinquished<00:05:04.800> you<00:05:05.580> know<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.030> that's<00:05:06.180> pretty

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
relinquished you know so that's pretty

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.499 
relinquished you know so that's pretty
pointless<00:05:07.520> whereas<00:05:08.520> with<00:05:08.550> if<00:05:08.819> i<00:05:08.909> use<00:05:09.030> illusion

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
pointless whereas with if i use illusion

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.620 
pointless whereas with if i use illusion
then<00:05:10.259> I<00:05:10.319> can<00:05:10.710> use<00:05:11.310> the<00:05:11.520> Djinn<00:05:11.759> I<00:05:11.969> can<00:05:12.330> send

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:15.719 
necro from my hand I can use literally

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:18.700 
necro from my hand I can use literally
pretty<00:05:16.110> much<00:05:16.199> any<00:05:16.409> monster<00:05:16.979> in<00:05:17.069> the<00:05:17.159> game<00:05:17.340> so

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
pretty much any monster in the game so

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.570 
pretty much any monster in the game so
illusion<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.830> a<00:05:19.860> lot<00:05:20.219> better<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:21.469> three

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
illusion is a lot better a three

alors<00:06:08.880> like<00:06:09.419> I<00:06:09.509> said<00:06:09.569> I<00:06:09.690> run<00:06:09.960> like<00:06:10.349> almost<00:06:11.190> my

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
alors like I said I run like almost my

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.640 
alors like I said I run like almost my
entire<00:06:11.370> deck<00:06:11.819> is<00:06:12.000> dark<00:06:12.449> so<00:06:12.840> it's<00:06:13.440> pretty

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
entire deck is dark so it's pretty

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.749 
entire deck is dark so it's pretty
obvious<00:06:13.979> that<00:06:14.009> on<00:06:14.310> all<00:06:14.430> doors<00:06:14.719> to<00:06:15.719> charges

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
obvious that on all doors to charges

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.680 
obvious that on all doors to charges
yeah<00:06:17.759> that's<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.240> thing<00:06:18.300> I've<00:06:18.539> been

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
yeah that's the thing I've been

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.779 
yeah that's the thing I've been
considering<00:06:19.440> a<00:06:19.740> because<00:06:20.159> if<00:06:20.279> I<00:06:20.340> don't<00:06:20.400> if<00:06:20.669> i'm

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
considering a because if I don't if i'm

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.149 
considering a because if I don't if i'm
only<00:06:20.909> running<00:06:21.060> one<00:06:21.509> raikou<00:06:22.259> i<00:06:22.469> might<00:06:22.770> only<00:06:22.919> run

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
only running one raikou i might only run

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.330 
only running one raikou i might only run
on<00:06:23.190> one<00:06:24.000> charge<00:06:24.300> but<00:06:24.870> i<00:06:25.169> kind<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.039> want<00:06:26.190> to<00:06:26.250> fit

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
on one charge but i kind of want to fit

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.389 
on one charge but i kind of want to fit
in<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.460> one<00:06:27.090> Lila<00:06:27.479> tect<00:06:27.840> anyway<00:06:28.259> so<00:06:28.370> right<00:06:29.370> now

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:29.399 
in the one Lila tect anyway so right now

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.990 
in the one Lila tect anyway so right now
I'm<00:06:29.580> just<00:06:29.669> testing<00:06:29.849> the<00:06:30.060> with<00:06:30.180> two

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 
I'm just testing the with two

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.780 
I'm just testing the with two
and<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.800> three<00:06:32.800> raikos<00:06:33.160> see<00:06:33.460> how<00:06:33.610> it<00:06:33.670> works

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
and the three raikos see how it works

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.580 
and the three raikos see how it works
but<00:06:34.510> it's<00:06:35.350> been<00:06:35.530> fine<00:06:36.310> so<00:06:36.520> far<00:06:36.900> pet<00:06:37.900> food<00:06:38.050> store

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
grain pretty much the staples

opening plays although that's pretty

this<00:07:06.730> is<00:07:06.880> actually<00:07:07.150> my<00:07:07.270> 41st<00:07:07.720> guard<00:07:08.080> i<00:07:08.140> was

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
this is actually my 41st guard i was

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.680 
this is actually my 41st guard i was
running<00:07:08.410> 40<00:07:09.070> but<00:07:09.760> i<00:07:09.790> found<00:07:09.940> that<00:07:10.120> sometimes<00:07:10.390> I

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
running 40 but i found that sometimes I

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.880 
running 40 but i found that sometimes I
know<00:07:11.440> like<00:07:11.740> two<00:07:12.250> of<00:07:12.520> my<00:07:12.630> relinquish<00:07:13.630> and<00:07:14.080> I

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:14.890 
know like two of my relinquish and I

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.950 
know like two of my relinquish and I
have<00:07:15.040> no<00:07:15.340> way<00:07:15.550> of<00:07:15.730> getting<00:07:15.850> them<00:07:16.120> back<00:07:16.630> if

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
have no way of getting them back if

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.040 
have no way of getting them back if
they're<00:07:17.560> in<00:07:17.890> my<00:07:17.980> grave<00:07:18.190> so<00:07:18.940> I'm<00:07:19.390> just<00:07:19.930> gonna

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:20.050 
they're in my grave so I'm just gonna

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.990 
they're in my grave so I'm just gonna
I'm<00:07:20.620> testing<00:07:20.980> a<00:07:21.070> tech<00:07:21.280> pot<00:07:21.490> of<00:07:21.640> avarice<00:07:21.730> with

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:22.000 
I'm testing a tech pot of avarice with

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.680 
I'm testing a tech pot of avarice with
my<00:07:22.120> 41st<00:07:22.540> card<00:07:22.870> right<00:07:23.020> now<00:07:23.730> and<00:07:24.730> hopefully<00:07:25.330> it

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:25.690 
my 41st card right now and hopefully it

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:28.409 
my 41st card right now and hopefully it
works<00:07:25.780> really<00:07:26.050> good<00:07:26.230> I<00:07:26.680> don't<00:07:27.400> know<00:07:27.460> like<00:07:27.669> it

00:07:28.409 --> 00:07:28.419 
works really good I don't know like it

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:29.790 
works really good I don't know like it
would<00:07:28.720> work<00:07:28.750> issued<00:07:29.169> we're<00:07:29.320> good<00:07:29.470> in<00:07:29.500> theory

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
would work issued we're good in theory

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.310 
would work issued we're good in theory
but<00:07:30.210> you<00:07:31.210> know<00:07:31.360> some<00:07:31.810> things<00:07:31.930> don't<00:07:32.169> work<00:07:32.290> good

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.320 
but you know some things don't work good

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.980 
but you know some things don't work good
in<00:07:32.500> theory<00:07:32.850> and<00:07:33.850> that's<00:07:34.060> it<00:07:34.300> actually<00:07:34.780> I<00:07:34.810> am

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990 
in theory and that's it actually I am

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.750 
in theory and that's it actually I am
not<00:07:35.800> running<00:07:35.979> any<00:07:36.310> traps<00:07:36.700> at<00:07:36.910> all<00:07:37.210> in<00:07:37.720> his<00:07:37.990> back

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
not running any traps at all in his back

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.430 
not running any traps at all in his back
mostly<00:07:39.760> because<00:07:39.790> I<00:07:40.030> wanted<00:07:40.390> to<00:07:40.510> make<00:07:40.960> it<00:07:41.140> sort

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440 
mostly because I wanted to make it sort

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.590 
mostly because I wanted to make it sort
of<00:07:41.500> like<00:07:41.740> lightsworn<00:07:42.370> where<00:07:42.669> you<00:07:43.120> run<00:07:43.300> pretty

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:43.600 
of like lightsworn where you run pretty

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.680 
of like lightsworn where you run pretty
much<00:07:43.720> no<00:07:43.930> traps<00:07:44.229> uh<00:07:45.419> because<00:07:46.419> I've<00:07:46.540> already

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:46.690 
much no traps uh because I've already

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:49.440 
much no traps uh because I've already
got<00:07:46.930> like<00:07:47.229> necros<00:07:47.890> and<00:07:48.190> relinquished<00:07:49.030> he<00:07:49.240> just

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:49.450 
got like necros and relinquished he just

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.760 
got like necros and relinquished he just
shuts<00:07:49.930> down<00:07:50.110> a<00:07:50.350> lot<00:07:50.590> of<00:07:50.710> stuff<00:07:50.919> already<00:07:52.770> okay

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:53.770 
shuts down a lot of stuff already okay

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.720 
shuts down a lot of stuff already okay
that's<00:07:54.040> it<00:07:54.190> I<00:07:54.280> gotta<00:07:54.460> go<00:07:54.610> phones<00:07:55.360> ringing
