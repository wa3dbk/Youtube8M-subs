00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.340 

when<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.820> get<00:01:57.939> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.210> end<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.720> each<00:01:59.049> of<00:01:59.080> the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
when you get to the end of each of the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.630 
when you get to the end of each of the
parades<00:01:59.590> go<00:01:59.830> ahead<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.100> secure<00:02:00.220> with<00:02:00.520> an

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
parades go ahead and secure with an

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.390 
parades go ahead and secure with an
elastic

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.470 

little<00:02:05.910> trickier<00:02:06.240> towards<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.660> end

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.440 

so<00:02:11.599> again<00:02:11.840> elastic<00:02:12.709> in<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.330> repeat<00:02:14.330> this

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
so again elastic in and repeat this

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.600 
so again elastic in and repeat this
process<00:02:14.620> till<00:02:15.620> all<00:02:15.860> three<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.280> them<00:02:16.430> are

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
process till all three of them are

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.580 
process till all three of them are
braided

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.410

I'm going to take a rat tail comb that's

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
I'm going to take a rat tail comb that's
a<00:02:24.630> comb<00:02:24.840> with<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.110> metal<00:02:25.440> piece<00:02:25.620> right<00:02:25.740> here

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
a comb with this metal piece right here

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
a comb with this metal piece right here
and<00:02:26.220> I'm<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.060> going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> grab<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.780> edge<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
and I'm just going to grab the edge of

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.560 
and I'm just going to grab the edge of
the<00:02:28.320> elastic<00:02:28.800> like<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.280> now<00:02:30.150> taking<00:02:30.540> that

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
the elastic like this now taking that

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.930 
the elastic like this now taking that
rightmost<00:02:31.140> piece<00:02:31.530> I'm<00:02:32.100> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.370> flip<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.700> up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
rightmost piece I'm going to flip it up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.920 
rightmost piece I'm going to flip it up
and<00:02:33.180> tuck<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.320> back<00:02:34.560> through<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.040> elastic

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
and tuck it back through that elastic

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.520 
and tuck it back through that elastic
you<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.080> how<00:02:37.200> I'm<00:02:37.260> doing<00:02:37.440> that

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
you see how I'm doing that

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.340 
you see how I'm doing that
and<00:02:38.620> then<00:02:39.580> I'm<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.910> go<00:02:40.090> same<00:02:40.810> using<00:02:41.320> the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
and then I'm going to go same using the

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.410 
and then I'm going to go same using the
same<00:02:41.710> part<00:02:42.100> of<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> elastic<00:02:42.790> just<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.300> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
same part of the elastic just to the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.690 
same part of the elastic just to the
left<00:02:43.660> side<00:02:43.900> now<00:02:43.960> and<00:02:44.440> pull<00:02:45.100> it<00:02:45.190> open<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.610> go

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
left side now and pull it open and go

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.210 
left side now and pull it open and go
ahead<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.180> tuck<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.510> left<00:02:46.720> side

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.320 

I<00:02:49.250> switch<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.910> my<00:02:50.060> this<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.600> not<00:02:50.780> home<00:02:51.250> handed

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
I switch to my this is not home handed

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.840 
I switch to my this is not home handed
is<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.690> awkward<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:54.320> me

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
is this awkward for me

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.340 
is this awkward for me
taking<00:02:56.360> it<00:02:56.480> through<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.080> then<00:02:57.920> pulling<00:02:58.190> it<00:02:58.370> up

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
taking it through and then pulling it up

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.560 
taking it through and then pulling it up
so<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.440> just<00:03:00.590> pull<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.800> up<00:03:00.980> both<00:03:01.970> sides<00:03:02.360> I'm

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
so you just pull it up both sides I'm

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.510 
so you just pull it up both sides I'm
going<00:03:02.780> to<00:03:02.840> pull<00:03:03.020> them<00:03:03.080> way<00:03:03.320> up<00:03:03.620> till<00:03:04.340> it's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
going to pull them way up till it's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.570 
going to pull them way up till it's
almost<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.690> top<00:03:05.960> of<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.350> elastic

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
almost to the top of that elastic

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.280 
almost to the top of that elastic
and<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.450> see<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:09.930> beginning<00:03:10.050> to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and you can see that it's beginning to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.990 
and you can see that it's beginning to
form<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.740> arch<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.310> we<00:03:11.460> want<00:03:11.670> with<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
form that arch that we want with the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.300 
form that arch that we want with the
heart<00:03:12.240> now<00:03:12.840> you<00:03:12.900> don't<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:14.010> use<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> third

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
heart now you don't have to use a third

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.120 
heart now you don't have to use a third
piece<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.240> we<00:03:15.600> are<00:03:15.780> doing<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.260> it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
piece on this we are doing it because it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.850 
piece on this we are doing it because it
really<00:03:17.700> helps<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.300> gravity<00:03:19.260> not<00:03:19.500> pull<00:03:19.740> the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
really helps that gravity not pull the

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
really helps that gravity not pull the
heart<00:03:20.040> down<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.460> get<00:03:20.610> all<00:03:20.730> saggy<00:03:20.970> by<00:03:21.300> the<00:03:21.360> end

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
heart down and get all saggy by the end

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.730 
heart down and get all saggy by the end
of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.720> day<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:21.990> you<00:03:22.080> have<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.290> third<00:03:22.530> piece

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
of the day if you have that third piece

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.830 
of the day if you have that third piece
that<00:03:23.010> stays<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.490> pretty<00:03:23.730> informed<00:03:24.270> that's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
that stays really pretty informed that's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.260
