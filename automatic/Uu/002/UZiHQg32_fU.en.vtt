00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
unhealthy once they see your two

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.120 
unhealthy once they see your two
textures<00:03:11.510> especially<00:03:12.470> if<00:03:12.560> you're<00:03:12.709> like<00:03:12.890> me

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
textures especially if you're like me

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.830 
textures especially if you're like me
and<00:03:13.160> your<00:03:13.370> hair<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.640> relaxed<00:03:14.299> bone<00:03:14.510> straight

and your hair is relaxed bone straight

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.610 
and your hair is relaxed bone straight

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
yes it's a drastic difference between

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.910 
yes it's a drastic difference between
the<00:03:20.180> two<00:03:20.329> textures<00:03:20.720> however<00:03:21.440> that<00:03:21.709> doesn't

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
the two textures however that doesn't

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.470 
the two textures however that doesn't
mean<00:03:22.100> that<00:03:22.220> your<00:03:22.519> relaxed<00:03:22.880> hair<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.090> unhealthy

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
mean that your relaxed hair is unhealthy

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.560 
mean that your relaxed hair is unhealthy
and<00:03:23.660> needs<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:24.019> be<00:03:24.140> shaved<00:03:24.620> off<00:03:24.950> okay<00:03:25.760> once<00:03:26.359> I

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
and needs to be shaved off okay once I

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.810 
and needs to be shaved off okay once I
straighten<00:03:27.109> out<00:03:27.260> my<00:03:27.290> hair<00:03:27.739> and<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.400> textures

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
straighten out my hair and the textures

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.430 
straighten out my hair and the textures
are<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> same<00:03:29.329> because<00:03:29.660> i've<00:03:29.810> used<00:03:30.019> heat<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
are the same because i've used heat to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.289 
are the same because i've used heat to
straighten<00:03:30.799> out<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.130> natural<00:03:31.430> hair<00:03:31.820> you

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
straighten out the natural hair you

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:33.789 
straighten out the natural hair you
can't<00:03:32.600> tell<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.900> difference<00:03:33.109> and<00:03:33.590> i'll<00:03:33.769> show

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
can't tell the difference and i'll show

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.860 
can't tell the difference and i'll show
you<00:03:34.100> some<00:03:34.370> pictures<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.820> prove<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.390> looks

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
you some pictures to prove it it looks

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.460 
you some pictures to prove it it looks
the<00:03:36.019> exact<00:03:36.380> same<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.100> i'm<00:03:37.670> going<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.470> gradually

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
the exact same so i'm going to gradually

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.280 
the exact same so i'm going to gradually
trim<00:03:39.890> away<00:03:40.010> my<00:03:40.340> ends<00:03:40.880> until<00:03:41.660> I'm<00:03:42.049> completely

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
trim away my ends until I'm completely

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.170 
trim away my ends until I'm completely
relaxed<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.100> free<00:03:43.310> which<00:03:43.489> brings<00:03:43.730> me<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.910> my

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
relaxed to free which brings me to my

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.390 
relaxed to free which brings me to my
second<00:03:44.600> point<00:03:44.630> I<00:03:45.019> will<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.709> be<00:03:45.829> big<00:03:46.010> chopping

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
second point I will not be big chopping

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.039 
second point I will not be big chopping
there<00:03:46.549> will<00:03:46.700> never<00:03:46.880> be<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.150> big<00:03:47.390> chop<00:03:47.600> video<00:03:47.900> on

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
there will never be a big chop video on

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.920 
there will never be a big chop video on
my<00:03:48.170> channel<00:03:48.200> because<00:03:48.880> one<00:03:49.880> like<00:03:50.359> I<00:03:50.480> said<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.720> am

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
my channel because one like I said I am

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.620 
my channel because one like I said I am
deciding<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.950> trim<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.549> away<00:03:52.730> neck<00:03:53.000> gradually

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
deciding to trim it away neck gradually

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.360 
deciding to trim it away neck gradually
but<00:03:53.840> they<00:03:53.959> also<00:03:54.140> the<00:03:54.560> second<00:03:54.920> reason<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.310> that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
but they also the second reason is that

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.870 
but they also the second reason is that
I<00:03:55.760> don't<00:03:56.450> want<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.049> circular<00:03:57.829> shape<00:03:58.220> that

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
I don't want that circular shape that

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.759 
I don't want that circular shape that
results<00:03:59.569> from<00:03:59.630> big<00:03:59.930> chopping<00:04:00.350> if<00:04:00.470> your<00:04:00.590> hair

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
results from big chopping if your hair

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.500 
results from big chopping if your hair
is<00:04:00.799> growing<00:04:01.160> at<00:04:01.400> an<00:04:01.519> even<00:04:01.700> speed<00:04:02.090> and<00:04:02.329> then<00:04:02.420> you

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
is growing at an even speed and then you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.970 
is growing at an even speed and then you
chop<00:04:02.750> off<00:04:02.870> all<00:04:03.019> the<00:04:03.109> relaxed<00:04:03.440> things<00:04:03.590> at<00:04:03.769> once

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
chop off all the relaxed things at once

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.009 
chop off all the relaxed things at once
what's<00:04:04.640> going<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:04.970> happen<00:04:05.090> is<00:04:05.569> you'll<00:04:05.840> have<00:04:05.989> a

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.019 
what's going to happen is you'll have a

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:07.809 
what's going to happen is you'll have a
circular<00:04:06.319> afro<00:04:06.980> and<00:04:07.160> there's<00:04:07.519> nothing<00:04:07.640> wrong

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
circular afro and there's nothing wrong

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.069 
circular afro and there's nothing wrong
with<00:04:08.000> that<00:04:08.239> but<00:04:08.389> I<00:04:08.480> feel<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.690> my<00:04:08.840> face<00:04:09.049> is

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
with that but I feel like my face is

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.870 
with that but I feel like my face is
flying<00:04:09.380> around<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.829> I<00:04:09.950> know<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.549> my<00:04:10.670> head<00:04:10.850> is

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
flying around and I know that my head is

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.340 
flying around and I know that my head is
big<00:04:11.180> so<00:04:11.329> I<00:04:11.389> don't<00:04:11.630> think<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:11.900> shape

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
big so I don't think that that shape

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.470 
big so I don't think that that shape
will<00:04:12.560> particularly<00:04:12.889> flatter<00:04:13.310> my<00:04:13.519> hair<00:04:13.730> what<00:04:14.450> I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
will particularly flatter my hair what I

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.990 
will particularly flatter my hair what I
ultimately<00:04:14.750> want<00:04:15.500> to<00:04:15.980> do<00:04:16.190> is<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.729> have<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
ultimately want to do is to have a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.629 
ultimately want to do is to have a
shoulder<00:04:17.479> length<00:04:17.750> or<00:04:17.989> longer<00:04:18.019> bob<00:04:18.950> hairstyle

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
shoulder length or longer bob hairstyle

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.060 
shoulder length or longer bob hairstyle
or<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.599> know<00:04:20.720> even<00:04:20.900> cut<00:04:21.320> eventually<00:04:21.890> so<00:04:22.010> I

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
or you know even cut eventually so I

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.050 
or you know even cut eventually so I
just<00:04:22.340> found<00:04:22.490> on<00:04:22.610> transit

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
when my hair is out I use it to spritz

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.050 
when my hair is out I use it to spritz
and<00:05:00.350> dampen<00:05:00.740> my<00:05:00.860> hair<00:05:01.070> before<00:05:01.220> i<00:05:01.430> begin<00:05:02.000> to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
and dampen my hair before i begin to

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.690 
and dampen my hair before i begin to
manipulate<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:02.870> style<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.440> some<00:05:04.190> natural

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
manipulate it and style it some natural

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.280 
manipulate it and style it some natural
girls<00:05:05.060> like<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.660> spray<00:05:05.840> their<00:05:05.990> hair<00:05:06.169> with

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
girls like to spray their hair with

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.870 
girls like to spray their hair with
water<00:05:06.530> I<00:05:06.889> think<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.460> this<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.580> better

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
water I think that this is better

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.340 
water I think that this is better
because<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.300> adds<00:05:08.450> moisture<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:09.020> my<00:05:09.110> hair<00:05:09.320> just

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
because it adds moisture to my hair just

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.320 
because it adds moisture to my hair just
like<00:05:09.680> water<00:05:09.950> does<00:05:10.220> but<00:05:10.460> also<00:05:10.669> has<00:05:10.940> some<00:05:10.970> amino

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
like water does but also has some amino

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.240 
like water does but also has some amino
acid<00:05:11.750> so<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.020> helps<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.380> strengthen<00:05:12.680> my<00:05:13.040> hair

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
acid so it helps to strengthen my hair

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.370 
acid so it helps to strengthen my hair
both<00:05:13.490> relax<00:05:13.820> and<00:05:14.120> natural<00:05:14.540> as<00:05:14.720> well<00:05:15.169> as

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
both relax and natural as well as

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.690 
both relax and natural as well as

decreased breakage at the line of

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.070 
decreased breakage at the line of

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
the deep penetrating reconstructor this

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.230 
the deep penetrating reconstructor this
is<00:06:06.229> their<00:06:06.410> original<00:06:07.070> I<00:06:07.370> think<00:06:07.970> this<00:06:08.090> may<00:06:08.210> be

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
is their original I think this may be

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.060 
is their original I think this may be
the<00:06:08.419> first<00:06:08.450> item<00:06:09.440> that<00:06:09.560> they<00:06:09.650> had<00:06:09.860> in<00:06:09.979> their

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:10.070 
the first item that they had in their

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.800 
the first item that they had in their
capac<00:06:10.460> line<00:06:10.669> that's<00:06:11.060> been<00:06:11.300> around<00:06:11.419> forever

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
capac line that's been around forever

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.930 
capac line that's been around forever
this<00:06:12.650> is<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.919> original<00:06:13.280> product<00:06:13.610> this<00:06:13.729> is<00:06:13.820> an

this is the original product this is an
intensive<00:06:14.600> protein<00:06:15.289> reconstructor<00:06:15.979> so<00:06:16.280> this

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
intensive protein reconstructor so this

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.000
