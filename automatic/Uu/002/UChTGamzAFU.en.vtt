sorry there may be a little bit of a
kindred<00:00:58.370> spirit<00:00:58.579> between<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.180> machines<00:00:59.510> in<00:00:59.690> a

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
kindred spirit between the machines in a

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.450 
kindred spirit between the machines in a
way<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.199> that's<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.440> big<00:01:00.590> story<00:01:00.890> element<00:01:01.370> that

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460

we<00:01:01.579> won't<00:01:01.760> get<00:01:01.910> into<00:01:02.090> today<00:01:02.449> but<00:01:02.829> yeah<00:01:03.829> you

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
we won't get into today but yeah you

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.920 
we won't get into today but yeah you
could<00:01:04.220> probably<00:01:04.369> guess<00:01:04.909> that<00:01:04.939> she's<00:01:05.600> not<00:01:05.780> this

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
could probably guess that she's not this

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.510 
could probably guess that she's not this
indiscriminate<00:01:06.680> hunter<00:01:06.920> that<00:01:07.070> just<00:01:07.250> wants<00:01:07.460> to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
indiscriminate hunter that just wants to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.460 
indiscriminate hunter that just wants to
go<00:01:07.640> around<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.000> kill<00:01:08.150> things<00:01:08.360> she<00:01:09.170> only<00:01:09.260> does

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
go around and kill things she only does

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.789 
go around and kill things she only does
so<00:01:09.619> with<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.799> purpose<00:01:11.320> almost<00:01:12.320> at<00:01:12.439> first<00:01:12.650> glance

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
so with a purpose almost at first glance

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.990 
so with a purpose almost at first glance
you<00:01:12.979> take<00:01:13.130> a<00:01:13.159> look<00:01:13.310> at<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.520> bone<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:13.850> might

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
you take a look at that bone you might

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.429 
you take a look at that bone you might
think<00:01:14.210> wait<00:01:14.450> that's<00:01:14.840> just<00:01:15.049> a<00:01:15.140> regular

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
think wait that's just a regular

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.770 
think wait that's just a regular
composite<00:01:16.009> bow<00:01:16.159> but<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.240> take<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.450> closer

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
composite bow but then you take a closer

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.570 
composite bow but then you take a closer
look<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.439> actually<00:01:18.650> notice<00:01:19.159> that<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:19.490> a

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
look and you actually notice that it's a

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.670 
look and you actually notice that it's a
mixture<00:01:19.970> it's<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.210> mixture<00:01:20.450> of<00:01:20.540> elements<00:01:21.020> first

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
mixture it's a mixture of elements first

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.410 
mixture it's a mixture of elements first
it's<00:01:21.979> a<00:01:22.070> mixture<00:01:22.310> of<00:01:22.430> elements<00:01:22.580> found<00:01:23.119> in<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
it's a mixture of elements found in the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.060 
it's a mixture of elements found in the
naturally<00:01:23.840> occurring<00:01:23.869> environment<00:01:24.770> but<00:01:24.890> it's

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
naturally occurring environment but it's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.179 
naturally occurring environment but it's
also<00:01:25.340> mixed<00:01:25.970> with<00:01:26.030> machine<00:01:26.479> parts<00:01:26.810> so<00:01:27.409> machine

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
also mixed with machine parts so machine

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.160 
also mixed with machine parts so machine
parts<00:01:28.400> with<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:28.640> key<00:01:29.030> turbo<00:01:29.630> aizen's<00:01:29.990> your

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
parts with the key turbo aizen's your

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.289 
parts with the key turbo aizen's your
add-on<00:01:30.439> that<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.040> base<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.490> economy<00:01:31.850> and

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
add-on that the base of the economy and

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.390 
add-on that the base of the economy and
you're<00:01:32.810> gonna<00:01:32.930> want<00:01:33.229> them<00:01:33.380> because<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.860> LOI<00:01:34.100> is

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
you're gonna want them because a LOI is

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.640 
you're gonna want them because a LOI is
the<00:01:34.880> Mastercraft<00:01:35.360> woman

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.990 

the<00:01:43.650> different<00:01:43.980> weapons<00:01:44.370> that<00:01:44.520> are<00:01:44.580> involved

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
the different weapons that are involved

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.970 
the different weapons that are involved
in<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.330> screen<00:01:45.630> there<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.050> can<00:01:46.620> actually

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
in the screen there you can actually

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.560 
in the screen there you can actually
you're<00:01:47.340> taking<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.820> at<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.330> there

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you're taking a look at that will there

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.270 
you're taking a look at that will there
are<00:01:48.660> four<00:01:48.870> slots<00:01:49.230> on<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.440> will<00:01:49.710> for<00:01:49.950> weapons
