really easy to put on you get the pod
you<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> gauge<00:00:38.100> so<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.420> pod

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you get the gauge so you get this pod

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.220 
you get the gauge so you get this pod
you<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.860> gauge<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.399> bracket<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.230> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you get the gauge the bracket and a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
you get the gauge the bracket and a
really<00:00:43.739> simple<00:00:44.070> installation<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.180> newer

bikes got a very simple harness that
goes<00:00:47.640> from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.000> gauge<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:49.140> into<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
goes from the gauge and then into the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
goes from the gauge and then into the
connector<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> bike<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.270> simple<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

gauges<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.659> marine<00:01:07.500> industry<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gauges for the marine industry the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.170 
gauges for the marine industry the
military<00:01:09.020> construction<00:01:10.020> agriculture<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
military construction agriculture and

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.000 
military construction agriculture and
power<00:01:12.180> sports<00:01:12.510> markets<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.740> this

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
power sports markets and so this this

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.730 
power sports markets and so this this
gauge<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.520> been<00:01:14.729> tested<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.740> severe

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
gauge has been tested for severe

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.960 
gauge has been tested for severe
environment<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.700> make<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.600> lot<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.170> rugged<00:01:19.470> duty

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
environment we make a lot of rugged duty

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.390 
environment we make a lot of rugged duty
application<00:01:20.970> gauges<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.600> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.159> same

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
application gauges so this is the same

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.249 
application gauges so this is the same
the<00:01:24.090> same<00:01:24.270> quality<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:24.900> go<00:01:24.990> into<00:01:25.140> a

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the same quality that would go into a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.670 
the same quality that would go into a
military<00:01:25.590> gauge<00:01:26.450> awesome<00:01:27.450> sure<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.470> just

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
guys have really done a nice job of

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.930 
guys have really done a nice job of
lighting<00:04:12.860> it<00:04:13.040> up<00:04:13.070> there's<00:04:13.489> a<00:04:13.550> couple<00:04:13.700> other

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
lighting it up there's a couple other

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.460 
lighting it up there's a couple other
things<00:04:14.030> that<00:04:14.239> I<00:04:14.360> really<00:04:14.390> think<00:04:14.900> are<00:04:15.020> cool<00:04:15.260> and

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
things that I really think are cool and

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.650 
things that I really think are cool and
that<00:04:15.860> is<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.820> lighting<00:04:17.030> is<00:04:17.150> all<00:04:17.299> LED

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
that is is that the lighting is all LED

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.960 
that is is that the lighting is all LED
so<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:17.870> got<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:17.989> hundred<00:04:18.260> thousand<00:04:18.950> hours<00:04:19.310> of

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
so you got a hundred thousand hours of

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.000 
so you got a hundred thousand hours of
traditional<00:04:20.900> lighting<00:04:21.290> that's<00:04:21.410> available<00:04:21.890> to
