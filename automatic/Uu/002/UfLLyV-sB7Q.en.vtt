00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.910
 hi girls today frieze tutorial 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.980
 nuanced with glitter and necessary 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.090
 between in cig versa then I did mine 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.790
 the wall the filed and buffered buffet 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.020
 I have also done the la la la already 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:36.230
 line of the of the smile with the gel 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.780
 tiffany of passion umbria own 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.840
 because i 'm going to use welter 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 tiffany and others used are tiffany green 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.040
 and in white the procedure you will see that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.230
 it's very simple 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.980
 after collecting my smaila 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.059
 in vado with a bit of constructor a 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:00.280
 fill all the french properly 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.280
 without going over the line 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.160
 take a pass in too much 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.160
 nor too thin 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:34.659
 now without channeling we are going to take 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:40.840
 first the darker glitter and with a 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:43.270
 simple flat brush let's go to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.979
 then take the glitter out and put them on 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 at the top of the french 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.740
 obviously if you want an effect more 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.920
 covering can can do even under 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.240
 a base is faded and then passed over the 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.920
 glitter on top 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:09.470
 let's say that in this case in a kind 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 of glass effect while the glitter 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.400
 white and we are going to dust with a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.310
 fan brush 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 this because we put them slowly 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:29.030
 even someone on those tiffany and the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.690
 its hard you see that it will come by itself not 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.690
 we have to do something else 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.870
 now we can go to the lamp 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.950
 completed the structure or buffer 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.300
 and now we can proceed with a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.300
 our de core angello 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.720
 I added a loan shark to the cooked mouse 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.940
 and this is me in the finite art 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.370
 to know if you liked it with a comment 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.580
 and with a like a kiss and the next 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.580
 Hello
