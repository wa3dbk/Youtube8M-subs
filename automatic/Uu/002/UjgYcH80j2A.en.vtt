00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.710
 So we begin the first lesson on the factory 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.650
 one ultu machine of their own 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:17.130
 handles what can happen to the machine 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:21.090
 before the truth suddenly starts breaking off 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 some awl awl awl awl and did not start 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.859
 tear off what happened is incomprehensible first 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.050
 what do you need hello wolf he first 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.170
 most likely you have it either passed by 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.520
 thick seam and stretched either tip 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.200
 needles blunt 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 but most likely this results because 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.870
 block simply bent over but 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 imperceptible yes eyes therefore better to a wolf 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.309
 change immediately after she started 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 tear off a little steeper than you 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.910
 as soon as his k went down queen exactly 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:58.859
 not others all removed the tick took another 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:01.920
 their benefits but now on sale usually 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:06.560
 we change to the same one that was taken into account 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.439
 mostly 8090 100 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.159
 these are required which are the most 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.259
 common and often used 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.670
 there are even more thick and wolves in cadiz 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.250
 120 to 150 170 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.549
 less than 7060 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:31.619
 needles but we pull out the Christmas tree looked 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.400
 found a number through a magnifying glass 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:39.240
 on it and found suitable their stocks 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.990
 or I can buy so salaries on and 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 leaves not turning away far in order 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 to tick the original 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.070
 the position is exactly different position on not 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.079
 put but there is a bottom bun you 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.420
 spinning in different directions you don't know in 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.939
 which 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.159
 side and better put something on a needle 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:05.229
 there is one dimple all over and wolves in 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.319
 this recess should go to the thread 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.800
 Here is this thread for example, I have it 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.770
 with those not now they spill some 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.620
 machines left or right right mode 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.819
 usually left or back she 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.489
 laid through not 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:30.390
 thread making their way to the hook and here if u 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:34.840
 you she left to protect the wolf need to put 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:38.610
 this notch recess length to 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.610
 was left before 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.060
 in this case, I don't have it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.060
 lies in front here you can see 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.890
 what does deepening long deepening 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.209
 should go to me like this or we set 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.030
 tick left until the end is not 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.980
 the middle and a little less at the pyramids 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.770
 top and fasten tighten the screw and 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.700
 someone will screwdriver someone 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.300
 will be by hand 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.330
 if the box only by hand make a cog 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.819
 parts of the leg by hand do not need much gusev 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.610
 cue and tighten with a screwdriver but someone he 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.100
 worth a screwdriver then the screwdriver is not strong 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.519
 trying to tighten it up 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:36.970
 after all being enough to refuel again 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:39.430
 needle and if the reason was in the corners 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.010
 the issue will be with you our masters in 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.959
 In this case, you will not need it all 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.530
 equal to your machine 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:50.459
 broke off then look second hand on 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.459
 that's all for now
