00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
as a base and now I'm using this dark

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.480 
as a base and now I'm using this dark
red<00:01:29.549> color<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.210> blend<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.200> into<00:01:31.590> my<00:01:32.070> crease

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
red color and blend this into my crease

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.260

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
but I prefer my natural lashes so I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.880 
but I prefer my natural lashes so I
won't<00:02:17.900> use<00:02:18.170> fake<00:02:18.410> lashes

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.830 

like<00:02:23.890> skin<00:02:24.340> always<00:02:24.700> looks<00:02:24.910> really<00:02:25.180> really

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
like skin always looks really really

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.760 
like skin always looks really really
glowy<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.620> shiny<00:02:27.240> so<00:02:28.240> I'm<00:02:28.540> using<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.500> betty

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
glowy and shiny so I'm using the betty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.490 
glowy and shiny so I'm using the betty
lou<00:02:30.069> manizer<00:02:30.430> from<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.000> balm<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.230> is

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
lou manizer from the balm and this is

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.710 
lou manizer from the balm and this is
basically<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.160> bronzer<00:02:33.790> but<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.180> also<00:02:34.360> has<00:02:34.690> a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
basically a bronzer but it also has a

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440 
basically a bronzer but it also has a
little<00:02:35.050> bit<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.230> shimmer<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:35.920> so<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.420> a

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
little bit of shimmer in it so it is a

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.110 
little bit of shimmer in it so it is a
bronzer<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.380> highlighter<00:02:38.440> at<00:02:39.430> once<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:40.090> I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
bronzer and highlighter at once and I

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.080 
bronzer and highlighter at once and I
think<00:02:40.360> that<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.630> perfect<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.530> regrade<00:02:42.090> Blake's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
think that is perfect to regrade Blake's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.320 
think that is perfect to regrade Blake's
look<00:02:46.980> but<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.220> still<00:02:48.489> want<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.850> add<00:02:49.000> a<00:02:49.030> little

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
look but we still want to add a little

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.960 
look but we still want to add a little

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
try to learn everything from the way I

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.759 
try to learn everything from the way I
do<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.959> because<00:04:14.530> I<00:04:14.890> don't<00:04:15.790> really<00:04:16.030> have<00:04:16.299> a

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
do it because I don't really have a

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.490 
do it because I don't really have a
scheme<00:04:17.769> or<00:04:18.150> system<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.419> curling<00:04:19.840> my<00:04:19.959> hair<00:04:19.989> as

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
scheme or system of curling my hair as

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.350 
scheme or system of curling my hair as
you<00:04:20.979> can<00:04:21.160> tell<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.609> looks<00:04:21.760> really<00:04:22.330> really

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
you can tell it looks really really

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.030 
you can tell it looks really really
messy<00:04:23.080> and

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
messy and

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:47.549 
messy and
confusing

00:04:47.549 --> 00:04:47.559 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:50.089 

and<00:04:48.099> once<00:04:48.399> you're<00:04:48.609> done<00:04:48.639> curling<00:04:49.539> your<00:04:49.719> hair

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:50.099 
and once you're done curling your hair

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:54.299 
and once you're done curling your hair
remove<00:04:51.099> all<00:04:51.429> the<00:04:51.849> bobby<00:04:52.089> pins<00:04:52.539> and<00:04:53.099> you<00:04:54.099> are

00:04:54.299 --> 00:04:54.309 
remove all the bobby pins and you are

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:59.309 
remove all the bobby pins and you are
done<00:04:54.909> I<00:04:56.909> always<00:04:57.909> like<00:04:58.059> to<00:04:58.239> brush<00:04:58.449> out<00:04:58.719> my<00:04:58.749> hair

00:04:59.309 --> 00:04:59.319 
done I always like to brush out my hair

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.739 
done I always like to brush out my hair
so<00:04:59.739> the<00:05:00.459> waves<00:05:00.759> look<00:05:01.089> a<00:05:01.239> little<00:05:01.449> bit<00:05:01.569> more

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:01.749 
so the waves look a little bit more

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.499 
so the waves look a little bit more
natural<00:05:01.989> and<00:05:02.709> I<00:05:03.309> think<00:05:03.549> that<00:05:03.729> also<00:05:03.999> really

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
natural and I think that also really

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.499 
natural and I think that also really
helps<00:05:04.629> to<00:05:05.019> be<00:05:05.169> carried<00:05:05.499> blares<00:05:06.239> did<00:05:07.239> I<00:05:07.329> say

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
helps to be carried blares did I say

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.849 
helps to be carried blares did I say
Blair<00:05:07.869> I<00:05:08.079> mean<00:05:08.259> Blake's<00:05:08.679> look<00:05:09.689> and<00:05:10.859> that's

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:11.859 
Blair I mean Blake's look and that's

00:05:11.859 --> 00:05:14.399 
Blair I mean Blake's look and that's
basically<00:05:12.369> it<00:05:12.489> but<00:05:12.879> if<00:05:12.969> you<00:05:13.119> want<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.809> you<00:05:14.199> can

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:14.409 
basically it but if you want to you can

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.209 
basically it but if you want to you can
also<00:05:15.089> make<00:05:16.089> a<00:05:16.119> ponytail<00:05:16.929> that's<00:05:17.499> what<00:05:17.769> I<00:05:17.799> did

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
also make a ponytail that's what I did

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.019 
also make a ponytail that's what I did
and<00:05:18.699> leave<00:05:19.599> out<00:05:19.899> a<00:05:20.229> little<00:05:20.739> part<00:05:21.099> of<00:05:21.219> your<00:05:21.399> hair

00:05:22.019 --> 00:05:22.029
