00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.040
 I'm going to be a video two I'm going to 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.139
 teach how to put on the handkerchief 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.639
 turban we have been seeing it in the 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.020
 street style text photos and we've 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.850
 behind but I at least still not 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.289
 I have done with none I have taken 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.820
 because discovered a very 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.740
 simple to do it through a 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.330
 We're going to try different handkerchiefs 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.110
 handkerchiefs in different ways so that 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.110
 you have it easier 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.540
 the first option we are going to do with 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.100
 a rectangular handkerchief like this one 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.510
 first thing we're going to do is put it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.510
 over the head as a blanket 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.790
 you have to make a world in the center 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.610
 and you have to be careful not to take a 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.460
 little hair that will bother you pre taiz 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.860
 you are putting the handkerchief 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.600
 that it does not stay in the center once 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.230
 you have it fixed well do a double 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.399
 knot 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.399
 go back to tighten well 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.690
 and then with that part to spare 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.100
 you have to look for example like this 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 if the ball does not have a double face that is 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 of the pretty face let's say with that towards 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.500
 behind 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.130
 and you put it in the back without it 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.130
 make a lot of bulk 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.250
 with the side with leftovers you also have 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.040
 that be the good side 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.980
 backwards and without a long return from 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 lateral inserted with the times fixed well 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.940
 the cloth the sides is time to place 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.010
 the hair in its place and good is very 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.330
 important that if you wear a dress by 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.710
 example like mine that is stamped or 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.869
 a garment that is very striking 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.820
 use a handkerchief in shades and 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.350
 vice versa if you have a look in shades 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.760
 smooth to recover life from the set 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.760
 use a patterned handkerchief 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.420
 we are going to do it in the same way 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.370
 putting bandana on the head of 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.850
 form of blanket leaving Arctic the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.850
 front part 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.860
 we do a knot in the same way 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.030
 and good in the double knot as you see this 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.590
 ticket or that we had left over here I have 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.590
 coupled with one of the parties 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.230
 so that it is well fixed 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 is that with this handkerchief we can not do 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.800
 the same as before it reaches us for 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 take it back then what are we going to 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.800
 to do is entangle more and a little and what 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.800
 we will stick by the side 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.590
 and then the other 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:36.010
 in the life 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.830
 and place the handkerchief 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.540
 the hair as mentioned before 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.270
 and well you see that for example for a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.610
 Total look like this black color and 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.980
 the handkerchief in a patterned tone gives 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.960
 much life a trick that I forget 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.820
 document them beforehand if you have a handkerchief 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.260
 of silk that slips or you have a lot 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.700
 hair you can use this type of 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.620
 hairpins that are the ones that are used 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.720
 normally to hook the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.890
 extensions and good if you want this 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.930
 video can help someone 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.370
 more do not forget to share it and then 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.450
