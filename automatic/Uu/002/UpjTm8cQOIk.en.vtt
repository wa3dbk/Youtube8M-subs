directly into the microphone as you can
see<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:38.010> I'll<00:02:38.130> angle<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.520> up<00:02:38.640> so<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.630> get<00:02:39.780> us

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
see there I'll angle it up so you get us

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.440 
see there I'll angle it up so you get us
to<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.530> that<00:02:40.680> it's<00:02:41.130> a<00:02:41.220> great<00:02:41.580> design<00:02:42.000> it's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
to look at that it's a great design it's

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.780 
to look at that it's a great design it's
very<00:02:42.540> snug<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.680> very<00:02:43.800> firm<00:02:44.100> in<00:02:44.310> place<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
very snug it's very firm in place and

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.210 
very snug it's very firm in place and
then<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.240> just<00:02:45.450> simply<00:02:45.570> just<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:45.990> this

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
then you just simply just use this

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.310 
then you just simply just use this
adjustment<00:02:47.220> knob<00:02:47.940> right<00:02:48.240> there<00:02:48.300> to<00:02:48.630> angle<00:02:49.050> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
can put it exactly facing straight down

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240 
can put it exactly facing straight down
to<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.720> drumhead<00:02:55.200> or<00:02:55.470> some<00:02:55.920> people<00:02:56.130> like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
to the the drumhead or some people like

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.520 
to the the drumhead or some people like
to<00:02:56.489> angle<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:56.820> towards<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.630> middle<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
to angle it towards the middle of the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
to angle it towards the middle of the
drumhead<00:02:59.220> for<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.459> little<00:02:59.730> more<00:02:59.880> reverberant

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
