00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
basically my reactions to it I thought

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.630 
basically my reactions to it I thought
somebody<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> return<00:01:34.829> but<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
somebody was going to return but the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.700 
somebody was going to return but the
ending<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.420> okay<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> gives<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
ending was okay you know it gives the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.859 
ending was okay you know it gives the
show<00:01:37.920> maybe<00:01:38.220> seven<00:01:38.579> point<00:01:38.759> five<00:01:38.880> eight<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.750> of

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
show maybe seven point five eight out of

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.050 
show maybe seven point five eight out of
ten<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.100> basically<00:01:41.369> maybe<00:01:41.759> wrong

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
ten so that's basically maybe wrong
