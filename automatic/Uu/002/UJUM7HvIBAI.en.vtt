was made around 1998 and I remember

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.810 
was made around 1998 and I remember
playing<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.050> was<00:00:19.170> younger<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.789> he<00:00:20.789> was

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
overall one of my favorite games for the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
overall one of my favorite games for the
n64<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.730> don't<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.970> why<00:00:24.180> but<00:00:24.840> someone<00:00:25.320> just

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
n64 I don't know why but someone just

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.019 
n64 I don't know why but someone just
stuck<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.920> mean<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.340> based<00:00:26.609> off<00:00:26.849> the

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
stuck out I mean it was based off the

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.439 
stuck out I mean it was based off the
movie<00:00:27.300> Toy<00:00:27.449> Story<00:00:27.779> 2<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.820> overall<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.179> it

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
movie Toy Story 2 and overall I think it

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.290 
movie Toy Story 2 and overall I think it
had<00:00:30.539> great<00:00:30.810> gameplay<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.520> was<00:00:32.610> just<00:00:32.820> fun

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you just saw the cinematics were very

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.549

primitive<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> time<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:42.390> all<00:00:42.719> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
primitive at the time because all you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
there to explain the storyline which was

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.500 
there to explain the storyline which was
okay<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.969> didn't<00:00:48.149> eat<00:00:48.270> anything

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
