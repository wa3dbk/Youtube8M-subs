let<00:00:17.390> me<00:00:17.630> tell<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:18.020> about<00:00:18.200> heart<00:00:18.680> rate

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
let me tell you about heart rate

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.050 
let me tell you about heart rate
training<00:00:19.100> I<00:00:19.810> will<00:00:20.810> start<00:00:21.050> at<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:21.320> beginning

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
training I will start at the beginning

training I will start at the beginning
in<00:00:23.380> 1977<00:00:24.380> we<00:00:24.560> invented<00:00:24.980> heart<00:00:25.279> rate

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
in 1977 we invented heart rate

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.310 
in 1977 we invented heart rate
monitoring<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.330> help<00:00:26.539> people<00:00:26.930> be<00:00:27.050> fitter

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
monitoring to help people be fitter

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.759 
monitoring to help people be fitter
faster<00:00:28.390> before<00:00:29.390> then<00:00:29.840> people<00:00:30.439> thought<00:00:30.590> the

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
faster before then people thought the

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.679 
faster before then people thought the
best<00:00:30.980> way<00:00:31.130> to<00:00:31.279> get<00:00:31.519> fit<00:00:31.789> levels<00:00:32.150> to<00:00:32.269> train<00:00:32.540> as

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
best way to get fit levels to train as

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.049 
best way to get fit levels to train as
hard<00:00:32.870> as<00:00:33.080> they<00:00:33.199> possibly<00:00:33.230> could<00:00:33.949> but<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:34.880> fact

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
hard as they possibly could but in fact

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.760 
hard as they possibly could but in fact
the<00:00:35.300> very<00:00:35.540> best<00:00:35.840> way<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.079> reach<00:00:36.380> your<00:00:36.590> goal

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
the very best way to reach your goal

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.049 
the very best way to reach your goal
whatever<00:00:37.370> it<00:00:37.700> is<00:00:37.850> is<00:00:38.270> to<00:00:38.540> train<00:00:38.809> smart<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.910> do

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
whatever it is is to train smart you do

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:42.700 
whatever it is is to train smart you do
this<00:00:41.239> by<00:00:41.300> listening<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.809> your<00:00:41.960> heart<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:42.680> you

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
this by listening to your heart so you

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.380 
this by listening to your heart so you
know<00:00:42.950> when<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.280> go<00:00:43.399> file<00:00:43.730> store<00:00:44.000> meant<00:00:44.149> to<00:00:44.239> go

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
know when to go file store meant to go

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.049 
know when to go file store meant to go
slow<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.040> that's<00:00:46.040> why<00:00:46.219> people<00:00:46.579> choose<00:00:46.700> polar

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
slow and that's why people choose polar

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.360 
slow and that's why people choose polar
we<00:00:47.930> not<00:00:48.050> only<00:00:48.079> listen<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.680> their<00:00:48.950> hearts<00:00:49.250> the

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
we not only listen to their hearts the

we not only listen to their hearts the
great<00:00:49.700> accuracy<00:00:50.090> but<00:00:50.930> we<00:00:51.110> tell<00:00:51.320> them<00:00:51.440> what<00:00:51.620> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800

information means for their body think

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.819 
information means for their body think

to seventy percent you burn fat and
improve<00:01:43.310> endurance<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.680> push

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
improve endurance and so on if you push

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.560 
improve endurance and so on if you push
your<00:01:45.979> more<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.430> limits<00:01:46.790> and<00:01:46.909> you<00:01:47.390> should

your more to the limits and you should

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.780 
your more to the limits and you should
only<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.140> for<00:01:48.200> short<00:01:48.590> birth<00:01:48.829> you<00:01:49.520> develop

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
only do this for short birth you develop

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.770 
only do this for short birth you develop
your<00:01:49.970> maximum<00:01:50.570> performance<00:01:50.720> and<00:01:51.259> speed

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
your maximum performance and speed

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.240 
your maximum performance and speed
knowing<00:01:53.780> how<00:01:54.020> hard<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.380> push<00:01:54.590> your<00:01:54.770> heart<00:01:55.009> and

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
knowing how hard to push your heart and

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.429 
knowing how hard to push your heart and
for<00:01:55.610> how<00:01:55.729> long<00:01:55.759> takes<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.720> guess<00:01:56.930> work<00:01:57.200> out<00:01:57.380> of

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
for how long takes a guess work out of

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.889 
for how long takes a guess work out of
your<00:01:57.619> hard<00:01:57.860> work<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:58.759> you'll<00:01:58.909> never<00:01:59.180> over<00:01:59.689> or

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
your hard work so you'll never over or

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.420 
your hard work so you'll never over or
under<00:02:00.229> train<00:02:00.469> again

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
under train again

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.610 
under train again
and<00:02:01.520> knowing<00:02:02.330> these<00:02:02.540> things<00:02:02.570> is<00:02:03.020> what<00:02:03.350> polar

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
and knowing these things is what polar

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.460 
and knowing these things is what polar
does<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.250> what<00:02:04.820> makes<00:02:04.970> us<00:02:05.150> special<00:02:05.380> because<00:02:06.380> we

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
does is what makes us special because we

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.260 
does is what makes us special because we
don't<00:02:06.680> just<00:02:06.890> pass<00:02:07.130> on<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> information<00:02:07.730> we

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
don't just pass on the information we
