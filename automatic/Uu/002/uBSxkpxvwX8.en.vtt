00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
one I feel like I had to use more of

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.550 
one I feel like I had to use more of
this<00:03:53.519> though<00:03:53.820> than<00:03:54.360> normal<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:55.019> get<00:03:55.170> it<00:03:55.410> all

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
this though than normal to get it all

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.840 
this though than normal to get it all
through<00:03:55.829> my<00:03:55.950> hair<00:03:56.160> like<00:03:56.310> I<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.459> feel<00:03:56.670> like

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
through my hair like I don't feel like

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.490 
through my hair like I don't feel like
it<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.120> stretches<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.780> much<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.170> get<00:03:58.290> through

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
it like stretches as much to get through

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.140 
it like stretches as much to get through
your<00:03:58.620> hair<00:03:58.799> as<00:03:58.920> much<00:03:59.130> or<00:03:59.579> maybe<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.000> was<00:04:00.120> just

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
your hair as much or maybe it was just

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.120 
your hair as much or maybe it was just
that<00:04:00.510> I<00:04:00.540> needed<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:01.019> put<00:04:01.170> more<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.829> make<00:04:01.980> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
that I needed to put more in to make the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.970 
that I needed to put more in to make the
curl<00:04:02.780> stay<00:04:03.780> and<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.140> frizz<00:04:04.470> up<00:04:04.590> as<00:04:04.769> much

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
curl stay and that frizz up as much

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.500 
curl stay and that frizz up as much
because<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.250> noticed<00:04:05.609> it<00:04:05.700> would<00:04:05.790> you<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.299> hold

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
because I noticed it would you know hold

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.479 
because I noticed it would you know hold
the<00:04:06.720> curl<00:04:06.989> but<00:04:07.530> I<00:04:07.590> feel<00:04:07.829> like<00:04:07.950> it<00:04:08.100> would<00:04:08.250> get

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
the curl but I feel like it would get

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.130 
the curl but I feel like it would get
big<00:04:08.910> if<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.180> didn't<00:04:09.420> put<00:04:09.540> enough<00:04:09.570> in<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.049> like

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
big if I didn't put enough in and like

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.860 
big if I didn't put enough in and like
it<00:04:10.260> would<00:04:10.350> expand<00:04:10.739> more<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:12.600> was<00:04:12.750> my

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
it would expand more so that was my

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.720 
it would expand more so that was my
thoughts<00:04:13.079> on<00:04:13.230> this<00:04:13.350> but<00:04:13.560> not<00:04:13.680> bad<00:04:13.950> I<00:04:14.220> think<00:04:14.280> it

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
thoughts on this but not bad I think it

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.159 
thoughts on this but not bad I think it
probably<00:04:15.209> worked<00:04:15.600> great<00:04:15.780> for<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.989> lot<00:04:16.109> of

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
probably worked great for a lot of

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.199 
probably worked great for a lot of
people<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.700> last<00:04:17.940> thing<00:04:18.330> that<00:04:18.660> I'm<00:04:18.870> going

smoothie

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.850 
smoothie
I<00:04:37.419> felt<00:04:38.259> like<00:04:39.569> gave<00:04:40.569> me<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> lot<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.050> shrinkage

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
I felt like gave me a lot of shrinkage

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.800 
I felt like gave me a lot of shrinkage
I<00:04:41.889> still<00:04:42.520> get<00:04:42.639> shrinkage<00:04:42.910> that's<00:04:43.449> going<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.720> be

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
I still get shrinkage that's going to be

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.740 
I still get shrinkage that's going to be
inevitable<00:04:44.289> but<00:04:44.949> this<00:04:45.669> not<00:04:46.030> nearly<00:04:46.389> as<00:04:46.569> much

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
inevitable but this not nearly as much

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.450 
inevitable but this not nearly as much
this<00:04:46.990> didn't<00:04:47.380> provide<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.979> whole<00:04:48.190> lot<00:04:48.340> of

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
this didn't provide a whole lot of

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.659 
this didn't provide a whole lot of
shrinkage<00:04:48.759> either<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.860> smells<00:04:51.130> great

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
shrinkage either and this smells great

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.020 
shrinkage either and this smells great
this<00:04:52.150> also<00:04:52.389> has<00:04:52.750> no<00:04:53.289> mineral<00:04:53.830> oil<00:04:54.039> parabens

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
this also has no mineral oil parabens

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.029 
this also has no mineral oil parabens
sulfates<00:04:55.210> all<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.840> stuff<00:04:56.139> so<00:04:56.169> I<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:56.860> that

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:57.039 
sulfates all that stuff so I like that

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.540 
sulfates all that stuff so I like that
as<00:04:57.190> well<00:04:57.220> and<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.930> feel<00:04:59.229> like<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.620> use<00:04:59.860> it<00:05:00.009> now<00:05:00.190> in

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
as well and I feel like I use it now in

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.529 
as well and I feel like I use it now in
conjunction<00:05:00.970> with<00:05:01.750> the<00:05:02.199> Shea<00:05:02.590> Moisture<00:05:03.539> the

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
conjunction with the Shea Moisture the

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.150 
conjunction with the Shea Moisture the
one<00:05:04.690> for<00:05:04.870> dry<00:05:05.080> hair<00:05:05.320> looks<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.830> yellowy

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
one for dry hair looks like the yellowy

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.969 
one for dry hair looks like the yellowy
color<00:05:06.550> label<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.990> conditioner<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:08.620> use<00:05:08.800> that

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
color label that conditioner I use that

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.980 
color label that conditioner I use that
as<00:05:09.070> my<00:05:09.220> leave-in<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.330> use<00:05:10.509> it<00:05:10.659> with<00:05:10.810> this

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
as my leave-in and I use it with this

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.749 
as my leave-in and I use it with this
they<00:05:11.349> work<00:05:11.560> really<00:05:11.800> well<00:05:12.039> together<00:05:12.250> no

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
they work really well together no

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.420 
they work really well together no
build-up<00:05:13.240> clumping<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.930> this<00:05:14.349> lasts<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.190> while

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
build-up clumping and this lasts a while

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.110 
build-up clumping and this lasts a while
so<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.120> feel<00:05:16.419> like<00:05:17.310> if<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.610> use<00:05:18.849> the<00:05:19.000> right

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
so I feel like if you use the right

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.700 
so I feel like if you use the right
amount<00:05:19.240> which<00:05:19.539> is<00:05:19.569> not<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.930> whole<00:05:20.169> lot<00:05:20.380> so<00:05:20.590> do

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
amount which is not a whole lot so do

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.890 
amount which is not a whole lot so do
not<00:05:20.889> overload<00:05:21.460> use<00:05:21.970> the<00:05:22.150> right<00:05:22.300> amount<00:05:22.419> and

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
not overload use the right amount and

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.649 
not overload use the right amount and
the<00:05:23.740> first<00:05:23.949> time<00:05:24.220> when<00:05:24.759> you<00:05:24.909> continue<00:05:25.270> to<00:05:25.539> do

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
the first time when you continue to do

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:27.839 
the first time when you continue to do
your<00:05:25.810> pineapples<00:05:26.470> each<00:05:26.770> night<00:05:27.039> like<00:05:27.550> you

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
your pineapples each night like you

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.360
