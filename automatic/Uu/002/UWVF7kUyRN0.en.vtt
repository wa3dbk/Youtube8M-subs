well guys I wanted to give you a few
technical<00:00:04.319> notes<00:00:04.589> on<00:00:04.859> this<00:00:05.120> assembly<00:00:06.120> that

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
technical notes on this assembly that

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.940 
technical notes on this assembly that
I'm<00:00:07.259> working<00:00:07.440> on<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.460> HEI<00:00:08.880> conversion

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
I'm working on for the HEI conversion

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950 
I'm working on for the HEI conversion
here's<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.610> old<00:00:11.759> module<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.389> came<00:00:12.599> off<00:00:12.780> this

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
here's the old module that came off this

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.400 
here's the old module that came off this
bracket<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.650> is<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:14.009> heatsink<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:15.410> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
bracket this is this heatsink and this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.050 
bracket this is this heatsink and this
is<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> coil<00:00:17.010> over<00:00:17.460> here

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
is the coil over here

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:26.050 
is the coil over here
and<00:00:20.600> here<00:00:21.920> you<00:00:22.920> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:24.779> seat<00:00:25.019> st.<00:00:25.320> mount

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
and here you can see the seat st. mount

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.769 
and here you can see the seat st. mount
like<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.420> on<00:00:28.289> here<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.510> module

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
like this on here and then the module

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.880 
like this on here and then the module
amounts<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.850> it's<00:00:33.690> got<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.710> bolts

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
amounts on it and it's got two bolts

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.920 
amounts on it and it's got two bolts
that<00:00:35.100> hold<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.460> are<00:00:35.550> like<00:00:35.850> -<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.600> these

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that hold it are like - like this these

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
that hold it are like - like this these
you're<00:00:37.140> down<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:38.040> just<00:00:38.190> screws<00:00:38.730> all<00:00:38.969> screws

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you're down and just screws all screws

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.069 
you're down and just screws all screws
off<00:00:39.570> together<00:00:39.719> there<00:00:40.140> now<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
off together there now one thing is

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
off together there now one thing is
these<00:00:43.079> modules<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.710> different<00:00:44.040> sizes<00:00:44.250> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
these modules are different sizes you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.959 
these modules are different sizes you
can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:45.350> slightly<00:00:46.350> different<00:00:46.920> sizes<00:00:49.250> so<00:00:50.250> this

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can see slightly different sizes so this

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.819 
can see slightly different sizes so this
bracket<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> heatsink<00:00:52.020> has<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> be<00:00:52.469> modified

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
bracket this heatsink has to be modified

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.709 
bracket this heatsink has to be modified
you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> remove<00:00:53.730> all<00:00:53.969> these<00:00:54.090> fins<00:00:54.480> you

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you have to remove all these fins you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.939 
you have to remove all these fins you
can<00:00:54.870> kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.140> see<00:00:55.350> her<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.800> I've

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
can kind of see her out there I've

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.700 
can kind of see her out there I've
ground<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> sauce<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.690> off<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.649> you

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ground it with a sauce on it off so you

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.070 
ground it with a sauce on it off so you
got<00:00:58.859> room<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.100> put<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.460> thing<00:00:59.670> on<00:01:00.079> like<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
got room to put this thing on like that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.100 
got room to put this thing on like that
it<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.140> fits<00:01:04.530> right<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.930> is

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it just fits right on and that thing is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.840 
it just fits right on and that thing is
on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.380> backbone<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.040> modules<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
on the backbone of these modules this is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000 
on the backbone of these modules this is
just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.119> four<00:01:09.360> pin<00:01:09.600> module<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.500> four<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> think

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
just a four pin module it's four I think

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580 
just a four pin module it's four I think
I<00:01:11.250> got<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> 1977<00:01:12.810> Impala<00:01:13.320> with<00:01:13.560> a

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I got this one for a 1977 Impala with a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.789 
I got this one for a 1977 Impala with a
350<00:01:14.250> Union<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:15.390> any<00:01:15.600> fourteen<00:01:16.140> module<00:01:16.590> should

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
350 Union but any fourteen module should

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.749 
350 Union but any fourteen module should
work<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.070> fine<00:01:19.040> these<00:01:20.040> things<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.549> got

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
work just fine these things have got

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
work just fine these things have got
right<00:01:21.000> on<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.240> bottom<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.750> them<00:01:21.869> they've<00:01:22.049> got

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
right on the bottom of them they've got

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
right on the bottom of them they've got
two<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.770> locating<00:01:23.130> tabs<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:24.000> normally

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
two little locating tabs that normally

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.840 
two little locating tabs that normally
when<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.290> installed<00:01:25.560> into<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> distributor

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
when it's installed into a distributor

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.999 
when it's installed into a distributor
you<00:01:27.060> know<00:01:27.840> they<00:01:28.020> usually<00:01:28.140> sit<00:01:28.470> inside<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you know they usually sit inside the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.940 
you know they usually sit inside the
distributor<00:01:29.220> on<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.729> radar<00:01:30.060> with<00:01:30.390> GM<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
distributor on a radar with GM and that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
distributor on a radar with GM and that
kind<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.159> locates<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> need<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.420> grind

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
kind of locates it so you need to grind

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.890 
kind of locates it so you need to grind
these<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:34.579> flush<00:01:35.579> as<00:01:36.240> much<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
these down flush as much as you can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.630 
these down flush as much as you can
because<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> certainly<00:01:37.500> needs<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.920> sit<00:01:38.220> flush

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
because it certainly needs to sit flush

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
because it certainly needs to sit flush
on<00:01:38.939> here<00:01:39.770> like<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:40.909> no<00:01:41.909> gaps<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.740> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
on here like so no gaps in it and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
on here like so no gaps in it and
another<00:01:44.640> thing<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:45.270> these<00:01:45.540> things<00:01:45.810> have<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.079> be

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
another thing is these things have to be

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.440 
another thing is these things have to be
grounded<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> have<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.090> good<00:01:48.210> ground

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
grounded I have to have a good ground

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.850 
grounded I have to have a good ground
you<00:01:48.659> can<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:48.869> one<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.079> these<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> got<00:01:49.619> like<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
you can see one of these is got like a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.050 
you can see one of these is got like a
little<00:01:51.950> ring<00:01:52.950> around<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.850> ring

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
little ring around it more of a ring

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.429 
little ring around it more of a ring
around<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.780> normally<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.409> be

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
around it so it normally would be

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230 
around it so it normally would be
grounded<00:01:56.130> with<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> screw<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.880> through<00:01:57.090> it

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
grounded with a screw going through it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.300 
grounded with a screw going through it
but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:58.020> don't<00:01:58.079> trust<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.710> because<00:01:58.950> these

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
but I don't trust that because these

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
but I don't trust that because these
screws<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.969> have<00:02:00.119> these

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
screws I have these

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.570 
screws I have these
little<00:02:00.600> hard<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.500> say<00:02:01.650> deceivers<00:02:02.280> kept<00:02:02.460> these

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
little hard to say deceivers kept these

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.850 
little hard to say deceivers kept these
little<00:02:02.880> star<00:02:03.480> washer<00:02:03.780> made<00:02:04.170> onto<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.680> that's

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
little star washer made onto and that's

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.590 
little star washer made onto and that's
really<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.280> thing's<00:02:05.580> not<00:02:05.760> resting<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.420> on

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
really this thing's not resting this on

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.930 
really this thing's not resting this on
the<00:02:06.720> ground<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.230> is<00:02:07.369> so<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.610> gonna<00:02:08.759> do

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the ground there is so what I'm gonna do

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.960 
the ground there is so what I'm gonna do
is<00:02:09.090> once<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.420> get<00:02:09.540> this<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.930> on<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.590> truck

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
is once I get this thing on the truck

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.250 
is once I get this thing on the truck
mounted<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.150> together<00:02:12.300> and<00:02:12.690> all<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.050> stuff

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
mounted all together and all that stuff

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.290 
mounted all together and all that stuff
I'm<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.920> take<00:02:14.280> one<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> those<00:02:14.940> ground

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
I'm going to take one of those ground

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360 
I'm going to take one of those ground
wires<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:16.050> connect<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> directly<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:17.220> this

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
wires and connect it directly to this

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.630 
wires and connect it directly to this
bolt<00:02:17.700> right<00:02:17.850> here<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> I'm<00:02:19.260> 100%<00:02:20.220> positive

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
bolt right here so I'm 100% positive

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.220 
bolt right here so I'm 100% positive
this<00:02:21.090> got<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.360> be<00:02:21.450> ground<00:02:21.720> because<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.110> would

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
this got to be ground because I would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.060 
this got to be ground because I would
cause<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> fail<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.540> don't<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.680> know

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
cause it to fail if you don't you know

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.480 
cause it to fail if you don't you know
so<00:02:27.260> that's<00:02:28.260> your<00:02:28.440> assembly<00:02:28.830> notes<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.310> don't

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
so that's your assembly notes and don't

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.620 
so that's your assembly notes and don't
forget<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.500> put<00:02:31.500> some<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.890> this<00:02:32.630> dielectric

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
forget to put some of this dielectric

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.720 
forget to put some of this dielectric
grease<00:02:35.450> put<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.100> back<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.490> this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
grease put this on the back of this

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.180 
grease put this on the back of this
module<00:02:39.030> between<00:02:39.570> here<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.840> here<00:02:40.200> once<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
module between here and here once you

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.790 
module between here and here once you
set<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.430> down<00:02:41.640> because<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.620> have<00:02:43.680> to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
set it down because you don't have to

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.350 
set it down because you don't have to
put<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.950> tub<00:02:44.220> just<00:02:44.550> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.820> spread<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.120> out

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
put a tub just kind of spread it out

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.550 
put a tub just kind of spread it out
nice<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.690> evenly<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:47.780> yeah<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:49.260> should<00:02:49.440> be

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
nice and evenly and yeah that should be

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.560 
nice and evenly and yeah that should be
it<00:02:49.800> I'll<00:02:49.980> show<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.250> video<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:51.030> this<00:02:51.330> thing

when I get it assembled I'm gonna go as

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.130 
when I get it assembled I'm gonna go as
far<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.300> as<00:02:54.420> I<00:02:54.480> can
