and then you're going to get the same

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.369 
and then you're going to get the same
over<00:02:42.900> here<00:02:43.790> you're<00:02:44.790> going<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.330> run<00:02:45.750> let's

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
over here you're going for run let's

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.140 
over here you're going for run let's
done<00:02:46.590> together<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.160> then<00:02:47.849> you're<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.090> to

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
done together and then you're going to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.199 
done together and then you're going to
take<00:02:48.450> your<00:02:48.480> redstone<00:02:48.900> underground<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.700> it's

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
take your redstone underground so it's

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.830 
take your redstone underground so it's
not<00:02:51.390> sloppy<00:02:51.810> looking<00:02:52.519> very<00:02:53.519> nice<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.950> compact

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
not sloppy looking very nice and compact

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.869 
not sloppy looking very nice and compact
not<00:02:57.840> really<00:02:58.110> compact<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:59.069> guess<00:02:59.489> it's<00:02:59.730> good

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
not really compact but I guess it's good

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.470 
not really compact but I guess it's good
enough<00:03:00.290> if<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.410> want<00:03:01.590> password<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:03.330> then

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
enough if you want password and then

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.119 
enough if you want password and then
you're<00:03:03.660> going<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.810> align<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.470> stuff<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.890> with

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
you're going to align your stuff up with

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.259 
you're going to align your stuff up with
the<00:03:05.250> door<00:03:05.660> you're<00:03:06.660> going<00:03:06.780> to<00:03:06.840> dig<00:03:07.049> under<00:03:07.260> it

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
the door you're going to dig under it

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.570 
the door you're going to dig under it
they're<00:03:09.269> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> dig<00:03:09.599> under<00:03:09.720> your<00:03:09.930> door<00:03:10.110> and

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
they're going to dig under your door and

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.370 
they're going to dig under your door and
then<00:03:11.580> you're<00:03:11.670> going<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.819> place<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.629> block<00:03:13.140> right

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
then you're going to place a block right

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.009 
then you're going to place a block right
there<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:15.000> tort<00:03:15.239> redstone<00:03:15.630> torch<00:03:15.870> right

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
there and the tort redstone torch right

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.550 
there and the tort redstone torch right
there<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:17.040> then<00:03:17.489> you're<00:03:17.670> going<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.290> wire<00:03:19.290> that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
there and then you're going to wire that

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.979 
there and then you're going to wire that
to<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.860> so<00:03:20.099> that<00:03:20.250> turns<00:03:20.459> off<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.000> then

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
to that so that turns off and then

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.059 
to that so that turns off and then
you're<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> place<00:03:22.470> your<00:03:22.500> door<00:03:22.829> back

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
you're going to place your door back

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.039 
you're going to place your door back
down<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:24.560> then<00:03:25.560> you<00:03:25.769> can<00:03:25.950> cover<00:03:26.220> all<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.670> up

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
down and then you can cover all this up

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.289 
down and then you can cover all this up
when<00:03:28.049> all<00:03:28.170> we<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.470> wine<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.970> come<00:03:30.150> up

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
when all we see is wine you come up

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.819 
when all we see is wine you come up
walls<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.870> here<00:03:30.930> so<00:03:31.230> nobody<00:03:31.379> sees<00:03:31.680> that

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
walls right here so nobody sees that

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.640 
walls right here so nobody sees that
either<00:03:32.930> instead<00:03:33.930> another<00:03:34.170> pastor<00:03:34.470> should

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
either instead another pastor should

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.539 
either instead another pastor should
work<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:34.980> 2<00:03:36.379> 4<00:03:37.610> 6<00:03:38.780> or<00:03:39.780> if<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.349> put<00:03:40.500> down<00:03:40.650> so<00:03:41.340> here's

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
work so 2 4 6 or if I put down so here's

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.370 
work so 2 4 6 or if I put down so here's
how<00:03:41.670> those<00:03:41.819> work<00:03:41.970> so<00:03:42.920> when<00:03:43.920> I<00:03:43.950> turn<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:45.380> when

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
how those work so when I turn on a when

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.710 
how those work so when I turn on a when
I<00:03:46.410> turn<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.739> a<00:03:46.769> lever<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:48.030> turns<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.569> back

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
I turn on a lever it turns the back

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.140 
I turn on a lever it turns the back
toward<00:03:49.019> drop<00:03:49.230> which<00:03:49.739> completely<00:03:50.639> stops<00:03:50.970> to

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
toward drop which completely stops to

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.539 
toward drop which completely stops to
powering<00:03:51.450> of<00:03:51.690> all<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:52.130> except<00:03:53.130> this<00:03:53.250> power

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
powering of all this except this power

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.280 
powering of all this except this power
from<00:03:53.760> over<00:03:53.910> here<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.180> coming<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.780> here<00:03:55.109> and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
from over here is coming to here and

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.809 
from over here is coming to here and
then<00:03:56.930> when<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:57.959> put<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.680> for<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.250> turns<00:03:59.579> that

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
then when I put in for it turns that

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.390 
then when I put in for it turns that
torch<00:04:00.090> off<00:04:00.329> which<00:04:01.319> stops<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:01.829> power<00:04:02.130> flow

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
torch off which stops the power flow

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.580 
torch off which stops the power flow
through<00:04:02.670> there<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.060> when<00:04:03.900> I<00:04:03.959> turn<00:04:04.109> 6<00:04:04.410> off

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
through there and when I turn 6 off

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.640 
through there and when I turn 6 off
which<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.010> final<00:04:05.430> torch<00:04:06.230> it<00:04:07.230> turns<00:04:07.500> off

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
which is the final torch it turns off

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.280 
which is the final torch it turns off
all<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.519> then<00:04:09.269> what<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.690> allows<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:10.260> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
all this and then what that allows it to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.979 
all this and then what that allows it to
do<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.519> allows<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:12.060> torch<00:04:12.389> right<00:04:12.750> here

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
do is that allows this torch right here

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.029 
do is that allows this torch right here
to<00:04:13.139> turn<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:14.120> so<00:04:15.120> let<00:04:15.660> me<00:04:15.720> show<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:15.979> so<00:04:16.979> it

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
to turn on so let me show you so it

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.680 
to turn on so let me show you so it
allows<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.400> torch<00:04:17.700> torrent<00:04:18.180> when<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.359> torch

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
allows this torch torrent when I torch

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.120 
allows this torch torrent when I torch
turns<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:20.130> opens<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.000> door<00:04:21.180> but<00:04:21.479> when<00:04:21.630> i

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
turns on it opens the door but when i

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.680 
turns on it opens the door but when i
turn<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.490> wrong<00:04:23.669> one<00:04:23.910> off<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.270> will<00:04:24.330> power<00:04:24.570> the

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
turn the wrong one off it will power the

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.450 
turn the wrong one off it will power the
redstone<00:04:25.490> turning<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.700> back<00:04:27.030> off<00:04:27.300> and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
redstone turning this back off and

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.469 
redstone turning this back off and
closing<00:04:29.460> it<00:04:29.639> because<00:04:30.090> there's<00:04:30.330> nothing

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
closing it because there's nothing
