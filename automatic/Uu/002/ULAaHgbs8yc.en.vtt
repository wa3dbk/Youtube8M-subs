00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.240 

I<00:00:04.520> had<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.790> motion<00:00:06.450> sensing<00:00:07.109> light<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.769> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
I had this motion sensing light on a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.750 
I had this motion sensing light on a
breadboard<00:00:08.910> before<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.680> mounted<00:00:11.610> it

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
breadboard before and now I mounted it

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.800 
breadboard before and now I mounted it
on<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:13.370> perf<00:00:14.370> port<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.619> I<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:16.919> four<00:00:17.810> 10

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
on a perf port and I use four 10

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.130 
on a perf port and I use four 10
millimeter<00:00:19.550> LED<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:21.169> I<00:00:22.169> use<00:00:22.649> a<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:24.210> n<00:00:24.450> four

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140

four zero one transistor the data sheets
that<00:00:31.969> supposed<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.149> able<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.870> go<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.550> 500

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550

that supposed to be able to go up to 500
milliamps<00:00:36.440> this<00:00:37.440> time<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.980> using<00:00:38.039> a<00:00:38.820> USB

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:39.359 
milliamps this time I'm using a USB

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.509 
milliamps this time I'm using a USB
power<00:00:40.109> pack<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.739> power<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.690> because<00:00:42.890> USB<00:00:43.890> power

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
power pack to power it because USB power

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.229 
power pack to power it because USB power
is<00:00:44.969> easier<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.690> set<00:00:45.960> up<00:00:46.219> this<00:00:47.219> power<00:00:47.789> pack<00:00:48.059> can

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
is easier to set up this power pack can

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.829 
is easier to set up this power pack can
be<00:00:48.420> charged<00:00:48.749> on<00:00:49.199> a<00:00:49.230> solar<00:00:49.589> panel<00:00:49.949> so<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.839> can

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
be charged on a solar panel so I can

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.919 
be charged on a solar panel so I can
always<00:00:52.800> set<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> solar<00:00:53.519> panel<00:00:53.879> next<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929 
always set up a solar panel next to it

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.090 
always set up a solar panel next to it
and<00:00:55.260> charge<00:00:55.589> it<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:58.050> got<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.499> charger

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
and charge it and I got this charger

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.509 
and charge it and I got this charger
doctor<00:00:59.339> here<00:00:59.929> just<00:01:00.929> to<00:01:01.109> check<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.800> amp<00:01:02.069> draw

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
doctor here just to check the amp draw

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:08.660 
doctor here just to check the amp draw
of<00:01:02.999> the<00:01:05.240> LEDs<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.479> make<00:01:06.659> sure<00:01:06.870> I<00:01:07.260> am<00:01:07.950> NOT<00:01:07.980> over

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
of the LEDs to make sure I am NOT over

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
of the LEDs to make sure I am NOT over
driving<00:01:09.000> them<00:01:09.480> or<00:01:09.810> they're<00:01:10.050> not<00:01:10.230> overheating

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
driving them or they're not overheating

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.910 
driving them or they're not overheating
or<00:01:11.250> anything<00:01:11.580> like<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.410> so<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.620> looks<00:01:13.650> like

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
or anything like that so it looks like

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.060 
or anything like that so it looks like
there's<00:01:14.850> only<00:01:14.970> drawing<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.870> 20<00:01:16.320> milliamps

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there's only drawing about 20 milliamps

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.890 
there's only drawing about 20 milliamps
which<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> fine<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.800> it<00:01:19.800> will<00:01:20.480> it<00:01:21.480> will<00:01:21.630> last

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
which is fine and it will it will last

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.930 
which is fine and it will it will last
for<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> long<00:01:22.410> time<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> power<00:01:23.670> pack

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
for a long time with the power pack

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.680 
for a long time with the power pack
because<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.570> got<00:01:24.890> four<00:01:25.890> lithium<00:01:26.490> ion<00:01:26.820> batteries

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
because I got four lithium ion batteries

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.130 
because I got four lithium ion batteries
in<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.850> motion<00:01:30.300> sensing<00:01:30.870> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
in there but with the motion sensing I

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.040 
in there but with the motion sensing I
set<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.190> to<00:01:32.660> turn<00:01:33.660> on<00:01:33.930> for<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:35.540> 40<00:01:36.540> seconds

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
set it to turn on for about 40 seconds

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.290 
set it to turn on for about 40 seconds
or<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.620> then<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.370> will<00:01:38.640> turn<00:01:38.910> off<00:01:38.940> by

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
or so and then it will turn off by

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.760 
or so and then it will turn off by
itself<00:01:39.660> and<00:01:40.020> then<00:01:40.950> if<00:01:41.190> I<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.790> past<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:43.320> sensor

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
itself and then if I go past the sensor

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.480 
itself and then if I go past the sensor
again<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.310> will<00:01:44.490> retrigger<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:47.660> this<00:01:48.660> I<00:01:49.490> guess

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
again it will retrigger so this I guess

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.070 
again it will retrigger so this I guess
will<00:01:50.760> last<00:01:51.030> quite<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.480> while<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.570> now<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.870> just

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
will last quite a while so now you just

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.540 
will last quite a while so now you just
saw<00:01:55.650> it<00:01:56.010> went<00:01:56.940> off<00:01:57.090> by<00:01:57.390> itself<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:59.310> just

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
saw it went off by itself and I just

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.530 
saw it went off by itself and I just
moved<00:01:59.820> slightly<00:02:00.150> with<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.780> body<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:03.090> LEDs

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
moved slightly with my body and the LEDs

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.210 
moved slightly with my body and the LEDs
one<00:02:03.900> back<00:02:04.170> on<00:02:04.700> again<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.380> I<00:02:07.380> will<00:02:07.920> probably

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
one back on again and I will probably

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.280 
one back on again and I will probably
use<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.970> glass<00:02:09.780> jar<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:10.790> yogurt<00:02:12.049> container

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
use a glass jar or yogurt container

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.030 
use a glass jar or yogurt container
alright<00:02:14.280> or<00:02:14.489> something<00:02:14.909> like<00:02:15.060> that

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
alright or something like that

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.690 
alright or something like that
two<00:02:16.489> houses<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.780> I'm<00:02:18.349> gonna<00:02:18.590> put<00:02:18.829> it<00:02:18.950> wherever

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
two houses and I'm gonna put it wherever

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.840 
two houses and I'm gonna put it wherever
I<00:02:20.150> need<00:02:20.450> a<00:02:20.480> motion<00:02:20.989> sensing<00:02:21.650> light

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.990 

this<00:02:27.850> one<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.810> corner<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:30.000> another

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
this one here in the corner is a another

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.630 
this one here in the corner is a another
store<00:02:31.390> port<00:02:31.720> when<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.110> is<00:02:32.320> rose<00:02:32.740> will<00:02:33.310> I

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
store port when this is rose will I

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.870 
store port when this is rose will I
think<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> one<00:02:34.960> of<00:02:35.080> my<00:02:35.260> best<00:02:35.700> because<00:02:36.700> it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
think this is one of my best because it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.920 
think this is one of my best because it
hasn't<00:02:37.060> failed<00:02:37.420> me<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.560> uses<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.040> 1<00:02:39.340> watt

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
hasn't failed me and it uses a 1 watt

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.200 
hasn't failed me and it uses a 1 watt
LED<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.500> there<00:02:41.830> are<00:02:41.890> two<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.220> them<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.820> 2

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
LED so there are two of them so it's 2

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.420 
LED so there are two of them so it's 2
watts<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.310> another<00:02:46.380> LED<00:02:47.380> light

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
watts here is another LED light

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.770 
watts here is another LED light
there's<00:02:49.120> no<00:02:49.300> solar<00:02:49.900> panel<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.740> one<00:02:51.010> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
there's no solar panel on this one and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.510 
there's no solar panel on this one and
then<00:02:52.780> over<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.530> my<00:02:53.770> garage<00:02:54.100> here<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:57.250> are

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
then over at my garage here these are

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.130 
then over at my garage here these are
all<00:02:57.730> solar-powered<00:02:58.600> battery<00:02:59.590> powered<00:03:00.490> lights

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
all solar-powered battery powered lights

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.970 
all solar-powered battery powered lights
this<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.850> traditional<00:03:04.260> I'm<00:03:05.260> not<00:03:05.530> sure<00:03:05.800> is

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
this is the traditional I'm not sure is

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.730 
this is the traditional I'm not sure is
what<00:03:06.580> they<00:03:06.730> call<00:03:06.910> Malibu<00:03:07.600> or<00:03:07.930> something<00:03:08.350> but

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
what they call Malibu or something but

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.310 
what they call Malibu or something but
this<00:03:08.890> one<00:03:09.100> once<00:03:10.000> good<00:03:10.300> because<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:10.720> put<00:03:11.290> a

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
this one once good because I put a

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.930 
this one once good because I put a
eneloop<00:03:11.920> battery<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.610> it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
eneloop battery in it

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.520 
eneloop battery in it
this<00:03:13.900> likes<00:03:14.590> been<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.370> several<00:03:15.580> years

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
this likes been there for several years

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.620 
this likes been there for several years
this<00:03:17.530> one<00:03:17.800> here<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.940> one<00:03:19.000> here<00:03:19.390> is<00:03:19.600> the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
this one here this one here is the

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.590 
this one here this one here is the
latest<00:03:20.020> one<00:03:20.350> this<00:03:20.590> is<00:03:20.740> a<00:03:20.950> remote<00:03:21.790> control<00:03:21.820> one

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
latest one this is a remote control one

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.570 
latest one this is a remote control one
I<00:03:22.780> have<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.050> bit<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.560> problem<00:03:23.830> with<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.340> with

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
I have a bit of a problem with this with

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.330 
I have a bit of a problem with this with
the<00:03:24.700> remote<00:03:25.030> control<00:03:25.470> this<00:03:26.470> is<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.680> strip<00:03:27.070> light

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
the remote control this is a strip light

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.670 
the remote control this is a strip light
because<00:03:28.300> sometimes<00:03:28.750> it<00:03:28.959> would<00:03:29.080> go<00:03:29.260> on<00:03:29.440> by

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
because sometimes it would go on by

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.080 
because sometimes it would go on by
itself<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.580> that's<00:03:30.850> not<00:03:31.000> good<00:03:31.300> so<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:33.090> don't

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
itself and that's not good so I don't

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.910 
itself and that's not good so I don't
really<00:03:34.269> depend<00:03:34.840> on<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:35.170> one<00:03:35.440> but<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.860> just

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
really depend on this one but I just

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.330 
really depend on this one but I just
plugged<00:03:36.489> it<00:03:36.580> in<00:03:36.700> to<00:03:37.060> show<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.920> brightness

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
plugged it in to show you the brightness

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.979 
plugged it in to show you the brightness
of<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.019> this<00:03:41.019> one<00:03:41.290> here<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.300> 12<00:03:43.300> volt<00:03:43.660> LED

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
of it this one here is a 12 volt LED

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.900 
of it this one here is a 12 volt LED
light<00:03:44.650> one<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.130> the<00:03:45.220> ones<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:45.519> I<00:03:45.610> made

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
light one of the ones that I made

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.040 
light one of the ones that I made
several<00:03:46.209> years<00:03:46.390> ago<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:48.580> attached<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.450> a<00:03:49.600> deep

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
several years ago is attached to a deep

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.240 
several years ago is attached to a deep
cycle<00:03:50.530> battery<00:03:51.870> not<00:03:52.870> all<00:03:53.050> that<00:03:53.230> bright<00:03:53.530> but

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
cycle battery not all that bright but

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.000 
cycle battery not all that bright but
this<00:03:54.430> okay<00:03:54.820> is<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:56.200> on<00:03:56.440> maybe<00:03:57.400> about<00:03:57.760> six<00:03:58.180> hours

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
this okay is is on maybe about six hours

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.460 
this okay is is on maybe about six hours
it<00:04:00.010> is<00:04:00.040> controlled<00:04:00.610> by<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:01.209> solar<00:04:02.049> charge

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
it is controlled by a solar charge

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.310 
it is controlled by a solar charge
controller<00:04:03.570> and<00:04:05.070> this<00:04:06.070> one<00:04:06.310> here<00:04:06.700> is<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:08.019> one

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
controller and this one here is the one

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
controller and this one here is the one
I<00:04:08.350> just<00:04:08.470> made<00:04:09.130> with<00:04:09.549> the<00:04:09.820> qyx<00:04:11.340> five-two

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
I just made with the qyx five-two

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.449 
I just made with the qyx five-two
five-two<00:04:12.370> chip<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.510> attached<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.830> any<00:04:15.100> loop

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
five-two chip I attached to any loop

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.009 
five-two chip I attached to any loop
battery<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.450> it<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:18.070> very<00:04:18.760> bright<00:04:19.120> but

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
battery to it it is very bright but

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.920 
battery to it it is very bright but
unfortunately<00:04:20.950> maybe<00:04:21.340> is<00:04:21.729> the<00:04:22.000> coil<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.750> I'm

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
unfortunately maybe is the coil that I'm

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.380 
unfortunately maybe is the coil that I'm
using<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:24.250> doesn't<00:04:24.610> really<00:04:24.760> last<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.330> night

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
using it doesn't really last all night

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.060 
using it doesn't really last all night
it<00:04:26.520> may<00:04:27.520> be<00:04:27.780> maybe<00:04:28.780> 2<00:04:29.169> or<00:04:29.200> 3<00:04:29.320> o'clock<00:04:29.860> in<00:04:29.890> the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
it may be maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.150 
it may be maybe 2 or 3 o'clock in the
morning<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.940> would<00:04:31.060> shut<00:04:31.270> down<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:32.560> that's<00:04:32.710> ok

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
morning it would shut down but that's ok

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.790 
morning it would shut down but that's ok
it<00:04:34.000> doesn't<00:04:34.210> really<00:04:34.539> have<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.900> be<00:04:35.050> an<00:04:35.169> on<00:04:35.349> all

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
it doesn't really have to be an on all

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.920 
it doesn't really have to be an on all
night<00:04:36.099> this<00:04:36.970> one<00:04:37.240> here<00:04:37.690> doesn't<00:04:38.050> go<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.500> all

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
night this one here doesn't go on all

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.840 
night this one here doesn't go on all
either<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:42.020> should<00:04:42.130> shut<00:04:43.130> down<00:04:43.460> when<00:04:43.699> the

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
either it should shut down when the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.100 
either it should shut down when the
voltage<00:04:44.150> goes<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:46.030> maybe<00:04:47.030> about<00:04:47.509> point<00:04:47.930> nine

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
voltage goes to maybe about point nine

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.850 
voltage goes to maybe about point nine
volt<00:04:48.880> but<00:04:49.880> the<00:04:50.030> next<00:04:50.360> day<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.810> will<00:04:51.080> charge<00:04:51.530> up

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
volt but the next day it will charge up

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.800 
volt but the next day it will charge up
again<00:04:52.039> I'm<00:04:52.789> just<00:04:53.630> gonna<00:04:53.840> show<00:04:54.169> you<00:04:55.090> my<00:04:56.090> solar

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
again I'm just gonna show you my solar

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.969 
again I'm just gonna show you my solar
controller<00:04:57.550> for<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:58.820> light<00:04:59.090> here<00:04:59.979> because

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
controller for this light here because

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:02.650 
controller for this light here because
I'm<00:05:01.160> thinking<00:05:01.639> of<00:05:01.729> making<00:05:01.940> another<00:05:02.360> one

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
I'm thinking of making another one

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.800 
I'm thinking of making another one
similar<00:05:03.650> to<00:05:03.680> this<00:05:03.979> one<00:05:06.460> this<00:05:07.460> is<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:08.150> solar

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
similar to this one this is the solar

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.800 
similar to this one this is the solar
controller<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.830> I<00:05:09.860> have<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:10.699> see<00:05:11.660> the

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
controller that I have and you see the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.529 
controller that I have and you see the
red<00:05:11.990> light<00:05:12.020> there<00:05:12.500> that<00:05:12.710> means<00:05:13.270> that<00:05:14.270> means

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
red light there that means that means

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:19.150 
red light there that means that means
the<00:05:15.410> load<00:05:15.650> is<00:05:15.889> on<00:05:16.099> and<00:05:16.509> the<00:05:17.509> battery<00:05:17.930> is<00:05:18.320> at

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
the load is on and the battery is at

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.689 
the load is on and the battery is at
twelve<00:05:19.550> point<00:05:19.880> five<00:05:20.180> five<00:05:20.570> and<00:05:20.979> I<00:05:21.979> have<00:05:22.490> a

yep<00:05:38.180> the<00:05:38.300> garage<00:05:38.690> door<00:05:39.050> doesn't<00:05:40.039> open<00:05:40.310> at

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
yep the garage door doesn't open at

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.500 
yep the garage door doesn't open at
least<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:41.030> would<00:05:41.270> have<00:05:41.389> one<00:05:41.750> light<00:05:42.020> that<00:05:42.380> I<00:05:42.410> know

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
least I would have one light that I know

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.279 
least I would have one light that I know
that<00:05:44.510> I<00:05:44.539> can<00:05:44.780> go<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.020> and<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:46.250> can<00:05:46.460> switch<00:05:46.760> off<00:05:47.289> my

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
that I can go to and I can switch off my

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:53.500 
that I can go to and I can switch off my
inverter<00:05:49.870> so<00:05:50.870> that<00:05:51.229> the<00:05:51.470> other<00:05:51.800> light<00:05:52.360> this<00:05:53.360> is

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
inverter so that the other light this is

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.050 
inverter so that the other light this is
another<00:05:54.050> DC<00:05:54.620> light<00:05:54.860> it<00:05:55.070> would<00:05:55.159> go<00:05:55.370> on<00:05:55.610> and<00:05:56.030> I

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
another DC light it would go on and I

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.469 
another DC light it would go on and I
would<00:05:56.720> I<00:05:57.050> would<00:05:57.830> know<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.970> know<00:05:59.120> where<00:05:59.300> all<00:05:59.330> my

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
would I would know you know where all my

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.879 
would I would know you know where all my
tools<00:06:00.050> are<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:00.699> and<00:06:01.699> whatnot<00:06:02.260> actually<00:06:03.260> this

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
tools are and and whatnot actually this

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.189 
tools are and and whatnot actually this
converter<00:06:04.370> is<00:06:04.520> only<00:06:04.729> 400<00:06:05.240> watts<00:06:05.510> because<00:06:06.050> I

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:06.199 
converter is only 400 watts because I

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:08.430 
converter is only 400 watts because I
only<00:06:06.349> have<00:06:06.530> one<00:06:06.560> battery<00:06:07.280> but<00:06:07.580> I<00:06:07.789> like<00:06:08.000> this

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
only have one battery but I like this

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:13.330 
only have one battery but I like this
inverter<00:06:09.909> DC<00:06:10.909> through<00:06:11.090> the<00:06:11.150> AC<00:06:11.330> is<00:06:11.990> copra<00:06:12.710> and

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
inverter DC through the AC is copra and

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:17.860 
inverter DC through the AC is copra and
when<00:06:14.150> I<00:06:14.180> first<00:06:14.509> turn<00:06:14.810> it<00:06:14.960> on<00:06:15.139> you<00:06:15.500> hurt<00:06:15.800> the<00:06:16.870> fan

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
when I first turn it on you hurt the fan

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.430 
when I first turn it on you hurt the fan
running<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:18.560> then<00:06:19.599> when<00:06:20.599> it's<00:06:20.750> stabilized

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
running and then when it's stabilized

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.820 
running and then when it's stabilized
the<00:06:22.280> fan<00:06:22.520> turned<00:06:22.909> off<00:06:23.090> by<00:06:23.300> itself<00:06:23.720> so<00:06:24.080> I<00:06:24.110> like

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
the fan turned off by itself so I like

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.580 
the fan turned off by itself so I like
this<00:06:25.039> it's<00:06:25.669> not<00:06:25.849> one<00:06:26.150> of<00:06:26.180> those<00:06:26.419> that<00:06:26.690> you<00:06:26.930> turn

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590 
this it's not one of those that you turn

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.149 
this it's not one of those that you turn
it<00:06:27.740> on<00:06:27.860> and<00:06:28.190> the<00:06:28.280> fan<00:06:28.490> goes<00:06:28.729> on<00:06:29.500> constantly<00:06:30.500> and

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159 
it on and the fan goes on constantly and

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:34.420 
it on and the fan goes on constantly and
that's<00:06:31.639> that's<00:06:32.000> not<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.479> good<00:06:32.720> I<00:06:33.190> like<00:06:34.190> it

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
that's that's not that good I like it

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.170 
that's that's not that good I like it
when<00:06:35.770> because<00:06:36.770> it<00:06:36.919> is<00:06:37.070> pretty<00:06:37.610> much<00:06:37.820> silent

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
when because it is pretty much silent

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.270 
when because it is pretty much silent
and<00:06:38.710> I<00:06:39.710> don't<00:06:40.159> actually<00:06:40.460> use<00:06:40.970> it<00:06:41.150> much<00:06:41.389> but

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 
and I don't actually use it much but

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.290 
and I don't actually use it much but
it's<00:06:43.280> there<00:06:43.580> for<00:06:43.669> me<00:06:44.000> if<00:06:44.240> I<00:06:44.419> ever<00:06:44.449> need<00:06:45.380> to<00:06:45.409> use

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
it's there for me if I ever need to use

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.659 
it's there for me if I ever need to use
the<00:06:47.300> DC<00:06:48.229> power

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 
the DC power

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.420 
the DC power
and<00:06:50.090> this<00:06:50.479> here<00:06:50.780> is<00:06:50.810> my<00:06:52.150> deep<00:06:53.150> cycle<00:06:53.629> battery

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
and this here is my deep cycle battery

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.980 
and this here is my deep cycle battery
and<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:55.669> have<00:06:56.469> diesel<00:06:57.469> fader<00:06:57.979> infinitum

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
and I have diesel fader infinitum

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.649 
and I have diesel fader infinitum
actually<00:06:59.990> I<00:07:00.020> want<00:07:00.439> to<00:07:00.529> get<00:07:00.710> more<00:07:00.979> but<00:07:01.659> the

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:02.659 
actually I want to get more but the

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:05.230 
actually I want to get more but the
these<00:07:02.990> operators<00:07:03.469> very<00:07:04.099> expensive<00:07:04.939> it's<00:07:05.180> like

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:05.240 
these operators very expensive it's like

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.249 
these operators very expensive it's like
over<00:07:06.229> $40.00<00:07:07.330> this<00:07:08.330> is<00:07:08.509> one<00:07:08.749> of<00:07:08.779> the<00:07:09.020> two

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:09.259 
over $40.00 this is one of the two

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.499 
over $40.00 this is one of the two
lights<00:07:09.560> I<00:07:09.800> made<00:07:10.099> using<00:07:10.580> the<00:07:11.270> qyx<00:07:13.509> five-two

00:07:14.499 --> 00:07:14.509 
lights I made using the qyx five-two

00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:17.349 
lights I made using the qyx five-two
five-two<00:07:14.539> chip
