00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.110
 or 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.590
 how 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.590
 or 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 for me 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.550
 hello girls how are you today we are going to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.740
 talk about some accessories that are very 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.170
 important and that is very fashionable but 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.240
 sometimes we feel intimidated by 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 time to use them and they are the maxi 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.810
 necklaces and I want to show you the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.910
 different types that I have and that I'm going to 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.520
 use in this video with the outfits the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.890
 first I want to show you is this 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.980
 black here that I bought in bershka and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.440
 It has like green beetles and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.470
 then some new iridescent experts 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.660
 I love it and I always use it and I feel that 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.520
 I can wear the polo or the shirt more 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.829
 basic of the world and this sweeps it to the 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.930
 come out to be much more elegant and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.540
 spataro and so big that it calls the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.700
 attention and I will convert an outfit of 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.100
 bored as in the best outfit if you 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.660
 like to try new things and you're like 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.149
 'the on the wave or wearing necklaces very 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.040
 great to try something like that now those that 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.350
 They are like with you are very 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.090
 fashion then I have this attack sure already 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.759
 they saw in many videos and I bought it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 on the channel about two years ago and it's 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.360
 in very good condition despite 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.110
 make fantasy because obviously it's not 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.770
 of gold 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.380
 and they are like interwoven chains 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.630
 and what I liked about this is that the 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.359
 golden is not a very strong golden like 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 that very artificial with gold but is a 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.640
 donor more opaque as a mixture of 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.670
 gold and silver and I quite like 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.759
 because it is large and elegant neutral 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.709
 so if you do not want to go by the side of 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.179
 necklaces or smaller and you're super 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.429
 big september the attention and be 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:52.799
 extravagant you can try something like that 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.259
 which is large and striking but not so 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.539
 scandalous like the other one and I like that 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.399
 the neutral because you can combine it with 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.349
 absolutely everything and that is the advantage 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.420
 of having this kind of gold as that 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.310
 it does not limit you to combine them only with 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.780
 warm colors but you can also 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 combine it with cool colors with 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
 prints and with everything you want the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.930
 third necklace that I want to show you 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
 I think it was the first maximum day that I 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.470
 I bought and I bought it to see tuna 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.599
 Even when I saw it, it seemed so 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.819
 delicate and feminine that I said I have to 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.860
 try these kinds of necklaces and I 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.569
 agreement that I used it put absolutely 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.910
 everything does not have so much texture that the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.610
 very rich piece and continued as a 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.000
 flat outfit if you wear this you're going to 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.980
 perform 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.680
 much more and it's not going to call that much 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.560
 attention and if you're the kind of girl that 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.870
 you like a lot the feminine or for example 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 that you do not like to use a brand or a 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.920
 checkered shirt because he feels that what 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.670
 it makes a lot more masculine you should try 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:51.150
 add a piece like this that is good 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.700
 like for girls for girls I was going to 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.310
 sweeten and will make it the outfit a lot 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.920
 more delicate so this is the third 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.050
 option that the three could do 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.450
 necklaces that I'm using more now in 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.860
 winter however the last two that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.110
 I showed you that they are golden you can 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.820
 listen in the autumn winter 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.250
 in spring when you want instead 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:14.510
 this one here that is darker me if I 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.510
 I would use more for winter 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.349
 as I mentioned earlier the first 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.390
 necklace is a winter piece and that's why 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.569
 I decided to combine it with a basic sweater 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.569
 Gray 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.600
 Sometimes I like to combine outfits 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.120
 dark so the colors the magical 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.160
 already stand out much more however is 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.080
 important that we give our attention in 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.880
 the texture of our clothes for 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.020
 prevent the outfit from looking very sober and 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.880
 boring 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.740
 and I'm wearing a knit sweater 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.150
 open with some leather pants and 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.150
 cotton and ankle boots 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.210
 It's a very simple style but small 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.310
 details like the necklace texture and 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.140
 some extra accessories make it more 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.710
 special and attractive 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.710
 yes 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.070
 yes 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.770
 very different 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.390
 the second out feedback with all the 

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.850
 women who are afraid of looking very 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.740
 recharged with a maxi collar the shape 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.220
 Safer to use this accessory is with 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.140
 a dress 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.240
 It does not matter if it's a sleeve dress 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.950
 long -sleeved zero-mark 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.540
 your sunset 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.060
 how my maxi necklace is one color 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.580
 neutral metallic I decided to contrast it with 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.470
 a soft and strong color fabric of this 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.190
 shape the accessory will highlight much more 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.080
 if not touch the dress 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.060
 the hairstyle is also a very 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.100
 important in an audio so that's why 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.100
 I decided to put everything back for a 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.810
 more sophisticated look 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.850
 to make the object a little more 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.950
 dynamic I added some animal heels 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.960
 print and a cute wallet but if not 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.000
 you want to take that risk you choose shoes 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.590
 and wallet nude or black all 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.590
 It depends on the color of the dress itself 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.660
 rich 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:15.250
 the last out fit is very romantic to use 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.919
 more boy llares with flowers gives a 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.139
 plus a female outfit or in any case 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:21.449
 makes a garment look more delicate 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.309
 more blush 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.949
 because it has enough support 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:28.050
 texture but little color I decided to play with 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.849
 the colors of the outfit garments 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.620
 I put a trumpet skirt ' are a top 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.230
 white lace and a leather jacket 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.570
 pink 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.490
 By doing this you can integrate the necklace 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.130
 to your outfit in a subtle way and without 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:43.240
 it looks very exaggerated ideal for those who 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.240
 They do not want much to draw attention 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.580
 Finally, it is very important that you 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.560
 I stressed that do not forget to incorporate 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.210
 minus a strong color in your outfit for 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.870
 get a more city look and not see each other 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.870
 so pale 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.450
 I hope you liked this video and 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.670
 help them inspire a little more to 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.400
 time to make your outfits and hopefully 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.980
 deriven to use more magical and you're because 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.140
 they are a piece some very very accessories 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.780
 cute that most of us left aside 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.090
 because we have to look a bit exaggerated 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.940
 or we feel that he will eat us for 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.040
 complete but give it a chance do not go 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.900
 to repent and if they do 19 of 

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.490
 send me a photon to detail come 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.050
 social networks I can always go 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.940
 giving lay and to all the photos that I 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.710
 Mandan I love to see castings follow 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:33.710
 and we're going in the next video
