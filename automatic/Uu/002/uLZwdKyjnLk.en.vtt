00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.230
 let's make our recipe for 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:18.529
 snails with tomatoes we will wash the 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.119
 snails once they are burgos that 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.119
 be at least a week without eating 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.000
 who will we make them live better 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.230
 the method of 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.210
 the drowning we will put weight on 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.250
 that they can not get out and there the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.650
 we will have all night 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.970
 once they have all left 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:46.250
 for 24 hours we will pass them to cook 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.850
 or the water and a bay leaf if 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:52.510
 we want 30 minutes 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:55.030
 and even super clean snails and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.960
 it was nothing more than proceeding to do the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.989
 tomato 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.559
 We stay with one or two Onions 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.559
 we will press 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.700
 we will pour a Cayenne chilli 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.700
 a little spicy 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.289
 we are also going to take some 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.420
 a few slices of ham serrano if 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.050
 we had what is the lean that is the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850
 much fatter slice much better 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.450
 we will use two cans of tomato already 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.450
 crushed 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.940
 we will throw some sugar for the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.940
 acidity 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.729
 with a little black pepper and salt 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.399
 and we leave it there 10 minutes 10 points 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.550
 If we have already closed you 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.450
 better is the lean that is the slice but 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.200
 fat at least half a centimeter 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.989
 thick 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.319
 but it is what was and is already itchy 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.319
 all right 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.030
 to our tomato 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.569
 here I have taken from crushed everything 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.100
 with vistilla and everything to make it disappear 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.420
 Onion and others 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.420
 and here we are 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.519
 the snails 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 halle 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.360
 from one day to the next they are much better 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.310
 and there you have yours 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.310
 snails with tomato
