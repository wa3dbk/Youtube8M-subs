right<00:04:31.700> right<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.420> teach<00:04:32.780> one<00:04:33.170> class<00:04:33.320> myself<00:04:33.800> on

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
right right I teach one class myself on

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.310 
right right I teach one class myself on
MIDI<00:04:34.520> technology<00:04:35.060> right<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.510> we<00:04:35.690> really<00:04:36.080> dive

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
MIDI technology right and we really dive

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.320 
MIDI technology right and we really dive
into<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.890> minutiae<00:04:37.400> of<00:04:37.550> midium<00:04:38.000> and<00:04:38.150> we<00:04:38.210> get

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
into the minutiae of midium and we get

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.630 
into the minutiae of midium and we get
into<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.260> bits<00:04:39.620> and<00:04:39.890> the<00:04:39.950> bytes<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:40.520> how

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
into the the bits and the bytes and how

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.130 
into the the bits and the bytes and how
the<00:04:40.700> data<00:04:40.940> flows<00:04:41.030> and<00:04:41.480> all<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.690> those<00:04:41.810> kinds<00:04:42.110> of

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
the data flows and all of those kinds of

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.690 
the data flows and all of those kinds of
things<00:04:42.350> so<00:04:42.530> I'm<00:04:42.890> assuming<00:04:43.040> all<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.370> classes

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
things so I'm assuming all the classes

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
things so I'm assuming all the classes
going<00:04:43.820> to<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.060> kind<00:04:44.240> of<00:04:44.300> depth<00:04:44.510> for

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
going to that kind of depth for

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.840 
going to that kind of depth for
absolutely<00:04:45.200> yeah<00:04:45.710> that's<00:04:46.280> pretty<00:04:46.430> amazing

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
absolutely yeah that's pretty amazing

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.820 
absolutely yeah that's pretty amazing
yeah<00:04:47.510> they<00:04:47.630> often<00:04:47.930> refer<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:48.350> as<00:04:48.500> drinking

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
yeah they often refer to it as drinking

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.230 
yeah they often refer to it as drinking
from<00:04:48.950> the<00:04:49.100> fire<00:04:49.280> hose<00:04:49.490> there's<00:04:49.790> a<00:04:49.880> lot<00:04:50.090> of

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
from the fire hose there's a lot of

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.700 
from the fire hose there's a lot of
information<00:04:50.720> coming<00:04:50.930> at<00:04:51.080> a<00:04:51.140> short<00:04:51.440> amount<00:04:51.590> of

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
information coming at a short amount of

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.770 
information coming at a short amount of
time<00:04:51.770> right<00:04:52.250> right<00:04:52.670> now<00:04:53.240> once<00:04:53.420> they<00:04:53.540> get<00:04:53.630> out

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
time right right now once they get out

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.030 
time right right now once they get out
of<00:04:53.900> Sweetwater<00:04:54.080> University<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.740> training

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
of Sweetwater University the training

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.130 
of Sweetwater University the training
doesn't<00:04:55.280> stop<00:04:55.460> there<00:04:55.730> no<00:04:56.300> not<00:04:56.480> at<00:04:56.630> all<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.780> guess

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:57.140 
doesn't stop there no not at all I guess

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.200 
doesn't stop there no not at all I guess
it's<00:04:57.230> just<00:04:57.380> the<00:04:57.740> beginning

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
it's just the beginning

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.090 
it's just the beginning
much<00:04:59.210> like<00:04:59.450> a<00:04:59.480> college<00:05:00.260> degree<00:05:00.410> program<00:05:00.890> where

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
much like a college degree program where

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.430 
much like a college degree program where
you<00:05:01.520> learn<00:05:01.550> how<00:05:02.000> to<00:05:02.030> learn<00:05:02.360> that's<00:05:03.140> a<00:05:03.260> little

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
you learn how to learn that's a little

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.360 
you learn how to learn that's a little
bit<00:05:03.590> of<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.710> concept<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.160> Sweetwater

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
bit of the concept of Sweetwater

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.800 
bit of the concept of Sweetwater
University<00:05:04.910> we<00:05:05.000> just<00:05:05.180> get<00:05:05.300> them<00:05:05.390> started<00:05:05.780> with

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
University we just get them started with

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.810 
University we just get them started with
how<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.140> learn<00:05:06.350> once<00:05:06.620> they<00:05:06.800> roll<00:05:06.980> out<00:05:07.130> from

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:07.820 
how to learn once they roll out from

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.550 
how to learn once they roll out from
there<00:05:08.060> we<00:05:08.180> have<00:05:08.270> continuing<00:05:08.750> education<00:05:08.810> and

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
there we have continuing education and

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.770 
there we have continuing education and
one<00:05:10.040> of<00:05:10.130> the<00:05:10.220> primary<00:05:10.460> sources<00:05:10.910> of<00:05:11.030> that<00:05:11.150> is<00:05:11.450> in

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
one of the primary sources of that is in

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.150 
one of the primary sources of that is in
this<00:05:11.930> very<00:05:12.140> room<00:05:12.320> that<00:05:12.380> we<00:05:12.620> have<00:05:12.800> our<00:05:12.890> morning
