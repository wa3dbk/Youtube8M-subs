is<00:00:33.739> Shannon<00:00:33.920> was<00:00:34.280> very<00:00:35.120> good<00:00:35.420> I<00:00:35.630> hit<00:00:36.560> a<00:00:36.590> pretty

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:36.740 
is Shannon was very good I hit a pretty

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.930 
is Shannon was very good I hit a pretty
good<00:00:36.830> run<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.100> cards<00:00:37.250> she<00:00:37.550> doesn't<00:00:37.820> know<00:00:37.910> that

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
good run of cards she doesn't know that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.750 
good run of cards she doesn't know that
but<00:00:38.680> but<00:00:39.680> most<00:00:39.860> of<00:00:39.920> my<00:00:39.980> cars<00:00:40.250> are<00:00:40.400> pretty<00:00:40.580> good

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
but but most of my cars are pretty good

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.590 
but but most of my cars are pretty good
and<00:00:41.740> so<00:00:42.740> I<00:00:42.770> was<00:00:43.010> very<00:00:43.160> fortunate<00:00:43.340> there<00:00:43.760> polska

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600

and so I was very fortunate there polska
and<00:00:44.690> I<00:00:44.750> I<00:00:44.780> mean<00:00:45.200> he<00:00:45.440> was<00:00:45.560> definitely<00:00:46.010> tough<00:00:46.130> as

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
and I I mean he was definitely tough as

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.400 
and I I mean he was definitely tough as
I<00:00:46.400> faced<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:46.790> far<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.180> him<00:00:47.750> and<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.930> had<00:00:48.080> had<00:00:48.380> a

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
I faced so far and him and I had had a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.620 
I faced so far and him and I had had a
marathon<00:00:48.890> match<00:00:49.100> I<00:00:49.310> mean<00:00:49.490> it<00:00:49.850> was<00:00:50.180> like<00:00:50.420> I

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
marathon match I mean it was like I

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.570 
marathon match I mean it was like I
chipped<00:00:50.870> him<00:00:50.990> down<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.470> 80<00:00:51.620> k<00:00:51.890> and<00:00:52.280> then<00:00:52.370> he

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
chipped him down to 80 k and then he

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.610 
chipped him down to 80 k and then he
like<00:00:52.700> doubled<00:00:53.090> up<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:53.690> it<00:00:54.200> was<00:00:54.320> just<00:00:54.500> really

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
like doubled up and it was just really

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.230 
like doubled up and it was just really
tough<00:00:54.830> and<00:00:55.070> eventually<00:00:55.400> I<00:00:55.460> got<00:00:55.610> we<00:00:55.880> at<00:00:55.970> all<00:00:56.090> it

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
tough and eventually I got we at all it

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.580 
tough and eventually I got we at all it
was<00:00:56.510> pretty<00:00:56.690> big<00:00:56.870> cooler<00:00:57.140> because<00:00:57.290> he<00:00:57.470> only

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
was pretty big cooler because he only

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.920 
was pretty big cooler because he only
had<00:00:57.740> 40<00:00:58.010> big<00:00:58.130> blinds<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.670> I<00:00:58.880> had<00:00:59.180> bottom<00:00:59.750> two

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
had 40 big blinds and I had bottom two

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.360 
had 40 big blinds and I had bottom two
and<00:00:59.960> he<00:01:00.200> had<00:01:00.350> top<00:01:00.590> hair<00:01:00.800> with<00:01:00.950> a<00:01:00.980> queen<00:01:01.160> kicker

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and he had top hair with a queen kicker

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.430 
and he had top hair with a queen kicker
so<00:01:01.610> like<00:01:01.790> it's<00:01:02.210> going<00:01:02.480> in<00:01:02.570> at<00:01:02.660> that<00:01:02.750> point<00:01:02.810> so<00:01:03.200> i

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
so like it's going in at that point so i

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.749 
so like it's going in at that point so i
was<00:01:03.560> pretty<00:01:03.590> fortunate<00:01:03.890> at<00:01:04.220> that<00:01:04.369> point<00:01:04.580> too

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
was pretty fortunate at that point too

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.719 
was pretty fortunate at that point too
because<00:01:05.119> i<00:01:05.409> felt<00:01:06.409> like<00:01:06.439> i<00:01:06.619> was<00:01:06.740> playing<00:01:07.189> like

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
because i felt like i was playing like

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:08.770 
because i felt like i was playing like
better<00:01:07.909> than<00:01:08.060> him<00:01:08.210> i<00:01:08.270> guess<00:01:08.450> in<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.659> beginning

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
better than him i guess in the beginning

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.160 
better than him i guess in the beginning
but<00:01:09.259> once<00:01:09.590> he<00:01:10.549> sort<00:01:10.999> of<00:01:11.030> went<00:01:11.179> back<00:01:11.420> from<00:01:11.810> being

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
but once he sort of went back from being

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.649 
but once he sort of went back from being
you<00:01:12.469> know<00:01:12.590> 721<00:01:13.399> out<00:01:13.549> chip<00:01:13.789> to<00:01:14.060> getting<00:01:14.390> back<00:01:14.509> to

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
you know 721 out chip to getting back to

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.209 
you know 721 out chip to getting back to
even<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.229> it<00:01:15.439> was<00:01:15.560> a<00:01:15.590> little<00:01:15.679> demoralized

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:16.219 
even like it was a little demoralized

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.929 
even like it was a little demoralized
and<00:01:17.049> so<00:01:18.049> that<00:01:18.229> was<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:18.380> really<00:01:18.560> crucial<00:01:18.950> to

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
and so that was like really crucial to

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:21.190 
and so that was like really crucial to
win<00:01:20.060> that<00:01:20.210> match<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.569> everything<00:01:20.719> she<00:01:21.049> was

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
win that match and everything she was

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.370 
win that match and everything she was
definitely<00:01:21.380> playing<00:01:21.770> very<00:01:22.069> well<00:01:22.659> so<00:01:23.659> yeah<00:01:24.170> and

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
definitely playing very well so yeah and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.899 
definitely playing very well so yeah and
how<00:01:24.920> do<00:01:24.979> you<00:01:25.069> think<00:01:25.310> what<00:01:25.429> is<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:25.670> about<00:01:25.729> your

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
how do you think what is it about your

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.580

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
is it reading players is it just being

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.630

to<00:01:37.789> like<00:01:37.909> put<00:01:38.179> them<00:01:38.299> on<00:01:38.389> a<00:01:38.420> pretty<00:01:38.659> narrow

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
to like put them on a pretty narrow

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:41.080 
to like put them on a pretty narrow
range<00:01:38.990> of<00:01:39.079> hands<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:40.159> addition<00:01:40.369> I<00:01:40.609> feel<00:01:40.909> like<00:01:40.969> I

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
range of hands in addition I feel like I

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.580 
range of hands in addition I feel like I
have<00:01:41.210> a<00:01:41.240> really<00:01:41.479> big<00:01:41.600> grasp<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:42.109> what<00:01:42.439> level

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
have a really big grasp on what level

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.679 
have a really big grasp on what level
they're<00:01:42.859> thinking<00:01:43.249> on<00:01:43.369> so<00:01:43.609> what<00:01:44.210> they<00:01:44.359> want<00:01:44.569> me

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
they're thinking on so what they want me

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.569 
they're thinking on so what they want me
to<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:44.990> at<00:01:45.319> any<00:01:45.560> given<00:01:45.770> time<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:45.979> I<00:01:46.159> just<00:01:46.399> do<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
to do at any given time so I just do the

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.249 
to do at any given time so I just do the
opposite<00:01:46.939> like<00:01:47.149> I'm<00:01:47.479> pretty<00:01:47.959> good<00:01:48.049> read<00:01:48.200> on

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
opposite like I'm pretty good read on

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.449 
opposite like I'm pretty good read on
when<00:01:48.409> people<00:01:48.590> are<00:01:48.679> bluffing<00:01:48.829> plus<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.340> have<00:01:49.429> a

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
when people are bluffing plus I have a

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.859 
when people are bluffing plus I have a
lot<00:01:49.549> of<00:01:49.579> live<00:01:49.789> experience<00:01:50.240> I<00:01:50.329> sort<00:01:50.600> of<00:01:50.630> grew<00:01:50.780> up

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
lot of live experience I sort of grew up

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.410 
lot of live experience I sort of grew up
in<00:01:50.959> life<00:01:51.079> poker<00:01:51.639> and<00:01:52.639> I've<00:01:52.789> put<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.969> ton<00:01:53.149> of<00:01:53.179> life

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
in life poker and I've put a ton of life

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.879 
in life poker and I've put a ton of life
and<00:01:53.689> most<00:01:53.959> of<00:01:54.139> these<00:01:54.229> people<00:01:54.499> are<00:01:54.530> internet

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
and most of these people are internet

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:56.559 
and most of these people are internet
players<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.549> there<00:01:56.060> is<00:01:56.149> something<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.479> be

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
players and there is something to be

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:57.999 
players and there is something to be
said<00:01:56.810> for<00:01:56.840> reading<00:01:57.439> people<00:01:57.560> live<00:01:57.829> and

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
said for reading people live and

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.620 
said for reading people live and
everything<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.819> guess<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.389> combination

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
everything so I guess it's combination

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.090 
everything so I guess it's combination
of<00:01:59.929> those<00:02:00.049> things<00:02:00.259> sort<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.649> like<00:02:00.740> balanced

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
of those things sort of like balanced

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.680 
of those things sort of like balanced
aggression<00:02:01.429> at<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.579> right<00:02:01.729> times

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
aggression at the right times

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.870 
aggression at the right times
and<00:02:03.230> really<00:02:03.560> putting<00:02:04.370> pressure<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.730> people

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
and really putting pressure on people

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.940 
and really putting pressure on people
the<00:02:05.090> right<00:02:05.180> times<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.690> think<00:02:05.930> that's<00:02:06.830> one

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
the right times and I think that's one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.800 
the right times and I think that's one
of<00:02:06.980> a<00:02:07.070> bit<00:02:07.220> big<00:02:07.340> strengths<00:02:07.730> and<00:02:08.119> last<00:02:08.600> year<00:02:08.780> you

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
of a bit big strengths and last year you

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.960 
of a bit big strengths and last year you
made<00:02:09.080> a<00:02:09.110> televised<00:02:09.860> final<00:02:10.250> table<00:02:10.580> how<00:02:10.790> have

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
made a televised final table how have

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.340 
made a televised final table how have
things<00:02:11.000> within<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.720> last<00:02:11.870> year<00:02:11.990> kind<00:02:12.290> of

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
things within the last year kind of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.140 
things within the last year kind of
changed<00:02:12.680> since<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:12.920> have<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.280> exposure<00:02:13.580> did

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
changed since you have that exposure did

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.490 
changed since you have that exposure did
you<00:02:14.270> notice<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.840> changed<00:02:15.170> when<00:02:15.290> people

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
you notice that it changed when people

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.620 
you notice that it changed when people
started<00:02:15.770> playing<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.190> more<00:02:16.400> live<00:02:16.640> or<00:02:17.030> you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
started playing you more live or you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:18.940 
started playing you more live or you
know<00:02:17.720> do<00:02:17.870> people<00:02:18.110> come<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.590> do<00:02:18.860> they

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
know do people come up to you do they

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.410 
know do people come up to you do they
play<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.190> differently<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:19.940> they<00:02:20.030> recognize

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
play you differently do they recognize

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.970 
play you differently do they recognize
you<00:02:20.630> from<00:02:20.960> that<00:02:21.050> table<00:02:21.260> they<00:02:21.590> definitely

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
you from that table they definitely

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.290 
you from that table they definitely
recognize<00:02:22.430> me<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.730> definitely<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.180> mean

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
recognize me and they definitely I mean

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.620 
recognize me and they definitely I mean
obviously<00:02:23.660> my<00:02:24.370> 52<00:02:25.370> suited<00:02:25.820> for<00:02:26.180> bed<00:02:26.330> all<00:02:26.450> in

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
obviously my 52 suited for bed all in

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.560 
obviously my 52 suited for bed all in
was<00:02:26.840> not<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.590> most<00:02:27.890> standard<00:02:28.190> play<00:02:28.430> so<00:02:29.150> I

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
was not like the most standard play so I

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.900 
was not like the most standard play so I
definitely<00:02:29.960> get<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.290> lot<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.500> people<00:02:30.950> calling

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
definitely get a lot of people calling

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.100 
definitely get a lot of people calling
me<00:02:32.000> down<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> lot<00:02:32.270> lighter<00:02:32.570> or<00:02:32.810> things<00:02:33.020> like

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
me down a lot lighter or things like

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.270 
me down a lot lighter or things like
that<00:02:33.200> I've<00:02:33.440> definitely<00:02:33.680> changed<00:02:33.890> my<00:02:34.100> game<00:02:34.190> a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
that I've definitely changed my game a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.100 
that I've definitely changed my game a
little<00:02:34.310> bit<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.880> can't<00:02:35.540> say<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:35.720> I'm<00:02:35.900> tight

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
little bit I can't say that I'm tight

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.750 
little bit I can't say that I'm tight
play<00:02:36.530> during<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.830> at<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.190> point<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:37.550> I

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
play during it at this point because I

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.540 
play during it at this point because I
just<00:02:38.060> not<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.330> me<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.380> know<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:40.100> realized

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
just not in me but you know I I realized

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.800 
just not in me but you know I I realized
that<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.120> something<00:02:41.330> they're<00:02:41.510> thinking

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
that that is something they're thinking

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.420 
that that is something they're thinking
about<00:02:41.840> any<00:02:42.200> given<00:02:42.410> time<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.070> I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
about any given time and so I I

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.920 
about any given time and so I I
definitely<00:02:43.880> balance<00:02:44.240> that<00:02:44.330> into<00:02:44.510> my<00:02:44.570> play<00:02:44.750> but

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
definitely balance that into my play but

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.150 
definitely balance that into my play but
I've<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:45.170> developed<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.620> much<00:02:45.770> as<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.950> player

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
I've just developed so much as a player

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.150 
I've just developed so much as a player
since<00:02:47.150> last<00:02:47.390> year<00:02:47.770> especially<00:02:48.770> as<00:02:49.070> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
since last year especially as a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.200 
since last year especially as a
tournament<00:02:49.460> putter<00:02:49.580> because<00:02:49.850> I<00:02:49.910> came<00:02:50.060> into

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
tournament putter because I came into

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.520 
tournament putter because I came into
last<00:02:50.420> year<00:02:50.570> only<00:02:50.660> having<00:02:50.990> played<00:02:51.170> with<00:02:51.350> like

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
last year only having played with like

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.980 
last year only having played with like
five<00:02:52.070> tournaments<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:52.580> my<00:02:52.670> life<00:02:52.850> and<00:02:53.060> now<00:02:53.180> you

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
five tournaments in my life and now you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.960 
five tournaments in my life and now you
know<00:02:54.110> I've<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:55.070> know<00:02:55.100> played<00:02:55.400> maybe<00:02:55.610> about<00:02:55.790> 30

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
know I've you know played maybe about 30

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.270 
know I've you know played maybe about 30
40<00:02:56.420> something<00:02:56.660> like<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.230> so<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.440> realized
