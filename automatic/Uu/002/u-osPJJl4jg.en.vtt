go<00:00:00.989> ahead<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:01.920> using<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.370> Vantage<00:00:02.669> Pro

00:00:03.039 --> 00:00:03.049 
go ahead this is using the Vantage Pro

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.829 
go ahead this is using the Vantage Pro
again<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.350> like<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> select<00:00:05.160> vehicle<00:00:05.460> first<00:00:05.940> so

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
again I like to select vehicle first so

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.299 
again I like to select vehicle first so
I<00:00:06.899> know<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.290> I'm<00:00:07.379> working<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.830> when<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.010> save

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
I know that I'm working on when I save

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.020 
I know that I'm working on when I save

liter<00:00:12.059> okay<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.740> might<00:00:13.950> ask<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.269> we

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
liter okay some might ask what if we

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.380 
liter okay some might ask what if we
just<00:00:15.660> go<00:00:15.809> into<00:00:15.960> ignition<00:00:16.500> scope<00:00:17.070> directly<00:00:17.699> if

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
just go into ignition scope directly if

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.090 
just go into ignition scope directly if
I<00:00:18.600> were<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.810> select<00:00:18.960> ignition<00:00:19.650> scope<00:00:19.920> because

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
I were to select ignition scope because

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.759 
I were to select ignition scope because
the<00:00:20.400> output<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.910> lower<00:00:21.380> initially<00:00:22.380> we're<00:00:22.619> not

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the output is lower initially we're not

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.890 
the output is lower initially we're not
going<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.189> be<00:00:23.310> able<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.570> anything

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
going to be able to get see anything

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.689 
going to be able to get see anything
because<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.590> output<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:26.099> much<00:00:26.279> lower<00:00:26.550> on

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because the output is much lower on

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.240 
because the output is much lower on
these<00:00:26.939> coils<00:00:27.210> some<00:00:28.050> cars<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.740> see<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> on

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
these coils some cars you can see it on

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.440 
these coils some cars you can see it on
some<00:00:29.550> cars<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.570> it's<00:00:30.689> very<00:00:30.840> low<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.949> amplitude

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
some cars but it's very low in amplitude

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.310 
some cars but it's very low in amplitude
if<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.690> go<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.250> lab<00:00:35.250> scope<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.059> know<00:00:36.899> I'm<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.230> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
if I go to lab scope I know I'm going to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
if I go to lab scope I know I'm going to
be<00:00:37.410> able<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.210> here<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.239> am<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.480> lab

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
be able to see it so here I am a lab

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.350 
be able to see it so here I am a lab
scope<00:00:39.989> I'm<00:00:40.860> gonna<00:00:41.100> take<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.790> channel<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
scope I'm gonna take go to channel to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.799 
scope I'm gonna take go to channel to
turn<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> off<00:00:43.460> okay<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.030> I'm<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.120> channel<00:00:45.600> one

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
turn that off okay so I'm in channel one

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
turn that off okay so I'm in channel one
and<00:00:46.789> we're<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> 20<00:00:48.510> volt<00:00:48.660> scale<00:00:49.399> and<00:00:50.399> drop

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
and we're on a 20 volt scale and drop

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.990 
and we're on a 20 volt scale and drop
that<00:00:51.030> down<00:00:51.300> again

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
that down again

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.290 
that down again
into<00:00:53.150> 2<00:00:53.360> or<00:00:53.390> 500<00:00:53.990> millivolts<00:00:54.850> now<00:00:55.850> you<00:00:55.940> can<00:00:56.150> see

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
into 2 or 500 millivolts now you can see

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.300 
into 2 or 500 millivolts now you can see
the<00:00:56.420> waveform<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.960> going<00:00:57.230> by<00:00:57.440> the<00:00:57.800> reason<00:00:58.160> is

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
the waveform is going by the reason is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.000 
the waveform is going by the reason is
we<00:00:58.720> want<00:00:59.720> to<00:00:59.810> invert<00:01:00.080> that<00:01:00.110> signal<00:01:00.830> on<00:01:00.920> this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
we want to invert that signal on this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.810 
we want to invert that signal on this
particular<00:01:01.370> car<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:03.220> then<00:01:04.220> it's<00:01:04.370> still<00:01:04.550> going

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
particular car and then it's still going

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.560 
particular car and then it's still going
by<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:05.089> can<00:01:05.449> see<00:01:05.660> what's<00:01:06.500> going<00:01:06.830> on<00:01:06.979> with<00:01:07.160> that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
by you can see what's going on with that

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.250 
by you can see what's going on with that
ok<00:01:09.340> what<00:01:10.340> we'll<00:01:10.490> have<00:01:10.670> to<00:01:10.820> do<00:01:11.030> is<00:01:11.840> then<00:01:12.080> we<00:01:12.140> need

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
ok what we'll have to do is then we need

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.050 
ok what we'll have to do is then we need
a<00:01:12.350> set<00:01:12.590> peak<00:01:12.830> detect<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.430> this

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.450 

sure<00:01:16.900> my<00:01:17.049> leads<00:01:17.290> are<00:01:17.470> tight<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:20.590> allows<00:01:21.159> us

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
sure my leads are tight that allows us

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.370 
sure my leads are tight that allows us
to<00:01:21.729> pick<00:01:21.880> up<00:01:22.030> every<00:01:22.450> little<00:01:22.720> frequency<00:01:23.140> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
to pick up every little frequency of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.420 
to pick up every little frequency of
this<00:01:23.470> signal<00:01:25.409> okay<00:01:26.409> and<00:01:26.979> we<00:01:27.070> need<00:01:27.100> to<00:01:27.280> make

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
this signal okay and we need to make

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.130 
this signal okay and we need to make
sure<00:01:27.610> our<00:01:27.640> time<00:01:27.970> base<00:01:28.240> here<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.600> about<00:01:28.840> ten

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
sure our time base here is about ten

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.719 
sure our time base here is about ten
milliseconds<00:01:29.799> I<00:01:29.890> got<00:01:30.040> lucky<00:01:30.250> on<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.580> other

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
milliseconds I got lucky on the other

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:31.260 
milliseconds I got lucky on the other
ones

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
ones

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.899 
ones
and<00:01:31.570> I'm<00:01:31.900> glad<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.890> that<00:01:32.950> defaulted<00:01:33.729> run

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
and I'm glad that that defaulted run

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.310 
and I'm glad that that defaulted run
because<00:01:34.149> usually<00:01:34.360> your<00:01:34.570> time<00:01:34.780> base<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.140> going

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
because usually your time base is going

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.050 
because usually your time base is going
to<00:01:35.380> be<00:01:35.440> right<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.430> tools<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.850> just

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
to be right the other tools I just

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.870 
to be right the other tools I just
happen<00:01:37.330> to<00:01:37.420> be<00:01:37.509> lucky<00:01:37.720> on<00:01:37.960> me<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:39.520> move<00:01:39.640> this

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
happen to be lucky on me I can move this

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.480 
happen to be lucky on me I can move this
over<00:01:40.119> a<00:01:40.299> little<00:01:40.420> bit<00:01:40.540> so<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:42.009> can<00:01:42.190> see<00:01:42.369> the

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
over a little bit so I can see the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.749 
over a little bit so I can see the
signal<00:01:42.909> as<00:01:43.030> I<00:01:43.180> want<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:47.399> I'm<00:01:48.399> gonna<00:01:48.520> raise

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
signal as I want and I'm gonna raise

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.080 
signal as I want and I'm gonna raise
this<00:01:48.970> up<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.509> can<00:01:49.690> see<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.520> whole<00:01:51.640> pattern

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
this up so I can see the whole pattern

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.300 
this up so I can see the whole pattern
okay

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
okay

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.450 
okay
so<00:01:54.850> here<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.210> have<00:01:55.360> a<00:01:55.390> nice<00:01:55.600> waveform<00:01:56.290> I<00:01:56.560> might

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
so here we have a nice waveform I might

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.980 
so here we have a nice waveform I might
want<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.670> blow<00:01:57.909> it<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.119> just<00:01:58.299> a<00:01:58.479> little<00:01:58.510> bit<00:01:58.750> to

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
want to blow it up just a little bit to

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.770 
want to blow it up just a little bit to
look<00:01:59.140> at<00:01:59.320> that<00:01:59.500> waveform<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> time<00:02:00.430> base<00:02:00.780> I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
look at that waveform the time base I'm

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.270 
look at that waveform the time base I'm
going<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.260> set<00:02:02.470> it<00:02:02.590> at<00:02:02.799> about<00:02:02.979> 1<00:02:04.320> Ms<00:02:05.320> delay<00:02:06.070> on

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
going to set it at about 1 Ms delay on

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.690

to see that the comparative analysis so

to see that the comparative analysis so
here<00:02:49.150> we<00:02:49.269> have<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> nice<00:02:49.720> waveform<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:51.160> it's

here we have a nice waveform and it's

here we have a nice waveform and it's

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
kind of your preference we can even get

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.110 
kind of your preference we can even get
a<00:02:53.260> decent<00:02:53.709> one<00:02:53.860> at<00:02:54.010> 500<00:02:54.489> milliseconds<00:02:54.940> that<00:02:54.970> we

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
a decent one at 500 milliseconds that we

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.150 
a decent one at 500 milliseconds that we
get<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.360> voltage<00:02:55.480> too<00:02:55.870> high<00:02:56.110> you're<00:02:57.010> not

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
get the voltage too high you're not

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.650 
get the voltage too high you're not
going<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> be<00:02:57.459> able<00:02:57.519> to<00:02:57.670> see<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.000> burn<00:02:58.180> time<00:02:58.510> as

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
going to be able to see the burn time as

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to be able to see the burn time as
well<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.739> why<00:03:00.100> I<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.040> bring<00:03:03.190> it

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
well and that's why I like to bring it

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.220 
well and that's why I like to bring it
down<00:03:03.549> and<00:03:03.820> amplify<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.360> signals<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.989> little

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
down and amplify the signals a little

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.569 
down and amplify the signals a little
bit<00:03:05.320> of<00:03:05.410> personal<00:03:05.709> preference<00:03:06.100> but<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.400> can

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
bit of personal preference but you can

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.670 
bit of personal preference but you can
see<00:03:06.820> really<00:03:07.600> easily<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.410> you're<00:03:08.590> running

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
see really easily that you're running

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.380 
see really easily that you're running
about<00:03:09.010> 1.6<00:03:09.820> on<00:03:10.690> the

problem with spark whether it's you want

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.330 
problem with spark whether it's you want
to<00:04:04.250> eliminate<00:04:04.610> spark<00:04:05.239> from<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.870> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
to eliminate spark from that so the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.500 
to eliminate spark from that so the
valves<00:04:07.340> are<00:04:07.489> floating<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.000> you<00:04:08.120> have<00:04:08.269> some

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
valves are floating if you have some

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.140 
valves are floating if you have some

right<00:04:13.670> away<00:04:14.120> on<00:04:14.300> this<00:04:14.390> ignition<00:04:15.070> as<00:04:16.070> we're

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
right away on this ignition as we're

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.099 
right away on this ignition as we're
looking<00:04:16.459> at<00:04:16.729> burn<00:04:17.239> time<00:04:17.510> is<00:04:17.540> normal<00:04:17.989> and

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
looking at burn time is normal and

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.020 
looking at burn time is normal and
compares<00:04:18.410> the<00:04:18.560> same<00:04:18.799> doing<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.669> comparative

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
compares the same doing a comparative

analysis whether the cylinders it looks

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.620 
analysis whether the cylinders it looks
virtually<00:04:21.950> identical<00:04:22.610> that's<00:04:23.030> a<00:04:23.150> good<00:04:23.360> firing

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
virtually identical that's a good firing

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.530 
virtually identical that's a good firing
foot<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> hope<00:04:25.040> this<00:04:25.190> helps<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:26.060> is<00:04:26.210> titled
