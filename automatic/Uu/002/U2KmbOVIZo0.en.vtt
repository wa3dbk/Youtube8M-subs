I<00:00:02.270> thought<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.330> just<00:00:03.419> might<00:00:03.780> show<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.140> quick

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
I thought I just might show a quick

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.560 
I thought I just might show a quick
video<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.190> how<00:00:05.250> to<00:00:06.140> gas<00:00:07.140> up<00:00:07.350> your<00:00:07.500> shocks<00:00:08.570> now

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570

the most important thing you want to do

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.629 
the most important thing you want to do
is<00:00:11.910> make<00:00:12.269> sure<00:00:12.300> your<00:00:13.040> shocks<00:00:14.040> are<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.370> full

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
is make sure your shocks are at full

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
first of all we're going to take the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:35.750 
first of all we're going to take the
valve<00:00:28.140> cap<00:00:28.410> off<00:00:31.160> let<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.399> live<00:00:33.950> now<00:00:34.950> we've

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
valve cap off let that live now we've

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.549 
valve cap off let that live now we've
got<00:00:35.969> like<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.180> Schrader<00:00:36.540> valve<00:00:36.899> set<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.260> here

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
got like a Schrader valve set up here

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.420 
got like a Schrader valve set up here
where<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.100> fix<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.920> valve<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
where we fix this to the valve on the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:01:06.399 
where we fix this to the valve on the
remote<00:00:41.969> reservoir

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.289 

do<00:01:07.130> that<00:01:07.310> up<00:01:07.460> nice<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.700> tight<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.970> get<00:01:14.119> no

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
do that up nice and tight you get no

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:15.240 
do that up nice and tight you get no
leaks

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
leaks

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.969 
leaks
now<00:01:16.250> see<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.060> at<00:01:17.600> the<00:01:17.840> moment<00:01:18.259> this<00:01:18.530> is<00:01:18.590> wound

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
now see this at the moment this is wound

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.710 
now see this at the moment this is wound
all<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.430> way<00:01:19.549> out<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.299> this<00:01:20.450> does<00:01:20.659> this

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
all the way out and what this does this

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.260 
all the way out and what this does this
one's<00:01:21.140> opinion<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:24.610> at<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:25.759> moment<00:01:25.940> with<00:01:26.180> it

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
one's opinion and at the moment with it

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.029 
one's opinion and at the moment with it
wound<00:01:26.479> all<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.780> way<00:01:26.899> out<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.619> valve<00:01:27.830> will<00:01:28.009> be

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
wound all the way out the valve will be

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.480 
wound all the way out the valve will be
closed<00:01:28.399> on<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:29.210> on<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.710> remote<00:01:31.039> reservoir

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
closed on the on the remote reservoir

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.350 
closed on the on the remote reservoir
and<00:01:31.729> when<00:01:32.509> we<00:01:32.659> won<00:01:33.140> this<00:01:33.350> in<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:34.759> will<00:01:34.940> open<00:01:35.180> the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
and when we won this in it will open the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.090 
and when we won this in it will open the
valve<00:01:35.479> just<00:01:35.960> like<00:01:36.110> putting<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.440> stick<00:01:36.740> into<00:01:36.950> the

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
valve just like putting a stick into the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.480 
valve just like putting a stick into the
ndu<00:01:37.520> valve<00:01:37.759> and<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.840> will<00:01:38.990> allow<00:01:39.229> us<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.649> put

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
ndu valve and that will allow us to put

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.090 
ndu valve and that will allow us to put
the<00:01:40.670> gas<00:01:40.880> into<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.479> remote<00:01:42.409> reservoir<00:01:42.920> and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
the gas into the remote reservoir and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.240 
the gas into the remote reservoir and
fill<00:01:43.819> the<00:01:43.909> shock<00:01:44.090> up<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.590> we've<00:01:45.800> got<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:46.100> all

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
fill the shock up and we've got that all

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.790 
fill the shock up and we've got that all
the<00:01:46.520> way<00:01:46.610> out<00:01:46.819> at<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.000> moment<00:01:47.619> I'm<00:01:48.619> going<00:01:48.740> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
the way out at the moment I'm going to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.669 
the way out at the moment I'm going to
come<00:01:49.009> over<00:01:49.039> here<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.720> turn<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.229> gas<00:01:51.409> bottle

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
come over here you turn the gas bottle

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:58.059 
come over here you turn the gas bottle
on<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.720> I've<00:01:53.960> got<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:55.600> I've<00:01:56.600> got<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:57.530> got<00:01:58.039> to

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
on and I've got the I've got the got to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.359 
on and I've got the I've got the got to
set<00:01:58.310> up<00:01:58.429> for<00:01:58.729> I'm<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.450> put<00:01:59.659> 200<00:02:00.229> psi<00:02:00.950> of

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
set up for I'm going to put 200 psi of

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.260 
set up for I'm going to put 200 psi of
pressure<00:02:02.170> into<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.380> shock<00:02:03.850> now<00:02:04.850> I'm<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.209> to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
pressure into the shock now I'm going to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.479 
pressure into the shock now I'm going to
wind<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:06.890> one<00:02:07.159> this<00:02:07.340> in<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.530> as<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:10.220> one's

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
wind just one this in and as this one's

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.229 
wind just one this in and as this one's
in<00:02:10.759> you'll<00:02:10.970> see<00:02:11.060> it<00:02:12.310> usually<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.430> changes<00:02:13.970> if

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
in you'll see it usually it changes if

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:19.270 
in you'll see it usually it changes if
the<00:02:14.420> shocks<00:02:14.930> I'd<00:02:15.170> guessed<00:02:15.470> up<00:02:17.980> these<00:02:18.980> are

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
the shocks I'd guessed up these are

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.699 
the shocks I'd guessed up these are
these<00:02:19.640> actually<00:02:20.000> got<00:02:20.209> gas<00:02:20.390> in<00:02:20.570> them<00:02:20.660> I've<00:02:21.530> just

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
these actually got gas in them I've just

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.340 
these actually got gas in them I've just
been<00:02:21.890> going<00:02:22.100> around<00:02:22.340> checking<00:02:22.579> them<00:02:22.820> all

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
been going around checking them all

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.840 
been going around checking them all
right<00:02:24.350> so<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:25.459> gassed<00:02:27.549> that's<00:02:28.549> what<00:02:28.730> this

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
right so that's gassed that's what this

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.610 
right so that's gassed that's what this
wound<00:02:29.120> in<00:02:29.359> I'm<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.870> one<00:02:30.049> that<00:02:30.260> back<00:02:30.440> out

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
wound in I'm going to one that back out

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.160 
wound in I'm going to one that back out
now

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.800 

oh<00:02:35.200> yeah<00:02:37.770> turn<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.890> bottle<00:02:39.160> off<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.660> will

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
oh yeah turn the bottle off that will

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.600 
oh yeah turn the bottle off that will
stay<00:02:41.020> charged<00:02:41.410> because<00:02:41.770> now<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:42.340> reading

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
stay charged because now it's reading

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.090 
stay charged because now it's reading
the<00:02:42.790> pressure<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.390> line<00:02:43.740> from<00:02:44.740> here<00:02:47.100> to

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
the pressure in the line from here to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.000 
the pressure in the line from here to
the<00:02:48.280> our<00:02:48.459> valve<00:02:49.110> I'm<00:02:50.110> going<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.440> crack<00:02:50.770> our

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
the our valve I'm going to crack our

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:00.090 
the our valve I'm going to crack our
Schrader<00:02:51.580> valve<00:02:51.880> off<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.500> our<00:02:59.709> pressures

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
Schrader valve off and our pressures

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.979 
Schrader valve off and our pressures
back<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.400> zero<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:03.220> that<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.910> how<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.480> guessed

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
back to zero and that is how you guessed
