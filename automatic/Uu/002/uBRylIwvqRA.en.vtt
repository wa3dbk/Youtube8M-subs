00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
jump I didn't use and then I have tape

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.839 
jump I didn't use and then I have tape
it<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.390> tape<00:02:24.630> down<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:25.620> loop-de-loops<00:02:26.160> and

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it to tape down the loop-de-loops and

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.760 
it to tape down the loop-de-loops and
the<00:02:27.480> parts<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:28.050> have<00:02:28.290> connectors

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
the parts that don't have connectors

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.360 
the parts that don't have connectors
there<00:02:28.920> you<00:02:29.010> go

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
there you go

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.210 
there you go
I<00:02:29.400> tape<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.709> because<00:02:32.040> you

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
I tape those down to just because you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.610 
I tape those down to just because you
know<00:02:32.340> what<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.700> speeds<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.750> all<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:34.050> they

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
know what the speeds and all that they

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.550 
know what the speeds and all that they
do<00:02:34.680> come<00:02:35.130> apart<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.720> turns<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.230> stuff<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
do come apart on the turns and stuff so

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.600 
do come apart on the turns and stuff so
this<00:02:37.739> way<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.250> keeps<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.760> all<00:02:39.080> together<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:41.310> one

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
this way it keeps it all together as one

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.650 
this way it keeps it all together as one
piece<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.060> don't<00:02:42.209> have<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> worry<00:02:42.540> about

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
piece so you don't have to worry about

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.040 
piece so you don't have to worry about
it<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.330> we're<00:02:45.480> gonna<00:02:45.569> go<00:02:45.720> ahead<00:02:45.810> and<00:02:45.900> we're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
it and so we're gonna go ahead and we're

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.309 
it and so we're gonna go ahead and we're
gonna<00:02:46.200> turn<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.840> I'll<00:02:48.840> show<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.140> how

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
gonna turn it on and I'll show you how

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.530 
gonna turn it on and I'll show you how
it<00:02:49.440> works<00:02:52.370> all<00:02:53.370> right<00:02:53.400> let<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.880> let<00:02:54.180> us<00:02:54.209> speed

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it works all right let that let us speed

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.759 
it works all right let that let us speed
up<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.780> little<00:02:54.810> bit<00:02:55.110> real<00:02:55.260> quick<00:02:55.290> BAM<00:02:57.769> there's

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
up a little bit real quick BAM there's

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.600 
up a little bit real quick BAM there's
my<00:02:58.980> other<00:02:59.220> son<00:02:59.370> over<00:02:59.610> there<00:03:01.220> let's<00:03:02.220> see<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.519> I

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
my other son over there let's see if I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.300 
my other son over there let's see if I
can<00:03:02.700> get<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.880> angle<00:03:03.000> better<00:03:07.010> all<00:03:08.010> right<00:03:08.130> go

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
can get the angle better all right go

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.660 
can get the angle better all right go
ahead<00:03:08.340> toss<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.000 

as<00:03:13.300> you<00:03:13.569> can<00:03:13.660> tell<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.290> one<00:03:14.500> booster<00:03:14.709> is<00:03:14.950> a

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
as you can tell the one booster is a

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:26.120 
as you can tell the one booster is a
little<00:03:15.250> weak<00:03:16.380> doesn't<00:03:17.380> really<00:03:17.500> even<00:03:17.680> lock<00:03:18.040> it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.610 

hurry<00:03:26.760> up
