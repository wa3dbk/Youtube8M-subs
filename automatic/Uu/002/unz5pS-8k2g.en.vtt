or three weeks for different reasons and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.310 
or three weeks for different reasons and
so<00:00:23.340> when<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> started<00:00:24.060> drawing<00:00:24.300> again<00:00:24.510> a<00:00:24.930> few

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
so when I started drawing again a few

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.460 
so when I started drawing again a few
days<00:00:25.529> ago<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:26.099> felt<00:00:26.400> like<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:26.640> was<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.470> like

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
days ago I felt like I was kind of like

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.429 
days ago I felt like I was kind of like
I<00:00:28.769> guess<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> would<00:00:29.880> call<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.539> slump

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
I guess in what you would call a slump

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.970 
I guess in what you would call a slump
where<00:00:32.510> you<00:00:33.510> don't<00:00:33.660> really<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.110> any<00:00:34.260> ideas<00:00:34.739> or

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
where you don't really have any ideas or

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.709 
where you don't really have any ideas or
if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.430> ideas<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:36.270> don't<00:00:36.510> really

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
if you have ideas they don't really

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.280 
if you have ideas they don't really
translate<00:00:37.380> well<00:00:37.739> into<00:00:38.100> your<00:00:39.050> sketches<00:00:40.050> or

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
translate well into your sketches or

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.360 
translate well into your sketches or
your<00:00:40.680> colors<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.550> I'm<00:00:42.420> sure<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.980> anyone<00:00:43.980> who

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
your colors and I'm sure that anyone who

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.290 
your colors and I'm sure that anyone who
draws<00:00:45.000> or<00:00:45.360> really<00:00:46.320> does<00:00:46.530> any<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.219> art<00:00:47.520> has

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
draws or really does any kind of art has

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.439 
draws or really does any kind of art has
those<00:00:48.980> slumps<00:00:49.980> those<00:00:50.399> very<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.969> inspired

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
those slumps those very and inspired

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.610 
those slumps those very and inspired
moments<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.430> always<00:00:53.730> find<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.210> interesting

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
moments and I always find it interesting

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.720 
moments and I always find it interesting
to<00:00:55.620> talk<00:00:56.010> about<00:00:56.449> what<00:00:57.449> people<00:00:58.309> do<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> get

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
to talk about what people do to get

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.820 
to talk about what people do to get
through<00:01:00.149> those<00:01:00.719> slumps<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:03.260> I<00:01:04.260> think<00:01:04.650> that

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
through those slumps and I think that

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
through those slumps and I think that
it's<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.939> mean<00:01:06.479> people<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.049> very

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's in that I mean people have very

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's in that I mean people have very
different<00:01:07.680> methods<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.820> seems<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
different methods but it seems that a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.780 
different methods but it seems that a
lot<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.430> look<00:01:11.430> at<00:01:11.610> other

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
lot of people like to look at other

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.050 
lot of people like to look at other
people's<00:01:12.299> art<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:13.110> really<00:01:13.560> soak<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
people's art to really soak in that

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.130 
people's art to really soak in that
inspiration<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:17.360> I've<00:01:18.360> found<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.720> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
inspiration and I've found that that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.310 
inspiration and I've found that that
doesn't<00:01:19.350> really<00:01:19.799> work<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.610> me<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
doesn't really work for me I you just

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.039 
doesn't really work for me I you just
have<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> sit<00:01:23.250> down<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.759> force<00:01:24.240> myself<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
have to sit down and force myself to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.620 
have to sit down and force myself to
draw<00:01:25.259> something<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.280> finish<00:01:26.640> something<00:01:27.060> more

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
draw something to finish something more

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.460 
draw something to finish something more
precisely<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.590> from<00:01:28.799> lines<00:01:29.100> two<00:01:29.400> colors

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
precisely really from lines two colors

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.039 
precisely really from lines two colors
even<00:01:31.470> if<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.740> don't<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.780> usually<00:01:33.780> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
even if I don't like it and usually that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.160 
even if I don't like it and usually that
helps<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:35.340> through<00:01:35.670> push<00:01:36.600> through<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
helps me get through push through that

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.359 
helps me get through push through that
slump<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:39.710> that's<00:01:40.710> pretty<00:01:40.890> much<00:01:41.040> what

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
slump and that's pretty much what

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.819 
slump and that's pretty much what
happened<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.659> drawing<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.409> well<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
happened with this drawing as well I

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.130 
happened with this drawing as well I
really<00:01:44.159> didn't<00:01:44.460> have<00:01:44.640> any<00:01:44.880> precise<00:01:45.450> ideas<00:01:45.990> and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
really didn't have any precise ideas and

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.670 
really didn't have any precise ideas and
when<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.259> started<00:01:46.710> this<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.100> think<00:01:47.159> i<00:01:47.430> was

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
when I started this I think i was

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.770 
when I started this I think i was
browsing<00:01:49.820> deviantart<00:01:50.820> some<00:01:51.119> random<00:01:51.509> stuff

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
browsing deviantart some random stuff

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.170 
browsing deviantart some random stuff
and<00:01:52.020> i<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.950> found<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.369> page<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.790> some<00:01:54.000> guy

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and i just found the page of some guy

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.109 
and i just found the page of some guy
who<00:01:54.240> does<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:55.290> props<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.130> costumes<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.289 
who does like props and costumes and
stuff<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.130> he<00:01:59.130> had<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> photo<00:01:59.939> of
