00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
back cuz everyone knows that the iphone

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.670 
back cuz everyone knows that the iphone
it's<00:01:56.909> rounded<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.689> edges<00:01:58.020> surrounded<00:01:58.590> on

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
it's rounded on the edges surrounded on

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.620 
it's rounded on the edges surrounded on
the<00:01:58.770> corners<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.310> what<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> people<00:02:00.450> at

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

bestbuy<00:02:00.930> didn't<00:02:01.200> realize<00:02:01.469> was<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
bestbuy didn't realize was it's the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.530 
bestbuy didn't realize was it's the
little<00:02:02.399> technique<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> learned<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.450> it's

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
little technique that I learned and it's

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.850 
little technique that I learned and it's
called<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> cutting<00:02:04.140> technique<00:02:04.469> he<00:02:04.619> kind<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
called the cutting technique he kind of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.859 
called the cutting technique he kind of
cup<00:02:05.070> your<00:02:05.250> hands<00:02:05.640> take<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.360> corner<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.689> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
cup your hands take the corner like that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.350 
cup your hands take the corner like that
you<00:02:07.020> hold<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.350> for<00:02:07.380> about<00:02:07.759> 60<00:02:08.759> seconds<00:02:09.090> or<00:02:09.209> so

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
you hold it for about 60 seconds or so

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.570 
you hold it for about 60 seconds or so
and<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.569> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.750> helps<00:02:09.959> out<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> corners<00:02:10.580> so

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
and it kind of helps out the corners so

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.660 
and it kind of helps out the corners so
I<00:02:12.000> pretty

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
I pretty

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.640 
I pretty
taught<00:02:12.940> them<00:02:13.120> how<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.240> do<00:02:13.450> that<00:02:13.599> but<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
taught them how to do that but like I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.230 
taught them how to do that but like I
said<00:02:14.709> this<00:02:14.950> was<00:02:15.099> thirty<00:02:15.370> dollars<00:02:15.819> for<00:02:16.150> the
