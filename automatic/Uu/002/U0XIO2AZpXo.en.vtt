okay<00:00:12.160> so<00:00:12.220> we're<00:00:12.520> back<00:00:12.550> in<00:00:12.700> I<00:00:13.090> painted<00:00:13.750> this

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
okay so we're back in I painted this

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.560 
okay so we're back in I painted this
area<00:00:14.350> green<00:00:14.620> here<00:00:14.890> just<00:00:15.190> so<00:00:15.309> it'll<00:00:15.550> feel<00:00:15.940> such

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
area green here just so it'll feel such

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.620 
area green here just so it'll feel such
it<00:00:16.750> just<00:00:17.740> Soviet<00:00:18.250> mud<00:00:18.520> will<00:00:18.760> show<00:00:19.300> up<00:00:19.450> better

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
it just Soviet mud will show up better

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.970 
it just Soviet mud will show up better
and<00:00:19.930> I<00:00:20.770> also<00:00:21.130> i<00:00:21.400> widen<00:00:22.240> this<00:00:22.510> out<00:00:22.750> more<00:00:23.230> and<00:00:23.560> I

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
and I also i widen this out more and I

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.420 
and I also i widen this out more and I
dug<00:00:24.279> in<00:00:24.460> deeper<00:00:24.939> and<00:00:25.840> as<00:00:26.380> you<00:00:26.619> can<00:00:26.710> see<00:00:26.770> so<00:00:27.250> if

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
dug in deeper and as you can see so if

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.220 
dug in deeper and as you can see so if
there's<00:00:27.669> I<00:00:27.790> probably<00:00:28.119> like<00:00:28.599> just<00:00:28.630> shy<00:00:28.960> of<00:00:28.989> like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
there's I probably like just shy of like

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.429 
there's I probably like just shy of like
a<00:00:29.259> quarter<00:00:29.860> inch<00:00:30.099> of<00:00:30.400> a<00:00:30.700> gap<00:00:30.910> there<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:32.349> I

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
a quarter inch of a gap there and I

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.819 
a quarter inch of a gap there and I
really<00:00:32.860> like<00:00:32.980> and<00:00:33.190> I<00:00:33.310> really<00:00:33.610> wanted<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:33.970> like

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
really like and I really wanted to like

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.200 
really like and I really wanted to like
carve<00:00:35.829> it<00:00:35.980> out<00:00:36.040> wide<00:00:36.340> because<00:00:36.700> now<00:00:37.000> we're

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
carve it out wide because now we're

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.850 
carve it out wide because now we're
going<00:00:37.329> to<00:00:37.390> do<00:00:37.540> is<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:38.290> we're<00:00:38.440> going<00:00:38.560> to<00:00:38.649> pack

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
going to do is all we're going to pack

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.020 
going to do is all we're going to pack
it<00:00:39.100> with<00:00:39.130> a<00:00:39.280> setting<00:00:39.970> mud<00:00:40.510> I'm<00:00:41.470> going<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.770> use

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it with a setting mud I'm going to use

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.670 
it with a setting mud I'm going to use
plaster<00:00:43.030> of<00:00:43.149> Paris<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.750> just<00:00:44.080> all-purpose

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
plaster of Paris and just all-purpose

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.350 
plaster of Paris and just all-purpose
joint<00:00:44.950> compound<00:00:45.430> and<00:00:45.670> when<00:00:45.910> you<00:00:46.000> mix<00:00:46.180> them

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
joint compound and when you mix them

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.200 
joint compound and when you mix them
together<00:00:46.600> it<00:00:47.320> sets<00:00:48.100> in<00:00:48.250> ten<00:00:48.460> minutes<00:00:48.670> and<00:00:48.970> it's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
together it sets in ten minutes and it's

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.020 
together it sets in ten minutes and it's
great<00:00:49.540> for<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.800> project<00:00:50.800> slide<00:00:51.340> like<00:00:51.760> this

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
great for a project slide like this

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.700 
great for a project slide like this
now<00:00:52.570> you<00:00:52.660> don't<00:00:52.900> want<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.290> just<00:00:53.440> use<00:00:53.680> just

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
now you don't want to just use just

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.890 
now you don't want to just use just
regular<00:00:54.190> all-purpose<00:00:54.850> mud<00:00:55.570> or<00:00:55.840> the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
regular all-purpose mud or the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.020 
regular all-purpose mud or the
lightweight<00:00:56.620> spackling<00:00:57.040> one<00:00:57.370> on<00:00:57.790> this

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
lightweight spackling one on this

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.240 
lightweight spackling one on this
because<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.420> crap<00:00:58.690> will<00:00:58.990> come<00:00:59.260> back<00:00:59.410> very

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
because the crap will come back very

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.610 
because the crap will come back very
very<00:01:00.430> quickly<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.330> you<00:01:01.390> always<00:01:01.720> want<00:01:02.050> to<00:01:02.110> use<00:01:02.350> a

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
very quickly so you always want to use a

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.469 
very quickly so you always want to use a
setting<00:01:02.980> type<00:01:03.280> compound<00:01:04.000> here<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.159> II<00:01:06.549> there

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
setting type compound here so II there

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.510 
setting type compound here so II there
are<00:01:07.689> a<00:01:07.720> bunch<00:01:08.290> of<00:01:08.439> deal<00:01:08.650> of<00:01:08.799> different<00:01:09.340> types

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
are a bunch of deal of different types

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
are a bunch of deal of different types
of<00:01:09.850> setting<00:01:10.210> compounds<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:12.100> I'm<00:01:13.060> just<00:01:13.420> going

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
of setting compounds so I'm just going

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.690 
of setting compounds so I'm just going
to<00:01:13.600> use<00:01:13.840> a<00:01:14.079> plat<00:01:14.439> via<00:01:14.650> plaster<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.159> Paris<00:01:15.490> with

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
to use a plat via plaster of Paris with

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.919 
to use a plat via plaster of Paris with
the<00:01:15.850> would<00:01:16.060> be<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.240> with<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.479> up<00:01:16.659> with<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
the would be up with the up with the

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:20.730 
the would be up with the up with the
Alba<00:01:17.289> with<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.880> already<00:01:18.880> mix<00:01:19.289> joint<00:01:20.289> compound

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
Alba with you already mix joint compound

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.169 
Alba with you already mix joint compound
so<00:01:21.280> we're<00:01:21.460> going<00:01:21.549> to<00:01:21.609> do<00:01:21.700> is<00:01:21.819> going<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:21.999> come

00:01:22.169 --> 00:01:22.179 
so we're going to do is going to come

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.179 
so we're going to do is going to come
over<00:01:22.210> here<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.079> make<00:01:23.409> up<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.770> mud<00:01:24.460> pie<00:01:26.159> so<00:01:27.159> I

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
over here and make up the mud pie so I

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:42.749 
over here and make up the mud pie so I
have<00:01:27.429> all-purpose<00:01:28.210> joint<00:01:28.479> compound<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:42.520> two

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:42.759 
have all-purpose joint compound this two

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.620 
have all-purpose joint compound this two
here<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:46.240> now<00:01:46.889> just<00:01:47.889> carve<00:01:48.280> up<00:01:48.459> the<00:01:48.700> middle

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
here and now just carve up the middle

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
here and now just carve up the middle
hair<00:01:49.869> so<00:01:50.679> I'll<00:01:50.829> make<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.039> donut

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.390 

okay<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.739> add<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.769> little<00:02:11.860> bit<00:02:12.129> of<00:02:12.220> water

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
okay so now add a little bit of water

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.210 
okay so now add a little bit of water
here<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> middle<00:02:13.810> of<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.900> then<00:02:17.220> in

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
here to the middle of it and then in

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.440 
here to the middle of it and then in
here<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.150> have<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.989> plastron<00:02:20.920> ericeira<00:02:21.640> and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
here I have the plastron ericeira and

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.850 
here I have the plastron ericeira and
we're<00:02:22.599> just<00:02:22.720> going<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:22.870> add<00:02:23.080> this<00:02:23.379> to<00:02:23.650> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
we're just going to add this to the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:32.039 
we're just going to add this to the
middle<00:02:24.340> air<00:02:30.060> I'm<00:02:31.060> just<00:02:31.239> going<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.420> push<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
middle air I'm just going to push it to

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.170 
middle air I'm just going to push it to
the<00:02:32.079> outsides<00:02:32.739> and<00:02:33.489> let<00:02:33.970> the<00:02:34.090> water<00:02:35.010> and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
the outsides and let the water and

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:51.839 
the outsides and let the water and
absorb<00:02:37.180> all<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.840> plaster<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.319> Paris<00:02:38.709> here

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.509 

so<00:02:52.849> now<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.060> brought<00:02:53.810> I'd<00:02:54.019> probably<00:02:54.290> put<00:02:54.650> a<00:02:54.860> lay

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
so now I brought I'd probably put a lay

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.210 
so now I brought I'd probably put a lay
a<00:02:55.549> little<00:02:55.790> too<00:02:56.120> much<00:02:56.360> of<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.650> plaster<00:02:58.189> of

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
a little too much of the plaster of

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.880 
a little too much of the plaster of
Paris<00:02:58.670> in<00:02:58.819> here<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.379> just<00:03:00.500> going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.709> make

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
Paris in here so I'm just going to make

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.759 
Paris in here so I'm just going to make
sure<00:03:01.069> I<00:03:01.099> go<00:03:01.970> all<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.360> way<00:03:02.659> out<00:03:02.950> to<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:05.769> and

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
sure I go all the way out to here and

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.140 
sure I go all the way out to here and
then<00:03:06.920> what<00:03:07.069> I'm<00:03:07.129> going<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.280> do<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:07.909> I'm
