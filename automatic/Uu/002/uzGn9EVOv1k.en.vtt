 second time because yesterday I
put<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.119> in<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.600> didn't<00:00:21.840> tighten<00:00:21.990> to

in<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.930> anyways<00:00:27.930> let's<00:00:28.410> get<00:00:28.560> started<00:00:28.910> okay<00:00:29.910> so

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
in so anyways let's get started okay so

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.330 
in so anyways let's get started okay so
first<00:00:30.689> let<00:00:30.960> me<00:00:30.990> show<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.650> where<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:31.980> at<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
first let me show you where it's at and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.360 
first let me show you where it's at and
kind<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.790> explain<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.270> does<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.250> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
kind of explain what it does so this is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.500 
kind of explain what it does so this is
the<00:00:35.460> reason<00:00:35.579> why<00:00:35.790> most<00:00:35.940> people<00:00:36.210> think<00:00:36.329> it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
the reason why most people think it's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.979 
the reason why most people think it's
 hard<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.920> impossible<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.840> ok<00:00:39.840> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
 hard and impossible to do ok and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.250 
 hard and impossible to do ok and
finally<00:00:40.110> phone<00:00:41.450> alright

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.400 

so<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.770> that's<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.640> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.350> hard<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
so that's that's it I'm kind of hard to

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.100 
so that's that's it I'm kind of hard to
it<00:00:49.620> see<00:00:50.579> where<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.760> bend<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.090> right<00:00:51.870> there's

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
it see where the bend is right there's

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229 
it see where the bend is right there's
the<00:00:52.260> end<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> top<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> little

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the end of it and at the top a little

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
the end of it and at the top a little
brass<00:00:54.570> nut

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
brass nut

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
brass nut
that's<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.860> feed<00:00:56.039> line<00:00:56.250> from<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> reservoir

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
that's the feed line from the reservoir

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
that's the feed line from the reservoir
tank<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.230> against<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> firewall

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
tank so it's up against the firewall

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.090 
tank so it's up against the firewall
tucked<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.910> way<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.329> back<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.100> especially

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
tucked in way in the back and especially

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.910 
tucked in way in the back and especially
my<00:01:02.550> car<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:02.969> no<00:01:03.000> room<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.570> work<00:01:03.830> you<00:01:04.830> get

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
my car there's no room to work you get

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.399 
my car there's no room to work you get
all<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.369> away<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.760> tiny<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.090> Treme

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
all the away it's tiny in Treme

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
all the away it's tiny in Treme
anyways<00:01:07.409> but<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.549> does<00:01:08.670> when<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> push<00:01:09.210> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
anyways but that does when you push the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
anyways but that does when you push the
clutch<00:01:09.450> pedal<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.869> push<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.290> Winston

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
clutch pedal and push this up Winston

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.000 
clutch pedal and push this up Winston
and<00:01:10.979> forces<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.729> fluid<00:01:12.710> through<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.740> line

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and forces the fluid through the line

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.030 
and forces the fluid through the line
which<00:01:14.880> comes<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.299> here<00:01:15.530> it<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.650> down<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
which comes down here it was down and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280 
which comes down here it was down and
around<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.810> pushes<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
slave cylinder which you can see the two

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
slave cylinder which you can see the two
bolts<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.880> hold<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.270> push<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> slaves<00:01:24.990> under

bolts that hold on push the slaves under

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.499 
bolts that hold on push the slaves under
which<00:01:25.380> engage<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.890> clutch<00:01:26.220> fork<00:01:26.520> which

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
which engage the clutch fork which

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.450 
which engage the clutch fork which
engages<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> clutch<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.799> disengages<00:01:29.340> it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
engages the clutch your disengages it

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.399 
engages the clutch your disengages it
depending<00:01:29.820> on<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.630> shifting

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
depending on if you're you know shifting

that I do personally is where this hard
line<00:02:50.780> can't<00:02:51.780> reach<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.140> where<00:02:52.770> this<00:02:52.890> hard<00:02:53.160> line

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
line can't reach it where this hard line

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.570 
line can't reach it where this hard line
connects<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.989> frame<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:56.250> undo<00:02:56.459> that

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
connects to the frame I just undo that

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.770 
connects to the frame I just undo that
bolt<00:02:56.790> there<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.209> they<00:02:57.270> don't<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.630> deal

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
bolt there so they don't have to deal

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
bolt there so they don't have to deal
with<00:02:58.230> bending<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.890> metal<00:02:58.920> or

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
have on there this this pan holds in

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.680 
have on there this this pan holds in
this<00:04:24.990> guy<00:04:25.250> seventeen<00:04:26.250> millimeter<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.880> then

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
this guy seventeen millimeter and then

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.159 
this guy seventeen millimeter and then
that<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.320> little<00:04:28.560> one<00:04:29.510> screws<00:04:30.510> into<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.900> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
that the little one screws into that and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.420 
that the little one screws into that and
it<00:04:31.560> allows<00:04:31.740> it<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:31.979> bend<00:04:32.610> and<00:04:33.080> move<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.410> guess<00:04:34.620> so

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
it allows it to bend and move I guess so

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.710 
it allows it to bend and move I guess so
I<00:04:35.490> need<00:04:35.639> to<00:04:35.700> tighten<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:36.000> down<00:04:36.060> all<00:04:36.450> the<00:04:36.600> way

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
I need to tighten that down all the way

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.180 
I need to tighten that down all the way
and<00:04:36.990> then<00:04:37.260> try<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.530> put<00:04:37.620> it<00:04:37.800> in<00:04:37.889> which<00:04:37.979> will<00:04:38.100> be

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
and then try and put it in which will be

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.159 
and then try and put it in which will be
a<00:04:38.220> little<00:04:38.310> bit<00:04:38.460> more<00:04:38.580> fun<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:39.000> definitely<00:04:39.900> the
