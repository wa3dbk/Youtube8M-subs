the<00:00:37.770> mean<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.550> these<00:00:39.180> numbers<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the mean of these numbers is to

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.880 
the mean of these numbers is to
literally<00:00:41.040> add<00:00:41.219> them<00:00:41.670> all<00:00:41.820> up<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.469> can<00:00:43.739> do

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
literally add them all up now you can do

box here seven plus three plus 25 plus

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.939 
box here seven plus three plus 25 plus
61<00:00:52.820> turns<00:00:53.820> out<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.270> be<00:00:55.129> 96<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> added<00:00:58.649> up<00:00:58.710> all

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
61 turns out to be 96 so I added up all

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.450 
61 turns out to be 96 so I added up all
my<00:00:59.100> numbers<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.120> got<00:01:00.300> 96<00:01:01.070> but<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.309> you

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
my numbers and I got 96 but then you

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
my numbers and I got 96 but then you
have<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.730> divide<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.629> number<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.320> things

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
have to divide by the number of things

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.719 
have to divide by the number of things
that<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:05.070> added<00:01:05.280> up

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729

the 170 plus 246 plus 374 plus 112 plus
201<00:02:00.719> method<00:02:04.640> 1103<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.780> forget<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
201 method 1103 and don't forget to

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.820 
201 method 1103 and don't forget to
divide<00:02:07.710> by<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.979> number<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.520> numbers<00:02:08.789> 1<00:02:09.509> 2<00:02:09.899> 3<00:02:10.319> 4

divide by the number of numbers 1 2 3 4
5<00:02:11.750> divided<00:02:12.750> by<00:02:12.780> 5<00:02:13.110> divided<00:02:14.010> by<00:02:14.040> 5<00:02:14.670> I<00:02:15.360> get<00:02:17.360> 220

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
5 divided by 5 divided by 5 I get 220

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.710 
5 divided by 5 divided by 5 I get 220
point<00:02:18.810> 6<00:02:19.640> now<00:02:20.640> because<00:02:20.970> you're<00:02:21.150> dividing<00:02:21.480> by

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
point 6 now because you're dividing by

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.559 
point 6 now because you're dividing by
just<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.709> number<00:02:23.220> here<00:02:23.610> you<00:02:23.760> might<00:02:24.300> end<00:02:24.480> up

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
just the number here you might end up

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.540 
just the number here you might end up
with<00:02:24.780> decimals<00:02:25.290> don't<00:02:25.739> be<00:02:25.920> alarmed

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
with decimals don't be alarmed

with decimals don't be alarmed
I<00:02:26.670> know<00:02:27.510> rounded<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.379> two<00:02:28.410> decimal

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
I know rounded to one or two decimal

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.650 
I know rounded to one or two decimal
places<00:02:29.069> whatever<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:29.760> teachers<00:02:30.120> asked<00:02:30.450> for

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
I personally like one or two decimal

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.369 
I personally like one or two decimal
places<00:02:33.560> just<00:02:34.560> throwing<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.010> there<00:02:35.340> and

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
places just throwing that out there and

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.229 
places just throwing that out there and
I<00:02:37.379> want<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.769> do<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> for<00:02:38.190> this<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.640> one<00:02:39.209> two

seven numbers that are all really small

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.300
