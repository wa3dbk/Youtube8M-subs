an<00:00:18.960> iphone<00:00:19.289> i<00:00:19.500> think<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.369> what<00:00:20.699> Apple

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
an iphone i think it's the what Apple

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.859 
an iphone i think it's the what Apple
does<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.740> phone<00:00:22.949> without<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:24.480> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
does with the phone without the the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.720 
does with the phone without the the
jailbreaking<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.130> rules<00:00:26.400> they<00:00:26.519> make

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
jailbreaking and all the rules they make

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.960 
jailbreaking and all the rules they make
with<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> apps<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.420> stuff<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.660> think<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.960> bogus

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
with the apps and stuff I think of bogus

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.730 
with the apps and stuff I think of bogus
once<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.210> is<00:00:30.480> jailbroken<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.349> think

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
once this thing is jailbroken I think

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.590
