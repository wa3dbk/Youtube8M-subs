00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
because shears you can actually go and

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
because shears you can actually go and
get<00:01:01.890> sheep<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.520> instead<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.420> killing<00:01:03.660> them

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
get sheep and instead of killing them

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
get sheep and instead of killing them
with<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.140> sword<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.769> can<00:01:04.920> create<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> farm

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
with your sword you can create a farm

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.510 
with your sword you can create a farm
which<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.229> past<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
which I have in the past and then you

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.840 
which I have in the past and then you
use<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.760> shears<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.860> just<00:01:11.100> clip<00:01:11.640> them

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
use your shears and you just clip them

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.050 
use your shears and you just clip them
so<00:01:12.090> you'd<00:01:12.210> run<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:13.610> sheep<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.850> click

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
so you'd run up to a sheep and you click

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.690 
so you'd run up to a sheep and you click
on<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.540> one<00:01:16.110> two<00:01:16.470> or<00:01:16.710> three<00:01:17.189> maybe

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
on it and one two or three maybe

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.690 
on it and one two or three maybe
sometimes<00:01:18.210> even<00:01:18.479> four<00:01:18.979> blocks<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.220> wool<00:01:20.490> will

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
sometimes even four blocks of wool will

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
sometimes even four blocks of wool will
come<00:01:20.909> off<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:21.900> I<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.259> most

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
come off them so that's how I got most

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.219 
come off them so that's how I got most

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
let's see so start from the scratch or

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
let's see so start from the scratch or
from<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> primary<00:01:32.159> colors<00:01:32.520> we

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
from the top we have primary colors we

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.969 
from the top we have primary colors we
have<00:01:33.450> secondary<00:01:34.049> colors<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.950> have

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
have secondary colors and we have

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.280 
have secondary colors and we have
tertiary<00:01:35.520> colors<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.420> said<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
tertiary colors if I said that right and

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.499 
tertiary colors if I said that right and
those<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.340> most<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.909> colors<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.420> I'm

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
those are most of the colors I think I'm

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
those are most of the colors I think I'm
missing<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.840> few<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> top<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:40.799> just

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
missing a few on the top there just

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
missing a few on the top there just
thought<00:01:41.220> it'd<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:41.369> decorative<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:42.990> didn't
