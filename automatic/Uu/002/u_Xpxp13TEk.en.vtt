shape so that you have an open air space

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.829 
shape so that you have an open air space
in<00:00:55.339> the<00:00:55.430> middle<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:55.939> allows<00:00:56.510> air

circulation what you don't want are any

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.960 
circulation what you don't want are any
cross<00:00:59.449> canes<00:00:59.869> or<00:01:00.170> foliage<00:01:01.010> laying<00:01:01.339> up<00:01:01.549> against

which will hold moisture and then

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.210 
which will hold moisture and then
promote<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.269> formation<00:01:05.510> of<00:01:05.990> black<00:01:06.229> spot<00:01:06.530> so

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
promote the formation of black spot so

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.710 
promote the formation of black spot so
you'll<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:07.460> want<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.880> go<00:01:08.000> in<00:01:08.180> there<00:01:08.330> any<00:01:08.570> of

those canes that are in the center of
the<00:01:10.430> rose<00:01:10.610> bush<00:01:10.909> go<00:01:11.420> in<00:01:11.630> there<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:11.900> prune

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
the rose bush go in there and prune

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.170 
the rose bush go in there and prune
those<00:01:12.350> out<00:01:12.560> down<00:01:12.830> at<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.009> base<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:13.820> that<00:01:14.060> you

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
those out down at the base so that you

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.690

the<00:01:26.000> reason<00:01:26.390> for<00:01:26.420> deadheading<00:01:27.080> is<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.620> when

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
the reason for deadheading is that when

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.760 
the reason for deadheading is that when
a<00:01:27.830> flower<00:01:28.159> or<00:01:28.580> plant<00:01:28.610> forms<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.480> flower<00:01:29.720> bud<00:01:30.050> it
