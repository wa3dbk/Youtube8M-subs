00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello dear friends in this video 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:10.400
 I will tell you how already 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:15.299
 candle some benefit from the sandbox program 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.080
 so start running grandma on running 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.439
 in starbucks and games will also end 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 it is in it and how to run games and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:30.630
 I set the startup parameters like this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.170
 Here are the options to make the game right away 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.600
 run in a window like this 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 800 by 600 I did it all saved as 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.950
 would the west go faster and no need to climb 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.100
 dota settings itself is given by dota 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.420
 uploads I will be the public share 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.800
 because my comp is not very fast and 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.670
 maybe howls even harder 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.350
 eggs I will run immediately run 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:12.740
 at the same time you see everything loaded 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.740
 now the second one is wrong 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:21.729
 so the whole thing is a dream you should not have 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:29.619
 be with the frame apparently 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.619
 The windowed parameter is not the one inserted so 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:42.439
 no, everything is correct 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:45.670
 I know okay change will come into the cavity 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:54.860
 settings and so difficult 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:58.039
 he is scared as you can see I have this 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.659
 account is friends well, not in the brow 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:05.119
 the initiative does not show it happens a 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.640
 happens all right that is appetite to you 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:17.540
 jambs if he will he shows that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:23.659
 dota easy you or another such 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.659
 here's the sky beyond simple books 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.939
 apply permission we are running 2 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:32.659
 dota 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:36.409
 sandbox 2 different account for what to us 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:39.709
 it is necessary and how, on the contrary, should 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:44.540
 pass we create from one account in 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:47.769
 Lobby if anyone will understand everything because 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.889
 no one at all is friends of the country 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:03:03.069
 okay now it's not clear all this is my joint 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:03:03.069
 or do not find the lobby and where do we run 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.010
 here does not want anything 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.640
 sometimes create some but it makes no sense 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:30.360
 we create traits with us automatically 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:34.110
 reacts here we need space 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.110
 leave it both 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:46.050
 how house how did you do i do 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:52.150
 Now we will not leave it like pen 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:04:00.720
 choose a map of the ride that is possible here 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:00.720
 no the same thing we do the same thing and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.220
 start searching for a game that is certainly not 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.160
 I know you will find what percentage of you have 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.250
 each other the same at lunch and in the very 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.940
 small for what we do it in hand 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:22.270
 and so for a start you need four friends 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.090
 which just as well make everyone go 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.229
 whole operation 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.330
 they will flop 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:33.570
 that is, each sit in one direction and their 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.760
 bots that is their account too and 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 it is desirable that they stand in the other all 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.030
 together and start just inviting something 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.780
 There are fake accounts if 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.669
 metal only after that goes 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.860
 normal buz process 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:05:00.820
 a coin, that is, a perry sheet 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.490
 I promise amulet is not necessary and start 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:08.680
 search game 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:11.410
 us finally and with each other by the way time 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.490
 the search is much reduced and the chance of being 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.169
 that it will be you and your will 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:21.800
 very big well for example i have never 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:26.379
 I would not go to the party only with my 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.940
 that is, I do not create 10 pieces a game 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:31.280
 went to a regular channel 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.970
 joined the german was barely by himself 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:40.250
 created and creating and looking for a game that is 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:45.259
 I found this immediately Patrick maximum 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:47.659
 three minutes i played i will be ed for what 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:50.000
 he will surely go with friends 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:52.250
 better because you can 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.729
 directly constantly win these 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.590
 games and the chance of getting clothes but a lot 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.719
 make sure you even I ran the trick on 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:06.430
 your computer's coins are powerful but we 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:09.229
 This work, in principle, did not lag much 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:14.090
 By the way, I donâ€™t know another feature of the chests 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:15.050
 who like it all got it give 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.379
 little topic 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:25.219
 see dota 400 without god himself not 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:28.009
 there would be about 900 thousand that is 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:33.080
 understand yes the difference I don't know is all in 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:35.029
 no order in general no matter the plan on if 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.949
 want maybe three windows behind the paths of groups 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.110
 one of these accounts will go to you 

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:48.469
 of course just take the flight to your 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:52.819
 arsenal and again functions were their 

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:54.500
 functions wrap as a gift just 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:58.740
 transfer this account 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:02.130
 whether its main 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.199
 you forgot amulets increased your chance 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:06.810
 each is exactly as much as 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:09.569
 accounts you connected 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:13.110
 if in one hyper super powerful comp htc 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:17.009
 10 windows run how to sit and I 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:22.039
 will you will be well then it will be 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:24.960
 you some kind of mark she is also a signal option 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:27.500
 in general, this is all thanks dear 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.500
 goodbye friends
