00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.700 

see<00:02:40.430> if<00:02:40.490> I<00:02:40.670> get<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.090> one<00:02:41.450> open<00:02:41.810> with<00:02:41.960> one<00:02:42.140> hand

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:55.360

so<00:02:59.750> yeah<00:02:59.930> I<00:02:59.959> guess<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.440> could<00:03:00.590> be<00:03:00.620> considered

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
so yeah I guess that could be considered

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.649 
so yeah I guess that could be considered
when<00:03:02.500> delayed<00:03:03.500> update<00:03:04.159> and<00:03:04.580> then<00:03:04.970> because<00:03:05.569> I

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
when delayed update and then because I

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:15.670 
when delayed update and then because I
have<00:03:06.010> anything<00:03:07.010> good<00:03:11.830> did<00:03:12.830> you<00:03:12.920> dig<00:03:13.099> it
