put the instant disk on in a step right
about<00:00:56.940> back<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.780> shooting<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.710> towards

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
about back here shooting back towards

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the camera to set the white balance so

the camera to set the white balance so
in<00:01:01.409> a<00:01:01.650> minute<00:01:01.920> I'll<00:01:02.040> do<00:01:02.909> this<00:01:03.089> one<00:01:03.360> more<00:01:03.629> time

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
in a minute I'll do this one more time

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.230 
in a minute I'll do this one more time
exactly<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.820> but<00:01:05.820> I'll<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
exactly the way it is but I'll do it

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.520 
exactly the way it is but I'll do it
with<00:01:06.479> setting<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.960> shooting<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.380> white

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
with setting the shooting the white

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
with setting the shooting the white
balance<00:01:07.970> towards<00:01:08.970> here<00:01:09.240> which<00:01:09.450> may<00:01:09.750> be<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
balance towards here which may be a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
balance towards here which may be a
little<00:01:10.080> tough<00:01:10.350> alright<00:01:11.310> second<00:01:11.760> tank<00:01:11.909> I'm

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
little tough alright second tank I'm

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
little tough alright second tank I'm
going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> move<00:01:12.810> over<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> little<00:01:13.140> bit

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
going to try to move over a little bit

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.969 
going to try to move over a little bit
more<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:14.390> hopefully<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> should<00:01:15.720> be

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
more of this way hopefully it should be

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
more of this way hopefully it should be
where<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.150> headlight<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.409> same<00:01:19.409> key<00:01:19.979> light

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
where the headlight is same key light

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.790 
where the headlight is same key light
here<00:01:20.460> fill<00:01:21.360> out<00:01:21.510> over<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.620> mean

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
here fill out over here I think I mean

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.620 
here fill out over here I think I mean
to<00:01:23.010> think<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.760> need<00:01:23.910> to<00:01:23.970> take<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.240> filter<00:01:24.420> off

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to think I need to take the filter off

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.110 
to think I need to take the filter off
this<00:01:24.840> moving<00:01:25.230> back<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.680> move<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> one<00:01:26.940> bag

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
this moving back here move that one bag

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.450 
this moving back here move that one bag
just<00:01:27.360> leave<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:27.540> bear<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.470> anyway<00:01:29.010> this<00:01:29.190> time

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
just leave a bear but anyway this time

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.330 
just leave a bear but anyway this time
white<00:01:30.120> balance<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.720> set<00:01:30.990> shooting<00:01:31.800> for

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
white balance was set shooting for

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.750 
white balance was set shooting for
towards<00:01:32.790> me<00:01:33.140> so<00:01:34.140> different<00:01:35.130> white<00:01:35.400> balance

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
towards me so different white balance

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.800 
towards me so different white balance
and<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:35.910> could<00:01:36.120> definitely<00:01:36.360> see<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> difference

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and I could definitely see a difference

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.980 
and I could definitely see a difference
there<00:01:37.460> see<00:01:38.460> what<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.940> what<00:01:38.970> changes<00:01:39.630> that

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
there see what see what changes that

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.110 
there see what see what changes that
makes<00:01:41.660> okay<00:01:46.280> okay<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.610> sit<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:47.970> back

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 
makes okay okay you can sit in the back

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.980 
makes okay okay you can sit in the back
I've<00:01:48.360> taken<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.550> diffuser<00:01:50.550> off<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.150> the<00:01:51.390> fill

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
I've taken the diffuser off of the fill

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.810 
I've taken the diffuser off of the fill
light<00:01:52.200> I've<00:01:52.860> moved<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.250> back<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.400> little<00:01:53.550> bit

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
light I've moved it back a little bit

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:54.980 
light I've moved it back a little bit
probably<00:01:54.060> need<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.480> be<00:01:54.720> down<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
probably need to actually be down a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.390 
probably need to actually be down a
little<00:01:55.140> bit<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.560> kind<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.830> bright<00:01:56.010> still

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
little bit it's kind of bright still

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.310 
little bit it's kind of bright still
because<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.150> bare<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.690> is<00:01:57.810> moved<00:01:58.080> back

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
because it's bare but it is moved back

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.890 
because it's bare but it is moved back
but<00:01:59.130> anyway<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.610> should<00:02:00.330> take<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> little<00:02:00.690> bit

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
but anyway the should take a little bit

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.140 
but anyway the should take a little bit
clear<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.530> back<00:02:01.680> here<00:02:02.040> coming<00:02:02.790> off<00:02:02.880> meets

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
clear off the back here coming off meets

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.690 
clear off the back here coming off meets
Phil<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> same<00:02:04.350> place<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:05.520> white

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
Phil that's the same place the white

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.380 
Phil that's the same place the white
balance<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.270> still<00:02:06.600> taken<00:02:07.819> from<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.030> cameras

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
balance is still taken from the cameras

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:20.110 
balance is still taken from the cameras
point<00:02:09.659> of<00:02:09.780> view<00:02:09.929> shooting<00:02:10.409> at<00:02:10.560> me

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.990 

all<00:02:21.120> right<00:02:22.070> I've<00:02:23.070> actually<00:02:23.280> turned<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
all right I've actually turned the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.330 
all right I've actually turned the
everything's<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.930> same<00:02:24.960> same<00:02:25.860> white<00:02:26.010> balance

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
everything's the same same white balance

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
everything's the same same white balance
from<00:02:26.520> last<00:02:26.610> time<00:02:27.770> I've<00:02:28.770> cranked<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.340> iso<00:02:30.290> so

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
from last time I've cranked the iso so

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.670 
from last time I've cranked the iso so
I'm<00:02:31.410> underexposed<00:02:32.100> by<00:02:32.310> about<00:02:32.520> two<00:02:32.820> clicks<00:02:33.680> I'm

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
I'm underexposed by about two clicks I'm

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.660 
I'm underexposed by about two clicks I'm
going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.860> see<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.190> works<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.580> little

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
going to see if this works a little

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.960 
going to see if this works a little
better<00:02:35.850> just<00:02:36.180> for<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.260> know<00:02:37.320> maybe<00:02:37.670> it's<00:02:38.670> over

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970
