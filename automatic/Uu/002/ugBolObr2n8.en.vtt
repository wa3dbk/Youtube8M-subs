00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
of the phone when use now one of the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.100 
of the phone when use now one of the
coolest<00:02:17.280> features<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.940> case<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.630> that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
coolest features of this case is that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.080 
coolest features of this case is that
they<00:02:19.230> also<00:02:19.410> include<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.160> silicon<00:02:20.610> layer<00:02:20.819> which

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
they also include a silicon layer which

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.089 
they also include a silicon layer which
you<00:02:21.330> could<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.480> install<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.470> use<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:23.010> you

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
you could also install and use if you

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.460 
you could also install and use if you
wish<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.340> have<00:02:23.700> more<00:02:24.510> drop<00:02:24.780> protection<00:02:24.900> other

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
wish to have more drop protection other

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.440 
wish to have more drop protection other
is<00:02:25.650> one<00:02:25.950> thing<00:02:26.130> to<00:02:26.190> keep<00:02:26.310> in<00:02:26.370> mind<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:27.150> is<00:02:27.209> going

is one thing to keep in mind it is going
to<00:02:27.540> give<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.780> case<00:02:27.989> a<00:02:28.260> lot<00:02:28.440> more<00:02:28.650> bulk<00:02:28.920> now

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
to give the case a lot more bulk now

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.040 
to give the case a lot more bulk now
when<00:02:29.489> comparing<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.209> defender<00:02:30.630> as<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
when comparing it to the defender as you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.710 
when comparing it to the defender as you
guys<00:02:31.230> can<00:02:31.470> see<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:32.280> silicon<00:02:32.670> layer<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.209> lot

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
guys can see the silicon layer is a lot

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.710 
guys can see the silicon layer is a lot
more<00:02:33.959> thicker<00:02:34.260> but<00:02:34.590> what's<00:02:35.010> cool<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:36.150> you

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
more thicker but what's cool is that you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.690 
more thicker but what's cool is that you
do<00:02:36.840> have<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> option<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.590> use<00:02:37.860> with<00:02:38.310> or

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
do have the option to use with or

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.759 
do have the option to use with or
without<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.540> silicon<00:02:39.930> layer<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:40.380> here<00:02:40.650> we

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
without the silicon layer now here we

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.770 
without the silicon layer now here we
have<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.130> included<00:02:41.610> belt<00:02:41.849> clip<00:02:42.060> which<00:02:42.239> is<00:02:42.450> not

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
have the included belt clip which is not

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990 
have the included belt clip which is not
all<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.110> thick<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.739> also<00:02:44.160> works<00:02:44.430> with<00:02:44.819> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
all that thick not also works with the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.970 
all that thick not also works with the
silicone<00:02:45.390> layer<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.750> stock<00:02:46.049> or<00:02:46.319> if<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.830> wish

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
silicone layer in stock or if you wish

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.710 
silicone layer in stock or if you wish
to<00:02:47.130> use<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.519> without<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.000> silicone<00:02:48.390> layer<00:02:48.569> it

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to use it without the silicone layer it

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.650 
to use it without the silicone layer it
also<00:02:48.870> works<00:02:49.410> well<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> little<00:02:50.340> loose<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:51.390> still

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
also works well a little loose but still

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.990 
also works well a little loose but still
pretty<00:02:51.870> secure<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:52.769> clipped<00:02:53.160> in<00:02:53.340> properly

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
pretty secure when clipped in properly

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.670 
pretty secure when clipped in properly
overall<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.569> really<00:02:54.780> have<00:02:55.080> no<00:02:55.260> complaints

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
overall I really have no complaints

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.170 
overall I really have no complaints
about<00:02:55.739> this<00:02:56.010> case<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.910> have<00:02:57.030> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
about this case this is going to have to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.449 
about this case this is going to have to
go<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:57.660> my<00:02:57.930> favorites<00:02:58.380> list<00:02:58.470> now<00:02:58.920> as<00:02:59.069> far<00:02:59.400> as

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
go on my favorites list now as far as

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.520 
go on my favorites list now as far as
the<00:03:00.000> silicon<00:03:00.420> layer<00:03:00.599> goes<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.170> is<00:03:01.260> going<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
the silicon layer goes it is going to
