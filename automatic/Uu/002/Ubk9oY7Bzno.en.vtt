and
heads<00:02:10.080> aren't<00:02:10.259> pointing<00:02:10.590> directly<00:02:10.739> at<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 
heads aren't pointing directly at the

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.920 
heads aren't pointing directly at the
background<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:12.209> I'm<00:02:12.299> doing<00:02:12.629> is<00:02:12.780> I'm

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
background what I'm doing is I'm

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.619 
background what I'm doing is I'm
feathering<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:13.620> lights<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:14.819> either<00:02:15.120> side<00:02:15.599> of

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
feathering the lights to either side of

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.210 
feathering the lights to either side of
the<00:02:15.930> background<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:16.620> they're<00:02:16.739> not<00:02:16.830> pointing

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the background so they're not pointing

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.949 
the background so they're not pointing
like<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.519> said<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.879> directly<00:02:18.659> to<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
background I have this this light on the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.300 
background I have this this light on the
right<00:02:21.810> side<00:02:22.049> it's<00:02:22.349> pointing<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> left

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
right side it's pointing to the left

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.089 
right side it's pointing to the left
side<00:02:23.549> of<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.780> background<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.890> left

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
side of the background and the left

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.649 
side of the background and the left
light<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.519> pointing<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> right<00:02:27.239> side<00:02:27.629> so

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
light is pointing to the right side so

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.940 
light is pointing to the right side so
they're<00:02:27.930> crossing<00:02:28.260> over<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.769> they're<00:02:28.860> going

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
they're crossing over and they're going

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
they're crossing over and they're going
to<00:02:29.069> give<00:02:29.190> us<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> nice<00:02:29.579> even<00:02:30.120> light<00:02:30.329> making<00:02:30.989> sure

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
to give us a nice even light making sure

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.220 
to give us a nice even light making sure
that<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.349> get<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> clean<00:02:32.040> white<00:02:32.519> surface<00:02:33.230> okay

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that we get a clean white surface okay

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.670 
that we get a clean white surface okay
now<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.069> have<00:02:35.430> on<00:02:35.760> this<00:02:36.120> light<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:37.500> is

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
now here we have on this light this is

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.100 
now here we have on this light this is
actually<00:02:38.040> Sinha<00:02:38.370> foil<00:02:38.700> because<00:02:39.629> like<00:02:39.870> I<00:02:39.959> said

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
actually Sinha foil because like I said

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890 
actually Sinha foil because like I said
this<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.379> bare<00:02:40.650> head<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.310> it's<00:02:41.700> it's<00:02:42.480> casting

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
this is a bare head so it's it's casting

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.460 
this is a bare head so it's it's casting
out<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.079> very<00:02:43.470> wide<00:02:44.390> area<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.450> light<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:46.319> what

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
out a very wide area of light so what

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.289 
out a very wide area of light so what
the<00:02:46.590> Sinha<00:02:46.829> foil<00:02:47.099> does<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:48.060> actually

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the Sinha foil does is it actually

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.050 
the Sinha foil does is it actually
blocks<00:02:48.810> any<00:02:49.109> spill<00:02:49.650> light<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.609> would<00:02:50.760> come

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
blocks any spill light that would come

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.050 
blocks any spill light that would come
and<00:02:51.840> hit<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.109> mall<00:02:52.410> because<00:02:53.069> these<00:02:53.280> these

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and hit the mall because these these

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.089 
and hit the mall because these these
heads<00:02:54.450> are<00:02:54.690> actually<00:02:55.049> putting<00:02:55.260> out<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.620> lot<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
heads are actually putting out a lot of

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.729 
heads are actually putting out a lot of
light<00:02:56.609> and<00:02:56.849> it's<00:02:57.209> too<00:02:57.480> bright<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:58.500> hit<00:02:58.620> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
light and it's too bright to hit the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.399 
light and it's too bright to hit the
model<00:02:59.099> so<00:02:59.340> what<00:03:00.060> these<00:03:00.269> like<00:03:00.930> I<00:03:01.019> said<00:03:01.049> what
