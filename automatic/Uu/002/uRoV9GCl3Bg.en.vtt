because<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.810> will<00:02:43.959> need<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.110> be<00:02:44.549> moderated<00:02:45.569> but

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
because it will need to be moderated but

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.800 
because it will need to be moderated but
when<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:46.959> is<00:02:47.110> approved<00:02:47.830> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.970> see<00:02:49.390> what<00:02:49.630> it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
when it is approved you can see what it

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.400 
when it is approved you can see what it
will<00:02:49.959> look<00:02:49.989> like<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.980> will<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:52.049> my<00:02:53.049> reply

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.330 
will look like you will have my reply
and<00:02:53.739> it<00:02:54.579> will<00:02:54.700> have<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.420> clickable<00:02:55.750> link<00:02:56.340> so

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
and it will have the clickable link so

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.900 
and it will have the clickable link so
that's<00:02:58.299> how<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.720> can<00:02:59.260> place<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.769> comment<00:03:00.549> on<00:03:00.850> a
