manectric I'm gonna switch out putting
the<00:00:21.270> power<00:00:21.660> turn<00:00:22.070> what's<00:00:23.070> called<00:00:23.430> sweeps

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
the power turn what's called sweeps

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.779 
the power turn what's called sweeps
laughably<00:00:24.740> straight<00:00:25.740> away<00:00:25.920> use<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.340> his<00:00:26.490> tab

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
of shadow move like superfecta move but

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.520 
of shadow move like superfecta move but
he<00:03:11.550> doesn't<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.540> again<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.780> do<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:12.990> Horace

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
he doesn't then again I do have Horace

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.190 
he doesn't then again I do have Horace
