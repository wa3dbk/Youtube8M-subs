simple<00:01:03.260> two<00:01:03.649> frets<00:01:03.890> down<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.409> after<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.560> you

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
simple two frets down and after that you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.590 
simple two frets down and after that you

to your lower east ring another step

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.980 
to your lower east ring another step
down<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:10.149> when<00:01:11.149> you<00:01:11.270> strum<00:01:11.509> the<00:01:11.600> lower<00:01:11.750> three

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
down so when you strum the lower three

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.800 
down so when you strum the lower three
strings<00:01:12.880> you're<00:01:13.880> going<00:01:14.090> to<00:01:14.149> see<00:01:14.780> power<00:01:15.050> cord

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
strings you're going to see power cord

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.969 
strings you're going to see power cord
so<00:01:17.810> what<00:01:18.110> I'm<00:01:18.200> going<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.350> do<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:18.649> it's<00:01:18.830> going

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
so what I'm going to do now it's going

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.180 
so what I'm going to do now it's going
to<00:01:19.039> play<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.250> lift<00:01:19.520> slowly<00:01:19.850> so<00:01:20.300> you<00:01:20.390> can<00:01:20.450> see

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
to play to lift slowly so you can see

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.649 
to play to lift slowly so you can see
you<00:01:22.190> know<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.369> can<00:01:22.640> get<00:01:22.759> a<00:01:22.819> more<00:01:23.119> closer<00:01:23.390> look

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659

[Music]

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.440 

that's<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.760> you<00:01:36.760> might<00:01:36.940> have<00:01:37.000> noticed<00:01:37.060> I'm

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
that's it so you might have noticed I'm

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.800 
that's it so you might have noticed I'm
using<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.750> lot<00:01:37.870> of<00:01:37.960> triplets<00:01:38.410> in<00:01:38.740> this<00:01:39.010> rift<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
using a lot of triplets in this rift and

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.020 
using a lot of triplets in this rift and
the<00:01:40.870> triplet<00:01:41.260> means<00:01:41.440> that<00:01:41.770> let's<00:01:42.730> say<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:42.880> have

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
the triplet means that let's say I have

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.470 
the triplet means that let's say I have
a<00:01:43.060> beat<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.540> this<00:01:44.550> every<00:01:45.550> beat<00:01:45.760> has<00:01:46.000> three

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
a beat like this every beat has three

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.180 
a beat like this every beat has three
notes<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.110> so<00:01:47.260> it's<00:01:47.410> one<00:01:47.620> two<00:01:47.650> three<00:01:47.800> one

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
notes in it so it's one two three one

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.120 
notes in it so it's one two three one
two<00:01:48.340> three<00:01:48.370> one<00:01:48.550> two<00:01:48.820> three<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
two three one two three you know the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.190 
two three one two three you know the
most<00:01:51.280> common<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:52.120> most<00:01:52.600> common<00:01:52.930> beat<00:01:53.050> is<00:01:53.170> like

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
most common the most common beat is like

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.270 
most common the most common beat is like
2<00:01:53.590> or<00:01:53.620> 4<00:01:54.070> so<00:01:54.190> it's<00:01:54.340> 1<00:01:54.580> 2<00:01:54.910> 1<00:01:55.540> 2<00:01:55.870> or<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.980> one

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
2 or 4 so it's 1 2 1 2 or just one

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.800 
2 or 4 so it's 1 2 1 2 or just one
people<00:01:57.670> one<00:01:57.820> people<00:01:58.090> one<00:01:58.360> people<00:01:58.540> about

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
people one people one people about

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.580 
people one people one people about
triplets<00:01:59.290> are<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.680> three<00:01:59.860> notice<00:02:00.220> 1<00:02:00.460> 2<00:02:00.640> 3<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
triplets are just three notice 1 2 3 so

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.900 
triplets are just three notice 1 2 3 so
that's<00:02:03.540> being<00:02:04.540> things<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.900> lot<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.410> strip

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
that's being things a lot in the strip

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.220 
that's being things a lot in the strip
so<00:02:06.910> I'm<00:02:07.060> going<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.300> play<00:02:07.420> really<00:02:07.720> slowly<00:02:07.960> now

starting the triplets on the Lower East
ring<00:02:16.410> just<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:26.110> my<00:02:26.320> index

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
ring just like that I use my index

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.610 
ring just like that I use my index

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.770 
finger on the fifth fret and I'm
releasing<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.450> let's<00:02:34.450> see<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.630> from

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
releasing it let's see that from

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.070 
releasing it let's see that from
beginning

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.380 

and<00:02:38.230> after<00:02:39.220> that<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.610> bought<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.240> lower

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and after that I bought the lower
