00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.080
 I believe the profession I have 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.070
 I can help many people I want 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.410
 do medicine 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.929
 It's a dream that I have since 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.119
 Little one even I want to be the one. 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.449
 manager of my own business

 I always studied in public school there. 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.960
 I started looking for more 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.690
 always a high price 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.870
 until I found what was most in mind 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.550
 only it was the weekends so it was 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.180
 a well summarized thing 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.940
 I would wake up until 3 o'clock in the morning then 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 It has always been very difficult to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 to school but I learned that you have 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.520
 to chase after the others in gaza if 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.120
 You really want to be someone in life. 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.700
 is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.540
 Look at the period to get here. 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.119
 complicated 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.430
 I always put goals in my 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 life to fulfill these goals and I had 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.020
 to go through many things had to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.140
 work for mexico day had to 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.660
 captures lots had to do carpets 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.330
 early afternoon the old college 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.820
 adapted so I had to run behind 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.520
 knowing that it was my duty of mine 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.040
 duty to seek the best for me 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.040

 the geek's mission is to lead learning 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.700
 customized for everyone starting from 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.160
 principle that everyone can learn 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.610
 anything is for us to achieve 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.720
 meet with every person learns and there 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.490
 customize the curriculum for 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.200
 this person so that she can 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.420
 understand that she has 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.320
 talent she has potential 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.490
 simply the way she learns a 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.290
 different way 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.630
 it is not as if each student had a 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.340
 tutor for millions of 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.850
 people everyone at the same time now 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.250
 is a facilitator so that he can 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.340
 get closer to college and it's like 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.550
 if you were a virtual teacher 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.920
 multiplier to all students at the same time. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.780
 time the world's deadline has decided to enter 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.570
 and stay here I want to stay in a hospital 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.380
 who knew the checchin platform 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.260
 totally different from what I had 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:36.160
 seen they take cell phone has an hour 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.650
 checked had some steaks a few videos 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.690
 pictures so look I saw with what I told you 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.610
 I was then in the test with a sensation 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 so they succeeded were they action 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.650
 people for me 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.120
 my students is not ours for sure 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.660
 are very close to the eyes of God 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.580
 through teams and then I see great 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.470
 differences overdue without the link with Kim and 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.510
 able to destroy the proof of enem yet 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.370
 will change the world, yes it is already changing 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.290
 life of many people and whether people 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.030
 are sure to be eternally grateful 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.320
 it's Wilson 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.000
 I think when a student is when 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.100
 he goes after 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.640
 There's no one to hold I grabbed the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.050
 opportunity and I went to bed and here I am 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.289
