of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> caveats<00:01:44.549> include<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> fact<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
of the caveats include the fact that

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
of the caveats include the fact that
there<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.020> no<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.259> guns<00:01:46.560> unfortunately

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
there are no more guns unfortunately

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.350 
there are no more guns unfortunately
they've<00:01:47.220> taken<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> weapons<00:01:48.090> off<00:01:48.210> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
they've taken all the weapons off of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.090 
they've taken all the weapons off of
these<00:01:48.479> not<00:01:48.990> only<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.829> just

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
these not only that but they I was just

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.499 
these not only that but they I was just
thinking<00:01:50.460> they<00:01:50.579> could<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.909> partner<00:01:51.329> with

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
thinking they could just partner with

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.160 
thinking they could just partner with
the<00:01:51.600> NRA

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the NRA

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
the NRA
and<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.860> sort<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.159> like<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.340> big

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and make this sort of like a big

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.920 
and make this sort of like a big
branding<00:01:54.030> at<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:57.450> weapons<00:01:57.750> because

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
branding at the weapons because

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.209 
branding at the weapons because
obviously<00:01:58.110> they're<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.649> take<00:01:58.860> those<00:01:59.009> off

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
obviously they're gonna take those off

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.130 
obviously they're gonna take those off
but<00:01:59.430> they<00:01:59.549> even<00:01:59.909> took<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> armor<00:02:00.719> off<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
but they even took the armor off the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.480 
but they even took the armor off the
armor<00:02:01.409> plating<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> was<00:02:01.979> on<00:02:02.100> some<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.399> these

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
armor plating that was on some of these

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.550 
armor plating that was on some of these
so<00:02:02.790> they've<00:02:03.270> really<00:02:03.540> stripped<00:02:03.869> them<00:02:04.049> down<00:02:04.290> but

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
so they've really stripped them down but

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160 
so they've really stripped them down but
they<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.520> specific<00:02:06.170> mechanical

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
they have very specific mechanical

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.979 
they have very specific mechanical
checks<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.610> these<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.209> even<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.539> metal

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
checks on these they even do metal

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.940 
checks on these they even do metal
metallurgical<00:02:10.920> oil<00:02:11.190> checks<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:11.849> you<00:02:11.910> can<00:02:12.120> see

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
metallurgical oil checks so you can see

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.949 
metallurgical oil checks so you can see
what<00:02:13.730> kind<00:02:13.879> of<00:02:13.910> shape<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.270> vehicles<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.810> and

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
what kind of shape the vehicles and and

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.030 
what kind of shape the vehicles and and
they're<00:02:15.050> gonna<00:02:15.140> continue<00:02:15.379> auctioning<00:02:15.980> off

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
they're gonna continue auctioning off

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.380 
they're gonna continue auctioning off
for<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.280> next<00:02:16.459> couple<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:16.819> years<00:02:16.879> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
for the next couple of years the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.580 
for the next couple of years the
government's<00:02:17.720> gonna<00:02:17.780> raise<00:02:17.989> about<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.230> hundred

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
government's gonna raise about a hundred

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.229 
government's gonna raise about a hundred
if<00:02:18.739> they<00:02:18.860> continue<00:02:19.220> this<00:02:19.310> average<00:02:19.640> 120

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
if they continue this average 120

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.300 
if they continue this average 120
million<00:02:20.420> dollars<00:02:20.989> with<00:02:21.440> these<00:02:21.590> sales<00:02:21.950> alone

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
million dollars with these sales alone

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.550 
million dollars with these sales alone
and<00:02:22.489> she's<00:02:22.640> got<00:02:22.760> me<00:02:22.849> thinking<00:02:23.209> what<00:02:23.390> else<00:02:24.050> can

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
and she's got me thinking what else can

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500 
and she's got me thinking what else can
they<00:02:24.709> sell<00:02:25.010> hold<00:02:25.340> on<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.519> second<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.180> said<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
they sell hold on a second you said the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.660 
they sell hold on a second you said the
auctions<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:27.230> original<00:02:27.769> ask<00:02:28.010> or<00:02:28.610> the

auctions that the original ask or the

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.280

auction<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.150> starting<00:02:29.569> bid<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.810> 10<00:02:30.050> grand

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
auction the starting bid is 10 grand

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.620 
auction the starting bid is 10 grand
they've<00:02:30.440> been<00:02:30.560> going<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.890> around<00:02:31.130> 30<00:02:31.400> 35<00:02:31.670> yeah

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
they've been going for around 30 35 yeah

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.780 
they've been going for around 30 35 yeah
30<00:02:33.170> 35<00:02:33.620> but<00:02:33.830> how<00:02:33.950> much<00:02:34.099> did<00:02:34.280> it<00:02:34.310> cost<00:02:34.430> them

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
30 35 but how much did it cost them

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.270 
30 35 but how much did it cost them
originally<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.300> make<00:02:35.480> these<00:02:35.690> suckers<00:02:36.280> well

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
originally to make these suckers well

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.890 
originally to make these suckers well
that's<00:02:37.430> a<00:02:37.489> good<00:02:37.640> question<00:02:37.700> I'm<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.269> sure<00:02:38.390> I'm

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
that's a good question I'm not sure I'm

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.660 
that's a good question I'm not sure I'm
sure<00:02:39.080> those<00:02:39.230> pup<00:02:39.470> figures<00:02:40.040> are<00:02:40.160> public<00:02:40.519> but

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
sure those pup figures are public but

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.610 
sure those pup figures are public but
I'm<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:40.880> sure<00:02:41.090> exactly<00:02:41.390> how<00:02:41.750> much<00:02:42.019> they're

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
I'm not sure exactly how much they're

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.979 
I'm not sure exactly how much they're
very<00:02:43.430> expensive<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:44.209> I<00:02:44.450> guess<00:02:44.720> if<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
very expensive and I guess if the

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.150 
very expensive and I guess if the
government's<00:02:45.410> paying<00:02:45.650> then<00:02:45.860> they're<00:02:45.980> twice

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
government's paying then they're twice

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.500 
government's paying then they're twice
as<00:02:46.220> expensive<00:02:46.430> as<00:02:46.910> they<00:02:47.060> would<00:02:47.209> have<00:02:47.299> been<00:02:47.420> to

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
as expensive as they would have been to

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.550 
as expensive as they would have been to
begin<00:02:47.750> with<00:02:47.900> right<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.170> government<00:02:48.440> feels

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
begin with right the government feels

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.530 
begin with right the government feels
like<00:02:48.709> $500<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.430> a<00:02:49.459> toilet<00:02:49.819> seat<00:02:50.000> so<00:02:50.269> I'm<00:02:50.390> sure

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
like $500 for a toilet seat so I'm sure

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.089 
like $500 for a toilet seat so I'm sure
they<00:02:50.690> were<00:02:50.750> paying<00:02:50.930> hundred<00:02:51.290> grand<00:02:51.440> for<00:02:51.530> for

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
they were paying hundred grand for for

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.430 
they were paying hundred grand for for
each<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:52.310> are<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.730> gonna<00:02:52.849> bid<00:02:53.060> on<00:02:53.180> one<00:02:53.440> no

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
each one are you gonna bid on one no

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.740 
each one are you gonna bid on one no
because<00:02:54.739> for<00:02:55.519> me<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:55.880> very<00:02:55.940> difficult<00:02:56.150> to

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
because for me it's very difficult to

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.120 
because for me it's very difficult to
imagine<00:02:56.870> going<00:02:57.470> there<00:02:57.590> you've<00:02:57.709> got<00:02:57.739> to<00:02:57.860> pay

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
imagine going there you've got to pay

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.710 
imagine going there you've got to pay
within<00:02:58.489> three<00:02:58.700> days<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.060> then<00:02:59.150> go<00:02:59.299> pick<00:02:59.450> it<00:02:59.510> up

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
within three days and then go pick it up

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.449 
within three days and then go pick it up
you<00:03:00.110> got<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.260> tow<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.470> back<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:01.040> need<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.220> really

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
you got to tow it back you need a really
