00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 this morning we will show you exemplary 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.640
 bridging technique 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.689
 very, very lucky that I sconces Koper 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.740
 multiple motocross champion 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.349
 he knows a lot about it 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:36.199
 so we start learning from this 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:39.640
 positions do not believe how much strength you can 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.670
 spend trying to overcome this log 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.350
 first we show how not to do 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.840
 so tell me an effective technique 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.790
 well here are a couple of options as true 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.450
 do and then show you the right one and 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.260
 effective technique and so right 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.260
 let's get started 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.060
 see 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.190
 as you can see the log for 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.540
 most foreigners is 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.000
 a serious obstacle to anna skype 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.130
 this is the usual caretaker reaction they 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.280
 raises the front wheel high and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.430
 lose control they don't take that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.520
 energy oil is lost here if you 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.870
 do it six seven times in a row 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.760
 having overcome so many admissions you 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:31.230
 you get tired it is tedious and inefficient 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.810
 look again loss of control 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.440
 front wheel rests and rule 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 George this up and see it stuck 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.110
 at an angle he makes a lot of extra 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.700
 body movements or it is ineffective it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.430
 joke inefficient just need to master 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.070
 one technique to use another method 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.150
 remember that experience comes with practice and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.250
 we will show you now 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.250
 the result of years of practice and Mototrial 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.950
 many will say endure is another story 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.630
 this you will see that this technique 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.820
 can be applied here and just 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.070
 try brian will show you you rate 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.950
 This technique will give ultrasound when so let's 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.410
 watch 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.900
 did you notice yes as soon as you broke the wheel 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.120
 some log costumes don't expect me 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
 give gas and this is very effective but 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.239
 at first it will be scary so he 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.220
 approaching 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:34.290
 pushes with his feet suspension bach crouching and 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.610
 pushing the suspension helps easier 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 raise the front wheel 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.510
 look again 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.130
 did you notice the wheel jumped from here to here 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.350
 to better show again 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.930
 once again watching the progress of the front 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.550
 pendants you will see in the gente goes 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.400
 up two 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.540
 in general, it's all as soon as you 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.490
 felt the gift give gas only not 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.730
 trying to do it in advance nothing 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.730
 will come out 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.320
 do it in front of obstacles 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.140
 no matter what the obstacles 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.020
 knowing this technique you can not drive 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.610
 it slowly and now we will show everything as 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:26.230
 you can not watch be careful 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:29.010
 put started handsome handsome well from our 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:33.000
 you balance two angles 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.370
 that's all see it of course 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.799
 nitration but you won't believe it 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.810
 work well done 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.970
 right if you felt two 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.980
 strike if you do it then you 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.680
 incredibly save your strength and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.560
 of course it is good that you mean 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.049
 bypass others if you want to save 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:59.299
 advantage of sorcerers need to learn 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:59.299
 identify obstruct technique cover
