00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.720
 The remaining warmth is invisible 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.010
 Her eyes were staring blankly at him standing in the rain 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.740
 Now that it's over, I walk without hesitation 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.030
 Each one has a direction for me 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.170
 Leave a person still quiet 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.020
 Remember every night still can't stop 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.900
 Lonely like someone else 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.780
 Leaving far away ... the lips of that man gave that day 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.830
 For those who forget this place 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 He wandered into memory 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.360
 Although I still know you are just the wind 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.780
 I walked to that place 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.970
 There is still one person who will follow me step by step 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.220
 When I fell in love, it was hard to forget 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.460
 How do you try to forget me? 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.440
 That gaze was no longer the love of the old days 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.640
 I quickly let go of my arm 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.200
 And the sunshine was also off in the distant sunset 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.410
 Where are you going? Where is love? 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.860
 Now he is alone with pain 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.140
 The dream of having each other is now too far away. 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.840
 I know the time will not be reversed 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.450
 I know love will never be sweet 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.660
 I know to leave you 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.140
 I can't forget 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.490
 Memories of how long we have been together 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.720
 Leave a person still quiet 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.450
 Remember every night still can't stop 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.440
 Lonely like someone else 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.980
 Leaving far away ... the lips of that man gave that day 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.140
 For those who forget this place 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.500
 He wandered into memory 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.820
 Although I still know you are just the wind 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.830
 I walked to that place 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 There is still one person who will follow me step by step 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.270
 When I fell in love, I forgot it 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.810
 How do you try to forget me? 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.630
 That gaze was no longer the love of the old days 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.800
 I quickly let go of my arm 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.320
 And the sunshine was also off in the distant sunset 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630
 Where are you going? Where is love? 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.130
 Now he is alone with pain 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 The dream of having each other is now too far away. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.510
 He forgot the time was over 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.550
 It is impossible to hold on 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.870
 Go back to the moments 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.060
 Although I still know you are just the wind 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.200
 I walked to that place 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.520
 There is still one person who will follow me step by step 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.700
 When I fell in love, it was hard to forget 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.000
 How do you try to forget me? 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 That gaze was no longer the love of the old days 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.250
 I quickly let go of my arm 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.700
 And the sunshine was also off in the distant sunset 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.880
 Where are you going? Where is love? 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.400
 Now he is alone with pain 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.700
 The dream of having each other is now too far away.
