00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
they deserve the worm and guess we just

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.109 
they deserve the worm and guess we just
have<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.170> keep<00:00:20.320> look<00:00:21.130> back<00:00:21.340> at<00:00:21.460> that<00:00:21.580> game<00:00:21.790> and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
have to keep look back at that game and

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.970 
have to keep look back at that game and
took<00:00:22.360> pointers<00:00:23.050> from<00:00:23.230> it<00:00:23.380> positives<00:00:23.830> and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
took pointers from it positives and

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.290 
took pointers from it positives and
negatives<00:00:24.400> and<00:00:24.550> then<00:00:24.670> to<00:00:24.849> flip<00:00:25.029> that<00:00:25.180> around

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
negatives and then to flip that around

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.819 
negatives and then to flip that around
when<00:00:25.570> we<00:00:25.689> win<00:00:25.840> and<00:00:25.960> play<00:00:26.050> France<00:00:26.470> so<00:00:26.680> I<00:00:26.710> think

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.829 
when we win and play France so I think

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.830 
when we win and play France so I think
the<00:00:27.009> girls<00:00:27.220> really<00:00:27.430> stepped<00:00:28.360> up<00:00:28.480> against

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
pushing us as well on camps so our camps

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.200 
pushing us as well on camps so our camps
are<00:01:35.619> very<00:01:35.799> competitive<00:01:36.100> Allan<00:01:36.909> who<00:01:37.060> else

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
are very competitive Allan who else

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.450 
are very competitive Allan who else
competition<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:38.079> pretty<00:01:38.799> competitive<00:01:39.100> and

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
competition is pretty competitive and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.130 
competition is pretty competitive and
that's<00:01:39.579> what<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.880> think<00:01:40.180> drives<00:01:40.450> us<00:01:40.659> back<00:01:40.960> home

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
that's what I think drives us back home

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.440 
that's what I think drives us back home
to<00:01:41.439> really<00:01:41.680> fight<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.789> position<00:01:43.149> to<00:01:43.299> get

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
to really fight for the position to get

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.240 
to really fight for the position to get
to<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.630> 12th<00:01:43.810> cuz<00:01:44.020> it's<00:01:44.140> not<00:01:44.259> easy<00:01:44.439> to<00:01:44.799> be<00:01:44.920> able

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
to the 12th cuz it's not easy to be able

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.859 
to the 12th cuz it's not easy to be able
to<00:01:45.340> get<00:01:45.460> selected<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:46.149> what<00:01:46.719> we're<00:01:46.840> doing

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.289 
to get selected and what we're doing
here<00:01:47.140> it's<00:01:47.770> not<00:01:47.890> an<00:01:48.009> easy<00:01:48.159> job<00:01:48.460> so<00:01:48.820> when<00:01:49.060> you<00:01:49.149> do

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299
