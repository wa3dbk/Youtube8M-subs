00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
that nice all-day multi-pitch chute one
thing<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.140> wouldn't<00:01:31.470> recommend<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
thing I wouldn't recommend it for is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
thing I wouldn't recommend it for is
extremely<00:01:33.390> steep<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.869> overhanging<00:01:34.500> climbing

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
extremely steep or overhanging climbing

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.399 
extremely steep or overhanging climbing
because<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.000> doesn't<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:37.079> turn

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
because it doesn't have that down turn

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.800 
because it doesn't have that down turn
to<00:01:37.590> really<00:01:37.829> hook<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.310> pull<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.450> need<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
to really hook and pull when you need it

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.819 
to really hook and pull when you need it
to<00:01:40.640> but<00:01:41.640> beyond<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.229> works<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:43.710> an

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
to but beyond that it really works as an

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.190 
to but beyond that it really works as an
all-around<00:01:44.399> shoe
