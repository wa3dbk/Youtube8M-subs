00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
70s and that kind of thing on the market

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.280 
70s and that kind of thing on the market
but<00:01:46.250> certainly<00:01:46.670> seems<00:01:47.210> acceptable<00:01:50.290> it's

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
but certainly seems acceptable it's

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.530 
but certainly seems acceptable it's
always<00:01:51.560> hard<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.920> image<00:01:52.310> comparisons<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.360> the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
always hard to image comparisons on the

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.150 
always hard to image comparisons on the
traitor<00:01:53.810> floor<00:01:54.200> because<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.590> lighting<00:01:54.800> sucks

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
traitor floor because the lighting sucks

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.440 
traitor floor because the lighting sucks
and<00:01:55.369> there's<00:01:55.520> not<00:01:55.700> in<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.940> really<00:01:56.180> interesting

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
and there's not in a really interesting

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.810 
and there's not in a really interesting
subject<00:01:57.229> sometimes<00:01:57.890> I'll<00:01:58.040> have<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.250> they've

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
got some trade show girl see maybe I can

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.469 
got some trade show girl see maybe I can
take<00:02:00.560> some<00:02:00.619> shots<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.190> them<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.150> want<00:02:02.330> to

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
take some shots of them but we want to

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.550 
take some shots of them but we want to
reduce<00:02:02.600> some<00:02:02.900> different<00:02:03.200> shots<00:02:03.409> of<00:02:03.530> different

reduce some different shots of different

low-light situation the high ISO would
just<00:02:21.769> ruin<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> shot<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.150> really<00:02:23.510> tried<00:02:23.690> my

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
just ruin the shot so I really tried my

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.020 
just ruin the shot so I really tried my
best<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:24.200> use<00:02:24.470> low<00:02:24.680> ISO<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.400> a<00:02:25.489> slow<00:02:25.760> shutter

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
speed and a steady hand to get these

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.250

shots<00:02:28.010> here<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.060> are<00:02:29.090> looking<00:02:29.600> just<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> take<00:02:30.230> a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
shots here we are looking just to take a

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.050 
shots here we are looking just to take a
look<00:02:30.500> at<00:02:30.620> how<00:02:30.769> that<00:02:30.830> bouquet<00:02:31.400> is<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.820> if<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
look at how that bouquet is see if you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.820 
look at how that bouquet is see if you
like<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:32.450> way<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.780> background<00:02:33.200> blur<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.650> as

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
like the way the background blur is as

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.490 
like the way the background blur is as
we<00:02:33.950> go<00:02:34.130> up<00:02:34.250> there<00:02:34.430> through<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> apertures

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
we go up there through the apertures

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.229 
we go up there through the apertures
next<00:02:36.500> up<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.739> test<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.070> love<00:02:37.310> doing<00:02:37.670> which<00:02:37.820> is<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
next up a test I love doing which is the

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.750 
next up a test I love doing which is the
black<00:02:38.480> and<00:02:38.510> white<00:02:38.840> contrast<00:02:39.110> test<00:02:39.769> they'll

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
black and white contrast test they'll

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.090 
black and white contrast test they'll
wait<00:02:41.000> open<00:02:41.360> definitely<00:02:41.989> some<00:02:42.260> color<00:02:42.590> fringing

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
wait open definitely some color fringing

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.490 
wait open definitely some color fringing
going<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.579> and<00:02:43.820> it's<00:02:44.390> certainly<00:02:45.079> not<00:02:45.140> pin

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
going on and it's certainly not pin

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.800 
going on and it's certainly not pin
sharp<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:46.459> was<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:46.850> a<00:02:46.880> decent<00:02:47.120> shutter<00:02:47.510> speed

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
sharp that was at a decent shutter speed

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.229 
sharp that was at a decent shutter speed
by<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.019> way<00:02:48.220> as<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.280> go<00:02:49.579> up<00:02:49.760> though<00:02:49.940> it's

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
by the way as we go up though it's

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.350 
by the way as we go up though it's
starting<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.079> clean<00:02:51.380> up<00:02:51.560> it<00:02:51.739> some<00:02:52.519> I'd<00:02:53.090> say

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
starting to clean up it some I'd say

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.030 
starting to clean up it some I'd say
it's<00:02:53.600> up<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.350> maybe<00:02:54.709> even<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:55.010> bit

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
it's up there and maybe even a bit

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.069 
it's up there and maybe even a bit
better<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.030> NIC<00:02:56.420> on<00:02:56.600> that<00:02:56.750> I've<00:02:56.840> used

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
better and the NIC on that I've used

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.740 
better and the NIC on that I've used
before<00:02:57.549> it's<00:02:58.549> not<00:02:58.760> gonna<00:02:58.910> be<00:02:59.209> king<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.630> the

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
before it's not gonna be king of the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.780 
before it's not gonna be king of the
hill<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.170> certainly<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.769> doing<00:03:01.070> too<00:03:01.280> bad<00:03:01.489> and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
hill but certainly not doing too bad and

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.340 
hill but certainly not doing too bad and
let's<00:03:01.970> take<00:03:02.120> another<00:03:02.420> couple<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.810> shots<00:03:03.079> here

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
let's take another couple of shots here

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.840 
let's take another couple of shots here
again<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.680> can<00:03:03.709> look<00:03:03.980> at<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.220> sharpness<00:03:04.549> and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
again you can look at the sharpness and

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.150 
again you can look at the sharpness and
the<00:03:04.910> bouquet<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.750> background<00:03:06.230> looking

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
the bouquet in the background looking

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.280 
the bouquet in the background looking
fairly<00:03:07.549> nice<00:03:07.760> nice<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.450> circular<00:03:08.959> doesn't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
fairly nice nice and circular doesn't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.810 
fairly nice nice and circular doesn't
seem<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> be<00:03:09.709> onion<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.220> going<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.610> either

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
seem to be onion in going on either

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.100 
seem to be onion in going on either
which<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:11.209> did<00:03:11.390> see<00:03:11.600> in<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.900> new<00:03:12.079> Canon<00:03:13.090> 1124
