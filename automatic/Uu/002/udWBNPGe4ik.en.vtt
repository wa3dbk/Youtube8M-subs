00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.990
 you have to go to Uruguay for a question 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.500
 that he had a photographic exhibition already 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.050
 In uruguay 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.150
 and the belt was a little loose 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.770
 papers then it was already in the chaco and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.270
 he calls it a town called police and 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.189
 asked if they find out if I'm going to 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.110
 have this problem on the border to see 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.110
 if they are going to retain me, what if I 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.890
 If I was held by the finite, I would die 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:39.160
 so white and at 15 minutes I 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 call me something arrives you can go up 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.670
 the houses 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.370
 and there I came up with the skinny one 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.620
 come when his friends had gone through 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.510
 the chaco where I live 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.989
 and well I called him in the morning he was like 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.640
 crazy because I was with him 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.649
 it was not Uruguay anymore but it was alaska 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.409
 and took us the boss lacoste animal of 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.690
 until making a circuit and he answers me 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.090
 do something I'm happy this morning 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.970
 that I already knew that the flank was 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.010
 in the ideal companion so and good in 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.440
 flaquita we started the trip and well there 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.900
 we started to prepare but all the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.310
 mechanical things once and uruguay I started it 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.020
 to know a little bit more finite 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.940
 we mechanics did not know where 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.430
 was the battery but good in that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.800
 moment we did not know anything in the 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.780
 first to leave because obviously 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.240
 we were going to go out by brásil and 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.790
 we end up going through Chile and not 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.570
 we did not even have a map or anything 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.270
 this silver we had very little we were going to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.520
 those that supposedly 23,000 kilometers 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.630
 we ended up saying more than 60,000 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.250
 Kirchner 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.990
 now I'm going back and I 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.110
 We started slowly got it going 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.020
 slowly and we are over 70 and the subject 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.159
 of the trip is the daily life every day 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.109
 The nice thing about traveling is 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.750
 is that every day are different 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.590
 especially on such a good trip and that 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.590
 we put in front 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.250
 19 months we left on January 26, 2013 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.140
 and we arrived 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 we come to lage I think the first 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.160
 days of yes for the summer the first of 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.180
 July that was the ideal date and the truth 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.150
 that we had a spectacular time 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.920
 because if not in alaska for example july 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.710
 that it's full summer would be full summer 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 from there the days never end not 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.520
 darken you have a sunset that sets 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:43.830
 the sun three hours but it never darkens 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.080
 but it clarifies and not only was driving 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.920
 at 4 in the morning and it was di 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.920
 practically daytime 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.170
 and the impressive people indeed 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.720
 we travel thanks to the people with us 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.330
 in Colombia in Cartagena we had to 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 cross the famous Darien plug that is 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.720
 where it is very complicated because it does not 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.770
 You have a highway, there is the guerrilla 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.960
 between panama between colombia and panama 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.690
 that we had to send the car in a 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.340
 container so well there starting to 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.440
 find out how we did in 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.440
 cartagena iago very little money 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.190
 and well first, well, we made ourselves 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.680
 by customs broker 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.480
 we climb it to the finite with two more cars in 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.910
 a container how do we get two auto 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.880
 more boys 11 guys who are here from 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:38.570
 Perez traveling in a citroën 13 ve 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.790
 that are baco and mica that we met 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.350
 there to cross and then this one 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.450
 Dutchman who was traveling in a Toyota that 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.800
 It would also stop parallel here as well 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.110
 that we upload all three cars in a 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.760
 container did not come out much cheaper 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.180
 because obviously we were not going to 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.410
 to pay and that's where we came up with 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.040
 We thought we made good plan 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.770
 to go live so in fact people 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.330
 he also helped us a lot because there 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.600
 in Cartagena brings us on board the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.850
 restaurants brought us good food before 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.800
 I can tell you that if they are in Peru, 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.510
 people did not stay we had created a 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.660
 website and people followed us 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.500
 quite and he told us good if they pass by 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.989
 It's next to it 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.910
 I give them shelter I give food 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.270
 count on me for whatever and good 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.220
 and so we went until we reached Colombia and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.890
 we made this decal with the page 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.510
 our people this one was approaching us 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.700
 We told him about our trip and we 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.640
 They were giving us abandoned 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.900
 from 10 cents to a guy I do not say a thousand 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.230
 dollars so that gives you an idea the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.230
 chicken 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.270
 and what happens that he calls a lot 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.819
 attention we left without giving us 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.979
 mind that we did not do it on purpose 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.960
 that was the car that had very more in 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.909
 other countries where practically no 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.370
 practically nothing there is no fitito alchemy 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:57.080
 nothing does not exist so to give you 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.370
 an idea in Miami I remember 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.430
 we stopped the car and parked a 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.469
 lamborghini again cable next 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.569
 our that came to take a mother photo 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.310
 fried and people looked more at the end and 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.060
 touch her watch her die and I 'm not saying 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.060
 really
