00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello very good to all and all how are you 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:09.330
 how are you will be welcome 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.330
 boxing 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.610
 there are four with the addition 4 this 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.180
 comes 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.349
 the console next to the web game two 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.029
 young people that has brought enough controversy 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.270
 since much has been said since 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.000
 presented at e3 last year if not 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:33.620
 they saw incredible images and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.780
 then the next one that is god 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.370
 the descent of the graph was tremendous 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 people realized he said 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.399
 can not keep counting more or less 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.399
 everything while I could watching 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.430
 maybe you ask me why all cooked 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.430
 for playstation 4 for here 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:06.720
 well 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.140
 I heard that playstation 4 took him out 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.369
 the best performance to the video game if not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.970
 I remember badly at 1080 for 60 frames frames 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.340
 per second 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.550
 thing that the xbox one I do not know if it ran 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 same as what ran in minor 901 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.130
 well I'm sure the truth is I'm not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.190
 I have got into these controversies that have 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.530
 done more than anything because with the theme of 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.450
 removals is that I've barely looked at things 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.390
 online but according to what they have told me 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.660
 colleagues that is better this game is better 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.880
 run better on playstation 4 and apart 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 in my videogame store as they did 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.000
 they have games and many sides 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:52.950
 they made a complete offer 614 in which 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.810
 you could finance 20 euros for 20 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.290
 months so I said this is my 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.400
 opportunity I'm going to buy 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.140
 it's four because with this pair of watts 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.750
 two 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.580
 and so we see that the forum is not worth seeing 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.670
 I will not show why 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.140
 this is not comfortable I had not planned 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.069
 It's like my old house 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.630
 but let's see what contains us more or 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:27.090
 less what this pack contains for the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.080
 console obviously the game white sox 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.800
 with 60 exclusive minutes of an edition 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.750
 exclusive large is 314 will not grow on 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.300
 game so I 've seen images 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.720
 videos and more 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.900
 it's a pretty curious sandbox I think 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.900
 what 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:53.120
 will try to shade gta 5 besides that 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.610
 apart from seeing it very gta also the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.950
 movement of the boy or even many 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.470
 things remind me of assassin's creed no 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.200
 if you exist in agreement with me but it is the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.420
 point of view that I see is worth then 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.350
 here we have control of the command of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.560
 play is a 4 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.020
 I had already picked up because a colleague a 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.220
 friend is cooking stefano and went to his 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.930
 home to try it and the truth is that if 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.600
 take time when you apply salt 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.069
 Well, it will not be too new for you 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.760
 feel it 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.610
 as you can see 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.460
 let's make a small comparison 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.819
 so you can see what is more or less what 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:44.109
 same 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:46.859
 but xbox 360 is perfect as it would have 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.859
 what to go 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.730
 and plastics 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.840
 things that we never read I do not know why 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.520
 but I'm going to leave it here just in case 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.550
 manual 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.390
 phone nothing 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.940
 instructions welcome to the world 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.190
 quiet playstation are not new anymore 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.160
 I've been around the world for years 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.139
 christie's jones thanks here we have 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.219
 the cables 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.219
 power cord 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.060
 then we have a mini set 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.750
 well we will try it to see how it is 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.750
 listen out 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:41.980
 USB cable to charge the remote 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.100
 and as not the hdmi to see the games in 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.100
 hd 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.360
 and now far larger 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.370
 here is 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.900
 mother 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.900
 Y 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.130
 there is no difference at all with an X 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.130
 mutual this is very fine you know 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.050
 here 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.750
 well, I think so 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:33.920
 the restriction logo here 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.100
 and tomÃ¡s are here that you can 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.100
 associate 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.849
 sun logo 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:48.950
 USB inputs s input button 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:52.180
 power button yesterday and we 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.180
 little more boys and girls 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.400
 the exit is left behind against 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:01.520
 power optical cable hd sound 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.690
 auxiliary milan and little more than 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.690
 just be in boxing 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:11.999
 and nothing else to know what is good for 

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:15.960
 that you know that I am already completely and 

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:18.889
 I can focus a little more 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.889
 good 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:35.669
 the xbox 360 and playstation3 and now 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:39.160
 will be this lady through where 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:42.460
 I'll put it somewhere but good 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.470
 the white sox gameplay will surely 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.810
 bring the campaign already directly in 

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.650
 question of the week that I had a 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:53.560
 little to the game already extracted the ex play 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:55.300
 from white sox to see how is the 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.970
 campaign will also try a multiplayer 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.030
 like nothing else, guys and girls, I hope 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.680
 that has been liked so that you have 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.350
 help and in the bunch we see the 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:08.170
 next one always depreciated a 4 of 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:09.440
 large examples pointed out three flaws of 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.590
 all 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.870
 gameplays of everything go so nothing we 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.870
 we see in the videos and goodbye
