favorite weapons the 50 Cal vmat2 a 3

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.099 
favorite weapons the 50 Cal vmat2 a 3
and<00:00:25.800> while<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> would<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.150> easy<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.510> select<00:00:27.840> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and while it would be easy to select the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
and while it would be easy to select the
50<00:00:28.439> Cal<00:00:28.650> because<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> an<00:00:29.640> absolute

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
50 Cal because and it is an absolute

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.720 
50 Cal because and it is an absolute
powerhouse<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.019> absolute<00:00:31.619> beast<00:00:31.859> and<00:00:32.250> it

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
powerhouse and so absolute beast and it

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.520 
powerhouse and so absolute beast and it
would<00:00:32.850> probably<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.329> everyone's<00:00:33.870> obvious

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
would probably be everyone's obvious

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
would probably be everyone's obvious
choice<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> 50<00:00:36.360> Cal<00:00:36.540> at<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> end

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
choice because it is a 50 Cal at the end

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.869 
choice because it is a 50 Cal at the end

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
favorite weapon is out of the beta so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.450 
favorite weapon is out of the beta so
far<00:00:51.059> now<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:52.020> thing<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.190> weapons

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
far now the thing is about the weapons

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.790 
far now the thing is about the weapons
is<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.719> damage<00:00:55.079> output<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.739> been

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
is that the damage output has been

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.060 
is that the damage output has been
increased<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.699> all<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.149> them<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.289> way<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
increased for all of them so the way the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
increased for all of them so the way the
game<00:00:59.100> plays<00:00:59.340> out<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.120> totally<00:01:00.660> different<00:01:00.840> from

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
game plays out is totally different from

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.160 
game plays out is totally different from
battlefield<00:01:01.920> 3<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.940> weapons<00:01:03.270> with<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> really

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
battlefield 3 so weapons with a really

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
battlefield 3 so weapons with a really
high<00:01:04.350> rate<00:01:04.619> of<00:01:04.650> fire<00:01:04.799> like<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.580> mx4<00:01:06.119> really<00:01:07.110> do

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
high rate of fire like the mx4 really do

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.020 
high rate of fire like the mx4 really do
well<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.890> that's<00:01:08.040> why<00:01:08.310> I'm<00:01:08.400> enjoying<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
well and that's why I'm enjoying it so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.929 
well and that's why I'm enjoying it so
much<00:01:09.360> now<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.650> MX<00:01:11.010> war<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> first<00:01:11.700> weapon

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
much now the MX war is the first weapon

you unlock from the engineer kit and I'm

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.820 
you unlock from the engineer kit and I'm
really<00:01:15.420> surprised<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.170> people<00:01:16.200> aren't

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
really surprised more people aren't

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.039 
really surprised more people aren't
using<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> kind<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.970> feel<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.210> I've<00:01:18.540> found<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
using I kind of feel like I've found the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
using I kind of feel like I've found the
diamond<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.680> rough<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.820> first<00:01:21.000> thing

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
diamond in the rough and the first thing

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.240 
diamond in the rough and the first thing
I<00:01:21.299> thought<00:01:21.479> when<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> used<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:23.040> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I thought when I used it was this is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
I thought when I used it was this is
awfully<00:01:23.880> lot<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.299> lot<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.990> mtar<00:01:25.350> back<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
awfully lot a lot like the mtar back in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.190 
awfully lot a lot like the mtar back in
battlefield<00:01:26.220> 3<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.939> if<00:01:27.570> you've<00:01:27.720> played<00:01:27.869> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
battlefield 3 and if you've played the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.560 
battlefield 3 and if you've played the
if<00:01:29.130> you've<00:01:29.340> used<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.880> mtar<00:01:30.210> back<00:01:30.420> in

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
if you've used the mtar back in

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.230 
if you've used the mtar back in
battlefield<00:01:30.990> 3<00:01:31.110> you'll<00:01:31.890> know<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
battlefield 3 you'll know that it was a

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.120 
battlefield 3 you'll know that it was a
really<00:01:33.689> good<00:01:33.869> weapon<00:01:34.170> at<00:01:34.259> close<00:01:34.439> range<00:01:34.740> due<00:01:34.979> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
really good weapon at close range due to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.609 
really good weapon at close range due to
its<00:01:35.280> 900<00:01:35.970> rounds<00:01:36.119> per<00:01:36.420> minute<00:01:36.540> medium<00:01:37.380> range

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
its 900 rounds per minute medium range

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.190 
its 900 rounds per minute medium range
it<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.009> very<00:01:38.369> very<00:01:38.579> viable<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.360> long-range

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
it was very very viable and long-range

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.109 
it was very very viable and long-range
you<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.740> had<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.920> microburst<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.939> did

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
you kind of had to microburst but it did

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.649 
you kind of had to microburst but it did
sway<00:01:42.540> and<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.430> left<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:45.180> like<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> left

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
sway and to like a left to like a left

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.480 
sway and to like a left to like a left
angle<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.320> was<00:01:46.530> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> bad<00:01:47.009> long-range

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
angle so it was kind of bad long-range

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.490 
angle so it was kind of bad long-range
be<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:47.880> smoke<00:01:48.240> robust<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> job<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
be could smoke robust and do the job and

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.130 
be could smoke robust and do the job and
arguably<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> best<00:01:51.689> weapons

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
arguably it was one of the best weapons

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
arguably it was one of the best weapons
in<00:01:52.320> battlefield<00:01:53.070> 3<00:01:53.189> definitely<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.299> best

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
in battlefield 3 definitely the best

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.270 
in battlefield 3 definitely the best
weapon<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> engineer<00:01:55.560> kit<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> I

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
weapon out of the engineer kit and I

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.639 
weapon out of the engineer kit and I
feel<00:01:56.579> like<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.810> battlefield<00:01:58.350> 4

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
feel like this is the battlefield 4

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.179 
feel like this is the battlefield 4
version<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.299> mtar<00:02:00.840> it's<00:02:01.409> pretty<00:02:01.770> obvious

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
version of the mtar it's pretty obvious

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.429 
version of the mtar it's pretty obvious
for<00:02:02.460> me<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.729> say<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.240> now<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
for me to say right now that it's the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.260 
for me to say right now that it's the
ultimate<00:02:04.619> weapon<00:02:05.310> considering<00:02:05.909> its<00:02:06.030> only

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
ultimate weapon considering its only

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.900 
ultimate weapon considering its only
competition<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.320> batter's<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.910> pp-2000

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
competition in the batter's the pp-2000

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.119 
competition in the batter's the pp-2000
and<00:02:09.030> while<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> pp-2000<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> good<00:02:10.920> weapon

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
and while the pp-2000 is a good weapon

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.640 
and while the pp-2000 is a good weapon
the<00:02:12.120> rate<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> fire<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.989> damage<00:02:13.349> model

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the rate of fire in the damage model

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.890 
the rate of fire in the damage model
just<00:02:13.770> doesn't<00:02:14.250> compare<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> end<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.660> or

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
just doesn't compare it to the end up or

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
just doesn't compare it to the end up or
open<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.560> entire<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.160> very<00:02:17.400> good<00:02:17.550> reviews<00:02:17.849> I

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
open the entire so very good reviews I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.839 
open the entire so very good reviews I
meant<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.569> save<00:02:18.750> mx4<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:20.430> doesn't<00:02:20.730> really

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
meant to save mx4 it doesn't really

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.820 
meant to save mx4 it doesn't really
compare<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> mx4<00:02:21.930> juice<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.379> rate<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> fire

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
compare to the mx4 juice or rate of fire

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.920 
compare to the mx4 juice or rate of fire
differences<00:02:23.370> damage<00:02:23.700> models<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
differences damage models but the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.140 
differences damage models but the
pp-2000<00:02:25.830> has<00:02:25.920> its<00:02:26.099> uses<00:02:26.310> as<00:02:26.640> well<00:02:26.849> but<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
pp-2000 has its uses as well but that

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.380 
pp-2000 has its uses as well but that
you<00:02:27.750> know<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.050> completely<00:02:28.530> off<00:02:28.650> topic<00:02:28.950> but

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
you know that's completely off topic but

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.630 
you know that's completely off topic but
yeah<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.870> mx4<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:32.129> good<00:02:32.280> weapon

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
yeah so the mx4 is a really good weapon

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.630 
yeah so the mx4 is a really good weapon
I'm<00:02:32.760> enjoying<00:02:33.120> it<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.450> ton<00:02:33.750> sofa<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.400> it's<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
I'm enjoying it a ton sofa and it's the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
I'm enjoying it a ton sofa and it's the
only<00:02:35.760> weapon<00:02:36.060> where<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> feel<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:37.080> can

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
only weapon where I feel like I can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.589 
only weapon where I feel like I can
consistently<00:02:38.099> really<00:02:38.580> do<00:02:38.760> well<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:38.970> guess<00:02:39.269> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
consistently really do well I guess the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.600 
consistently really do well I guess the
sky<00:02:39.810> H<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.230> also<00:02:40.590> one<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.800> those<00:02:40.980> weapons<00:02:41.220> but

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
sky H is also one of those weapons but

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.369 
sky H is also one of those weapons but
it's<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:42.150> totally<00:02:42.450> different<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.170> great

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
it's that's totally different it's great

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.350 
it's that's totally different it's great
at<00:02:43.500> long<00:02:43.980> range<00:02:44.250> medium<00:02:44.760> range<00:02:44.970> at<00:02:45.120> short

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
at long range medium range at short

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.479 
at long range medium range at short
range<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:46.140> rate<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.379> fire<00:02:46.680> pretty<00:02:46.980> much<00:02:47.160> kills

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
range the rate of fire pretty much kills

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.979 
range the rate of fire pretty much kills
it<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.849> they're<00:02:48.030> total<00:02:48.390> opposites<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:48.930> that

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
it so they're total opposites in that

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.589 
it so they're total opposites in that
respect<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.099> out<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.000> better<00:02:51.209> I'd<00:02:51.390> say

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
respect but out of the better I'd say

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.830 
respect but out of the better I'd say
look<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.500> mx4<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.879> sky<00:02:54.090> HR<00:02:54.450> probably<00:02:54.720> my

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
look the mx4 and the sky HR probably my

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.890 
look the mx4 and the sky HR probably my
two<00:02:54.900> favorites<00:02:56.150> and<00:02:57.150> I<00:02:57.360> guess<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.720> two

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
two favorites and I guess for two

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.210 
two favorites and I guess for two
different<00:02:58.050> reasons<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.620> depends<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.159> kind

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
different reasons it depends what kind

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.100 
different reasons it depends what kind
of<00:02:59.519> play<00:02:59.730> style<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.209> feel<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.569> playing<00:03:00.870> but

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
of play style I feel like playing but

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.559 
of play style I feel like playing but
yeah<00:03:01.950> that's<00:03:02.159> pretty<00:03:02.340> much<00:03:02.550> that<00:03:02.849> I've<00:03:03.060> and

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
yeah that's pretty much that I've and

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.080 
yeah that's pretty much that I've and
the<00:03:03.989> thing<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.890> again<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.550> labeled

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the thing is I have again I have labeled

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.170 
the thing is I have again I have labeled
it<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.629> ultimate<00:03:06.900> weapon<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.890> mx4<00:03:08.400> and<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
it the ultimate weapon the mx4 and I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.059 
it the ultimate weapon the mx4 and I
feel<00:03:09.420> like<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.260> mean<00:03:10.440> if<00:03:10.590> you're<00:03:10.709> skilled

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
feel like it is I mean if you're skilled

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.070 
feel like it is I mean if you're skilled
enough<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.640> can<00:03:11.790> microburst<00:03:12.420> at<00:03:12.599> long<00:03:12.780> range

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
enough you can microburst at long range

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.729 
enough you can microburst at long range
take<00:03:13.500> off<00:03:13.680> your<00:03:13.830> targets<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> do<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.819> job<00:03:14.849> and

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
take off your targets and do the job and

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.259 
take off your targets and do the job and
well<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:17.040> could<00:03:17.250> say<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:17.550> know<00:03:17.790> these<00:03:18.030> pick

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
well you could say you know these pick

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.720 
well you could say you know these pick
up<00:03:18.420> weapons<00:03:18.599> like<00:03:18.959> the<00:03:19.080> US<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.069> m82<00:03:20.430> were

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
up weapons like the US and the m82 were

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.759 
up weapons like the US and the m82 were
better<00:03:20.970> they<00:03:21.629> are<00:03:21.840> better<00:03:22.080> but<00:03:22.530> you<00:03:22.739> know

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
better they are better but you know

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.290 
better they are better but you know
they're<00:03:23.099> supposed<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.580> be<00:03:23.700> overpowered

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
they're supposed to be overpowered

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.789 
they're supposed to be overpowered
they're<00:03:24.510> supposed<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.959> be<00:03:25.080> overbearing<00:03:25.530> to
