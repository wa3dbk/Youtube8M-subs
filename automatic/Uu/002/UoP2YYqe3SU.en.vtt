a lot at once and drag it over to the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.150 
a lot at once and drag it over to the
minecraft.jar<00:03:59.600> make<00:04:00.530> sure<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.770> drag<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.130> to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
minecraft.jar make sure to drag it to

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.070 
minecraft.jar make sure to drag it to
the<00:04:01.280> on<00:04:01.610> top<00:04:01.910> of<00:04:02.030> one<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.180> these<00:04:02.300> glass<00:04:02.810> files

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
the on top of one of these glass files

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.420 
the on top of one of these glass files
because<00:04:03.320> if<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.530> drag<00:04:03.740> it<00:04:03.890> on<00:04:03.980> top<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.220> one<00:04:04.400> of

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
because if you drag it on top of one of

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.090 
because if you drag it on top of one of
these<00:04:04.520> folders<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.870> highest<00:04:06.560> chances<00:04:06.860> that

these folders the highest chances that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.920 
these folders the highest chances that
it's<00:04:07.250> going<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> go<00:04:07.550> into<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.820> folder<00:04:08.120> okay<00:04:08.870> so

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
it's going to go into the folder okay so

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.930 
it's going to go into the folder okay so
I<00:04:09.350> got<00:04:09.650> in<00:04:09.770> all<00:04:09.920> these<00:04:10.130> now<00:04:10.430> it's<00:04:10.640> got<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:10.850> get
