00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
what I'd really love to point out again

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:06.050 
what I'd really love to point out again
is<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.680> the<00:05:05.040> motor<00:05:05.250> off<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.669> back<00:05:05.820> of<00:05:06.000> the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
is the the motor off the back of the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.240 
is the the motor off the back of the
boat<00:05:06.240> and<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:07.200> operation<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.890> this<00:05:08.040> whole

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
boat and the operation of this whole

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.270 
boat and the operation of this whole
thing<00:05:08.280> with<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.880> torque<00:05:09.150> ito<00:05:09.330> 4.0<00:05:10.070> here<00:05:11.070> with

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
thing with the torque ito 4.0 here with

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.330 
thing with the torque ito 4.0 here with
is<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.580> control<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.750> very<00:05:12.990> basic<00:05:13.169> but<00:05:13.620> more

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
is the control it's very basic but more

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.490 
is the control it's very basic but more
importantly<00:05:14.820> is<00:05:15.060> there's<00:05:15.630> a<00:05:15.690> readout<00:05:16.169> that's

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
importantly is there's a readout that's

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.920 
importantly is there's a readout that's
on<00:05:16.680> here<00:05:16.919> that<00:05:17.160> tells<00:05:17.430> us<00:05:17.669> how<00:05:18.180> much<00:05:18.390> time<00:05:18.720> we

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
on here that tells us how much time we

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.620 
on here that tells us how much time we
have<00:05:19.140> percentage<00:05:19.890> of<00:05:20.010> battery<00:05:20.190> life<00:05:20.580> tells<00:05:21.479> us

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
have percentage of battery life tells us

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.170 
have percentage of battery life tells us
the<00:05:21.900> speed<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.440> we're<00:05:22.620> going<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:23.640> distance

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
the speed that we're going the distance

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.210 
the speed that we're going the distance
that<00:05:24.390> we<00:05:24.450> have<00:05:24.540> in<00:05:25.110> which<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.440> operate<00:05:25.530> there's

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
that we have in which to operate there's

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.350 
that we have in which to operate there's
a<00:05:26.280> GPS<00:05:26.760> module<00:05:27.750> in<00:05:27.900> here<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.530> gives<00:05:28.740> us<00:05:29.360> the

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
a GPS module in here that gives us the

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.170 
a GPS module in here that gives us the
exact<00:05:30.660> speed<00:05:30.990> through<00:05:31.500> satellite<00:05:32.190> and<00:05:32.370> also

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
exact speed through satellite and also

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.540 
exact speed through satellite and also
the<00:05:33.390> range<00:05:33.600> in<00:05:33.840> which<00:05:33.960> we<00:05:34.169> have<00:05:34.380> now<00:05:35.070> we<00:05:35.130> had

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
the range in which we have now we had

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.430 
the range in which we have now we had
three<00:05:35.580> people<00:05:35.820> on<00:05:36.240> board<00:05:36.510> this<00:05:36.660> boat<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.110> we

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
three people on board this boat and we

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.290 
three people on board this boat and we
were<00:05:37.560> able<00:05:37.710> to<00:05:37.860> do<00:05:38.130> about<00:05:38.400> six<00:05:38.729> miles<00:05:38.910> an<00:05:39.180> hour

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
were able to do about six miles an hour

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.750 
were able to do about six miles an hour
probably<00:05:39.840> a<00:05:39.870> little<00:05:40.020> bit<00:05:40.260> better<00:05:40.520> the<00:05:41.520> sweet

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:41.760 
probably a little bit better the sweet

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:43.969 
probably a little bit better the sweet
spot<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.270> this<00:05:42.450> was<00:05:42.720> about<00:05:42.960> four<00:05:43.500> miles<00:05:43.710> an

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:43.979 
spot on this was about four miles an

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:45.110 
spot on this was about four miles an
hour<00:05:44.100> when<00:05:44.370> we<00:05:44.430> were<00:05:44.520> getting<00:05:44.790> the<00:05:44.880> most

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
hour when we were getting the most

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.150 
hour when we were getting the most
amount<00:05:45.479> of<00:05:45.660> range<00:05:45.960> out<00:05:46.320> of<00:05:46.650> this<00:05:46.800> which<00:05:47.010> was

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
amount of range out of this which was

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.150 
amount of range out of this which was
varying<00:05:47.610> about<00:05:48.000> 28<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.690> 30<00:05:48.990> miles<00:05:49.290> that<00:05:50.040> we

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
varying about 28 to 30 miles that we

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.250 
varying about 28 to 30 miles that we
could<00:05:50.340> go<00:05:50.490> on<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:50.880> full<00:05:51.150> charge<00:05:51.200> right<00:05:52.200> now

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
could go on a full charge right now

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.450 
could go on a full charge right now
we've<00:05:52.500> been<00:05:52.560> operating<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:53.070> boat<00:05:53.280> for<00:05:53.430> about

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
we've been operating this boat for about

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.520 
we've been operating this boat for about
an<00:05:53.640> hour<00:05:53.760> and<00:05:53.910> a<00:05:53.940> half<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:54.360> we<00:05:54.450> still<00:05:54.690> have<00:05:54.870> 87

an hour and a half and we still have 87

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.000 
an hour and a half and we still have 87
percent<00:05:55.890> battery<00:05:56.070> life<00:05:56.430> so<00:05:57.060> you<00:05:57.120> can<00:05:57.390> see<00:05:57.600> the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.010 
percent battery life so you can see the

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.719 
percent battery life so you can see the
opportunities<00:05:59.010> here<00:05:59.190> are<00:05:59.280> incredible<00:05:59.669> you
