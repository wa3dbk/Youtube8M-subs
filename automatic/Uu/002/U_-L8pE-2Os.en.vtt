changes<00:04:42.500> between<00:04:43.160> each<00:04:43.700> new<00:04:44.060> trailer<00:04:44.480> that

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
changes between each new trailer that

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.630 
changes between each new trailer that
they<00:04:44.690> show<00:04:44.960> you<00:04:45.020> that<00:04:45.200> you<00:04:45.920> know<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.370> was<00:04:46.610> a

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
they show you that you know it was a

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.220 
they show you that you know it was a
separate<00:04:47.000> trailer<00:04:47.270> so<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.450> warranted<00:04:47.930> being

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
separate trailer so it warranted being

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:49.720 
separate trailer so it warranted being
on<00:04:48.380> here<00:04:48.620> so<00:04:48.890> that's<00:04:49.040> all<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.460> nothing

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730
