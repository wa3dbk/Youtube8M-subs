 Tiberius but will finally be put under control sunset piping system 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.790
 20 cm the conflict between two factions again rekindled by the possibility of 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.880
 check all these resources now channeled from here on almost all 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.170
 features that have made this saga famous will disappear to leave 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.630
 place completely new game concepts 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.540
 the first 3 missions will be common for both sides will work 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:39.140
 from tutorial explaining the player the functionality of the crawler the novelty 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.790
 larger than this command &amp; conquer where the capacity of is a mobile base 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.299
 producing all the units and facilities at your disposal there are 3 types 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.970
 different colors to choose from at the beginning of every offensive battle 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.220
 defensive support with the offensive can only generate troops of 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.050
 land and will ensure the most defensive ass firepower will have the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.890
 peculiarities of allowing the player to place bunga turrets as well as life 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.660
 Infantry states while support krone will be the only one with capacity 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.190
 to fly to produce air units to activate ally upgrades 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.510
 neighbors having a mobile base radically changes the way you play guarantor 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.900
 clashes certainly a more dynamic approach 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.060
 dynamism also supported by the disappearance of any speech 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.259
 Pope welcome 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.679
 the production of new troops and instead regulator kombat forces each invited 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:28.849
 It requires. for once reached the maximum d. as available we will have to 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.589
 to wait for one of our soldiers who had cut the same tonal micheli 

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.029
 before being able to produce new ones 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.979
 hyperion however I do not go completely out of the game here and there 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.369
 there for the maps there are crystals that fortunately used 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.029
 will guarantee history malignancy believes specialty enhancements according to 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:47.229
 own photos 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.359
 during campaign missions it will only be possible to change numbers 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.509
 fixed the typology of the base times and unlike the classic rts 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:58.290
 in the event that your crawler is unfortunately not destroyed 

00:02:58.289 --> 00:03:01.540
 you will lose the game, you will not be able to simply send me another one 

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:03.429
 in the starting area 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.699
 successfully completed an objective by killing the enemies we will come 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.879
 rewarded with experience points needed to increase ours 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.019
 player level factor which will guarantee us access to all skills 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.289
 more powerful all single player modes can be used 

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.240
 multipleyer 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.310
 with the same system they will reveal closer to bhe even if they all progress of the 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.469
 night is macerated 

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.299
 command &amp; conquer 4 tiberian tuailait offers numerous possibilities to play 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.339
 multiplayer you can complete the bokutachi cooperative mode campaign 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:34.359
 directly online and used managed since yesterday 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.969
 the possibility to choose the type of class to play all 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:41.039
 game start will lead the player to seek specialize in one of these 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:45.009
 theater plows company balancing the others to get a balanced group 

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.129
 having introduced respects the basis of the radical change in the gaming system and 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:52.939
 the objectives to be reached to win a game if in almost all the rts 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.919
 victory achieved with the complete elimination of the opponent 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:59.639
 here we will find ourselves having a closer multiplayer mode 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.379
 shooters will in fact be control points scattered around the maps 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.400
 here our life had to keep possession until it reached the points 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.029
 necessary for the victory as previously mentioned at the end of each 

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:13.859
 Match 3 3 points experience scandal directly to increase your trust 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:14.769
 of player 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.769
 the event that decisively pulls multiplex matches 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:21.529
 complete the campaign that is too short compared to 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.270
 past 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.949
 in fact, in the tower seven hours with a total of 20 missions you are played 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.330
 with both factions it will only take you halfway between achieving the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.440
 fuck and so it remains devolution you have to compione sky force says against 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.440
 computer I tried the luck here instead of the ching 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.499
 as is tradition, all the intermezzo films see as protagonists 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:48.970
 actors in the flesh computerized backgrounds 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.499
 the flavor that one breathes is always the dvd one 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.589
 although this time the video quality improved markedly compared to 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:55.539
 past 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.229
 graphic detail of life instead remains on the high standards dictated 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.669
 from the old command &amp; conquer 3 but is lost both in the variety of the same 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.560
 given the lack of all naval means if the quality of the environments 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:09.349
 they see stripped of all the details in favor of a dwelling 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.809
 post-apocalyptic 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.929
 few elements have been present in these, however, manage to cause 

00:05:13.929 --> 00:05:16.080
 problems in the automatic paths of life 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.389
 doing the same to block the tight curves 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:21.210
 venice design is good and mail is up for grabs 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.069
 although I lost the recipe of the past 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:27.379
 the frantic clashes this new version start from having on screen 

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:31.099
 hundred laser tracer bullets that cross at the same time 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:35.319
 thus creating battle skipped or perhaps too chaotic in spite of this 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:38.610
 however the graphic engine is absolutely not fatigue varicose therapy 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.610
 been during our slowdown matches 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:48.460
 novara almost always brings benefits but also different risks 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.870
 completely remove the management of the construction of the base and eliminate the 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.340
 collection of resources in favor of greater dynamism could be a good one 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.030
 starting point avis and result too close type this fourth 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.159
 chapter will make even the most hardened fans turn up their noses 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:06.099
 ecomodel of koper 4 types of aqua light the player's attention is no longer 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.209
 turned towards the fortification of a safe place from which to start own 

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:12.860
 direct farm attacks at the management of a few units of a base 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.999
 mobile thus radically changing the way of playing respect 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:19.319
 in the past the fact of not having to worry about doing one's base anymore 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.150
 main 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.500
 has brought changes to the online game system files leaving 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.599
 Space mode closer shooter happiness 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:29.990
 rather than the strategists thus bringing the player to launch into the 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.749
 clashes against leveled staff instead of reasoning and waiting for time 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.999
 just to avoid baking up precious moments spent accumulating 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:39.550
 it's just sex data as it was in the past 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.770
 fortunately, not protected lost intermezzo dvds maintain the charisma they give 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.020
 always features the dbl feasts of history will amaze you with different 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.020
 twists 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.370
 interesting that the fact of being able to play co-operative campaigns 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.450
 in spite of this it is of poor duration discourse if standing 3 multiplayer that to 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:58.870
 because of network experience levels some gta dignity combinations here 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.539
 unstoppable will raise the online experience too unbalanced 

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.569
 summing up this is a product with the potential to become a 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.270
 master if only he was limited to be a command &amp; conquer than a title that 

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.449
 it retains its name on the cover but which profoundly modifies it 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:15.079
 style of play for more than doubting results
