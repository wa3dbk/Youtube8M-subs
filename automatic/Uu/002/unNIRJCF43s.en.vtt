00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone and garden us a separate good 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.509
 to the moon 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.790
 she decided to tell you how to search 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.679
 ordinary chests where you can find 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.610
 handfuls of haze over the world and a resource for 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.250
 armor upgrade 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.560
 as you know i am a small garden and not 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.640
 I can boast of much experience but I 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 love chests 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 and chests must think love me therefore 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.830
 my story will be about a few rules 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.580
 that will help you in the hunt for them 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.779
 rule number 1 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.779
 turn on some of the classics 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.039
 and 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.720
 I 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.720
 more 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.830
 rule number two on try not 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.800
 watch guides where every bit of the map 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.650
 checked on the chest as it would be useful 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.320
 but on the other hand as if not because 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.450
 chests changes place spawn memorize 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.850
 dozens of places but just no reason 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.160
 and you are more likely to grow old and die from 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.080
 boredom bye yes see these 40 minute 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.060
 video 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.369
 rule number three remember the principle 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.229
 the locations of the chests look into 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.440
 dark corners and crevices always 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.880
 check the aqueduct and you will be rewarded 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.030
 look at the buildings on the roofs 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.310
 back streets of caves and under the stairs in 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.800
 in the end to find the chest you 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.770
 must think like a chest which is high 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:47.210
 turret if i were a chest i 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.940
 visited the ledge on the roof where you can 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.830
 jump in 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.160
 place under the nose where no one will look 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:01.970
 a hundred pounds there is strange there is nothing 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:04.760
 look up over time you will start 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.820
 intuitively find chests with time 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:11.120
 this sense in an hour but rule number 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.459
 four jump carefully if you have 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.120
 There is a bounty type unstoppable where you can not 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.140
 die 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.910

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.910
