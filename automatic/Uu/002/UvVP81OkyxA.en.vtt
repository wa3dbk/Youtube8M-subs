00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.340
 physically impossible to be with 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.820
 child all day no matter how 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.919
 wanted to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.589
 but eavesdrop and spy that 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:15.629
 going on in the nursery it can of course we 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.760
 we're not talking about spy stuff but everything 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.830
 just a video is not a motorola company 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.830
 offers a variety of such devices 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 If you just say these devices 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 conventional radios improved for 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.420
 more comfortable use 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.550
 they are not such that they consist of a children's unit with 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 camera and parent from the screen they are all 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
 work on digital dect technology a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.670
 This means that the device will not be 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 intersect with wi-fi and other networks 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.050
 similar devices including 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.240
 Walkie talkies are very important that video signals 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.490
 no fully encrypted and no one else's 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.820
 will not be able to connect to them now 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.080
 let's see how our models differ and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.630
 the first thing that strikes you is the size 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.550
 The screen on the parent unit is the most 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.490
 small diagonal and a half inches in 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 mbps 21 models are enough for him 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.030
 for visual observation especially 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.710
 given the democratic cost 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 devices have vision mbp 33 and mbp 36 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.729
 screen is already much larger and more comfortable and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
 on the body of the unit there is a connector for 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.829
 connecting to a TV that's even more 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.530
 expands the possibilities of observation the most 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.719
 big screen for model m heavy 700 but 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.759
 there is an interesting feature here 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.539
 the device combines the video nurse and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.759
 and photo frame 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.320
 true screen resolution to normal 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.820
 photo frames still do not reach 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.069
 and also begs the question in 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 practicality such a parent unit is not 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.700
 very convenient to carry, unlike 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.649
 other models included with which 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 even have a clip to hang 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.429
 partly benefit from this block 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.380
 compensated remote 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.139
 control which is included 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 Interior Ministry 700 by the way video transmission 

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.869
 can be disabled if it is not needed in 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.850
 this moment 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.609
 leaving the device to work as a radio 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.289
 not on the kids block of all the videos of her 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.770
 camera installed with night function 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.600
 visions 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 so at any time of day your baby 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.740
 will be supervised and for that not 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.350
 need to leave the light on the model 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.789
 Mbp 33 and mbp 36 are equipped 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.319
 robotic cameras with 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.750
 parent unit can be controlled 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.140
 tilt and turn and it is very convenient 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.900
 especially when the baby likes to spin you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.000
 besides, they didn't see mbp 36 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.770
 possibility to enlarge the image if 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.140
 need to consider any details 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.030
 also all models except nbp 20 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.430
 supports connectivity up to 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.020
 4 cameras can be set to monitor not 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.030
 only for the babyâ€™s bed but also for 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.300
 example for playpen and other places where 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.350
 baby, you can leave yourself go to 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.630
 functionality 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.910
 there are many interesting things here too 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.280
 all this is a two-way communication with the child 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.170
 can talk quality at a distance 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.959
 sound even through several partitions 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.580
 stays perfect and if the baby is good 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.260
 falls asleep to the sound of music with 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.570
 parent unit can enable it 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.970
 everybody has this opportunity 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.470
 Visions All models are equipped and built 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.820
 temperature sensor on the baby unit 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.040
 you can always control 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.630
 temperature in the nursery and if 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.580
 the temperature will go beyond the set 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.980
 norms the device will give the corresponding 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.110
 the signal on the model of heavy 700 is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.690
 convenient organizer functions built-in 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.170
 calendar clock and alarm as we see from 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.000
 each model has its advantages 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.739
 let's summarize and say video nannies from 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.400
 motorola comfortable and easy to use 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.079
 using 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.329
 allow and not to lose sight 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.700
 infant and provide freedom 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.820
 and personal space is more adult 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.820
 for children
