00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
a look at the bravado yuga and this is a

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.219 
a look at the bravado yuga and this is a
van<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.490> has<00:01:47.700> been<00:01:47.880> transformed<00:01:48.600> into<00:01:48.689> so

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
van which has been transformed into so

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.620 
van which has been transformed into so
many<00:01:49.439> different<00:01:49.939> customizations<00:01:50.939> that<00:01:51.090> you

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
many different customizations that you

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.929 
many different customizations that you
would<00:01:51.840> no<00:01:52.140> longer<00:01:52.460> recognize<00:01:53.460> his<00:01:53.700> van<00:01:53.909> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
would no longer recognize his van and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
would no longer recognize his van and
the<00:01:54.180> reason<00:01:54.450> why<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> say<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.810> is<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the reason why I say that is because you

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.410 
the reason why I say that is because you
can<00:01:55.590> add<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> whole<00:01:55.950> new<00:01:56.009> roof<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.610> taspan<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
can add a whole new roof on taspan you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120 
can add a whole new roof on taspan you
can<00:01:57.570> add<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.960> many<00:01:58.110> other<00:01:58.350> customization<00:01:59.040> or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
can add so many other customization or

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
can add so many other customization or
features<00:01:59.579> on<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.880> van<00:02:00.119> which<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.750> couldn't

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
features on this van which you couldn't

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260

normally<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.829> on<00:02:02.040> any<00:02:02.549> other<00:02:02.729> van<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
normally get on any other van in the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
normally get on any other van in the
game<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:03.840> could<00:02:04.170> essentially<00:02:04.590> be<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.890> rare

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
game this could essentially be a rare

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.370
