test<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.000> means<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.930> zed<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
test what this means is that the zed is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
penetrates it and after one or two hits

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
penetrates it and after one or two hits
it<00:00:38.969> will<00:00:39.360> generally<00:00:39.870> kill<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.260> target<00:00:40.649> now

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it will generally kill the target now

hopefully<00:00:53.010> never<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.520> shot<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.360> is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
hopefully never get shot at but it is

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.990 
hopefully never get shot at but it is
the<00:00:54.780> most<00:00:54.899> dangerous<00:00:55.379> tank<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.610> current

penetration<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.369> very<00:01:11.820> weak<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> need<00:01:12.750> to

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
penetration is very weak so you need to

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.550 
penetration is very weak so you need to
use<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> tank<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.580> take<00:01:15.210> locations<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> try

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
now this tank is very lightly armoured

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.479 
now this tank is very lightly armoured
and<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.899> has<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.229> same<00:02:10.379> 45<00:02:10.739> millimeter<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.430> the

the bt7 we can see the t-34 which is

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.970 
the bt7 we can see the t-34 which is
probably<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.750> strongest<00:02:18.960> tank<00:02:19.500> on<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.740> test

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
probably the strongest tank on the test

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.470 
probably the strongest tank on the test
server<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.340> feel<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.670> it's<00:02:20.880> all<00:02:21.060> little

the<00:02:23.970> other<00:02:24.120> tanks<00:02:24.600> really<00:02:24.960> this<00:02:25.230> thing<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
the other tanks really this thing is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.330 
the other tanks really this thing is

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640

very well angled and the enemy tanks

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.080 
very well angled and the enemy tanks
find<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.740> very<00:02:37.950> hard<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.340> penetrate<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:39.000> it

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
find it very hard to penetrate and it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.300 
find it very hard to penetrate and it
gets<00:02:39.270> a<00:02:39.390> rather<00:02:39.630> dangerous<00:02:39.930> 76<00:02:40.920> millimeter

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
gets a rather dangerous 76 millimeter

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.650 
gets a rather dangerous 76 millimeter
gun<00:02:41.550> which<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.000> capable<00:02:42.180> of<00:02:42.480> penetrating

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
really all the tanks on the test server

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.670 
really all the tanks on the test server
next<00:02:45.330> we'll<00:02:45.570> look<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.870> Germans<00:02:46.260> we<00:02:46.530> can

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
next we'll look at the Germans we can

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.850 
next we'll look at the Germans we can
see<00:02:46.830> there's<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.160> stug<00:02:47.940> three<00:02:48.600> elves<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.320> which

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
see there's a stug three elves a which

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.920 
see there's a stug three elves a which
is<00:02:50.010> fast<00:02:50.340> very<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.180> armoured<00:02:51.480> at<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> front

ammunition its armor penetration is very

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.940 
ammunition its armor penetration is very
underwhelming<00:02:57.870> however<00:02:58.350> we<00:02:58.470> can<00:02:58.620> see<00:02:58.800> that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
underwhelming however we can see that

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.070 
underwhelming however we can see that
there<00:02:59.100> is<00:02:59.130> an<00:02:59.310> upgraded<00:02:59.790> ammo<00:03:00.480> which<00:03:00.810> is<00:03:01.050> a

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
there is an upgraded ammo which is a

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.710 
there is an upgraded ammo which is a
heat<00:03:01.410> which<00:03:01.830> gives<00:03:02.340> this<00:03:02.550> tank<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:03.030> universal

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
heat which gives this tank a universal

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.540

30 is very interesting indeed here you
can<00:05:24.120> see<00:05:24.300> it<00:05:24.449> I<00:05:24.629> have<00:05:25.050> played<00:05:25.319> this<00:05:25.469> tank<00:05:25.710> a

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
can see it I have played this tank a

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.170 
can see it I have played this tank a
couple<00:05:26.039> of<00:05:26.099> times<00:05:26.310> and<00:05:26.580> it<00:05:26.669> doesn't<00:05:26.819> have<00:05:27.150> a

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
couple of times and it doesn't have a

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.230 
couple of times and it doesn't have a

full turret Traverse its turret can only
point<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:30.960> think<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.379> within<00:05:31.589> maybe<00:05:32.370> 45

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940
