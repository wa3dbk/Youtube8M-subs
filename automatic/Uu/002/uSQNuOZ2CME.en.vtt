00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:44.519
 I do not know where I made a brief 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:55.019

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.500

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.939

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.880

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.230

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.100
 moved but it sucks but our team 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.100
 did not have the bomb 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:40.140
 I called the false testimony of a goal 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.140

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.230
 that others like this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.300
 and kill an old man that I had 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.300
 mistaken 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.970

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:52.200
 explodes in boston cab tv1 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:56.930

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:26.140
 we and this time we will not decide 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:30.580
 nothing like that I did not think I 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:36.120
 I think it was already a stronghold of smoking if 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:39.280
 front Carol and shipping coina elitism 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.440
 Our team is and but let me see more 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:46.710
 some things here all catching on 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.710
 any basic bazooka 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.500
 to err is enemy 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:09.390
 It's not going to take a guy who is but he did 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.850

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:16.190

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:20.760

 [Music] 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:35.090
 but then guys this is an ode 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.039
 so I think that if we spend another one 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.930
 service to his lap lap then have 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:51.249
