some<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.979> numbers<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.460> changing<00:01:05.729> as<00:01:06.090> we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
some of these numbers are changing as we

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
some of these numbers are changing as we
encroach<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:06.990> their<00:01:07.140> territory<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.979> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
encroach on their territory more and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.149 
encroach on their territory more and
build<00:01:08.700> homes<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.420> more<00:01:09.990> rural<00:01:10.229> regions<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
build homes in more rural regions and in

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.420 
build homes in more rural regions and in
the<00:01:11.250> hills<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.840> hiking<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.619> so

now a lot of the calls that we actually

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.039 
now a lot of the calls that we actually

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
unfortunately it can cause a lot of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.130 
unfortunately it can cause a lot of
swelling<00:01:23.460> at<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> area<00:01:24.240> where<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.900> and
