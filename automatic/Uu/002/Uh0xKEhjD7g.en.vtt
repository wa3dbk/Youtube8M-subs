up to 50 people explain why are you
developing<00:01:49.299> on<00:01:49.720> the<00:01:49.750> tegra<00:01:50.110> platform<00:01:50.470> so<00:01:51.460> with

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
developing on the tegra platform so with

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.050 
developing on the tegra platform so with
the<00:01:51.700> tegra<00:01:52.030> allows<00:01:52.300> us<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.979> accelerate<00:01:54.729> the

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
the tegra allows us to accelerate the

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.060 
the tegra allows us to accelerate the
flash<00:01:55.300> on<00:01:55.659> one<00:01:55.869> core<00:01:56.140> and<00:01:56.409> on<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> other<00:01:56.740> core

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
flash on one core and on the other core

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.200 
flash on one core and on the other core
we<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.430> accelerate<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.630> 3d<00:01:59.290> audio<00:01:59.470> plug<00:01:59.860> in

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
we can accelerate the 3d audio plug in

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.190 
we can accelerate the 3d audio plug in
excellent<00:02:01.210> how<00:02:01.360> are<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:01.540> finding<00:02:01.750> developing

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
excellent how are you finding developing

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.790 
excellent how are you finding developing
for<00:02:02.320> tegra<00:02:02.790> no<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:03.940> been<00:02:04.259> we're<00:02:05.259> still

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
for tegra no it's been we're still

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.260 
for tegra no it's been we're still
pretty<00:02:05.950> early<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.310> right<00:02:06.610> now<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.179> know

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
pretty early on right now but you know

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.960 
pretty early on right now but you know
so<00:02:07.810> far<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.140> can<00:02:08.259> see<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:08.619> good<00:02:08.970> excellent

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
so far you can see so good excellent
