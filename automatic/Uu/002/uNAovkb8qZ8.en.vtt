00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.720
let's see what all ingredienta are required for making muskmelon seeds paag.

00:00:29.512 --> 00:00:35.260
muskmelon seeds - 100 grams (1 cup)

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:39.440
sugar - 200 grams (1 cup)

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.884
ghee - 1 tbsp

00:00:45.325 --> 00:00:49.174
slightly roast muskmelon seeds.

00:00:49.447 --> 00:00:55.695
for this add 1-1.5 tsp ghee in pan

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:18.649
when ghee gets hot add muskmelon seeds into it.

00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:44.247
if seeds are coming out from pan then cover it with plate like this.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.315
stir constantly and roast.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:10.120
seeds are roasted now turn off the gas.

00:02:12.152 --> 00:02:18.386
take out seeds in a plate and prepare sugar syrup for the paag.

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:43.948
for this add sugar in a pan and add 1/3 water then sugar .i.e. for 1 cup sugar add 70-75 grams (less then 1/2 cup of water)

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.909
turn on the gas and let the sugar melt.

00:02:54.217 --> 00:03:02.546
stir after every 1-2 minutes until sugar melts.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:17.735
it takes 4-5 minutes for cooking sugar syrup after melting it completely.

00:03:20.076 --> 00:03:25.600
syrup has started boiling;keep testing it after every 1 minute.

00:03:47.963 --> 00:03:59.026
sugar syrup is ready;now add muskmelon seeds into it.

00:04:05.347 --> 00:04:06.673
turn off the gas.

00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:14.844
let the syrup remain in pan until it gets frigid and starts setting.

00:04:18.568 --> 00:04:21.814
grease a plate with some oil.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:43.539
when syrup gets frigid and seeds get coated nicely with syrup then pour the mixture in plate and set it.

00:05:00.743 --> 00:05:03.068
now we will set the mixture in a plate.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:27.324
after 1/2-1 hour cut into pieces as per your preference;paag is now ready.

00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:35.184
there is a little difference between muskmelon seeds paag and chikki.

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.018
for making chikki we caramalize the sugar whereas we prepare syrup for paag.

00:05:42.332 --> 00:05:44.293
both have different taste.

00:05:44.858 --> 00:05:56.873
cut into pieces, store in an air tight container and enjoy eating for up to 1 month.
