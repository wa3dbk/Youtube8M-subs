things<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.660> prusik<00:00:34.410> knot<00:00:34.850> etc<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
things like prusik knot etc the good is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.660 
things like prusik knot etc the good is
that<00:00:39.030> it's<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.870> cheap<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.980> readily

that it's it's cheap it's readily
available<00:00:41.989> but<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> bad<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.309> when

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
available but the bad is is that when

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.840 
available but the bad is is that when
it's<00:00:44.700> wet<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.860> gets<00:00:46.950> wet<00:00:47.219> it

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
it's wet and and when it gets wet it

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.380 
it's wet and and when it gets wet it
will<00:00:48.090> stretch<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.340> also<00:00:50.340> any<00:00:50.670> really<00:00:51.120> tight

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
will stretch and also any really tight

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.260 
will stretch and also any really tight
knots<00:00:51.719> will<00:00:51.989> swell<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:53.579> very<00:00:53.820> difficult

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
knots will swell and be very difficult

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.340 
knots will swell and be very difficult
to<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.399> middle<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:57.390> have<00:00:57.690> power

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
to get out in the middle we have power

fifty pound test this is made of spectra
I<00:01:05.189> believe<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.780> very<00:01:06.869> very<00:01:07.799> thin<00:01:08.130> line

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
I believe this is a very very thin line

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.630 
I believe this is a very very thin line
it<00:01:08.970> holds<00:01:09.240> knots<00:01:09.689> well<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:11.010> super

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
it holds knots well it's a super

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.899 
it holds knots well it's a super
lightweight<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:13.170> price<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.860> about

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
lightweight the price is about

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.590 
lightweight the price is about
oh<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:16.229> 150<00:01:16.799> 150<00:01:17.700> yards<00:01:17.970> school<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
oh it's 150 150 yards school and it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.420 
oh it's 150 150 yards school and it
works<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.380> nine<00:01:19.740> ten<00:01:20.040> cents<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
works out to be about nine ten cents a

works out to be about nine ten cents a
foot<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:23.180> it<00:01:24.180> doesn't<00:01:24.570> absorb<00:01:24.930> water<00:01:26.390> like<00:01:27.390> I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
foot the it doesn't absorb water like I

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149 
foot the it doesn't absorb water like I
said<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.869> incredibly<00:01:28.409> strong<00:01:28.710> I'm<00:01:28.920> very

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
said it's incredibly strong I'm very

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.120 
said it's incredibly strong I'm very
very<00:01:29.310> light<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.450> only<00:01:31.140> downside<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
very light the only downside to it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.450 
very light the only downside to it
really<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.770> too<00:01:34.950> thin<00:01:35.250> to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
really is is that it's it's too thin to

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.179 
really is is that it's it's too thin to
use<00:01:35.670> for<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> bear<00:01:36.659> bag<00:01:36.840> hanging<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:38.009> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
use for a bear bag hanging because it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.330 
use for a bear bag hanging because it
will<00:01:38.400> cut<00:01:38.670> into<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:39.030> tree<00:01:39.270> branch<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.340> it's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
will cut into a tree branch and it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.490 
will cut into a tree branch and it's
thin<00:01:41.579> enough<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.909> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.259> make<00:01:43.470> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thin enough that if you you make a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.270 
thin enough that if you you make a
mistake<00:01:44.000> while<00:01:45.000> you're<00:01:45.210> using<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.280> could

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
mistake while you're using it you could

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.889 
mistake while you're using it you could
slice<00:01:47.729> your<00:01:47.939> hand<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.570> cheap

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
slice your hand with it but it is cheap

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.880 
slice your hand with it but it is cheap

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.900 
spool that's shown is 180 feet which is
probably<00:02:32.870> way<00:02:33.650> more<00:02:33.680> than<00:02:34.130> most<00:02:34.340> folks<00:02:34.670> would

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
probably way more than most folks would

probably way more than most folks would

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
use the cord is thick enough you could

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:49.920 
use the cord is thick enough you could
use<00:02:38.569> it<00:02:38.720> for<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:45.230> thick<00:02:45.980> enough<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:48.670> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
use it for it's thick enough that and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.289 
use it for it's thick enough that and
the<00:02:50.930> rated<00:02:51.650> of<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.400> tensile<00:02:52.849> strength<00:02:53.150> in

the rated of the tensile strength in
this<00:02:53.420> stuff<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:53.900> nearly<00:02:54.230> six<00:02:54.500> hundred<00:02:54.560> pounds

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
this stuff is nearly six hundred pounds

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.059 
this stuff is nearly six hundred pounds
I<00:02:55.340> seriously<00:02:55.760> doubt<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.260> most<00:02:57.260> backpackers

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
I seriously doubt that most backpackers

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.660 
I seriously doubt that most backpackers
would<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:59.709> anything<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.950> would<00:03:01.099> come

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
would have anything that would come

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.949 
would have anything that would come
close<00:03:01.849> to<00:03:02.090> stressing<00:03:02.599> that<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:05.060> advantage<00:03:05.780> of

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
close to stressing that the advantage of

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.809 
close to stressing that the advantage of
course<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.440> this<00:03:06.590> spectra<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:07.549> means<00:03:07.700> it

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
course of this spectra so that means it

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.780 
course of this spectra so that means it
doesn't<00:03:08.180> stretch<00:03:08.450> doesn't<00:03:09.230> absorb<00:03:09.560> water<00:03:09.799> the

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
doesn't stretch doesn't absorb water the

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.490 
doesn't stretch doesn't absorb water the
other<00:03:10.819> advantage<00:03:11.389> is<00:03:11.480> thick<00:03:11.780> enough<00:03:11.810> that<00:03:12.350> you

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
other advantage is thick enough that you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.559 
other advantage is thick enough that you
can<00:03:12.680> tie<00:03:13.630> you<00:03:14.630> know<00:03:14.660> constricting<00:03:15.350> type<00:03:15.590> knots

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
can tie you know constricting type knots

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.309 
can tie you know constricting type knots
with<00:03:17.569> ease<00:03:18.880> the<00:03:19.880> only<00:03:20.060> disadvantage<00:03:20.450> is<00:03:21.079> is

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
with ease the only disadvantage is is

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.309 
with ease the only disadvantage is is
that<00:03:22.060> unless<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.269> happen<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.780> have<00:03:23.959> an

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
that unless you happen to have an

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.110 
that unless you happen to have an
arborist<00:03:24.680> supply<00:03:25.130> store<00:03:25.459> nearby<00:03:25.730> you're

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
arborist supply store nearby you're

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.640 
arborist supply store nearby you're
probably<00:03:26.359> gonna<00:03:26.600> have<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.989> mail<00:03:27.170> order<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
probably gonna have to mail order it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.340 
probably gonna have to mail order it
because<00:03:28.239> it's<00:03:29.239> just<00:03:29.450> not<00:03:29.569> something<00:03:30.079> you're

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
because it's just not something you're

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.550 
because it's just not something you're
gonna<00:03:30.470> find<00:03:30.799> and<00:03:31.359> sporting<00:03:32.359> goods<00:03:32.389> stores<00:03:33.170> or

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
gonna find and sporting goods stores or

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.879 
gonna find and sporting goods stores or
the<00:03:33.590> big<00:03:33.859> box<00:03:34.160> home<00:03:34.819> improvement<00:03:35.389> stores<00:03:35.889> so

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:36.889 
the big box home improvement stores so

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.300 
the big box home improvement stores so
there<00:03:37.040> you<00:03:37.160> go<00:03:37.280> folks<00:03:37.519> I'm<00:03:37.790> a<00:03:37.910> big<00:03:38.239> fan<00:03:38.600> of

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
there you go folks I'm a big fan of

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.640 
there you go folks I'm a big fan of
spectra<00:03:40.310> cordage<00:03:40.730> because<00:03:41.500> because<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.530> the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
spectra cordage because because of the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.460 
spectra cordage because because of the
strength<00:03:43.040> of<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.310> stuff<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:44.139> really<00:03:45.139> don't

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
strength of the stuff I really don't

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.150 
strength of the stuff I really don't
like<00:03:45.739> this<00:03:46.549> general-purpose<00:03:48.010> paracord

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
like this general-purpose paracord

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160 
like this general-purpose paracord
stuff<00:03:49.549> mainly<00:03:50.120> because<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.690> just<00:03:50.840> doesn't

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
stuff mainly because it just doesn't

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.470 
stuff mainly because it just doesn't
work<00:03:51.260> pretty<00:03:51.500> well<00:03:51.590> when<00:03:51.889> it's<00:03:52.010> wet<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.519> I<00:03:53.329> hope

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
work pretty well when it's wet so I hope

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.489 
work pretty well when it's wet so I hope
this<00:03:53.630> give<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.930> some<00:03:54.109> ideas<00:03:54.500> thanks<00:03:55.220> bye
