00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.090
 well yes of newstreet.it usually not 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.270
 I almost never do it but today I decided to 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:23.220
 boxing elegy optimus and le 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 7 but the second edition 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.410
 so the 7 we had already tried 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.570
 last year but this year yes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.390
 re-presents after the mobile world congress 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.320
 with the newest updated version either 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.140
 from the design point of view 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 hardware we have the phone i'm 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 opening now with you 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:51.090
 as you see all the packaging of 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.399
 when you buy it the shop is here 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.829
 here the phone later then we will go to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.539
 see better but let's see 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.519
 what else is there in the package because 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:07.860
 enough things if we can open it ok 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.140
 we find the classic guide of use the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.500
 quick which is found in every phone 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.440
 we find the microusb usb data cable 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.860
 obviously shared with the charger 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:26.420
 compact looks with usb output and finally 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.110
 earphones not in here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.920
 of excellent workmanship with standard jacks from 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.710
 3.5 mm in the package 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.930
 here it is we find the battery that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.880
 now we're going to open let's go to 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.030
 see now the amperage of the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.970
 2460 milan battery battery for now 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.100
 obviously I can't tell you currently 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:57.950
 the autonomy of this battery 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:00.890
 we remove the plastic of this lg la 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.880
 I take off with you 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.740
 ok we remove those of the display on the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.259
 plastic as you can see there are 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.590
 also the technical characteristics 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:17.450
 main to swallow here on the 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.989
 sales box 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.360
 but now we go to mount it we remove 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.640
 the back cover back cover in material e 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.650
 polycarbonate 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.030
 I must say that it has a nice texture but 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.870
 obviously it is always a material 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 plastic 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.260
 I must say that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.989
 the feedback is really good even if it is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.760
 the type of material to which they remain 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.110
 fingerprints 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:51.610
 let's go to open the back cover if I find it 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:53.200
 here it is the opening I found here 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.940
 we have in vain for that battery 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.099
 now we're going to enter it's really a 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.010
 powerful battery in the next 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:02.260
 days now we will do the heaviest tests 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.890
 to really whip it here 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.170
 we find the sim slot informed 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.260
 normal while here we find the one for 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.290
 the micro sd 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:19.599
 we close all the back cover ok 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.150
 in the meantime we light it up to see it 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.609
 also the configuration is tough 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.629
 reception on the right 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:33.609
 we could tell you the dimensions of this 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:37.629
 optimus of the 72 121.5 in height 66.6 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:39.129
 width 9.7 mm the thickness must say 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.819
 which are quite large 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.069
 contained for the put in comparison of a 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.530
 alcatel one touch eagle that has one 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.410
 really reduced thickness and I must say that 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.860
 a little bit the difference is noticeable though 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.630
 I must say that they are two excellent phones 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.260
 especially in 7 is really good in 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.280
 hand because really compact 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.280
 we select the Italian language 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.170
 ok we look for it 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.120
 here it is obviously these setups 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.570
 when you buy the phone we click 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:24.200
 up ahead 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:27.110
 we say ok let's always go ahead 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.890
 we save the settings and in the meantime 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:36.110
 I'm talking about the 4.3 inch ips display 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:38.060
 with a 480 x 800 widescreen resolution 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.790
 pixel at 217 ppi 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:46.360
 glass is a gorilla glass as you can 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.360
 see we find the optimus new motion 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.050
 custom of course from lg and this 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.150
 is l 7 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.500
 let's go and peek at them right away 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.500
 system settings 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:04.700
 we have information about the software 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.400
 we have version 4.1.2 of android 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.540
 therefore jelly bean is the version of the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.120
 base band ms m 82 25 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.470
 I'll show you his 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.750
 operation 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.050
 obviously we only opened it again 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.090
 Now I'll show you a little less here 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:29.070
 here suggestions I must say that it really is 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:32.460
 this optimus is very fluid and the 7 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.550
 in short for this boxing and everything now 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.850
 starting from today we will begin to do 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:40.760
 the tests allow just the whip 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.800
 both from a functioning point of view 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.930
 that also from the autonomy above all for 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.070
 the economy and in the coming days we will do 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.620
 even the most complete review then 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:55.700
 for this boxing and all for news.it 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.700
