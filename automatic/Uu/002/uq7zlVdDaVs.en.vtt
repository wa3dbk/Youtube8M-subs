science department today we're gonna be

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.020 
science department today we're gonna be
talking<00:00:07.529> about<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.919> theory<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.370> continental

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
talking about the theory of continental

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.390 
talking about the theory of continental
drift<00:00:09.769> before<00:00:10.769> we<00:00:10.860> actually<00:00:10.980> get<00:00:11.160> into<00:00:11.280> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
drift before we actually get into the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.980 
drift before we actually get into the
theory<00:00:11.730> got<00:00:12.120> talked<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> little<00:00:12.509> bit<00:00:12.690> about<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
theory got talked a little bit about the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.099 
theory got talked a little bit about the

continental drift well Alfred Wegener
was<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> man<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> came<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.289> idea

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
was the man that came up with this idea

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
was the man that came up with this idea
and<00:00:49.920> he<00:00:50.010> came<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.180> ludicrous<00:00:51.510> idea<00:00:51.989> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
and he came up this ludicrous idea that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.990 
and he came up this ludicrous idea that
our<00:00:52.410> continents<00:00:53.160> were<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.550> single

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
our continents were all a single

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.939 
our continents were all a single
landmass<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:54.989> called<00:00:55.230> Pangaea<00:00:55.649> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
landmass that he called Pangaea and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.639 
landmass that he called Pangaea and
supposedly<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.120> existed<00:00:57.600> about<00:00:57.780> 250

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
supposedly this existed about 250

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.430 
supposedly this existed about 250

million years ago now Vagner came up up

million years ago now Vagner came up up
came<00:01:01.680> under<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> tremendous<00:01:02.280> amount<00:01:02.670> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
came under a tremendous amount of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.179 
came under a tremendous amount of
criticism<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.799> vagner

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
criticism here and you can see vagner

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.200 
criticism here and you can see vagner
here<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.970> Pangaea<00:01:06.510> as<00:01:07.909> if<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.060> might<00:01:09.150> have

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
here with Pangaea as if it might have

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.630 
here with Pangaea as if it might have
looked<00:01:09.479> up<00:01:09.780> rock<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.320> 250<00:01:11.130> million<00:01:11.340> years

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
looked up rock to me 250 million years

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.990 
looked up rock to me 250 million years
ago<00:01:11.810> what<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.840> criticism<00:01:13.560> was<00:01:14.000> widespread

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
ago what the criticism was widespread

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.160 
ago what the criticism was widespread
because<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.080> major<00:01:16.320> problem<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.189> idea

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
because the major problem with this idea

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.810 
because the major problem with this idea
was<00:01:19.170> he<00:01:19.259> had<00:01:19.350> fact<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:20.040> he<00:01:20.369> couldn't<00:01:20.700> prove

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
was he had fact that he couldn't prove

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.999 
was he had fact that he couldn't prove
while<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> continents<00:01:21.689> moved<00:01:21.900> he<00:01:22.830> didn't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
while the continents moved he didn't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.230 
while the continents moved he didn't
know<00:01:23.070> anything<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.700> ascent<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> sphere

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
know anything about the ascent of sphere

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
know anything about the ascent of sphere
you<00:01:24.780> know<00:01:24.960> anything<00:01:25.259> about<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> convection

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
you know anything about the convection

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.100 
you know anything about the convection
cells<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.850> unfortunately<00:01:27.420> begginer<00:01:27.840> passed

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
cells and unfortunately begginer passed

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490 
cells and unfortunately begginer passed
away<00:01:28.430> well<00:01:29.430> before<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.509> idea<00:01:30.869> even<00:01:30.900> came

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
away well before this idea even came

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.219 
away well before this idea even came
into<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.950> came<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.340> existence<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.840> was<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
into it came into existence so was it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
into it came into existence so was it
well<00:01:34.439> after<00:01:34.680> world<00:01:35.100> war<00:01:35.189> ii<00:01:35.549> had<00:01:35.759> ended<00:01:36.119> that

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
well after world war ii had ended that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.020 
well after world war ii had ended that
convection<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.829> asthenosphere<00:01:38.130> gate

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
convection and the asthenosphere gate

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.999 
convection and the asthenosphere gate
became<00:01:39.360> part<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> model<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.290> continental

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
became part of the model of continental

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
Pangaea and he did a pretty good job he

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
Pangaea and he did a pretty good job he
came<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.210> with<00:01:54.360> five<00:01:54.630> pieces<00:01:54.960> let's<00:01:55.829> take<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
came up with five pieces let's take a

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.569 
came up with five pieces let's take a
look<00:01:56.250> at<00:01:56.340> each<00:01:56.430> one<00:01:58.159> begginers<00:01:59.159> first<00:01:59.430> piece

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
look at each one begginers first piece

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.660 
look at each one begginers first piece
of<00:01:59.729> evidence<00:01:59.850> is<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.659> he<00:02:00.930> focused<00:02:01.469> on

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
of evidence is that he focused on

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.859 
of evidence is that he focused on
coastlines<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.820> certain<00:02:03.149> continents<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
coastlines of certain continents and

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.359 
coastlines of certain continents and
knows<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.619> look<00:02:04.829> like<00:02:04.950> they<00:02:05.100> fit<00:02:05.340> like

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
knows that they look like they fit like

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.300 
knows that they look like they fit like
puzzle<00:02:05.820> pieces<00:02:06.000> he<00:02:06.990> specifically<00:02:07.770> focused<00:02:08.220> on

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
puzzle pieces he specifically focused on

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
puzzle pieces he specifically focused on
South<00:02:08.580> America<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.149> Africa<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.110> he<00:02:10.170> saw<00:02:10.379> that

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
South America and Africa and he saw that

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.960 
South America and Africa and he saw that
their<00:02:10.679> coastlines<00:02:11.129> look<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.640> they<00:02:11.760> fit

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
their coastlines look like they fit

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.820 
their coastlines look like they fit
together

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
together

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.670 
together
the<00:02:13.830> next<00:02:14.070> piece<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.280> evidence<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:16.260> he<00:02:16.470> spent

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
the next piece of evidence was he spent

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.440 
the next piece of evidence was he spent
some<00:02:16.830> time<00:02:17.010> looking<00:02:17.160> at<00:02:17.370> fossils<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.240> dead

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
some time looking at fossils the dead

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
some time looking at fossils the dead
plant<00:02:18.750> animal<00:02:19.140> remains<00:02:19.470> that<00:02:20.010> are<00:02:20.070> found<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
plant animal remains that are found in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.910 
plant animal remains that are found in
rocks<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.090> he<00:02:21.990> noticed<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:22.500> there<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
rocks and he noticed that there was a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.070 
rocks and he noticed that there was a
little<00:02:23.160> bit<00:02:23.310> of<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.550> pattern<00:02:23.790> here<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.930> he

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
little bit of a pattern here so he

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.030 
little bit of a pattern here so he
focused<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.710> fossil<00:02:26.040> called<00:02:26.430> meses<00:02:26.820> or

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.470 

signaled<00:02:32.040> athis<00:02:37.190> glossopteris<00:02:38.240> which<00:02:39.240> was<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
signaled athis glossopteris which was a

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:48.170 
signaled athis glossopteris which was a
plant<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:43.310> lystrosaurus<00:02:46.820> what<00:02:47.820> he<00:02:47.910> found

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
plant and lystrosaurus what he found

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.260 
plant and lystrosaurus what he found
amazed<00:02:49.050> him<00:02:51.020> what<00:02:52.020> Beckner<00:02:52.350> did<00:02:52.850> was<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:54.030> he

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
amazed him what Beckner did was that he

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.640 
amazed him what Beckner did was that he
took<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.660> contents<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.260> put<00:02:55.410> him<00:02:55.500> back

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
took the contents and put him back

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.760 
took the contents and put him back
together<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.450> noticed<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.230> fossils

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
together and noticed that the fossils

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.920 
together and noticed that the fossils
created<00:02:59.250> zones<00:02:59.610> from<00:03:00.300> continent<00:03:00.840> to

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
created zones from continent to

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.229 
created zones from continent to
continent<00:03:01.470> so<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.340> only<00:03:02.580> way<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.120> these

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
continent so the only way that these

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.570 
continent so the only way that these
animals<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.020> plants<00:03:04.560> could<00:03:05.160> have<00:03:05.250> gone<00:03:05.400> from

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
animals and plants could have gone from

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.640 
animals and plants could have gone from
content<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.090> continent<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:07.230> only<00:03:07.440> way<00:03:07.530> they

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
content to continent the only way they

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.110 
content to continent the only way they
could<00:03:07.709> have<00:03:07.830> done<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.190> is<00:03:08.489> if<00:03:08.700> they<00:03:08.820> were<00:03:08.880> all

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
could have done that is if they were all

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.449 
could have done that is if they were all
together<00:03:09.300> there's<00:03:10.020> no<00:03:10.410> way<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.430> a

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
together there's no way that a

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.040 
together there's no way that a
freshwater<00:03:11.730> reptile<00:03:12.209> would<00:03:12.690> have<00:03:12.810> been<00:03:12.900> able

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
freshwater reptile would have been able

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.530 
freshwater reptile would have been able
to<00:03:13.140> swim<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.739> Atlantic<00:03:14.520> Ocean<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.000> couple

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
to swim to the Atlantic Ocean a couple

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.780 
to swim to the Atlantic Ocean a couple
thousand<00:03:15.930> miles<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.410> between<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.280> continents

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
thousand miles in between the continents

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.670 
thousand miles in between the continents
they<00:03:18.150> had<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.570> have<00:03:18.660> been<00:03:18.720> together<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.560> them

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
they had to have been together for them

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.300 
they had to have been together for them
to<00:03:19.799> travel<00:03:20.040> from<00:03:20.370> one<00:03:20.430> location<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.269> next

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
to travel from one location to the next

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.729 
to travel from one location to the next
so<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.549> fossils<00:03:24.120> matched<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.690> in<00:03:24.900> this

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
so if the fossils matched up in this

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.310 
so if the fossils matched up in this
example<00:03:26.070> you<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.310> meses<00:03:26.670> or<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.870> fossils

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
example you have meses or if the fossils

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.050 
example you have meses or if the fossils
matched<00:03:28.500> up<00:03:28.769> then<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> rocks<00:03:29.640> must<00:03:29.910> have

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
matched up then the rocks must have

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.670 
matched up then the rocks must have
matched<00:03:30.209> up<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.810> that's<00:03:30.989> evidence<00:03:31.470> number

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
matched up and that's evidence number

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.830 
matched up and that's evidence number
three<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.000> if<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.180> take<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> look<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.720> this

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
three and if you take a look at this

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.220 
three and if you take a look at this
example<00:03:34.250> if<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.519> have<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:36.030> basaltic<00:03:36.630> lava<00:03:36.900> flow

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
example if you have a basaltic lava flow

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.949 
example if you have a basaltic lava flow
then<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> sandstone<00:03:38.640> then<00:03:39.060> a<00:03:39.090> shell<00:03:39.480> then<00:03:39.930> a

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
then a sandstone then a shell then a

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.560 
then a sandstone then a shell then a
coal<00:03:40.320> then<00:03:40.890> some<00:03:41.070> glacial<00:03:41.519> material<00:03:42.000> in<00:03:42.180> South

coal then some glacial material in South

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.259 
coal then some glacial material in South
America<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:44.130> within<00:03:44.519> those<00:03:44.730> rocks<00:03:45.000> of<00:03:45.180> my

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
America and within those rocks of my

America and within those rocks of my
fund<00:03:45.510> glossopteris<00:03:45.989> fossils<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.340> not

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
fund glossopteris fossils it's not

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.460 
fund glossopteris fossils it's not
coincidental<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.900> exact<00:03:49.260> same

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
coincidental that the exact same

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.780 
coincidental that the exact same

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
sequences can be found in africa as well

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.490 
sequences can be found in africa as well
very<00:03:53.790> simply<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.750> same<00:03:54.959> rock<00:03:55.230> layers

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
very simply it's the same rock layers

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.199 
very simply it's the same rock layers
they<00:03:55.890> just<00:03:56.070> got<00:03:56.220> broken<00:03:56.459> up<00:03:56.700> when<00:03:57.090> the

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
they just got broken up when the

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.789 
they just got broken up when the
continents<00:03:57.870> decided<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.739> split<00:03:58.950> apart

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
continents decided to split apart

okay there's a layer in the earth in the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.899 
okay there's a layer in the earth in the

clay it's a very clay like almost fluid
like<00:05:33.169> now<00:05:34.169> because<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:35.370> earth<00:05:35.520> gets<00:05:35.789> much

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
like now because the earth gets much

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.240 
like now because the earth gets much
hotter<00:05:36.360> as<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.659> go<00:05:36.810> deeper<00:05:37.229> this<00:05:37.800> is<00:05:37.950> Santa's

fear is influenced by temperature so if

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.640 
fear is influenced by temperature so if
the<00:05:41.520> temperature<00:05:42.000> changes<00:05:42.479> the<00:05:42.960> density<00:05:43.260> is

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
the temperature changes the density is

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.399 
the temperature changes the density is
going<00:05:43.860> to<00:05:43.919> change<00:05:44.190> as<00:05:44.400> well<00:05:45.020> if<00:05:46.020> you<00:05:46.140> want<00:05:46.349> to

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
going to change as well if you want to

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:48.469 
going to change as well if you want to

it spreads out okay it's gonna drag
plates<00:06:39.900> with<00:06:40.170> it<00:06:40.380> so<00:06:40.860> convection<00:06:41.520> is<00:06:41.640> can<00:06:41.760> be<00:06:41.880> a

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:41.910 
plates with it so convection is can be a

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.390 
plates with it so convection is can be a
very<00:06:42.420> very<00:06:42.690> important<00:06:43.260> concept<00:06:43.380> in<00:06:43.980> regard<00:06:44.370> to

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 
very very important concept in regard to

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.930 
very very important concept in regard to
the<00:06:44.580> plate<00:06:44.790> tectonics<00:06:46.790> okay

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:47.940 
the plate tectonics okay

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.230 
the plate tectonics okay
so<00:06:48.150> temperature<00:06:48.570> increases<00:06:49.050> with<00:06:49.200> depth<00:06:50.240> when

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 
so temperature increases with depth when

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:52.850 
so temperature increases with depth when
things<00:06:51.510> become<00:06:51.810> hot<00:06:52.050> they<00:06:52.230> become<00:06:52.470> less<00:06:52.680> dense

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
things become hot they become less dense

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.640 
things become hot they become less dense
and<00:06:53.070> rise<00:06:53.420> and<00:06:54.420> they<00:06:54.510> cool<00:06:54.780> off<00:06:54.810> they<00:06:55.410> become

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
and rise and they cool off they become

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.630 
and rise and they cool off they become
more<00:06:55.830> dense<00:06:56.040> and<00:06:56.220> sink

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:56.640 
more dense and sink

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.880 
more dense and sink
I<00:06:56.670> put<00:06:56.940> cool<00:06:57.180> in<00:06:57.420> quotation<00:06:58.050> marks<00:06:58.320> when

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
I put cool in quotation marks when

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.350 
I put cool in quotation marks when
you're<00:06:59.040> dealing<00:06:59.280> with<00:06:59.310> cooler<00:07:00.030> temperatures

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
you're dealing with cooler temperatures

you're dealing with cooler temperatures
inside<00:07:00.600> the<00:07:00.750> earth<00:07:00.960> it's<00:07:01.380> still<00:07:01.650> quite<00:07:02.100> warm

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
inside the earth it's still quite warm

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.580 
inside the earth it's still quite warm
but<00:07:02.610> not<00:07:02.790> as<00:07:03.060> warm<00:07:03.270> as<00:07:03.660> you<00:07:04.080> get<00:07:04.200> much<00:07:04.380> deeper

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:04.590 
but not as warm as you get much deeper

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.520 
but not as warm as you get much deeper
into<00:07:04.860> the<00:07:05.040> planet<00:07:05.750> again<00:07:06.750> you<00:07:07.050> there's<00:07:07.350> your

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
into the planet again you there's your

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.470 
into the planet again you there's your
convection<00:07:08.040> cells<00:07:08.310> and<00:07:08.610> what<00:07:09.150> you<00:07:09.240> want<00:07:09.420> to

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
convection cells and what you want to

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.880 
convection cells and what you want to
look<00:07:09.660> at<00:07:09.900> is<00:07:10.080> you<00:07:10.200> want<00:07:10.410> to<00:07:10.440> look<00:07:10.590> at<00:07:10.770> the

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:10.890 
look at is you want to look at the

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.010 
look at is you want to look at the
convection<00:07:11.550> currents<00:07:12.000> just<00:07:12.510> below<00:07:12.870> the
