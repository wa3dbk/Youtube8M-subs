conquest and I think that said I don't
think<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> give<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.100> company<00:00:23.250> would<00:00:23.730> focus

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.810 
think I give the company would focus
anybody<00:00:24.480> else<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:24.990> we'll<00:00:25.140> see<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
anybody else but we'll see so the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
anybody else but we'll see so the
Spriggan<00:00:27.119> moves<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.420> he<00:00:27.539> does<00:00:27.720> his<00:00:27.930> targeting

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
Spriggan moves up he does his targeting

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.230 
Spriggan moves up he does his targeting
flares<00:00:28.890> what<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.429> basically<00:00:29.609> does<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.090> it

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
flares what that basically does is it

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.790 
flares what that basically does is it
helps<00:00:30.449> ignore<00:00:30.750> stealth<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.439> all<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.650> other

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
helps ignore stealth and all the other

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.180 
helps ignore stealth and all the other
stuff<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.540> these<00:00:33.540> guys<00:00:33.780> are<00:00:33.840> stealth<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.739> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
stuff and these guys are stealth and so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
stuff and these guys are stealth and so
that's<00:00:35.670> just<00:00:35.820> their<00:00:36.090> normal<00:00:36.840> ability<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.590> then

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that's just their normal ability so then

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.840 
that's just their normal ability so then
he's<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.920> move<00:00:38.129> up<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.370> try<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:38.700> some

that's<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> nice<00:01:38.250> straight<00:01:38.579> at<00:01:38.880> seven<00:01:39.270> point

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that's a nice straight at seven point

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
that's a nice straight at seven point
jack<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.869> 12<00:01:40.110> point<00:01:40.350> definitely<00:01:41.130> like<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
jack for 12 point definitely like that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
jack for 12 point definitely like that
and<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.570> he<00:01:42.659> ignores<00:01:42.780> ignores<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> juggernaut

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
and if he ignores ignores a juggernaut

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.050 
and if he ignores ignores a juggernaut
well<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> juggernaut<00:01:44.610> can<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> whole

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
well then the juggernaut can do a whole

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
well then the juggernaut can do a whole
lot<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.299> damage<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> nice<00:01:46.710> typical

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
lot of damage so that's a nice typical

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.080 
lot of damage so that's a nice typical
strategy<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.729> use<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:47.970> your

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
strategy that you can use with your

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.300 
strategy that you can use with your
k'dor<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.509> kind<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.500> feed<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:49.979> your<00:01:50.100> jacks

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
k'dor to kind of feed one of your jacks

k'dor to kind of feed one of your jacks
and<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.549> only<00:01:50.670> problem<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.240> list<00:01:51.540> is

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and the only problem in this list is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.929 
and the only problem in this list is
that<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.740> Jack<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.610> feed

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that I only really have one Jack to feed

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.819 
that I only really have one Jack to feed
I'd<00:01:54.210> prefer<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.930> two<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:55.560> even<00:01:55.649> three

if<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.609> enter<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:20.049> still<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.739> juggernaut

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
if you enter it but still the juggernaut

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.589 
if you enter it but still the juggernaut
now<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.400> at<00:03:21.519> minus<00:03:21.669> five<00:03:22.000> armor<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.480> then

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 
now is at minus five armor and then

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.030 
now is at minus five armor and then
another<00:03:22.750> minus<00:03:23.199> two<00:03:23.349> because<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:23.859> dark

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
another minus two because of the dark

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.650 
another minus two because of the dark
shroud<00:03:24.190> from<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.639> vain<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.940> also<00:03:25.209> his<00:03:25.359> armor

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
shroud from the vain for also his armor

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.050 
shroud from the vain for also his armor
is<00:03:25.780> 13<00:03:26.379> he's<00:03:26.680> worse<00:03:26.949> than<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.250> light<00:03:27.519> war<00:03:27.760> jack

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
is 13 he's worse than a light war jack

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.030 
is 13 he's worse than a light war jack
so<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.810> banter<00:03:29.049> all<00:03:29.139> goes<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.470> there<00:03:29.590> with<00:03:29.769> his

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
so the banter all goes in there with his

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.399 
so the banter all goes in there with his
weapon<00:03:30.609> master<00:03:31.030> charge<00:03:31.359> attack<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.930> takes

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
weapon master charge attack and takes

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.710 
weapon master charge attack and takes
out<00:03:32.590> half<00:03:32.889> of<00:03:33.069> his<00:03:33.489> boxes<00:03:34.000> so<00:03:34.480> he<00:03:34.599> basically

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
out half of his boxes so he basically

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.899 
out half of his boxes so he basically
wants<00:03:35.199> to<00:03:35.260> kill<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> juggernaut<00:03:36.040> so<00:03:36.639> the

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:36.909 
wants to kill the juggernaut so the

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.789 
wants to kill the juggernaut so the
death<00:03:37.120> jack<00:03:37.449> can<00:03:37.659> charge<00:03:37.989> my<00:03:38.290> colossal

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
death jack can charge my colossal

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.140 
death jack can charge my colossal
because<00:03:39.220> he<00:03:39.310> thinks<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.609> death<00:03:39.760> jack<00:03:40.000> with

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
because he thinks the death jack with

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.819 
because he thinks the death jack with
five<00:03:40.329> focus<00:03:40.720> can<00:03:40.900> kill<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.199> colossal<00:03:41.590> in<00:03:41.680> one

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
five focus can kill the colossal in one

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.250 
five focus can kill the colossal in one
turn<00:03:42.040> and<00:03:42.220> he's<00:03:42.729> probably<00:03:43.000> right<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:44.079> bio

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
turn and he's probably right the bio

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.960 
turn and he's probably right the bio
thrall<00:03:44.560> moves<00:03:44.799> through<00:03:45.069> the<00:03:45.099> PAL<00:03:45.340> 6<00:03:45.699> and

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
thrall moves through the PAL 6 and

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.270 
thrall moves through the PAL 6 and
doesn't<00:03:46.510> take<00:03:46.629> any<00:03:46.780> damage<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.409> then<00:03:48.159> he

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
doesn't take any damage and then he

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.009 
doesn't take any damage and then he
sprays<00:03:48.609> into<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.329> juggernaut<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.609> he<00:03:51.609> misses

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
sprays into the juggernaut and he misses

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.330 
sprays into the juggernaut and he misses
which<00:03:53.019> sucks<00:03:53.379> for<00:03:53.560> him<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:53.979> second<00:03:54.250> one

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
which sucks for him and the second one

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.710 
which sucks for him and the second one
sprays<00:03:54.609> into<00:03:54.879> the<00:03:54.970> juggernaut<00:03:55.299> also<00:03:55.569> has<00:03:55.690> a

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
sprays into the juggernaut also has a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.140 
sprays into the juggernaut also has a
colossal<00:03:56.199> which<00:03:56.290> is<00:03:56.409> not<00:03:56.530> too<00:03:56.680> big<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> deal<00:03:57.150> so

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
colossal which is not too big a deal so

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.729 
colossal which is not too big a deal so
first<00:03:58.419> against<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.690> juggernaut<00:03:59.109> he<00:03:59.470> hits

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
first against the juggernaut he hits

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.879 
first against the juggernaut he hits
it'll<00:04:00.489> be<00:04:00.609> dice<00:04:00.790> minus<00:04:01.359> one<00:04:01.659> because<00:04:02.620> it's

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
it'll be dice minus one because it's

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.550 
it'll be dice minus one because it's
only<00:04:03.129> pal<00:04:03.370> 13<00:04:03.819> or<00:04:03.909> armor<00:04:04.239> 13<00:04:04.659> and<00:04:05.290> so<00:04:05.349> he<00:04:05.409> does

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
only pal 13 or armor 13 and so he does

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.770 
only pal 13 or armor 13 and so he does
seven<00:04:05.859> damage<00:04:06.159> 24<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:07.120> you<00:04:07.239> ever<00:04:07.359> seen<00:04:07.540> by

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
seven damage 24 have you ever seen by

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.899 
seven damage 24 have you ever seen by
all<00:04:07.840> thralls<00:04:08.229> do<00:04:08.590> that<00:04:08.769> much<00:04:08.949> damage<00:04:08.979> to<00:04:09.879> a

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
all thralls do that much damage to a

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.030 
all thralls do that much damage to a
heavy<00:04:10.419> Kate<00:04:10.720> or<00:04:10.870> war<00:04:11.079> jack<00:04:11.319> I<00:04:11.590> sure<00:04:11.859> haven't

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
heavy Kate or war jack I sure haven't

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.039 
heavy Kate or war jack I sure haven't
and<00:04:12.310> then<00:04:12.790> he<00:04:12.879> hits<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.359> colossal<00:04:13.810> as<00:04:13.900> well

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
and then he hits the colossal as well

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.899 
and then he hits the colossal as well
it's<00:04:14.199> diced<00:04:14.349> minus<00:04:14.650> 6<00:04:14.889> only<00:04:15.099> this<00:04:15.220> one<00:04:15.489> damage

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
it's diced minus 6 only this one damage

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.000 
it's diced minus 6 only this one damage
colossal<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.930> still<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.139> pretty<00:04:17.440> high<00:04:17.620> armor<00:04:17.889> at

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
colossal is still a pretty high armor at

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.240 
colossal is still a pretty high armor at
18<00:04:18.489> there

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
18 there

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.030 
18 there
and<00:04:19.630> then<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:20.750> have<00:04:20.959> ongoing<00:04:21.200> corrosion<00:04:21.890> so

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
and then they have ongoing corrosion so

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.140 
and then they have ongoing corrosion so
it'll<00:04:22.190> continue<00:04:22.370> taking<00:04:22.580> one<00:04:22.880> point<00:04:23.060> of

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
it'll continue taking one point of

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.240 
it'll continue taking one point of
damage<00:04:23.180> every<00:04:23.750> turn<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.560> other<00:04:24.740> buyer<00:04:24.980> all

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
damage every turn the other buyer all

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.980 
damage every turn the other buyer all
over<00:04:25.460> here<00:04:25.670> explodes<00:04:26.240> himself<00:04:26.720> he<00:04:26.870> actually

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
over here explodes himself he actually

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.170 
over here explodes himself he actually
wanted<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.440> kill<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:27.860> guy<00:04:28.100> because<00:04:28.910> he'd<00:04:29.090> be

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
wanted to kill this guy because he'd be

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.490 
wanted to kill this guy because he'd be
in<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.300> way<00:04:29.450> of<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.600> Deaf<00:04:29.780> Jack<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.290> then<00:04:30.410> he

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
in the way of the Deaf Jack and then he

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.960 
in the way of the Deaf Jack and then he
hits<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.830> juggernaut<00:04:31.220> automatically<00:04:31.850> so

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
hits the juggernaut automatically so

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:32.920 
hits the juggernaut automatically so
basically<00:04:32.270> the<00:04:32.330> by<00:04:32.420> all<00:04:32.510> trials<00:04:32.810> can

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
basically the by all trials can

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.390 
basically the by all trials can
sacrifice<00:04:33.260> himself<00:04:33.680> to<00:04:33.920> hit<00:04:34.130> everything

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
sacrifice himself to hit everything

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.330 
sacrifice himself to hit everything
within<00:04:34.640> six<00:04:34.970> inches<00:04:35.090> for<00:04:35.960> pout<00:04:36.140> 12<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.740> almost

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
within six inches for pout 12 and almost

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.940 
within six inches for pout 12 and almost
kills<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.730> juggernaut<00:04:38.090> just<00:04:38.420> with<00:04:38.540> that<00:04:38.770> so<00:04:39.770> he

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
kills a juggernaut just with that so he

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.170 
kills a juggernaut just with that so he
and<00:04:40.130> he<00:04:40.310> was<00:04:40.430> even<00:04:40.610> thinking<00:04:40.640> of<00:04:40.880> using<00:04:41.000> a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
and he was even thinking of using a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.600 
and he was even thinking of using a
Kraken<00:04:41.600> to<00:04:42.290> finish<00:04:42.770> off<00:04:42.950> the<00:04:43.070> juggernaut<00:04:43.460> but

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
Kraken to finish off the juggernaut but

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.040 
Kraken to finish off the juggernaut but
it<00:04:43.670> looks<00:04:43.820> like<00:04:43.910> just<00:04:44.390> with<00:04:44.570> shooting

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
it looks like just with shooting

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.140 
it looks like just with shooting
although<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.560> one<00:04:45.770> pal<00:04:46.100> wepa<00:04:46.700> master<00:04:47.030> from

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
although that one pal wepa master from

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.820 
although that one pal wepa master from
the<00:04:47.240> been<00:04:47.360> through<00:04:47.540> all<00:04:47.600> did<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.840> too<00:04:48.020> he's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
the been through all did it too he's
