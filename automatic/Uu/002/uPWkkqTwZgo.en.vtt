 basil a little and pepper 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.660
 third we have to take the pot and 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.520
 fill it about a quarter or half 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.150
 of water to cook well I'm going to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.490
 cook for two people 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.520
 good friends while the water is 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.830
 boiling we start chopping the 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.770
 ingredients now garlic cloves what 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.430
 we apply in small squares 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.430
 A) Yes 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.650
 and the onion 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.950
 once we finish chopping the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.170
 little squares we have to take the oil and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.750
 put calculate two or three tablespoons of 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.750
 more or less oil to fill 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 this and good we take the onion also 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.710
 and we will apply it in small squares 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.710
 to give him the pleasure 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.160
 once the onion and garlic are finished 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 chopped into small squares with a 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.470
 great little nothing happens 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.720
 we take the salt and calculate how I use the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.670
 three fingers is a bit vulgar and I guess 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.650
 three fingers makes a handful what 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.830
 we spread over all the onion and the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.450
 Garlic 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.310
 and a little more 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.310
 now we will take the basil 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.020
 and we will put a little basil 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.350
 above 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.280
 to give it a good flavor and a little 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.280
 pepper 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.630
 on top 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.810
 we will put the fire 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.380
 and let's hope it 's good once 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.380
 water is boiling 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.860
 and the oil is put we take 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.860
 I'll take spaghetti for two people 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.260
 I will be 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.580
 1.10 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.580
 I'll catch it and the martyrs 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.880
 and they would put it on the pot in a circle 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.880
 so they do not stick 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.909
 the other handful also 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:05.640
 I'll take a teaspoon and salt and 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 I will put a spoonful of salt 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.020
 over scattering the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.680
 Onion and garlic is being made 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.170
 you have to be careful not to burn 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.590
 because if you do not have it it will give you a bad taste 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.590
 to spaghetti and Poland 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.300
 good friends once we have almost ready 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.160
 fried onion with garlic as 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.150
 we stir a little bit and see if it is 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.260
 a little golden 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:44.879
 and we went to the next step what is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.489
 fry the meat the minced meat I have 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.500
 300 grams of meat I eat as I am for two 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.310
 people and I love the meat I will put 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.620
 medium 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.620
 of ground beef 1 minced meat 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.870
 as I am at home I cook with my hand and 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.650
 feet 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.650
 I take it 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.189
 and I start to sit in small 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.189
 pieces by applying it with the same hand 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.290
 good friends one of them because there is the 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.830
 meat to skillet we take the chop one 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.250
 bit 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.580
 with what you use if we put a little 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.240
 more oil two tablespoons more or less 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.540
 they calculate two or three and we start 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.660
 stir it 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.930
 apply it well 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.090
 and stir what I mix 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.510
 with the xunta 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.770
 good while while doing the 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:55.400
 meat the spaghetti were ready 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:00.090
 Now we have to take the colander 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.860
 We take it to the sink 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.860
 we leave this we cut the pot 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.200
 and the 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:12.250
 we look over the colander for what 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.250
 the water 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.009
 take the pot we leave it in the same 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.150
 Market Stall 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.010
 we take the spaghetti 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.460
 and we throw them some water for the 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.460
 receive people 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:34.620
 Once ready spaghetti clean 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.430
 we leave here a moment we take the pot 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.420
 we put some oil 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.420
 two or three tablespoons 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:50.460
 and of course we turned it 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.440
 the kitchen 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.430
 We lounged in hand 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.430
 we stir it 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.740
 so they do not stick while doing 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.740
 the meat 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.620
 we see that the meat is already cooked 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.560
 we take the salt and we put another little 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.630
 of salt over on all the flesh a 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.540
 a little more 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:22.430
 and we revolve it 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:26.090
 once the fried meat 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:28.390
 it's all right we open the tomato 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.390
 fried 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.790
 very carefully 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.380
 and we put it on the meat 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.310
 this has to do has to be to 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.310
 mid fire 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:49.639
 because if not everything will jump 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.180
 once put it we revolve it with the 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.180
 fried meat 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:07:02.230
 all the count and we hope 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:05.800
 5 to 7 minutes for the meat to absorb 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:08.440
 the fried tomato 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.940
 good friends have already passed almost 7 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:15.009
 minutes and as you can see the meat has already absorbed 

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:18.390
 all the fried tomato now what 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:22.380
 we will do is turn off the kitchen 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.470
 and put it in on the spaghetti that 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.470
 they are in the pot we take it and what 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.470
 passionate 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.350
 once we put friends we take them 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:36.979
 spaghetti for the meat and stir them 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.979
 all over the pot 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.860
 the salt of that agreement 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.669
 good friends once ready we can 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.680
 serve the dish and we can put it as 

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:58.680
 You want a bit of cheese like me 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:03.800
 I always do 

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.800
 and nothing this was all and enjoy
