this exhibit is entitled dinosaurs the
lost<00:00:15.179> world<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.850> lost<00:00:18.390> world

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
lost world and it is about a lost world

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.109 
lost world and it is about a lost world
that<00:00:19.140> actually<00:00:19.320> existed<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.369> Western<00:00:20.910> North

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that actually existed in Western North

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.349 
that actually existed in Western North
America<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:22.050> stretched<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> way<00:00:23.490> from

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
America it stretched all the way from

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.349 
America it stretched all the way from
Mexico<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.800> North<00:00:26.099> Slope<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.519> Alaska<00:00:26.640> and

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
Mexico to the North Slope of Alaska and

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.450 
Mexico to the North Slope of Alaska and
was<00:00:27.689> isolated<00:00:28.529> from<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> rest<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.220> North

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
was isolated from the rest of North

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
was isolated from the rest of North
America<00:00:29.970> by<00:00:30.150> a<00:00:30.179> shallow<00:00:30.570> sea<00:00:31.050> wave<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.920> earth

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
America by a shallow sea wave the earth

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.130 
America by a shallow sea wave the earth
was<00:00:32.250> much<00:00:32.489> warmer<00:00:32.820> there<00:00:33.120> were<00:00:33.210> no<00:00:33.360> ice<00:00:33.540> camps

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
was much warmer there were no ice camps

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.530 
was much warmer there were no ice camps
and<00:00:34.350> about<00:00:34.950> 20%<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> land<00:00:35.820> area<00:00:36.239> was

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
and about 20% of the land area was

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.729 
and about 20% of the land area was
flooded<00:00:36.989> by<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.170> sea

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
flooded by the sea

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.000 
flooded by the sea
so<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.550> sea<00:00:38.910> deposits<00:00:39.570> we<00:00:40.140> find<00:00:40.440> giant

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so in those sea deposits we find giant

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.080 
so in those sea deposits we find giant
turtles<00:00:41.489> huge<00:00:42.530> lizard<00:00:43.530> like<00:00:43.800> marine<00:00:44.460> reptiles

when the extinction event occurred that

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.649 
when the extinction event occurred that
wiped<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:25.220> dinosaurs<00:01:25.759> off<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.119> face<00:01:26.299> of<00:01:26.330> the

earth we do also have a large spacious

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.920 
earth we do also have a large spacious
area<00:01:30.979> for<00:01:31.700> children's<00:01:32.299> activities

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
area for children's activities

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.789 
area for children's activities
particularly<00:01:33.830> those<00:01:34.220> dealing<00:01:34.250> with<00:01:34.880> how

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
particularly those dealing with how

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.770 
paleontologists gene and geologists
search<00:01:38.810> for<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:39.789> excavated<00:01:40.789> new<00:01:41.119> dinosaurs

search for and excavated new dinosaurs

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.880 
search for and excavated new dinosaurs
so<00:01:42.770> there<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.039> a<00:01:43.070> dig<00:01:43.399> area<00:01:44.439> children<00:01:45.439> can

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
so there is a dig area children can

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.899 
so there is a dig area children can
uncover<00:01:46.610> a<00:01:47.420> series<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.350> bones<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.549> complete

the<00:01:53.240> sediments<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:53.990> make<00:01:54.619> a<00:01:54.649> little<00:01:54.950> map<00:01:55.159> of

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
the sediments and make a little map of

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.639 
the sediments and make a little map of
the<00:01:55.940> growing<00:01:56.390> Stella<00:01:56.869> just<00:01:57.470> as

the growing Stella just as

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.359 
the growing Stella just as
paleontologist<00:01:58.550> would<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.039> great

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
paleontologist would it's a great

paleontologist would it's a great
introduction<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.270> science<00:02:02.720> is<00:02:02.990> you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
introduction to what science is you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.080 
introduction to what science is you
don't<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.979> use<00:02:04.220> that<00:02:04.429> process<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
don't just have to use that process to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.730 
don't just have to use that process to
think<00:02:05.270> about<00:02:05.479> dinosaurs<00:02:05.929> but<00:02:06.110> other<00:02:06.289> aspects

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
think about dinosaurs but other aspects

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.889

of<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.979> world<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.580> would<00:02:08.269> argue<00:02:08.600> you're<00:02:08.750> not

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
of the world I would argue you're not

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.389 
of the world I would argue you're not
