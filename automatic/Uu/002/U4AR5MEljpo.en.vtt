00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
because I knew I needed it so because I

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.530 
because I knew I needed it so because I
knew<00:04:05.129> me<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.489> her<00:04:05.640> was<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.060> back<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:06.329> forth

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.360 
knew me and her was going back and forth
with<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.989> toll<00:04:07.200> so<00:04:07.500> I<00:04:07.530> knew<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.099> couldn't

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
with the toll so I knew that I couldn't

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.069 
with the toll so I knew that I couldn't
at<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> moment<00:04:09.150> miss<00:04:09.269> my<00:04:09.480> second<00:04:09.810> attempt

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079

and<00:04:11.519> the<00:04:11.640> third<00:04:11.819> one<00:04:12.030> was<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:13.190> possible

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
and the third one was it possible

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.120 
and the third one was it possible
because<00:04:16.200> their<00:04:16.320> body<00:04:16.500> weight<00:04:16.650> was<00:04:16.769> too<00:04:16.950> long

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
because their body weight was too long

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.460 
because their body weight was too long
yeah<00:04:17.579> yeah<00:04:17.850> definitely<00:04:18.750> was<00:04:18.870> too<00:04:19.019> low<00:04:19.169> but<00:04:19.350> I

yeah yeah definitely was too low but I

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.569 
yeah yeah definitely was too low but I
knew<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:19.620> was<00:04:19.799> going<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.949> give<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.220> everything<00:04:20.280> I

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.110 
long as I can
they<00:05:44.990> say<00:05:45.200> they<00:05:45.380> thought<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.980> the<00:05:46.370> hungriest

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
they say they thought the the hungriest

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.760 
they say they thought the the hungriest
person<00:05:47.600> is<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.750> person<00:05:48.080> chasing<00:05:48.290> you

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
person is a person chasing you

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.170 
person is a person chasing you
I<00:05:48.800> think<00:05:49.280> the<00:05:49.340> hungriest<00:05:49.580> person<00:05:50.000> is<00:05:50.090> the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
I think the hungriest person is the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.420 
I think the hungriest person is the
person<00:05:50.210> on<00:05:50.630> top<00:05:50.810> because<00:05:51.200> now<00:05:51.890> you're<00:05:52.100> on<00:05:52.220> top

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
person on top because now you're on top

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.160 
person on top because now you're on top
and<00:05:52.640> everyone's<00:05:53.000> trying<00:05:53.210> to<00:05:53.390> take<00:05:53.570> you<00:05:53.720> off<00:05:53.900> so

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
and everyone's trying to take you off so

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:57.070 
and everyone's trying to take you off so
it<00:05:54.830> becomes<00:05:55.840> increasingly<00:05:56.840> more<00:05:56.960> difficult

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
it becomes increasingly more difficult

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.540 
it becomes increasingly more difficult
and<00:05:57.560> more<00:05:57.680> challenging<00:05:58.190> because<00:05:58.280> you're

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
and more challenging because you're

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.460 
and more challenging because you're
constantly<00:05:58.880> have<00:05:59.240> having<00:05:59.930> to<00:06:00.020> get<00:06:00.170> stronger

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
constantly have having to get stronger

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.310 
constantly have having to get stronger
because<00:06:00.950> it's<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.550> matter<00:06:01.730> of<00:06:01.880> how<00:06:02.630> how<00:06:03.080> long

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
because it's a matter of how how long

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.110 
because it's a matter of how how long
can<00:06:03.470> I<00:06:03.590> stay<00:06:03.800> here<00:06:04.010> and<00:06:04.220> everyone's<00:06:04.940> watching

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
can I stay here and everyone's watching

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.550 
can I stay here and everyone's watching
how<00:06:05.540> long<00:06:05.750> can<00:06:05.900> you<00:06:05.960> do<00:06:06.170> it<00:06:06.320> and<00:06:06.440> I'm

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
how long can you do it and I'm

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.010 
how long can you do it and I'm
determined<00:06:06.980> to<00:06:07.190> do<00:06:07.310> it<00:06:07.430> as<00:06:07.520> long<00:06:07.640> as<00:06:07.700> I<00:06:07.880> can<00:06:08.090> so

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
determined to do it as long as I can so

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.340 
determined to do it as long as I can so
just<00:06:09.950> keep<00:06:10.100> getting<00:06:10.340> better<00:06:10.870> it's<00:06:11.870> terribly

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
just keep getting better it's terribly

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.170 
just keep getting better it's terribly
awkward<00:06:12.670> competing<00:06:13.670> in<00:06:14.590> powerlifting<00:06:15.590> I<00:06:16.180> now

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
awkward competing in powerlifting I now

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.570

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
complete primarily raw when I first

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.130 
complete primarily raw when I first
started<00:06:19.850> powerlifting<00:06:20.330> it<00:06:20.480> was<00:06:20.570> equipped<00:06:20.870> but

started powerlifting it was equipped but

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.240 
started powerlifting it was equipped but
they<00:06:21.350> didn't<00:06:21.590> have<00:06:21.740> raw<00:06:21.980> powerlifting

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250

it's the schedule only pretty much

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.260 
it's the schedule only pretty much
allows<00:06:27.200> me<00:06:27.380> to<00:06:27.500> complete<00:06:27.830> raw<00:06:28.010> and<00:06:28.550> I<00:06:28.850> love<00:06:29.060> raw
