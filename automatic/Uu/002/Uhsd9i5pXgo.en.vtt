00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello everyone we are in front of ever 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.690
 to 2015 I will now show you the main ones 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.900
 new in this version 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:14.219
 then as you can see this is one 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 scene not very complex and we go 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.560
 to analyze the viewport as you can 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.400
 seeing is a really high scene 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.470
 quality this is not a rendering 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.199
 comment in with maya software majella 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.380
 you already have viewport 2.0 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.430
 seen on several occasions but sumaya 2015 la 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 b porto 2.0 is the standard carryover e 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.870
 we also have two other ports which is the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.890
 legacy defaults that are not the same 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.420
 high performance is also the high one 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.410
 quality but right now there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 interest is precisely the strongest 2.0 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.730
 now it allows us many more operations 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.500
 it was really amplified in his 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.809
 potential and also has much more 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 compatibility with maya itself then 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.010
 let's go and see what I have 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.580
 activated 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.920
 then I activated the screen and space 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.560
 ambient occlusion that would be this one 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.490
 allows me to have a small ambient 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:25.350
 occlusion I don't know if you can see the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.259
 difference and then the anti aliasing that is 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.290
 this allows me to have 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:34.520
 much more image 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:39.530
 smooth and in the contours less vic saddled 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.720
 the gamma correction that we say one 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.400
 color correction and then floating 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.380
 point which is one thing on video 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.900
 you probably won't see but that 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.880
 sharply increases the qualities of 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.430
 transparency in general now we will go to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.120
 see also what it is because I have it 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.120
 used 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.530
 let's take a moment to take a look at 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:09.979
 course here in the various levels 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:14.830
 we obviously put a hdr in that 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.750
 this one then I put the penguin a 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.430
 well with his skeleton a light 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.200
 environmental all rendered the sun the 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.730
 sunlight all rendered into 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.980
 real time through the strongest of the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.780
 2.0 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.110
 and also a fog effect an effect 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.720
 very nice fog made with mesh 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:40.430
 fluids then with maio fluids ok 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 the main news 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.390
 we see these clearly 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.040
 a few years the green square brackets 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.570
 for example this one 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 this little button allows us to see 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.600
 the whole scene through the material 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:59.510
 by default which is lamberth lamberto nuno 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.930
 and therefore if we press it we have one 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.049
 clearer view of the scene 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.640
 then here we have the usual buttons 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.040
 obviously there is no button left 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.340
 of the ippoliti there are only i 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:17.030
 buttons of the port 2.0 view for le 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.120
 texture used two fused textures for 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.049
 this land used decs tour fuse 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:27.580
 and I used the bike function 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.950
 texture that 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.410
 becker here and solution for a support 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.130
 of the third and because he used one 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:40.180
 3d texture ie stucco texture that 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:45.520
 now I will show you stucco textures ho 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.920
 used this 3d texture or from the port 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.590
 2.0 does not support ma ho resources 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.700
 had to back up with a resolution 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.630
 2048 and this allowed me to have a 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.730
 result of a good quality for 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.240
 as for fluids instead I have 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:09.010
 I used an ordinary I do 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:15.870
 see a very common container better 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:22.050
 of maya fluids that would be this here 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:26.770
 I put an ingredient in the density 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:30.460
 I removed the speed of the fluid and up 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.250
 shading I put a certain 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.370
 transparency we say what I wanted 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.490
 we can we can see that lowering 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.280
 transparency is a more dense effect 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.740
 of the fog and then then I put 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.450
 I almost put you a gradient a 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.610
 pyramid let's say so that al 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.930
 center the density of the radio was more 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.940
 strong 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:05:00.070
 that is, he had perhaps no more dense and then 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.950
 I show the settings for a moment 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.130
 I have activated the viewport hole 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.000
 floating point I show that 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.310
 disabling it we have an effect 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 very ugly of transparency indeed 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.840
 we will see the fog of so many colors that the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.880
 that we don't like 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.130
 we abolish the highest in pointer we see 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:22.479
 already that the result is different and 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.930
 best for viewport 2.0 this is 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.610
 all 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.610
 see you at the next video
