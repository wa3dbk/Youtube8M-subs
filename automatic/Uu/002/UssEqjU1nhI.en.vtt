his speed to try to stay away from the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.860 
his speed to try to stay away from the
southpaw<00:00:46.039> Pacquiao<00:00:46.430> in<00:00:46.609> his<00:00:46.699> power<00:00:46.910> patio<00:00:47.690> has

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
southpaw Pacquiao in his power patio has

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.810 
southpaw Pacquiao in his power patio has
to<00:00:48.019> come<00:00:48.199> out<00:00:48.230> very<00:00:48.890> aggressive<00:00:49.129> he's<00:00:49.460> got<00:00:49.699> to

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
to come out very aggressive he's got to

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.509 
to come out very aggressive he's got to
come<00:00:49.969> out<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:50.629> go<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:51.199> broke<00:00:51.230> and<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.250> that's

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
come out and go for broke and so that's

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.549 
come out and go for broke and so that's
why<00:00:52.820> we<00:00:53.149> may<00:00:53.750> see<00:00:53.809> an<00:00:54.050> interesting<00:00:54.410> fight

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
why we may see an interesting fight

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.259 
why we may see an interesting fight
where<00:00:55.129> Pacquiao<00:00:55.429> could<00:00:55.760> come<00:00:55.969> in<00:00:56.090> make

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
where Pacquiao could come in make

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.759 
where Pacquiao could come in make
himself<00:00:56.420> vulnerable<00:00:56.750> by<00:00:57.230> being<00:00:57.500> gone<00:00:57.739> for

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
himself vulnerable by being gone for

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.770 
himself vulnerable by being gone for
broke<00:00:58.129> or<00:00:58.339> he<00:00:58.579> could<00:00:58.730> catch<00:00:58.940> up<00:00:58.969> with<00:00:59.300> Lloyd<00:00:59.539> so

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
broke or he could catch up with Lloyd so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.079 
broke or he could catch up with Lloyd so
I<00:01:00.140> see<00:01:00.589> it<00:01:00.679> being<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.920> 12-round<00:01:01.280> decision<00:01:01.399> and

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
I see it being a 12-round decision and

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:05.800 
I see it being a 12-round decision and
and<00:01:02.899> I<00:01:03.379> can't<00:01:03.980> wait<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.129> see<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.400> unfold<00:01:04.820> could

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
and I can't wait to see it unfold could

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.150 
and I can't wait to see it unfold could
we<00:01:05.870> potentially<00:01:06.050> see<00:01:06.500> a<00:01:06.530> rematch<00:01:06.830> you<00:01:06.950> think

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
we potentially see a rematch you think

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.910 
we potentially see a rematch you think
it<00:01:07.250> has<00:01:07.430> that<00:01:07.760> type<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.060> that<00:01:08.960> fight<00:01:09.170> to<00:01:09.200> have

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
it has that type of that fight to have

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.890 
it has that type of that fight to have
another<00:01:10.160> rematch<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:11.480> it's<00:01:11.570> all<00:01:11.659> based

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
another rematch I think it's all based

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020 
another rematch I think it's all based
on<00:01:12.080> what<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.860> fight<00:01:13.010> looks<00:01:13.159> like<00:01:13.400> if<00:01:13.580> it's<00:01:13.730> if

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
on what the fight looks like if it's if

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.060 
on what the fight looks like if it's if
it's<00:01:14.150> a<00:01:14.330> one-sided<00:01:14.780> lopsided<00:01:15.350> fight<00:01:15.530> know<00:01:15.800> if

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
it's a one-sided lopsided fight know if

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.670 
it's a one-sided lopsided fight know if
it<00:01:16.700> is<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.850> close<00:01:17.150> by<00:01:17.420> controversial<00:01:18.020> decision

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
it is a close by controversial decision

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.380 
it is a close by controversial decision
yes<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.610> know<00:01:19.640> they<00:01:19.820> don't<00:01:19.910> have<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.120> rematch

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
think anybody who who faces Floyd is an

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.400 
think anybody who who faces Floyd is an
underdog<00:01:32.210> just<00:01:32.510> because<00:01:32.780> no<00:01:32.990> one<00:01:33.140> has<00:01:33.260> figured

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
underdog just because no one has figured

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.670 
underdog just because no one has figured
it<00:01:33.620> out<00:01:33.740> yeah<00:01:34.300> having<00:01:35.300> said<00:01:35.540> that<00:01:35.570> you<00:01:35.960> know<00:01:36.080> if

Andy's<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.400> muck<00:01:37.700> on<00:01:37.910> underdog<00:01:38.480> it's<00:01:38.660> not<00:01:38.810> by

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
Andy's a muck on underdog it's not by

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.620 
Andy's a muck on underdog it's not by
much<00:01:39.230> he's<00:01:39.770> got<00:01:39.980> a<00:01:40.420> unorthodox<00:01:41.420> style

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
much he's got a unorthodox style

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.570 
much he's got a unorthodox style
something<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.260> Floyd<00:01:42.530> has<00:01:43.040> never<00:01:43.310> seen

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
something that Floyd has never seen

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.120 
something that Floyd has never seen
before<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.900> really<00:01:45.110> doesn't<00:01:45.500> exist<00:01:45.890> within

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
before and really doesn't exist within

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.490 
before and really doesn't exist within
the<00:01:46.280> sport<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.390> it's<00:01:47.630> really<00:01:47.960> an<00:01:48.140> intriguing

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the sport so it's really an intriguing

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.590 
the sport so it's really an intriguing
matchup<00:01:48.980> it's<00:01:49.190> hardly<00:01:49.460> call<00:01:50.060> but<00:01:50.330> I<00:01:50.360> think

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
matchup it's hardly call but I think

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.450 
matchup it's hardly call but I think
you've<00:01:50.720> got<00:01:50.900> to<00:01:50.990> go<00:01:51.110> with<00:01:51.290> the<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.040> guy<00:01:52.220> who's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
you've got to go with the the guy who's
