games on discs anymore so it really was

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.330

probably the demographic you recently

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.120 
probably the demographic you recently
grew<00:04:52.780> up<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:52.990> it<00:04:53.110> there<00:04:53.289> are<00:04:53.380> male<00:04:53.590> focused

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130

advertising campaigns focused for teens
and<00:04:57.039> it<00:04:57.220> made<00:04:57.460> sense<00:04:57.700> for<00:04:57.850> that<00:04:58.060> to<00:04:58.180> be<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
and it made sense for that to be the
