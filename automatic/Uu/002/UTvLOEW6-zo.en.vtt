00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
name this customer ID and again this is

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.190 
name this customer ID and again this is
going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.259> number<00:02:11.720> this<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.110> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
going to be a number this is just a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.270 
going to be a number this is just a
simple<00:02:13.470> Auto

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
simple Auto

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.300 
simple Auto
number<00:02:14.610> increment<00:02:15.209> in<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.360> other<00:02:15.630> tables<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
number increment in the other tables and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.920 
number increment in the other tables and
then<00:02:18.180> we're<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.450> go<00:02:18.600> ahead<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:18.840> do

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
then we're going to go ahead and do

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.490 
then we're going to go ahead and do
product<00:02:19.580> ID<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:21.209> again<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.140> number

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
product ID and again it's a number

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.490 
product ID and again it's a number
because<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> other<00:02:23.970> table<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:25.050> products

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
because in the other table the products

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.199 
because in the other table the products
table<00:02:25.770> our<00:02:26.430> product<00:02:27.000> ID<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.420> also<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.959> number<00:02:28.200> an

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
table our product ID is also a number an

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.729 
table our product ID is also a number an
auto<00:02:30.209> number<00:02:30.560> so<00:02:31.560> we<00:02:31.680> know<00:02:32.239> the<00:02:33.239> order<00:02:33.450> idea<00:02:33.989> we

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
auto number so we know the order idea we

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.680 
auto number so we know the order idea we
know<00:02:34.890> who<00:02:35.069> purchased<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:35.700> when<00:02:36.270> you<00:02:36.360> know<00:02:36.480> what

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
again that's going to be a number we

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.540 
again that's going to be a number we
want<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> know<00:02:45.660> how<00:02:46.050> they<00:02:46.290> want<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.739> ship<00:02:47.070> so

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
a particular order we do that by

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.000 
a particular order we do that by
multiplying<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:33.209> quantity<00:03:33.540> times<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.739> price
