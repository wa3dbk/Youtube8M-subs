00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
James Storm for the past few weeks

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.709 
James Storm for the past few weeks
turned<00:00:40.950> his<00:00:41.129> back<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.610> spitting<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.239> green

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
turned his back by spitting the green

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.860 
turned his back by spitting the green
mist<00:00:43.290> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> face<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.940> Great<00:00:45.180> Muta<00:00:45.480> and

mist in the face of the Great Muta and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.869

aligning himself with the cowboy

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.930 
aligning himself with the cowboy
definitively<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.800> think<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.460> is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
definitively and I think that that is

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
definitively and I think that that is
just<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.210> blatant<00:00:51.570> sign<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.930> disrespect<00:00:52.649> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
just a blatant sign of disrespect and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
just a blatant sign of disrespect and
now<00:00:53.250> Great<00:00:53.699> Muta<00:00:53.910> alongside<00:00:54.300> Tajiri<00:00:54.899> has<00:00:55.020> an

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
now Great Muta alongside Tajiri has an

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.830 
now Great Muta alongside Tajiri has an
opportunity<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.640> revenge<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.449> i

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
opportunity to get that revenge and i

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.540 
opportunity to get that revenge and i
think<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> bad<00:00:58.590> blood<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.250> going<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
think that the bad blood is going to

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.220 
think that the bad blood is going to
result<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.969> some<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:00.300> vicious<00:01:00.570> wrestling<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
result in some very vicious wrestling as

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.869 
result in some very vicious wrestling as
