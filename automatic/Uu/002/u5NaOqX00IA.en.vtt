00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.420
 we passed several tournaments and let's 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.710

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.510
 that is, test tournaments for now 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.600
 that only 1 of 3 is open 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.480
 and let's begin but first want 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.420
 tell you about one project here 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.480

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.870

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.360

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.210

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.100
 getting good money join 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.129
 my team will make money together 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:48.360
 that's about such a small ad well 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.170
 let's start the junior tournament so far 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.090
 what's open well let's start playing it 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.550
 so well, once against the young man, let's choose 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.899
 someone weaker 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.910
 to equalize the forces so well let's start 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 will be here to play most of the Naruto 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.590
 weak character who is now so 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.490
 and let the arena be snowy plains 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.490
 metal countries 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 Now I want to say right away that everyone who 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.500
 liked it like and leave 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.950
 comments because some may 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.530
 do not watch the video here write your 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 opinion about my passage continue 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.750
 them to me on it or not to continue 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.810
 here and let's continue going back in 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.810
 the game 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.530
 something first rival 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.370
 first junior tournament weakest 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.000
 so special problems 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.250
 should not be 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.390
 so understandably play naruto main 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.070
 rooms 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.650
 huge rasengan well for good damage 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:14.720
 decent even 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:18.980
 We are going to understand clearly he can 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.980
 clear here and so today try 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.500
 couple incomprehensible shadow clone and 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.250
 close good paper 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.599
 like that he can attack 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.599
 already a little bit of a dream 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.709
 How do you study 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.950
 she is very beautiful victory turned out 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.850
 Well, as you can see, in principle, a rival 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.310
 still weak first tournament so here for 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.540
 less bonuses will give them here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.610
 rank c well why c because we donâ€™t 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.070
 did absolutely the maiden did not win 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.030
 Awakening for it usually give a lot 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:16.790
 bonuses and so high rank we 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.950
 try when the next combat inside 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.360
 I go through all the tournaments show characters 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:30.020
 discoveries here and then pass 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:35.090
 adventures can also be tried 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:38.180
 pass the tests there, too, a lot of things 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.020
 interesting but it's all year in a separate 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.730
 video 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.230
 and in a separate playlist 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.230
 so look 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.680
 more and more interesting 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 absolutely so 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.540
 empress ki 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.010
 cool 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:15.280
 she is still so weak once intelligent 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.670
 the very first water come different com 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.670
 to make 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.630
 and here 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:29.680
 that is, you can start someone and then 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.680
 do just come here brother 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.820
 as you can see damage and we do a little bit well 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.770
 and experience know what will happen much later 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.080
 less 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.800
 great next win so well now 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.090

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:53.790
 so 5 st he is not bad here so we 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:00.330
 save money then various items 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:01.490
 maybe we will buy here in tests there 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.370
 give bonuses 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 personal items partner will be interested 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:16.260
 and in the tournament here they just give points that is 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:21.260
 money here and the characters open so 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.260

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.060
 Nice on top of him very snowball beautiful 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:31.630
 I will write 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 palmin 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:39.849
 opponent opponent once again weak damage 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:43.529
 small to us we put more 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.529
 have just leave does nothing 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.810
 such a big bright 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.810
 detainee strike 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.080
 supra 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:08.210
 so as you see no g3 hit us 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.810
 subtract more each of the room reduces in 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.810
 maximum 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.200
