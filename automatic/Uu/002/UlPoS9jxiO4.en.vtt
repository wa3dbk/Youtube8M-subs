half inches which i think is even a
little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.270> longer<00:02:30.650> than<00:02:31.650> my<00:02:31.920> advanced<00:02:32.340> all

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
pliers were but but they feel really

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.760 
pliers were but but they feel really
delicate<00:02:35.670> they<00:02:35.940> actually<00:02:36.450> feel<00:02:36.720> smaller<00:02:37.320> than

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
delicate they actually feel smaller than

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.030 
delicate they actually feel smaller than
my<00:02:37.950> previous<00:02:38.190> pair<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.820> pliers<00:02:39.740> these<00:02:40.740> pliers

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
my previous pair of pliers these pliers

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.770 
my previous pair of pliers these pliers
included<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:42.120> sheath<00:02:43.250> which<00:02:44.250> is<00:02:44.460> not<00:02:45.120> nearly<00:02:45.600> as

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
included a sheath which is not nearly as

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.140 
included a sheath which is not nearly as
good<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.230> quality<00:02:46.470> sheath<00:02:47.160> as<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.640> vance<00:02:47.850> doll

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
good a quality sheath as the vance doll

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.350 
good a quality sheath as the vance doll
pliers<00:02:48.590> but<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.770> actually<00:02:50.190> kind<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.940> like<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
pliers but I actually kind of like the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.480 
pliers but I actually kind of like the
design<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.960> this<00:02:52.170> sheath<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.830> when<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.460> I

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
design of this sheath more when I when I

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.740 
design of this sheath more when I when I
use<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.030> sheath<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.300> put<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.810> pliers<00:02:56.090> in<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
use the sheath to put the pliers in and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
use the sheath to put the pliers in and
on<00:02:57.990> my<00:02:58.200> hip<00:02:58.530> they<00:02:59.430> really<00:03:00.260> really<00:03:01.260> tend<00:03:01.560> to

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
on my hip they really really tend to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.030 
on my hip they really really tend to
disappear<00:03:02.340> flat<00:03:03.020> into<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.050> sheath<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.740> just

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
disappear flat into the sheath and just

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.010 
disappear flat into the sheath and just
go<00:03:05.220> right<00:03:05.490> up<00:03:05.550> against<00:03:06.060> my<00:03:06.210> hip<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.660> don't

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
go right up against my hip but I don't

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.810 
go right up against my hip but I don't
even<00:03:07.140> realize<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.650> I'm<00:03:08.040> wearing<00:03:08.280> them<00:03:08.520> so

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
even realize that I'm wearing them so

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.600 
even realize that I'm wearing them so
not<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:10.020> greatest<00:03:10.410> quality<00:03:10.920> sheath<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:11.400> don't

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
not the greatest quality sheath I don't

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.870 
not the greatest quality sheath I don't
think<00:03:11.880> but<00:03:12.620> but<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.770> design<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.190> really<00:03:14.490> grown

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
think but but the design is really grown

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.630 
think but but the design is really grown
on<00:03:14.910> me<00:03:15.300> by<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.140> way<00:03:16.350> this<00:03:16.560> this<00:03:17.100> split<00:03:17.430> ring

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
on me by the way this this split ring

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.580 
on me by the way this this split ring
here<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:17.910> added<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.540> makes<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.350> bit

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
here I added just makes it a little bit

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.770 
here I added just makes it a little bit
easier<00:03:20.130> for<00:03:20.430> me<00:03:21.390> to<00:03:21.420> put<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> lanyard<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
easier for me to put the lanyard on and

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.480 
easier for me to put the lanyard on and
they<00:03:24.780> sell<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.200> lanyard<00:03:25.590> separately<00:03:26.280> which

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
they sell the lanyard separately which

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.490 
they sell the lanyard separately which
was<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.730> little<00:03:27.060> bit<00:03:27.180> unfortunate<00:03:28.080> because<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
was a little bit unfortunate because the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.530 
was a little bit unfortunate because the
vance<00:03:28.860> dolls<00:03:29.160> included<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.880> lanyard

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
vance dolls included the lanyard

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.090 
vance dolls included the lanyard
but<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.990> lanyard<00:03:34.440> is<00:03:34.590> something<00:03:34.980> i

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
but the lanyard is something i

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.130 
but the lanyard is something i

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
pair of pliers so I like the narrower

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
precision point here the cutters are

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.440 
precision point here the cutters are
inside<00:03:54.990> the<00:03:55.260> jaws<00:03:55.560> which<00:03:56.100> frankly<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.970> liked

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
inside the jaws which frankly I liked

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.640 
inside the jaws which frankly I liked
the<00:03:57.720> external<00:03:58.470> cutters<00:03:58.860> the<00:03:59.100> outside<00:03:59.520> cutters

the external cutters the outside cutters

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.730 
the external cutters the outside cutters
much<00:04:01.650> better<00:04:02.720> but<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:04.050> getting<00:04:04.410> used<00:04:04.590> to

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
much better but I'm getting used to

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.080 
much better but I'm getting used to
