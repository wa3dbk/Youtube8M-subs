00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:53.319 
gonna use your model and push it against

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.829 
gonna use your model and push it against
the<00:00:53.710> face<00:00:53.979> and<00:00:54.370> measure<00:00:54.789> it<00:00:54.999> against<00:00:55.449> powder

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
the face and measure it against powder

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.459 
the face and measure it against powder
the<00:00:56.559> inside<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.309> product<00:00:58.319> press<00:00:59.319> it

against the face and when you remove it

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:03.509 
against the face and when you remove it
you<00:01:01.629> can<00:01:01.780> see<00:01:01.929> powder<00:01:02.170> lines<00:01:02.530> another<00:01:03.280> way<00:01:03.459> you

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
you can see powder lines another way you

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.520 
you can see powder lines another way you
can<00:01:03.699> do<00:01:03.879> this<00:01:04.030> is<00:01:04.239> press<00:01:04.780> it<00:01:04.930> against<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.229> face

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
can do this is press it against the face

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.120 
can do this is press it against the face
and<00:01:06.250> powder<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.060> edges<00:01:07.680> when<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:08.770> remove<00:01:09.100> it

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
and powder the edges when you remove it

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.370 
and powder the edges when you remove it
the<00:01:09.909> parts<00:01:10.240> that<00:01:10.299> are<00:01:10.479> powder<00:01:10.719> to<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:11.110> parts

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
the parts that are powder to the parts

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.959 
the parts that are powder to the parts
they're<00:01:11.530> gonna<00:01:11.649> be<00:01:11.799> revealed<00:01:12.130> these<00:01:12.610> are<00:01:12.759> not

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
they're gonna be revealed these are not

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:15.810 
they're gonna be revealed these are not
custom-built<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.500> any<00:01:15.070> adjustments<00:01:15.789> should

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
custom-built so any adjustments should

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.090 
custom-built so any adjustments should
be<00:01:16.000> done<00:01:16.149> off<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.390> face<00:01:16.780> once<00:01:17.710> you<00:01:17.859> get<00:01:17.979> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
be done off the face once you get the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.160 
be done off the face once you get the
glue<00:01:18.280> in<00:01:18.460> start<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:18.939> the<00:01:19.060> gluon<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.600> started

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
glue in start and the gluon is started

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.349 
glue in start and the gluon is started
okay<00:01:20.920> now<00:01:21.189> that<00:01:21.369> we've<00:01:21.490> fit<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> prosthetic

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359

we're<00:02:00.229> gonna<00:02:00.350> do<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.590> all<00:02:00.800> while<00:02:01.040> it's<00:02:01.160> still

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
we're gonna do this all while it's still

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.219 
we're gonna do this all while it's still
a<00:02:01.430> little<00:02:01.550> damp<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:02.630> way<00:02:02.810> if<00:02:02.900> we<00:02:02.960> have<00:02:03.110> to

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
a little damp this way if we have to

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.150 
a little damp this way if we have to
move<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:03.910> it's<00:02:04.910> not<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> end<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> world

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
move it it's not the end of the world

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.400 
move it it's not the end of the world
there<00:02:07.160> we<00:02:07.250> are<00:02:07.280> there's<00:02:07.910> our<00:02:08.060> first<00:02:08.410> section

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
there we are there's our first section

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.730 
there we are there's our first section
glue<00:02:10.240> that<00:02:11.240> will<00:02:11.360> continue<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> same<00:02:12.080> process

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
glue that will continue the same process

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.710 
glue that will continue the same process
by<00:02:13.010> peeling<00:02:13.400> back<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.820> piece<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.270> gluing<00:02:14.570> up

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
by peeling back the piece and gluing up

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.690 
by peeling back the piece and gluing up
now<00:02:15.560> because<00:02:15.890> we're<00:02:16.040> going<00:02:16.130> to<00:02:16.190> use<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.400> lace

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
now because we're going to use a lace

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.210 
now because we're going to use a lace
front<00:02:16.940> wig<00:02:17.270> piece<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:18.410> going<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.680> keep<00:02:18.950> from

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
front wig piece I'm going to keep from

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.640 
front wig piece I'm going to keep from
gluing<00:02:19.610> this<00:02:19.880> section<00:02:20.360> here<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:21.020> then<00:02:21.470> place

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
gluing this section here and then place

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.710 
gluing this section here and then place
it<00:02:21.860> over<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.190> prosthetic<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.240> order<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.600> do

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
it over the prosthetic so in order to do

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.020 
it over the prosthetic so in order to do
that<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.650> need<00:02:24.740> to<00:02:24.830> keep<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.160> pivot<00:02:25.520> point<00:02:25.550> so

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
that you need to keep a pivot point so

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.580 
that you need to keep a pivot point so
I'm<00:02:26.600> going<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.990> little<00:02:27.110> glue<00:02:27.350> right

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I'm going to put a little glue right

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:41.750 
I'm going to put a little glue right
here

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.339 

and<00:02:42.760> we'll<00:02:42.909> take<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> little<00:02:43.420> pros-aide<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.170> the

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
and we'll take a little pros-aide on the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.649 
and we'll take a little pros-aide on the
sponge<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.950> sponge<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.790> edges<00:02:46.120> down<00:02:46.299> so<00:02:46.540> it's

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
sponge and sponge the edges down so it's

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.330 
sponge and sponge the edges down so it's
nice<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.079> smooth<00:02:47.379> this<00:02:47.920> will<00:02:48.069> give<00:02:48.189> you<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
nice and smooth this will give you a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.339 
nice and smooth this will give you a
nice<00:02:48.519> transition<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:49.480> opposed<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.930> having<00:02:50.140> a

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
nice transition as opposed to having a

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.020 
nice transition as opposed to having a
strong<00:02:50.590> edge<00:02:50.920> with<00:02:51.730> the<00:02:51.819> particular

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
strong edge with the particular

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.819 
strong edge with the particular
prosthetic<00:02:52.750> because<00:02:53.290> this<00:02:53.439> is<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.620> machine

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
prosthetic because this is a machine

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.009 
prosthetic because this is a machine
look<00:02:54.400> I'm<00:02:54.760> really<00:02:55.150> going<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.329> leave<00:02:55.480> the<00:02:55.629> edges

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
look I'm really going to leave the edges

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.740 
look I'm really going to leave the edges
hard<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.590> rigid<00:02:56.739> on<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.099> edges<00:02:57.459> but<00:02:58.000> inside

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
hard and rigid on the edges but inside

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.390 
hard and rigid on the edges but inside
the<00:02:58.870> eye<00:02:58.900> area<00:02:59.500> here<00:02:59.889> I<00:03:00.040> will<00:03:00.579> do<00:03:00.790> here<00:03:05.340> now<00:03:06.340> you

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
the eye area here I will do here now you

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.800 
the eye area here I will do here now you
use<00:03:06.639> a<00:03:06.670> blow<00:03:07.000> dryer<00:03:07.359> to<00:03:07.389> dry<00:03:07.689> the<00:03:07.959> glue<00:03:08.230> quickly

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.540 

so<00:03:11.810> once<00:03:12.050> all<00:03:12.170> the<00:03:12.230> glue<00:03:12.530> is<00:03:12.710> dried<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.070> it's

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
so once all the glue is dried and it's

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.460 
so once all the glue is dried and it's
clear<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:14.210> that's<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.540> great<00:03:14.750> indication<00:03:15.350> that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
clear and that's a great indication that

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.170 
clear and that's a great indication that
it's<00:03:15.650> dry<00:03:16.540> he'll<00:03:17.540> go<00:03:17.720> in<00:03:17.960> with<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.200> powder<00:03:18.530> and

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
it's dry he'll go in with a powder and

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.060 
it's dry he'll go in with a powder and
gently<00:03:20.180> use<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.390> very<00:03:20.870> small<00:03:20.990> amount<00:03:21.740> of<00:03:21.800> powder

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
gently use a very small amount of powder

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:46.899 
gently use a very small amount of powder
and<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:22.970> will<00:03:23.180> set<00:03:23.540> any<00:03:24.050> of<00:03:24.590> the<00:03:24.680> prosthetic

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.430 

you'll<00:03:47.909> notice<00:03:48.150> I've<00:03:48.269> rubbed<00:03:48.810> over<00:03:49.140> a<00:03:49.170> lot<00:03:49.409> of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
you'll notice I've rubbed over a lot of

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.920 
you'll notice I've rubbed over a lot of
