00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 

so<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> started<00:01:35.729> seeing<00:01:35.969> these<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
ago and they taste a little bit

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.069 
ago and they taste a little bit
different<00:01:43.140> than<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> orange<00:01:43.979> carrots<00:01:47.960> and<00:01:48.960> I

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
different than the orange carrots and I

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.029 
different than the orange carrots and I
got<00:01:49.259> some<00:01:49.950> cauliflower<00:01:50.420> now<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.860> know<00:01:53.009> if

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
you can get a perspective of the size

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.679

three<00:02:06.360> US<00:02:06.630> dollars<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.679> this<00:02:07.799> little<00:02:08.039> head<00:02:08.640> of

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
cauliflower that says right here it's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.509

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
from focus there No so this from Hugo

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.150 
from focus there No so this from Hugo
prefecture<00:02:17.519> so<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> has<00:02:18.030> grown<00:02:18.269> locally

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
prefecture so this has grown locally

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.839
