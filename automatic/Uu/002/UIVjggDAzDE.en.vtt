00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:06.080
 with the intention of informing you in an abusive way of our intention 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.350
 is that the rains affect 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.590
 is to take information to information only people 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.120
 and today we are going to talk about the issue 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.929
 of height 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.789
 when when someone asks clients to search for great minds so 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.880
 higher than in reality that way 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.880
 What you really wanted was in the head of the producer 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.689
 and passes on the heads of the saints 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.210
 and he's what we're going to start talking about 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.210
 good our system 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.020
 of the tonal system 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.060
 the tonal system he set up by all these fears 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.530
 then the system is totally different 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.530
 our system comes in 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.480
 for being beaten we went 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.040
 colonized by 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.810
 people see what we have 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.750
 efe this song 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.870
 we started there is more involvement than 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080
 on top of concepts 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.200
 studied and reviewed by the Europeans then in our music are our 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 we are in the tonal system 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.050
 and in the tonal system we have to unravel 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 What is the distance between the intervals 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.730
 for example the pain scale everyone is part of the April will be 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.799
 this scale 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.259
 she has a great distance from the north so when someone loses a title 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.870
 also produces 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.560
 is wanting the distance 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.380
 that the inner hopper because he was the singer 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.189
 several secretaries currently have baskets for example 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.270
 someone with the singer asks me 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.619
 He plays on me, what do I mean when we have to think 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.540
 have to think that it will be on the larger pain scale 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.540
 worse than that means to be masking the biggest 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.660
 before passing power he must have internally these distances 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.599
 as well 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.469
 good 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.599
 the structure of the pain scale 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.759
 she follows pattern 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:23.759
 each scale note 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.449
 has a distance 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:30.889
 and each time scale note 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:36.519
 in these states, then the first degree of the scale corresponds to 20% of the 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.439
 duvalier 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:42.699
 this is the second grade can be quickly in this event 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:47.459
 on Sunday the third grade for the fourth game made it easy 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:49.319
 of fact 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.849
 for the show 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.569
 kia of 4th degree degree we have distance of slightly 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.139
 no show 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.290
 to the side 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 the price of the kilo of the degree of doctor the sixth degree of pain I have the owners 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.099
 also distance 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.089
 on the federal revenue side 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:09.239
 for the site is the human being also have the tone away 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.430
 including that the seventh grade 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.859
 for Doctor Eight Best Screenplay 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.389
 man went into a trance 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.939
 what would then be 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:17.900
 one all 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.239
 in a segment 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.260
 in our system would be smaller the less distance 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.410
 if he felipe 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.410
 and at greater distance he gave way 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.140
 restlessness here 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.359
 in relation to the cup 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.359
 of a note to come back 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.330
 looks 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.129
 here she is the mccoy very simple 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.569
 but on the head of man 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.809
 every musician 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:43.579
 dre and instrumentalist 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.120
 son of the musician who is 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.919
 vocalist works a little differently 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.340
 because sometimes 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.110
 and often the vocal musician the vocalist musician 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.309
 he has 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:00.500
 subjectivities and on top of what he 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.190
 accustomed to listen and never stopped to analyze exactly those questions 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.989
 I use seeds and see these 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.279
 this feature is looking for some information 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.210
 this is important 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.029
 we begin to observe 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.549
 on the day that we are asking for protection and defense of the arts 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.099
 What you actually like singing 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.179
 You want to destroy it said yesterday that the instrumentalist is waiting for you 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.800
 this is our first information 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.250
 On top of this preliminary information, more and more people 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:36.869
 we will start in the next to develop our language tÃ¡ 

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:37.759
 cool 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.879
 it was a pleasure 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.270
 A big hug to all of you, Tatiana.
