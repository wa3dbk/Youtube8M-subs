right here we have our target mode one

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
right here we have our target mode one
point<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:07.920> point<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:09.290> unzip<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.960> have

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
point two point one unzip it and we have

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.090 
point two point one unzip it and we have
all<00:01:13.350> these<00:01:13.770> files<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:15.590> we<00:01:16.590> need<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> take

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
all these files in here we need to take

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.140 
all these files in here we need to take
all<00:01:17.369> these<00:01:17.520> files<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.130> put<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.520> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
all these files and put them in the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.469

minecraft.jar<00:01:22.670> which<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.060> bin<00:01:24.240> folder

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
minecraft.jar which is in a bin folder

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.600 
minecraft.jar which is in a bin folder
so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.320> can<00:01:25.470> do<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.830> multiple<00:01:26.310> multiple

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
so you can do this in multiple multiple

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
so you can do this in multiple multiple
ways<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.330> i'm<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> by<00:01:28.259> other

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
ways but i'm going to do it by other

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.830 
ways but i'm going to do it by other
things<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:29.280> pie<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:30.540> it's<00:01:30.659> from<00:01:30.780> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
things is a pie like think it's from the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
things is a pie like think it's from the
mac<00:01:31.110> app<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> called<00:01:31.829> V<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.220> archiver

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
mac app so it's called V an archiver

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.020 
mac app so it's called V an archiver
although<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.570> could<00:01:33.750> find<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.290> google<00:01:34.740> and

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
although you could find it on google and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
although you could find it on google and
it<00:01:36.030> basically<00:01:36.210> archives<00:01:37.020> any<00:01:37.439> documents<00:01:38.189> so

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
it basically archives any documents so

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
it basically archives any documents so
i'm<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.520> going<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.790> put<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.320> beer
