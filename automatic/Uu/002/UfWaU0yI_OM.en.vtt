 I am andy and welcome friends and this 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.540
 week I want to share with you the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.000
 recipe for stuffed artichokes and how 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.539
 all my recipes this is also very 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.550
 simple to do so let's start with 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.980
 the ingredients 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.669
 artichokes previously engraved and a 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.280
 lime onion and chopped parsley 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.770
 Parmesan 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:36.180
 ground bread whether they are in sachets 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:38.520
 control or you garlic salt and pepper 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.400
 Last bacon I recommend you look 3 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.400
 optional had a knife for part 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.719
 Now we are all the ingredients 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.039
 i 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.170
 d 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.970
 I will 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.400
 in my case that 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.020
 ah 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.170
 ah 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.950
 ah 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.689
 well now let's cut the plus or 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.930
 less like half and then we're going to 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.930
 cut 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 yes 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.960
 we also paint the leaves of 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.400
 beginning 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.879
 here 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.510
 and this 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.930
 it is this 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930
 same 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.250
 or be quick 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.250
 the lemon is so that 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.330
 all right 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.160
 Now let's remove the center 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.850
 court 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.850
 healthy 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:30.989
 well now let's put stuffed 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.989
 in the center and then in everything 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.770
 once we have put all the stuffing 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.350
 in all our artichokes we are going to 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.540
 put a little more than that go that 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.660
 then we are going to toast the elements 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.300
 re-shot 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.180
 Y 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.880
 our oven has to be 350 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.860
 degrees and we're going to put it approximately 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.890
 about 45 minutes 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.370
 our next step will be to put oil 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:09.370
 and reality 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.970
 either with a skewer a small bottle 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.500
 how are you in the form of spray or 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.620
 you can simply put it together with your 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.260
 fingers 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.870
 finally we are going to put approximately 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:28.400
 a quarter of water container we cut 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.960
 pieces of animal and the ope the other 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:35.789
 half we explain it everywhere 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.789
 and we cover very 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:52.809
 the 45 minutes have passed, let's check 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.809
 how are our anchovies 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.240
 let's leave uncovered now 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:02.460
 approximately 10 minutes to toast 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.460
 how much state I assume 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.580
 we spent it very carefully 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.580
 and in aromas 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.800
 and to accompany we are going to put 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.620
 butter part of you 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.470
 that's how our wind rates stayed 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.780
 sabella 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.420

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.730
