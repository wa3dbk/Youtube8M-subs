00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello how about friends applaud 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.970
 production with these guys good 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.120
 here we are with mission number 2 of 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.490
 the guide to obtain the pure gold trophy 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.140
 of the big one of fire and then boys 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.560
 I will quickly comment on the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.440
 four requirements to be able to take out is 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.910
 this good the gold medal in this 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.590
 mission in particular that is the mission 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.570
 number two since the prologue comes to be 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.210
 mission number one 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.430
 and then boys quickly here or 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.110
 well start the game when you are in 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.239
 this part and they come out in the part 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.750
 top left the message that says 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.570
 that pressing l 3 and r3 can use the 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.370
 franklin's special ability 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.250
 boys quickly tighten it and if 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.040
 they are fixed in the lower left 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.460
 there is a yellow bar that means 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.320
 that is how long will the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.260
 franklin's skill then they have 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.629
 to spend it completely 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.360
 and once they spend it completely they go 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.759
 to meet one of the four requirements 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.759
 that they need to be able to get the 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.130
 gold medal then this is a 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.649
 very important advice as soon as it comes out 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.320
 the option when they fold in that part of 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:21.680
 the good track or road as you 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.500
 they want to call him they squeeze him l 3 and r3 and he goes 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.770
 to activate the east as the specialty 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.780
 from franklin 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.490
 from there now let's talk I think that 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.450
 let's get to the point where we're going 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.149
 to go to the second requirement that is we come 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.479
 in peace that is not touching the 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.369
 aliens from the movie studio boys not 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.159
 be what I know they have to beat him 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.860
 to the sea in the race but go bring 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.600
 quiet for example here have a lot 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.259
 Beware of these characters that are 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.780
 that are dressed as aliens just 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.780
 try to blow the horn 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 but peter that's why they move and go 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.350
 quiet when it comes to bending boys 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.530
 do well tighten the brake and 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.390
 do your curve well we do not want to damage the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.489
 car remember that another of the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.850
 requirements to get the gold medal 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.480
 is not to damage the car and deliver it 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.230
 Well, a normal condition, for example 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.180
 this part of the road is not 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.230
 go crazy and look like 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.720
 whores you want to make a somersault 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.459
 but just go quiet I know 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.519
 that as I told you before, you have to 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.470
 beat the race to the sea but here 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.360
 obviously you do not get the map where 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.269
 you have to go and stop the other but 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.550
 there is a trick that in the end before 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.040
 get to the final stretch that comes to be 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.829
 by 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.500
 they have to go through a garage then 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.689
 there they will use the skill again 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.829
 special franklin and with that they will 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.659
 make win the race 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.260
 now they will see it in the video 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.670
 then just follow it to the sea as you 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.150
 I say 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:11.349
 I do not know what not bind much the car 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.239
 and then we have fulfilled until now 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.610
 the first one was to use the skill of 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.520
 franklin that are 7 seconds they have 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.580
 to use it 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.800
 Well from the beginning we already killed him 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.180
 no aliens carry two and 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060
 boy here for example in this part 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.430
 video go quiet do not be what ok or 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.860
 once there right there where the 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.410
 direction arrows to squeeze the 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.980
 franklin's ability and they will be able to 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.550
 winning the race to the sea and that's how 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.650
 you are going to be able to get the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.200
 gold medal in this mission in 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.320
 particular at the beginning for me this 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:53.950
 mission was a bit difficult but in 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.510
 two more attempts and you can take it out 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.030
 I understood a lot how to win the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.550
 alhama but with the ability 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.070
 special they will be able to beat him then 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.080
 you follow these steps boys and 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.720
 just in case you do not forget not to scratch the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.760
 truck then here just after 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.650
 win the race of the sea try to 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.510
 lose the cops I cut the 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.239
 scenes since I delayed like 5 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.820
 6 minutes to lose them and once you 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.489
 lose they will leave the signal that 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.230
 where do they have to go then just go 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.840
 quiet 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:30.760
 do not touch anything go with caution and then 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.340
 there you will direct them on the map to 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.870
 deliver the car because it has been seized 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.020
 since that is one of the first 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.680
 missions that is going to be frank franklin was 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.680
 take on web 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.740
 what more boys to see good already 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.939
 we meet all four requirements in 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.940
 the description of the video will be 

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:54.600
 anything 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.190
 related to this mission and well 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.400
 cut the scenes boys of the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.670
 video game since this is a guide 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:06.150
 and you will already know that youtube is 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.850
 web king in did videos where they come out 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:10.380
 the scenes and all this history and 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.550
 it is not necessary for me to put it 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.510
 here in this video not just 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.370
 show you the easiest way to get out 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.980
 the golden measure in this mission in 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.770
 particular and well either do not forget 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:24.900
 that tomorrow there will be another mission that 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.090
 it's going to be the third one and we're going to try 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.419
 to achieve that gold medal 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.250
 rather the gold curved trophy 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.100
 then no more here they are already 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.729
 quietly to the house of franklin van 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:42.340
 to I think there's more going quiet 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:44.440
 that this car can scratch it like 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.960
 you want and so basically 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.419
 it's how the 5th gta begins 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.860
 well there in the garage guys for 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.770
 example can they keep their cars 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.080
 that you want and this that the other and 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.090
 once they have left, then this 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.470
 scene I do not know if I cut it well I think 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:05.060
 yes and let's see if we've got 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.060
 the requirements to be able to take the 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.830
 mediator then we wait a little and 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.080
 we're going to be here where we 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.199
 says mission exceeded says no scratch 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.389
 check driver concentrated winner and 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:20.199
 good boys see you next time 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.199
 well I know a lot
