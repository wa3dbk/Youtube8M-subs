I<00:00:00.060> don't<00:00:00.390> let<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.570> hunter<00:00:04.250> the<00:00:05.250> scouts<00:00:05.520> are

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
I don't let the hunter the scouts are

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.120 
I don't let the hunter the scouts are
very<00:00:05.879> good<00:00:06.150> but<00:00:06.330> when<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.350> go<00:00:07.410> first<00:00:07.799> while

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
very good but when I go first while

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.220 
very good but when I go first while
growth<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.550> such<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> big<00:00:09.059> deal<00:00:09.240> because<00:00:09.960> you

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
growth is such a big deal because you

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.280 
growth is such a big deal because you
get<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> temple<00:00:10.860> lights<00:00:10.980> back<00:00:11.599> yeah<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:13.110> get

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
get the temple lights back yeah you get

get the temple lights back yeah you get
the<00:00:13.380> temples<00:00:13.889> back<00:00:14.130> with<00:00:15.379> Yukos<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.740> back

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
the temples back with Yukos I can back

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.060 
the temples back with Yukos I can back
off<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.220> really<00:00:17.490> much<00:00:17.670> worse<00:00:17.880> again<00:00:18.119> Santa

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
off it's really much worse again Santa

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.830 
off it's really much worse again Santa
because<00:00:20.070> they<00:00:20.250> usually<00:00:20.730> open<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.330> for<00:00:21.510> 21

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
because they usually open it for 21

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.890 
because they usually open it for 21
million<00:00:24.289> but<00:00:25.289> when<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.500> go<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:26.689> Mulligan<00:00:27.689> for

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
million but when I go first Mulligan for

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:37.520 
million but when I go first Mulligan for
it<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.880> innovates<00:00:35.899> current<00:00:36.899> mad<00:00:37.020> scientist

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
it and innovates current mad scientist

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.410 
it and innovates current mad scientist
that<00:00:37.710> usually<00:00:38.160> means<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.850> here's<00:00:39.180> another

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
that usually means that here's another

turn<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.960> play<00:00:40.230> sawdust<00:00:41.160> awesome<00:00:42.410> well<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> will

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
turn to play sawdust awesome well I will

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.170 
turn to play sawdust awesome well I will
probably<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.190> free<00:00:44.550> straight<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.090> you'll

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
probably get free straight and you'll

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.260 
probably get free straight and you'll
see<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:47.510> have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> shrine<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.200> harrison<00:00:49.590> jones

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
see I have to shrine to harrison jones

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.330 
see I have to shrine to harrison jones
if<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.449> decide<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.989> keep<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.410> bow<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.860> turn<00:00:53.070> free

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
if you decide to keep a bow in turn free

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.920 
if you decide to keep a bow in turn free
which<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.059> likely<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.660> i<00:00:54.690> play

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
which is kind of likely because i play

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.170 
which is kind of likely because i play
this<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.920> died<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.000> ball

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
this right and we just died to the ball

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
this right and we just died to the ball
and<00:00:59.300> then<00:01:00.300> then<00:01:00.539> i<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.050> proc<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> free<00:01:01.710> strip

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
and then then i can proc the free strip

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
and then then i can proc the free strip
with<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.399> full<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.850> nature<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.660> more

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
with the full of nature it's just more

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.890 
with the full of nature it's just more
likely<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.260> he<00:01:04.619> has<00:01:05.270> freezing<00:01:06.270> trap<00:01:06.420> just

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
likely that he has freezing trap just

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.830 
likely that he has freezing trap just
like<00:01:07.100> just<00:01:08.100> statistically<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.360> most<00:01:09.390> play

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
like just statistically the most play

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.320 
like just statistically the most play
trap<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.409> free<00:01:10.710> strap<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.760> because<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
trap is free strap just because it's the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.130 
trap is free strap just because it's the
best<00:01:12.360> rap<00:01:13.760> okay<00:01:14.760> leper<00:01:15.180> gnome<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.990> an

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
best rap okay leper gnome is like an

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.010 
best rap okay leper gnome is like an
indication<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:18.920> explosive<00:01:19.920> trap<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:24.020> think

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
indication for explosive trap I think

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.300 
indication for explosive trap I think
it's<00:01:25.140> still<00:01:25.229> better<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.680> play<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> shredder

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
it's still better to play the shredder

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
it's still better to play the shredder
or<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.909> hero<00:01:27.299> powering<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.170> being<00:01:28.380> behind

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
or a hero powering and just being behind

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.690 
or a hero powering and just being behind
them<00:01:28.829> board<00:01:31.040> all<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.220> Mitchell<00:01:32.820> voice<00:01:34.700> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
them board all right Mitchell voice this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.300 
them board all right Mitchell voice this
means<00:01:36.000> he<00:01:36.270> probably<00:01:36.900> runs<00:01:37.380> explosive<00:01:38.070> trap

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
means he probably runs explosive trap

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.130 
means he probably runs explosive trap
because<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.850> he<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.650> a<00:01:41.240> freezing<00:01:42.240> trap<00:01:42.390> he

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
because if he has a freezing trap he

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.109 
because if he has a freezing trap he
would<00:01:43.259> probably<00:01:43.500> just<00:01:43.860> attack<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.850> can't

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
would probably just attack it so I can't

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.120 
would probably just attack it so I can't
kill<00:01:45.329> me<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.659> for<00:01:45.869> free<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.950> see

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
kill me so for free and there you see

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.710 
kill me so for free and there you see
the<00:01:47.159> difference<00:01:47.369> between<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.119> show<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:50.720> how

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the difference between you show and how

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.600 
the difference between you show and how
this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> interesting<00:01:52.770> because<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.399> now

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
this is interesting because I could now

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
this is interesting because I could now
just<00:01:53.880> play<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> Harrison<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> minion<00:01:55.259> on

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
just play the Harrison as a minion on

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.510 
just play the Harrison as a minion on
board<00:01:57.079> if<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.229> hear<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> powerless<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.130> down<00:01:59.340> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
board if I hear a powerless one down I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
board if I hear a powerless one down I
could<00:01:59.729> hear<00:01:59.939> power<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.479> down<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.930> wild

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
could hear power this one down and wild

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.069 
could hear power this one down and wild
growth<00:02:03.740> let's<00:02:04.740> play<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.100> Harrison<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:06.630> text

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
growth let's play the Harrison it text

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.070 
growth let's play the Harrison it text
those<00:02:07.229> tool<00:02:07.640> can<00:02:08.640> kill<00:02:08.789> whatever<00:02:09.000> he<00:02:09.300> plays<00:02:09.539> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
those tool can kill whatever he plays of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.040 
those tool can kill whatever he plays of
the<00:02:10.140> Emperor

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
the Emperor

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.220 
the Emperor
I<00:02:11.730> don't<00:02:12.730> really<00:02:12.880> need<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.210> mana<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.840> I<00:02:13.870> guess

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
I don't really need the mana so I guess

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.020 
I don't really need the mana so I guess
Harrison<00:02:14.890> seems<00:02:15.100> strong<00:02:15.430> here<00:02:17.790> sort<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.940> more

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
Harrison seems strong here sort of more

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.720 
Harrison seems strong here sort of more
pressure<00:02:19.360> if<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:21.250> know<00:02:21.280> go<00:02:21.520> for

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
pressure if I just you know go for

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:38.130 
pressure if I just you know go for
killing<00:02:22.090> him

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.870 

I<00:02:38.200> don't<00:02:38.860> want<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.069> procure<00:02:39.340> trap<00:02:39.580> because<00:02:39.730> I

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
I don't want to procure trap because I

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.220 
I don't want to procure trap because I
don't<00:02:40.120> want<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.300> give<00:02:40.420> him<00:02:40.540> both<00:02:40.720> charges<00:02:41.050> i

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
don't want to give him both charges i

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.160 
don't want to give him both charges i
think<00:02:41.440> i<00:02:41.530> just<00:02:41.560> go<00:02:42.040> for<00:02:43.920> or<00:02:44.920> i<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.520> for<00:02:46.170> shade

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
think i just go for or i go for shade

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
though I think for us is pretty good I

00:03:27.359 --> 00:04:05.900 
though I think for us is pretty good I

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:16.349 

I<00:04:06.030> think<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.870> right

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359

taunt<00:04:40.050> plus<00:04:40.500> Laura<00:04:50.180> this<00:04:51.180> would<00:04:51.330> be<00:04:51.360> explosive
