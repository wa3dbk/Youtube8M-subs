 with furniture high and low furniture in 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.090
 this super elegant combination that already 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.400
 you have seen in other our projects 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.770
 which is white as a casino and the board 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.350
 of the kitchen with initial granite 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.700
 super chic cooking now in the area of 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.620
 the bedrooms that the services are 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.360
 quite large that we have in large 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.010
 this has its little room inside the 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.260
 fourth of the fil the same we have the 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.570
 secondary squares now you have 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.090
 said are very broad and in one of them 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.710
 we have a dressing room where you can is 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.530
 totally independent can do a 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.380
 goal that even if they wanted and also in 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.120
 the master bedroom comes with closet 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.680
 and a spectacular terrace for those who 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.030
 they have the most beautiful view of the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.060
 Main bedroom 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.550
 I really stay in love 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.600
 of this project because it 's super wide 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.100
 good decoration is not part of the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.990
 department purchase but this line 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.190
 and they can copy it, it's not good 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.170
 so 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.180
 one last question when I interviewed 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.670
 these departments we are delivering to 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:00.490
 from the month of August next year 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.580
 already that is to say let's have time for 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:05.500
 to save vouchers to give and just like 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.940
 you know we're always taking the 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.740
 facilities for clients with the theme 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.480
 of the initial fee as I told you 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.450
 separate with only one thousand suns the 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.280
 department and then we can converse 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.110
 the subject of the initial suddenly out there 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.780
 divide because sometimes not all 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.160
 they can pay the rent and the credit 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.720
 mortgage at a time then we are 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.310
 giving facilities so that they can 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.990
 work directly with our 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.760
 minister that some last little thing that 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.230
 is forgetting laundry has 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.730
 laundry clear that we do have a 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:33.040
 large laundry where you enter 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.130
 quietly all all things the 

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.800
 washer dryer have for a piece of furniture 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.150
 super independent makes good flaw 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.820
 then let's see the images of 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.660
 this 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.660

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.819
