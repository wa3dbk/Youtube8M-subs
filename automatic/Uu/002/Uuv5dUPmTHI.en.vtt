00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.180
 We want the multimedia features 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.440
 from the mgp 720 optimus 3d max once 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.500
 take a closer look 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 yes it is a 3d device 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 stereoscopic can be here in 3d 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.020
 be presented and the whole without 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.630
 glasses that your eyes are counting on her 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.010
 gets almost two pictures displayed 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.250
 the camera that works great 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.800
 You can do 3d photos and 3d videos 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.870
 the whole thing is both in the recording 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.789
 as shown in the after 3d in order 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.079
 looks awesome can you guys with 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.449
 But like me already 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 mentioned that goes pretty well on the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.440
 eyes or on the head so you can there 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.809
 really filling up a little weird 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.519
 but then the function is there and 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.140
 works great and what can it do 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.260
 whole device so that can still here 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.100
 Of course it can also play 3D games 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.600
 represent 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.800
 you have here now 3d space on 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.179
 I have deposited you on homescreen 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.339
 already shown before 

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:02.489
 and there now has 3D Games apps camera 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.680
 gallery youtube 3d guide games apps 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.500
 camera so what games do we have here 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.160
 Let's look at Novas as an expert 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 golf gulliver's travels and catch 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.490
 just with nova 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.130
 I had already played the game 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.930
 before and after I was already one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.300
 little bad what can you say 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 So you personally only see it now 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.670
 here the 2d view not the 3d view 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.440
 like me and the game is really 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 shown well and looks in 3d 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.450
 actually also very good only needs 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.580
 You always really frontal on it 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.410
 look because otherwise you sometimes see 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.900
 an element twice as here 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.150
 anyway so you see her here 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.710
 opponents partly because it is so 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.080
 by two pictures 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.909
 Nevertheless, it runs very smoothly like you 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.360
 it's definitely fun to see 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.930
 and in 3d actually a whole 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.940
 new 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.240
 I would not say new but mine 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.119
 different playing experience and has already 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.159
 A great effect only as I said 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.069
 must pay attention to how to look up 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.800
 this device and that pleases in this 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.230
 play asphalt 6 again in more detail 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.510
 I have the game on mine myself 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 Smartphone, too, I can direct that way 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.590
 by moving the device that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.680
 does not work here anymore 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.019
 because we can guess if you do that 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.700
 whole move then you see some 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:33.690
 elements at once only in 3d 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.940
 once only twice and not 3d is that 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.250
 what are you doing since you are distracting now 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.720
 here with the thumb so and the like 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.730
 Personally, I'm not so good 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.980
 because I'm not good at it anyway 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.470
 am racing to play and if I now have a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.510
 then strange control is even more so 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.880
 not but as I said there is no 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 possibility if you would end up like this 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.620
 then the presentation is in any case 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.350
 not so great 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.840
 yes you can of course play games 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.880
 convert from 2d to 3d 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.010
 Well, that means, of course, pushing here 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.380
 plus then you add the whole thing and 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.570
 then I have the games here and I can 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.680
 Calling them in 3d , but what can 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.230
 to say so 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.079
 agent of actually a very good 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.459
 shown game looks like 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.030
 nothing would have changed 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.070
 bed peace or tide ninja come in the menu 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.989
 Let's do it a little bit like 3D while 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.930
 of playing is only sometimes there 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.530
 not really a 3d deep now 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.079
 see 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.670
 and somehow does the converter 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.070
 because you can not really do that now 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.049
 change the 3d depth here 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.150
 but even that has nothing for me 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.980
 I'll just start it 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.870
 play that was already in yes belief 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.260
 I was already seeing you on it 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.780
 I did not know that right now 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.780
 stupid advertising so and now it starts 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:59.810
 and let's look at it again is see 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.560
 a little bit so 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.799
 but somehow it is not comparable 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.420
 they are already playing with the others here 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.659
 be included 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.769
 yes, what I've asked myself in general 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.480
 I have not figured out yet 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.840
 I googled in the place tor 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.750
 Looking for how to find 3d games now 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.829
 which for a 3d use so directly 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.830
 they are not suitable 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.889
 must convert 3d bohlingen mobile 3 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.050
 3d of course that is something completely different 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.759
 just means that the graphic 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.130
 it is more elaborate but it is now 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.650
 not shown here in 3d on this one 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.120
 because of this, how do you look for the whole thing 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.009
 can you say in the comments 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.470
 I really have not found a solution 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:44.570
 I've also googled and said that 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.479
 not able to find out the convert 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.740
 it does not work as well as it does 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.870
 described here 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.550
 yes, but we still have the quadrant here 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.159
 standard and easy to make even a 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.990
 benchmark test before i finish all apps 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:01.580
 and then let's see how it works 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.289
 so we'll have a look 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.970
 the result of benchmark that then 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.669
 once here press now and then 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:12.940
 get you a listing judy here 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:16.940
 white 2418 we have cpu 3756 here 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.560
 memory 2921 about it more htc vaneks 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.009
 transformer prime and so on and so on 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:24.830
 continue tab galaxy nexus optimus and then 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.380
 the wisdom comes under htc desire hd 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.690
 yes, so you have the overview 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.430
 got over how the device here 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.860
 we want to be arranged now 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.560
 once again briefly test the nfc tags 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.229
 switch on here and then have it 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.840
 Here are three different tags in the 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:45.020
 scope of delivery are included look what 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.550
 the one we once came to fashion 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.150
 and office mode and if you like the whole 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.870
 Now here's holding vibrates and then 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.310
 you have an unknown text here 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.980
 So last time, actually 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.320
 realized what I wanted to do here 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.390
 so now we barely get up and there is 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:09.020
 the navigation starts automatically 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.610
 we can see so accept and then 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.050
 are you in the navigation 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.610
 if now out again and came up 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.070
 hauswald then I pushed on here 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.590
 disable or auto mode so and then 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:26.020
 we still love fashion here that we have 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:28.970
 What happens then nothing 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.200
 and now we are can see 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.200
 screen brightness is 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.910
 Shut down on here once 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.760
 deactivate and we are back in 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.730
 normal mode so nfc tags here 

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.050
 just like sticky buttons are 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.680
 maybe not as expensive as that of 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:48.410
 sony sony cost 14 99 and are 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.490
 made of metal so thicker are the free ones 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.470
 I do not have the cheap one now 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.770
 looked up for the cost so much 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.170
 to the multimedia settings of ngp 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.530
 720 optimus 3d max if your further 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.300
 Find information then go to www 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.340
 handy.de if you compare contracts 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:08.470
 wanted and so on then go to www
