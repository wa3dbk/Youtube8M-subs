so<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.420> parameter<00:02:15.930> has<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> limited<00:02:16.650> start<00:02:17.010> and

so the parameter has a limited start and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.590 
so the parameter has a limited start and
stop<00:02:17.610> range<00:02:19.010> for<00:02:20.010> example<00:02:20.610> by<00:02:21.060> setting<00:02:21.480> the
