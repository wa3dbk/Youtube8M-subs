00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
possible here we have our preheated oil

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.080 
possible here we have our preheated oil
and<00:01:13.999> I<00:01:14.749> have<00:01:14.899> heated<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.469> oil<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.159> 315

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and I have heated this oil to 315

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.060 
and I have heated this oil to 315
degrees<00:01:17.479> which<00:01:17.929> I<00:01:18.079> found<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.590> be<00:01:18.679> pretty

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
degrees which I found to be pretty

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.340 
degrees which I found to be pretty
effective<00:01:19.729> when<00:01:20.359> frying<00:01:20.630> up<00:01:20.869> some<00:01:21.079> fish

up and as it cooks it will start to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.590 
up and as it cooks it will start to
float<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:44.899> top<00:01:45.549> and<00:01:46.549> what<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.939> is<00:01:47.119> entirely
