hero Rico 5k so I'm just going to get
right<00:00:18.210> into<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:21.830> use<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> bit<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.189> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
right into it I use a bit of a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.240 
right into it I use a bit of a
combination<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:24.170> Curtis<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.439> Marie<00:00:25.740> Carter's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
combination of Curtis and Marie Carter's

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.599 
combination of Curtis and Marie Carter's
techniques<00:00:27.349> I<00:00:28.349> tend<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.949> use<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.130> little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.519> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
techniques I tend to use a little bit of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.939 
techniques I tend to use a little bit of
a<00:00:29.730> strapping<00:00:30.210> technique<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> whole<00:00:30.929> time<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
a strapping technique the whole time I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.290 
a strapping technique the whole time I
hope<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.730> find<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.210> helps<00:00:33.480> keep<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.200> nice

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
hope I find that this helps keep a nice

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.910 
hope I find that this helps keep a nice
even<00:00:36.300> edge<00:00:36.690> when<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.050> get<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> tip<00:00:37.710> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
even edge when you get up to the tip and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.340 
even edge when you get up to the tip and
since<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.610> don't<00:00:38.670> sharpen<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.390> sections<00:00:39.660> um

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
since I don't sharpen it in sections um

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.950 
since I don't sharpen it in sections um
it's<00:00:41.100> kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.489> necessity<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:42.059> stay<00:00:42.329> even<00:00:42.360> I

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that i do a little differently is i keep

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.149 
that i do a little differently is i keep
the<00:01:11.180> stone<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.750> an<00:01:12.900> angle<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.290> me<00:01:13.590> rather<00:01:14.010> than

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the stone at an angle to me rather than

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.969 
the stone at an angle to me rather than
straight<00:01:14.580> ahead<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.270> i<00:01:16.080> find<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> dead<00:01:16.590> helps

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
straight ahead and i find the dead helps

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.770 
straight ahead and i find the dead helps
with<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:20.030> right<00:01:21.030> side<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> blade<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
with the right side of the blade and

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.940 
with the right side of the blade and
keeps<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> mega<00:01:25.110> stone<00:01:27.200> nice<00:01:28.200> positioning

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
keeps the mega stone nice positioning

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.130 
keeps the mega stone nice positioning
for<00:01:28.979> me<00:01:29.369> rather<00:01:29.759> than<00:01:29.970> straight<00:01:30.509> ahead<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.840> find

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
for me rather than straight ahead I find

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.530 
for me rather than straight ahead I find
that<00:01:31.229> if<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> straight<00:01:31.860> ahead<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.460> end<00:01:33.450> up

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
that if I do it straight ahead I end up

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.310 
that if I do it straight ahead I end up
cocking<00:01:34.020> my<00:01:34.200> elbow<00:01:34.590> out<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> right

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.340 

so<00:01:42.320> move<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.009> down<00:01:43.189> here<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:43.579> you<00:01:43.640> can<00:01:43.759> get<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
so move it down here and you can get the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:55.380 
so move it down here and you can get the
feel<00:01:45.350> for<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.799> angle<00:01:53.380> I'm<00:01:54.380> also<00:01:54.619> not<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:54.950> very

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
feel for the angle I'm also not a very

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.910 
feel for the angle I'm also not a very
hard<00:01:56.390> sharpener<00:01:56.929> I<00:01:56.960> don't<00:01:57.229> go<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:57.679> gas<00:01:57.890> is

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
hard sharpener I don't go this gas is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.410 
hard sharpener I don't go this gas is
some<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.520> guys<00:01:58.700> I've<00:01:58.909> seen<00:01:59.149> in<00:01:59.299> their

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
videos I don't push as hard as some

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.190 
videos I don't push as hard as some
people<00:02:02.000> say<00:02:02.689> is<00:02:02.869> necessary<00:02:04.960> thing<00:02:05.960> is<00:02:06.079> how

I've<00:02:06.350> really<00:02:06.649> only<00:02:06.679> been<00:02:06.979> sharpening<00:02:07.520> for<00:02:08.509> a

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
I've really only been sharpening for a

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.600 
I've really only been sharpening for a
couple<00:02:08.929> years<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.289> don't<00:02:09.500> I<00:02:09.830> don't<00:02:10.220> mind

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.970 
couple years I don't I don't mind
spending<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.180> extra<00:02:11.209> time<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.500> feel<00:02:12.769> like

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
spending the extra time and I feel like

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.030 
spending the extra time and I feel like
I<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> little<00:02:14.060> more<00:02:14.450> room<00:02:14.630> for<00:02:14.870> error<00:02:15.140> if<00:02:15.860> I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I have a little more room for error if I

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.210 
I have a little more room for error if I
don't<00:02:16.100> push<00:02:16.459> really<00:02:16.700> hard<00:02:17.739> as<00:02:18.739> you<00:02:18.980> might<00:02:19.100> be
