 Hello dear friends, this is gameplay 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.290
 review on update for zombiewood game 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.750
 now this game has multiplayer 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.380
 and so there came from ikonochka 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.029
 network game go and see two modes 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.880
 games fat Challenge and online cat against 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.449
 Christmas Eve if we choose something here 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.670
 there is a certain championship mission and you with 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 friends compete who has more points in 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.219
 this championship stuff and can do 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.770
 here are the greenbacks 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.190
 zombie dollars and who accordingly 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.920
 wins the call that money and here 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.420
 online co - op mode I liked 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 much more and today we tried 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.140
 play it with our friends with 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.030
 our subscribers but for some reason playing 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.079
 absolutely does not want to add here 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.180
 all friends who i have on facebook 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.390
 here is such a department 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.760
 so dreamed with your subscribers 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 play online and help the zombies but 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.590
 unfortunately this failed and the game 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.680
 automatically picks up our players 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.380
 of the whole world and we are such a gang 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.080
 four people competing for three 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.070
 minutes destroy the most zombies and 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.900
 score the most points in 10 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 points are displayed i.e. tournament 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.659
 table 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 where you can in real time to dial in 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.759
 how to observe where you are 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.850
 you are and how many points you scored 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.950
 your rivals here also so in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.380
 normal game appears from time to time 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.570
 bonuses that must be selected for 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.479
 to kill most effectively 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.790
 zombary it can be various axes 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.259
 types of weapons of acceleration and so on in 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
 general obats 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.840
 the game tells you and I will not be my gist 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.140
 would you tell this update about 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.210
 multiplayer 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.850
 in general, so here for pretty 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.520
 interesting of course to play when you drench 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.759
 zombari on one location are not alone and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.310
 a crowd because of desperate players 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.259
 who also like you hate these 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.830
 zombary and very 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.590
 hurricane shoot them thanks to that 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.680
 that there are several in the game 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.140
 man do this game a few here 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.709
 even more hurricane even more 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.170
 crazy and even more addictive 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.860
 one more thing I can tell you sometimes 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.590
 the players 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:38.459
 they wait and leave the game 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:41.040
 pad before you play either 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.959
 kill them by the way here i am now 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.720
 used the first aid kit to 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.750
 heal and what would I do if lost 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.150
 this would complete your review here 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.480
 by the way this box and secret weapon and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.510
 it was a flying experience regret me 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.019
 killed we can rise again after 10 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.989
 seconds 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.510
 either come to life instantly for 2 a money 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.379
 why is it so important to live as you can 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.019
 this is more important in order for you not to 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.599
 overtaken on points but since we had 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.810
 big enough odds we could 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:23.400
 give way to our rival and wait in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.069
 Basically this is not a long time in general as 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.930
 for me it is very cool that in this 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.569
 multiplayer appeared in the game 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.209
 that's the only minus that I have and 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.470
 did not work all the same to play with 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.489
 your dudes 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.049
 and this disappointed me and so in principle 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.840
 update I am pleased with all the advice 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.209
 updated if someone succeeds 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.879
 play with your real friends 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.720
 write in the comments and tell how u 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.720
 you got it
