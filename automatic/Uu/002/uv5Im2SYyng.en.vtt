 Hello everyone, Alex and this 4 review 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.520
 mods what do we have today today 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.700
 also a small mod that adds 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.130
 new pistons these pistons are just 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.890
 awesome let's see everything and 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.500
 so we put each of them an obstacle 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.019
 block I will not move and look well 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.809
 ok nothing like that for 2 blocks 

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:45.870
 moves and each one is just 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:48.150
 drop dead here and so comrades this 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.269
 awesome mod I'm not tired of repeating 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.229
 since this mod just doesn't like me 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.809
 just pleases the eye awesome but to 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:59.850
 Sorry club such a problem is that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.610
 only one block can move 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 piston now this problem is solved 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.790
 We put as many units here though 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.350
 100 x 200 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 he'll move everything we'll see 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.090
 so unfortunately he only returns 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.640
 one vlog also those pistons are and not in 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.440
 sticky option let's move on 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:25.320
 Kraft is a network of pistons right here 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.510
 our smallest is just 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.500
 the piston there is the sticky piston just gone 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:35.760
 bti duty understood kravec they pretty 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 just a regular plunger sticky version then 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:44.130
 piston painted here so here is very 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:47.820
 just the next well and that is first 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.870
 to brighten up this nur craft here 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.820
 this is beautiful here 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.460
 so as to improve it turns out 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 red all again and improve red 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.440
 here later is purple in general I think 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.750
 that you all understood the same craft 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.060
 like a regular piston only instead of the lower 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.649
 blocks of cobblestone put 2 blocks 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:13.459
 obsidian and everything will be awesome 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.459
 let's see again 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 according to the mind it's awesome mod cool nothing 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.850
 you say cool but I think not echo 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:33.470
 runs away this general porsche a strongman runs away 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.590
 any number of blocks well the top edge 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.590
 row 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.040
 fine 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.740
 awesome comrades Well, I was wrong, he 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.680
 runs down the top row too 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:56.050
 which is pretty awesome here and so 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.560
