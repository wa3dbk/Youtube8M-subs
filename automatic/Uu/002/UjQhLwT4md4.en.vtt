00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
remember which actually the levels are a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
remember which actually the levels are a
bit<00:01:00.180> low<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.260> took<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.649> long<00:01:01.920> time

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

uphill<00:01:06.119> battle<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.320> guess<00:01:07.439> there's<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.159> I

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630

uphill battle so I guess there's that I
would<00:01:09.630> attempt<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.830> ish<00:01:10.950> accent<00:01:11.369> at
