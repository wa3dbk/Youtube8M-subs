 hello to all and 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.600
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.110
 we find ourselves for a brand new 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.970
 video 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.890
 so that would be a pretty good backup 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.040
 nice so that will be to have 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.000
 the cargo plane so there the cargo ship is a 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.440
 20s that does not exist in the mode 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.020
 history but we can still 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.210
 have thanks to a backup to whom we 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.309

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.410
 force and excerpt excuse me you 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.210

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.410

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.620
 your usb key and usb key to the 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.080
 console it must be all that is done that 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.700
 was going to use the utility 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.110
 backed up peripheral data 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.670
 usb you're going to take there backing up 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.670
 you go the copy 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.430
 must be done quickly 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.330
 once that's done you have 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.740
 you start the game nothing complicated 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.930
 so, fortunately, I'm starting 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.340

 which this save know is like 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.860
 the biggest plane of the game do the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.510
 bigger I think it's he's a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.660
 little bigger than the cargo plane 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.270
 finally the boeing plane or the big white 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.520
 heart fashion story so this algeria 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.980
 will be blue and black I believe in club the 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:48.290
 day where you will see we find ourselves 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.290
 just after we land 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:17.530
 you are like you 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.130
 can see it I'm crying the 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.220
 data confirm and only three 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.220
 years 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.989
 so to see them is the blue plane and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.299
 black so it's super beautiful so by 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.140
 against there is just the back that bug or 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.989
 by phone 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.480
 so there rebug a little so the invisible 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.340
 but hey it's one of the biggest planes 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.299
 looked at the boeing that is right behind 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.360
 compared to this monster urge so you 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.650
 can of course drive it so by 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.650
 contract to go slowly 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.489
 so I hope I would have liked 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.099

 even when badly eh is this 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.220
 plane I was going to say it's this little before 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.220
