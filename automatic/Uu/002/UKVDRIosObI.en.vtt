00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 It is a true fall of the course 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.000
 both precious metals gold and silver 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.700
 after gold the important 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 support line at $ 1,530 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.690
 There seems to be no break at this time 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.639
 keep giving more in silver is the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.039
 situation is even worse 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.090
 where does that come from and what are the investors? 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.380
 I want to do that today 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.330
 Knowledge of Michael Görgens Leiter 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.119
 fund trading on stuttgart stock exchange 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.320
 yes, I do what the etf 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.519
 Investors from the current situation 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 which we at the two precious metals 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.619
 so of course, of course, see 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.410
 gold what was the primary then also the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.600
 lead indication for silver is it 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.760
 of course so we the lowest 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.610
 stalls for two years 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.530
 that is the 1500 50s brand the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 in the end as well as the 30 daily cut 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 was actually in the past 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.579
 week then broken down and 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.860
 we already have the 1400 today 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.579
 US dollar mark per troy ounce gold 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.800
 seen 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.300
 Of course this is already a big trend 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.129
 Change, where does that come from? 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.070
 Of course it's on one side 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.589
 in particular the overall situation gold 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.020
 does not throw off any income is always off and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.790
 the whole crisis topic with one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 premium with a safety bonus 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
 been provided 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.939
 that is on the other side 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 now cyprus saved on the so to speak 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.509
 Altogether, funds were scarce 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.159
 over 10 billion euros here to 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.830
 provided for this 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.780
 of course, of course 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.670
 to provide appropriate security and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.159
 Mr. draghi has already been in the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.220
 last week indicated that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 also the possibility exists that cyprus 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 dissolve into his gold holdings for this purpose 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.970
 should or could 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.189
 here it is, of course 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.590
 decision of the central bank ob 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.360
 such a transaction comes to fruition 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.299
 one must not forget Cyprus owns 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 just under 14 tons of gold on this 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.270
 page 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.640
 that means we have several topics here 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.130
 that break into the situation 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 so that is practically a moment around 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.729
 arises that also gold altogether into 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.530
 you can not slip 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.590
 forget we have a total here 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.340
 funding costs of almost 950 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.429
 US dollar for the troy ounce gold if you 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.879
 looking at the gold noted 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.379
 in the highest in the year 2011 at scarce 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.150
 1900 50 dollars 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.340
 That was a premium safety bonus 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.189
 from just over 100 just now 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.140
 was reduced to 40 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:27.349
 I think we will be here in total 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.489
 of course, a movement against even 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:31.549
 see it in the short term 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.469
 But the trend has ushered in the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.989
 Security currency is now in question 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.939
 yes this trend is also included 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.469
 actually arrived to the investors 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.689
 because when we look at the table 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.579
 then it shows up in the past 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.439
 At least a lot of buyers are still shopping 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.049
 yes we have in particular of course 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:49.909
 Buyers seen outside of Europe 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.530
 we have a certain cabbage base 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.079
 I always say noise in etf 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.230
 just for the long-term investment it is so 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:59.569
 that investor is constant in etf swiss 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.599
 invest it is about savings 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.120
 or hold purchase orders more regularly 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.730
 nature on the stock exchange that means we have 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.760
 but overall the situation 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.620
 that the dax here between 7600 and 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.010
 7,900 points strong fluctuations 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.419
 Of course, often it is subject to one 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.590
 driven by that the 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.510
 economic conditions 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.949
 especially within the euro area 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.310
 to be in constant motion 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:30.290
 the themes italy greece cyprus 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.489
 these are of course house numbers the us 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.229
 Meet here daily 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.400
 on the other side it is so 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:39.470
 American stock market jumps from 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.150
 one up to the next so here 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.519
 Ultimately investors also stepped in 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.280
 The markets are also investing here 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.319
 to use an opposite pole 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.579
 Remember the German if you look 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.470
 then again a glance in the 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.840
 South American area there we had 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.549
 Of course, Venezuela was the one too 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.129
 A certain restraint in advance 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.709
 such an option to the investor 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:02.599
 let us feel and asia here in particular 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.310
 of course, driven by the japan 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:06.409
 sponge of the central bank is it 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.689
 actually so that the nikkei 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.699
 now almost 50 percent since 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.699
 november last year outperformance 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:16.200
 Of course these are indications for that 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:17.970
 that here continue to buy 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.650
 in the markets where, on the other hand 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.440
 especially Germany and the euro zone 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.940
 Restraint is the view in the 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.710
 etf trade with michael görgens conductor 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.820
