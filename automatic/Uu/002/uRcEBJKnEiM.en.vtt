00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 what's up with people here at the start and 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.649
 Welcome to the snapshot 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.230
 notions 13 42 and yes I'd times 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.309
 can directly say I have something here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.780
 my prepared for this video and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.310
 my mobile vibrates like a piece here 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.480
 shit but we let ourselves 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.340
 Of course not distract 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.260
 and I would say let's start 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 Just look at the coolest one and that 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 you now have the possibility of own sounds 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 in minecraft or in the resort pack 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.700
 reinzubringen and I demonstrated the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.579
 So just let's hear 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.410
 you hear as custom tugs yes and that is 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.030
 from inmate so says the custom 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.070
 sound and so I have the resort 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.320
 pack here for this introduction video 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.899
 by karl from sap bring down 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.620
 and yes, you just have to go here 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.989
 move in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.989
 So you have sound the command is like that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.370
 place and customs and and nxp 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 So yes, I think so very clearly and that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.359
 cult it too you can also use random sounds 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.409
 make more or less random 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:15.479
 sounds you can say you said it now 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:21.659
 when or how to hear so either 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 acted and exactly so place to be but 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.770
 very important here is that you stop 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.960
 the spelling respects that 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.520
 It is always important to do so 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 example is custom serra and also 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.430
 important that the goal is great in that 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.409
 it ok, yes , I would say here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.909
 we to something different and to have ourselves 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.520
 over the past week is about it 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.250
 complains that if you ice for example 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.040
 just like if, for example, behind 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.560
 So water is just behind water 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.660
 so better if behind water 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 directly the ice block is like for example 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.380
 here so that is no distance or 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.810
 so no blog distance then you can see that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.390
 Water still in the past 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.790
 autumn than his because the Sun was one of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.930
 the water is just normal and yes 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.430
 There have hit tight again 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.650
 that's why it was set that way 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.060
 if there is an ice block behind that water 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.860
 you can no longer hold the view the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.690
 water and if for example one 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.770
 little distance to the water then 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.020
 you can see the water is okay 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.970
 otherwise there was something else too 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.740
 I have glass there now somehow 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.170
 not quite recognized in the difference 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.850
 supposedly the texture should be minimal 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.890
 have been improved 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.990
 but honestly, I do not see then 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.770
 just a serious difference 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.480
 ok then we come to the last 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.500
 Changes, and I have to do it once 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.300
 just change the game mode here 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:49.020
 time tends to lick me at the ass times 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.630
 at any rate and yes definitely spot 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.290
 now a certain mozart if it is 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.350
 night is and that is that the witch yes 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.830
 the witch is definitely one will 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 who can already see right away 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:09.000
 it always takes a little moment 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:11.880
 important, of course, that's how they are 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
 The witches spawn in any case now 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.820
 okay , we already have them there 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.360
 found and the cool is definitely 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.910
 that they then turn to those witches too 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.200
 can drive certain items and here 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.730
 In any case, they are now in 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.860
 to be found every night 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.769
 okay that 's it from this one 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.540
 short and concise, however, concrete 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.040
 snapshot performances i hope she has 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.600
 you like and if you like this 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.769
 snapshot imagination then liked 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410
 Of course I would like to have one 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 happy positive assessment 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.980
 and yes, then I would say we see 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.420
 us next time or not 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.420
