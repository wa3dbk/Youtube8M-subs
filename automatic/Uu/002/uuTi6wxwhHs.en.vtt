00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
mine started off at 80 I tried 120 as a

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.889 
mine started off at 80 I tried 120 as a
another<00:01:49.729> player<00:01:50.030> that<00:01:50.270> plays<00:01:50.450> on<00:01:50.479> our<00:01:50.690> server

another player that plays on our server
uses<00:01:51.319> 120<00:01:51.800> but<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.009> found<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.490> wasn't

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:52.819 
uses 120 but I found that it wasn't

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:54.249 
uses 120 but I found that it wasn't
right<00:01:52.940> for<00:01:53.149> me<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.479> went<00:01:53.660> down<00:01:53.810> to<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.050> hundred

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
right for me so I went down to a hundred

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.410 
right for me so I went down to a hundred
and<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.740> works<00:01:54.950> perfectly<00:01:55.429> you<00:01:56.060> know<00:01:56.149> some

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
and that works perfectly you know some

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.089 
and that works perfectly you know some
people<00:01:56.450> may<00:01:56.840> go<00:01:57.050> higher<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.289> think<00:01:57.740> they<00:01:57.860> can<00:01:57.979> go

00:01:58.089 --> 00:01:58.099 
people may go higher I think they can go

00:01:58.099 --> 00:02:01.809 
people may go higher I think they can go
up<00:01:58.220> to<00:01:58.369> 150<00:01:58.970> 160<00:01:59.840> up<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:00.289> 200<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.369> highest<00:02:01.700> i've
