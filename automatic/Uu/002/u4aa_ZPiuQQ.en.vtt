when<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.160> come<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.430> blender<00:00:23.699> because<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
when you come to blender because the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.200 
when you come to blender because the
layers<00:00:24.960> are<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> little<00:00:25.320> bit<00:00:25.529> different<00:00:26.210> let's

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
layers are a little bit different let's

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
layers are a little bit different let's
pop<00:00:27.359> open<00:00:27.480> blender<00:00:29.359> we'll<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.949> alright<00:00:31.949> so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
pop open blender we'll see alright so

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.340 
pop open blender we'll see alright so
here<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:32.820> our<00:00:33.000> default<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:34.260> I'm

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
here we are in our default what I'm

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.900 
here we are in our default what I'm
going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.920> going<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
going to do is I'm going to make a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.150 
going to do is I'm going to make a
couple<00:00:36.450> cubes<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.620> I've<00:00:37.710> got<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.980> one

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
couple cubes so I've got this one

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.990 
couple cubes so I've got this one
already<00:00:38.399> selected<00:00:38.489> I'll<00:00:39.300> say<00:00:39.540> shifty<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
already selected I'll say shifty and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.250 
already selected I'll say shifty and
move<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.149> along<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.450> X<00:00:42.600> I'll<00:00:42.989> hold<00:00:43.110> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
move that along the X I'll hold the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
move that along the X I'll hold the
control<00:00:43.590> key<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.040> snip<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.700> these

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
control key so I snip to these

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.959 
control key so I snip to these
increments<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:48.559> two<00:00:49.559> cubes<00:00:49.969> so

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
increments so now we got two cubes so

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.069 
increments so now we got two cubes so
the<00:00:51.780> layers<00:00:52.020> are<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:54.780> we've<00:00:54.899> got

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the layers are down here what we've got

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.639 
the layers are down here what we've got
is<00:00:55.320> 20<00:00:55.770> layers<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.430> blender<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.440> one<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
is 20 layers in blender and one of the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.250 
is 20 layers in blender and one of the
cool<00:00:58.890> things<00:00:58.920> about<00:00:59.430> blender<00:01:00.270> well<00:01:01.050> first

let's<00:01:54.479> view<00:01:54.630> just<00:01:55.020> layer<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.560> click<00:01:56.540> Wow<00:01:57.540> see

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
let's view just layer one click Wow see

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.130 
let's view just layer one click Wow see
so<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:58.829> guy<00:01:59.040> exists<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.880> both<00:02:00.060> layers<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.600> love

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
so this guy exists on both layers I love

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
so this guy exists on both layers I love
that<00:02:02.030> and<00:02:04.070> another<00:02:05.070> thing<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.790> might<00:02:06.149> get

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that and another thing that might get

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.139 
that and another thing that might get
you<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:07.259> view<00:02:07.469> layers<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:08.610> can<00:02:08.640> hit<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you is to view layers you can hit the

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.479 
you is to view layers you can hit the
numbers<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.289> keyboard<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.890> numbers

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
numbers on your keyboard the numbers

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.620 
numbers on your keyboard the numbers
that<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.730> above<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.120> letters

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that are above your letters

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.320 
that are above your letters
so<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.650> example<00:02:13.740> a<00:02:14.070> piping<00:02:14.370> one<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.850> see<00:02:15.150> layer

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so for example a piping one I see layer

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.740 
so for example a piping one I see layer
1<00:02:15.630> 2<00:02:16.560> 3<00:02:16.890> 4<00:02:18.530> if<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.190> don't<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:21.090> anything<00:02:21.420> on

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
1 2 3 4 if you don't have anything on

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.040 
1 2 3 4 if you don't have anything on
layers<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.740> two<00:02:23.010> three<00:02:23.400> four<00:02:23.730> then<00:02:24.540> it's

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
layers you know two three four then it's

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.280 
layers you know two three four then it's
not<00:02:25.290> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.530> be<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.800> any<00:02:26.070> use<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.460> you<00:02:27.290> well

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
not going to be have any use to you well

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.560 
not going to be have any use to you well
you<00:02:28.830> know<00:02:28.950> that's<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.090> important<00:02:30.420> point

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you know that's it is an important point

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.010 
you know that's it is an important point
is<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.290> accidentally<00:02:32.250> type<00:02:32.750> or<00:02:33.750> hit

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
is that if you accidentally type or hit

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.170 
is that if you accidentally type or hit
one<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.320> keys<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.800> here<00:02:35.400> I'm<00:02:35.520> on<00:02:35.640> layer<00:02:35.790> 3

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
one of the keys like here I'm on layer 3

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.110 
one of the keys like here I'm on layer 3
I<00:02:36.210> hit<00:02:36.480> number<00:02:37.380> three<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.820> don't<00:02:39.000> see

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
I hit number three and I don't see

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
I hit number three and I don't see
anything<00:02:39.270> everything<00:02:39.750> disappeared<00:02:40.320> they<00:02:40.920> can

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
anything everything disappeared they can

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.890 
anything everything disappeared they can
freak<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.490> when<00:02:41.820> you're<00:02:41.910> new<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.570> blender

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
freak you out when you're new to blender

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.790 
freak you out when you're new to blender
so<00:02:43.650> if<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.820> hit<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:46.730> till<00:02:47.730> day<00:02:48.320> which<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
so if I hit the till day which is the

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.190 
so if I hit the till day which is the
key<00:02:50.460> that's<00:02:50.820> right<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.690> left<00:02:51.900> of<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
key that's right to the left of the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.760 
key that's right to the left of the
number<00:02:52.410> one<00:02:53.240> that<00:02:54.240> shows<00:02:54.540> all<00:02:54.810> layer<00:02:55.380> see<00:02:55.650> how

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
number one that shows all layer see how

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.500 
number one that shows all layer see how
they're<00:02:55.920> all<00:02:56.040> selected<00:02:56.460> now<00:02:59.270> but<00:03:00.270> really

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
they're all selected now but really

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.060 
they're all selected now but really
that's<00:03:00.600> all<00:03:00.810> there's<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.530> two<00:03:01.860> layers

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
that's all there's to it to two layers

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.030 
that's all there's to it to two layers
in<00:03:02.310> blender<00:03:03.020> one<00:03:04.020> two<00:03:04.290> three<00:03:04.320> oh<00:03:04.590> one<00:03:04.680> more

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
in blender one two three oh one more

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.950 
in blender one two three oh one more
thing<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:06.030> keypad<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:07.410> through<00:03:07.800> zero<00:03:08.250> is<00:03:08.550> is

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
thing the keypad one through zero is is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.600 
thing the keypad one through zero is is
you<00:03:09.960> can<00:03:10.140> type<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.560> get<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.890> those<00:03:11.010> layers<00:03:11.280> and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
you can type to get to those layers and

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.190 
you can type to get to those layers and
of<00:03:12.030> course<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:12.420> hold<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.660> shift<00:03:12.840> key<00:03:12.930> so

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
of course you can hold the shift key so

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.220 
of course you can hold the shift key so
if<00:03:13.290> I<00:03:13.350> want<00:03:13.470> layer<00:03:14.250> 1<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:14.940> layer<00:03:15.300> 2<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.990> can

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
if I want layer 1 and layer 2 I can

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.910 
if I want layer 1 and layer 2 I can
shift<00:03:16.620> one<00:03:16.890> shift<00:03:17.130> too<00:03:17.540> but<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.110> also<00:03:19.410> do

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
shift one shift too but you can also do

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.290 
shift one shift too but you can also do
alt<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.150> go<00:03:21.300> to<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.480> layer<00:03:21.720> 11<00:03:22.260> 12<00:03:23.250> 13<00:03:23.610> so

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
alt one to go to a layer 11 12 13 so

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.540 
alt one to go to a layer 11 12 13 so
it's<00:03:24.420> all<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.930> make<00:03:25.710> sure<00:03:25.860> your<00:03:26.010> mouse<00:03:26.160> is<00:03:26.370> over

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
it's all to make sure your mouse is over

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.490 
it's all to make sure your mouse is over
this<00:03:26.670> window<00:03:27.030> when<00:03:27.870> you're<00:03:28.020> hitting<00:03:28.230> those

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
this window when you're hitting those

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.490 
this window when you're hitting those
keys<00:03:28.860> because<00:03:29.780> blender<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.840> very<00:03:31.020> context

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
keys because blender is very context

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.420 
keys because blender is very context
sensitive<00:03:31.890> for<00:03:33.410> where<00:03:34.410> your<00:03:34.560> mouth<00:03:34.710> is<00:03:35.010> when
