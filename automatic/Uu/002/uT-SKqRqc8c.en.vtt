00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.440
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.870
 new guide world before power was to tears 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.210
 Today it is about the success of this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.369
 We have to worry about that first 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.330
 times in the dark Monday are on the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.460
 right side and in the success must 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 we make the big house out of the big one 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.050
 race with the help of remscheid inside 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.630
 complete of twenty bells 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.030
 let's get first murder and leader 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.970
 Just here you run this spot 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 then want the quest and see 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.860
 have three new capabilities ago and that 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 Bring it to the station is everywhere 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 the route is so small 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.239
 Because of this ability, it is easy 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.890
 closer and blast starter booster it 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.020
 There is everywhere on the track as well 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.040
 For example, Airbus will increase the tempo 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.379
 or brush me partly too 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.660
 teleported further forward so to speak 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.480
 and then there is still going to be a runner 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.000
 we need to supplement it first 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.080
 and the seeds will be on the track 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 on and are so small bags and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 in addition to this skill need 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.220
 Of course there are other players as well 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 you can just play with others 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.599
 to pull up, so to speak 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.720
 I'm going on this success it alone 

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:27.420
 make it without which game it is 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 still a bit heavier, but it does 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.039
 is expected to carry out 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.590
 and yes there will be one here 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.729
 small entertaining not the 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.679
 make anoderation in a thousand times 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.270
 wanted 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.270
 and yes in seven, right back 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.810
 I am so sorry that I am running this 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.400
 also a bit uncommented 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.030
 let the problem was simple 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.230
 that if I saved them 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.330
 I have somehow again 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.700
 to use forgotten ability but it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.190
 should actually be apparent what 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.799
 one must use skills 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.580
 which points and in addition mobile 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.610
 I still say 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.060
 the boots are changing everywhere 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.610
 the route can be very different 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.360
 that you are where I wait a long time 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.310
 had to jump in immediately and 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.890
 then of course time is less 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.580
 Body so I was now relatively close 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.040
 with 20 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.620
 but you can do it at 18 too 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.160
 if it had just at this point that not 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.620
 answer is announced and yes what you now 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.590
 got here is a checkered 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.510
 Flag with 50 charge and ten 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.630
 minutes of cooldown I already have 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.460
 just glued on it to see what 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.310
 It's easy to do here 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.910
 click on it and then you have 30 percent 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:11.390
 Range speed is not straight 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:15.260
 the world maybe a lot of pvp maybe 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.760
 does that red white do not even know that 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.090
 it was actually for this guide from 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.130
 success of the big sause i hope so 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.550
 helped you and still wishes a lot 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.550
 fun
