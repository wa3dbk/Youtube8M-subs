iPads into moving billboards and we've
created<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.910> beacon<00:00:30.840> with<00:00:31.740> some<00:00:31.980> scientists<00:00:32.489> at

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
created a beacon with some scientists at

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.729 
created a beacon with some scientists at
MIT<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.989> put<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.290> your<00:00:34.410> car<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
MIT that is put in your car and

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.680 
MIT that is put in your car and
