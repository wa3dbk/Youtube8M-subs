00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.620
 the term poke ghost is used to 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.139
 refer to pokemon invented by fans 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.209
 that supposedly could be achieved in 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.670
 the first editions and they had 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.400
 a great impact during the 90s 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.030
 flooding all kinds of websites and doing 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.710
 Many people believe in their existence 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.780
 as its own name indicates these 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.790
 pokemon were considered gods or 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.380
 divinities because their power was very 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.660
 superior to the rest of the pokemon 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.969
 known in addition to very difficult to 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.230
 get to get them there was that 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.390
 follow a series of steps and 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.699
 complex and meaningless instructions 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.620
 such as for example defeating the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.420
 league champion a hundred times leading 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.089
 in the team some pokemon in particular 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.519
 talk 50 times with certain characters 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.769
 of the game complete the pokédex in a 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.780
 specific order or enter game 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.729
 sharks or other codes among others 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.710
 many things tricks of the most 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.649
 crazy and gimmicky that you can 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.510
 imagine seems the page you gave 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.819
 start to this event was pokemon 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.370
 factory in which the 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.410
 supposed tricks accompanied by images 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.690
 of the most accomplished for the time and 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.270
 from there that phenomenon was extended 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 throughout the network it is worth noting that in 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.200
 this period the sources of information 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.000
 reliable were scarce 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.970
 so it was very difficult to verify that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.440
 it was true and that it was not helped either 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.220
 much that as a joke of the day of the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.860
 innocent 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.930
 expert gamers magazine reveals if there is or 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.760
 if as an evolution of dragon it or that the 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.550
 Nintendo's own website says I know that the 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.410
 liquid evolved the wii 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.020
 that said let's start with the only poke 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.630
 got that really came into being mine 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.820
 in a morimoto programmer interview 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.950
 of red and green pokemon revealed that 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.320
 mine was added to these games in the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.360
 last moment without it coming to power 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 obtained in any way other than in a 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.080
 possible future event 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.910
 however, mine ended up appearing 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.860
 departure of some players due to a 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.200
 mistake the famous blitz that all 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 We know which was activated using flight 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.890
 teleportation in front of some 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 trainers in concrete avoiding like this 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.000
 that the fight starts , however, 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.460
 Many people knew of the existence 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.350
 of this error and the rumors to get 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.570
 the pink kitten were on the rise 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.239
 many of which I must say that I 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.470
 I tried from there people 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.300
 it began to pose 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.490
 if mine is real because the rest of 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.260
 pokemon are not going to be and that's how 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.510
 began the history of the pivots 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.939
 it would be impossible to describe each and every 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.379
 one of the few that were created as 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.840
 it is not unreasonable to think about the 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.489
 existence of hundreds of them in addition to 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.010
 that the propelling webs of this 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.110
 phenomenon do not exist at present by 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.569
 I'm going to show just some of 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.120
 the first known 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:46.340
 we have applicable this little bit exhausted without 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.840
 doubt the most rumored and extended and 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.720
 It has its origin in the first images 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.670
 revealed of maril was thought to be 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.159
 a secret evolution of pikachu or of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 raich or water or ice type due to 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.540
 that the red and blue versions there is one in 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.879
 epc on cinnamon island that offers you a 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.129
 electro in exchange for a lightning bolt 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.829
 interchange will tell the king shock me 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.659
 you changed evolved however today 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.639
 we know that this is just a bad 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.859
 translation because the editions 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:15.170
 Japanese the pokemon in question are 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.909
 cadabra and grave read which as 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.310
 we all know evolve through 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.290
 exchange 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.000
 the rumors continued to increase when 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.459
 a cd that contained 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.680
 images of the short film holidays 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.349
 of pikachu before the launch of 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.880
 pokémon gold and silver however once 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.470
 this short already for the cinemas for 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.630
 accompany the first movie of 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.610
 pokemon the disappointment of the fans was 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.769
 brutal to be this pokemon nicknamed as 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.250
 meryl describing it as a pokémon 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.780
 common and not too strong muse tri 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.910
 It has also been one of the few 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 known as another of the clones of miu 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.080
 if there is a youtube because there can not be 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.790
 a view tour and fed suppositions 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.950
 by the revealed images of youtube 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.920
 with armor before the launch of the 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.080
 movie mentioned above other 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.610
 similar case is that of jojoy as it appears 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.799
 flying over the sky in the first 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.080
 chapter of the anime as a pokémon without 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.370
 identify or toga eby well it also does 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.260
 its appearance when the second 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.330
 generation had not yet been released 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.200
 even the crystal onyx any 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.510
 thing was reason to rumble 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.160
 without forgetting to see this is the merger of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.380
 venus uribe the three that appears in the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.980
 episode the ghost of maiden speech 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.100
 as an illusion created by gas reads another 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.840
 of these curious mergers we are 1 a 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.700
 merger of the three legendary birds the 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.160
 which appears in a manga volume as 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.110
 a team rocket experiment for 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.210
 finish we will mention anidó god and it is 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.190
 that lothar that were created as 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.050
 than many others as evolutions or 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.540
 alternative forms of pokemon already 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.419
 known both with some requirements of 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.950
 something complex and logical but 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.530
 that however we believed without even 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.270
 to question it today would be unthinkable 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.460
 that something like this could happen again 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.960
 Well, there are numerous information websites and 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.540
 the programming codes of the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.430
 games are studied and analyzed not 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.380
 However, the fact that this important 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.080
 and revolutionary phenomenon has been 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.540
 so in oblivion is something that I still 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.400
 surprise nothing more to say I hope that 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.410
 I have found it interesting and if 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.600
 you know some other little that of small 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.770
 try 6 get you can leave it in 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.660
 the comments 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.660
 greetings and until the next video
