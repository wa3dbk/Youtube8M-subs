00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.750
 have the right emotion 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.330
 a lot like actors and actresses me 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.210

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.240
 another famous green actor 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.240
 glass of beer like that 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.110

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.010
 my studio and that I would take another 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 time park 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.350
 all cowboy's birthday is today 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.180
 come on guys the coast is what safe 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.470
 might also be important to 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.640
 say a lot of people don't 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.030
 realize that the dubbing 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.850
 actor 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.200
 many difficulties with that one 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:13.560
 canoes actors 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:16.170
 that Mr. Tom Hanks being asked 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.720
 say for a radio play okay post or 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.060
 two re-operation playtime 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.580
 was a longshot in a chubby misfire 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.890
 problem is already so yes it there 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.560
 getting plaid again to 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.050
 miami and that says a few sentences three 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.040
 in a different tone that she told him 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.250
 to have 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.770
 and so becomes his entire script with 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.270
 his dialogue is recorded then becomes pietje 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.910
 PUK absorbed than he is me wife 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.070
 taken to be the best texts 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.160
 compiled by the director 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.410
 well those texts that have zero voices 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.970
 takes a little longer an actor working 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.970
 to do that down his day I think 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.730
 maybe three boring stable sherry 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.239
 campo stand star school grab you know 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.690

 Charlie attack plan ah but 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.150
 the man who claims to be American 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.640
 so it's much harder and acting 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.990
 also pay attention that you are in sync with 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.660
 because that other the whore that other 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:43.320
 actors fail to pay attention to that forgive 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.320
 wonder of the world
