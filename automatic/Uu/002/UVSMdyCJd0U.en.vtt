00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 belt what can remember this competition 

00:00:10.979 --> 00:00:13.219
 that organization Monday year 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.649
 then good position 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:17.499
 why 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.679
 dario had a lot of possession 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.769
 models daraa 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.210
 careless moments 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.599
 top not enough pace 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.249
 a total ball circulation 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.020
 both times from dam to my role can go with those slightly too few fans 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.010
 true it is about the physical preparedness of the players twice a week 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 play it is something 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.710
 it is thought out or thought about 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.910
 in name 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.460
 we already have one on 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.580

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.780
 play on dessel 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.780
 but everyone will be one we will be up to 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 so there are maximum conditional opel you want 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.490
 hotels at the moment just about others we have we know with 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.250
 players are busy who can speak language 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.480
 but the high council 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.390
 so certainly win 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.710
 is already there 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.820
 their view of a typing crew 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.700

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.250
 peter r 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.400
 we all play competitions in order 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 the players are the minutes with the bar 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.100
 to do it 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.230

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.130
 psv and already three matches more more more other couples play in the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.940
