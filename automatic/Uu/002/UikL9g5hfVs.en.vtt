00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
Viper sword the only thing that I don't

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.539 
Viper sword the only thing that I don't
really<00:03:54.930> like<00:03:55.169> is<00:03:56.449> that<00:03:57.449> it<00:03:57.599> doesn't<00:03:57.840> have

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
really like is that it doesn't have

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.179 
really like is that it doesn't have
poison<00:03:59.549> damage<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:01.169> bonus<00:04:01.500> experience<00:04:02.009> for

poison damage the bonus experience for

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.709 
poison damage the bonus experience for
monsters<00:04:02.579> only<00:04:02.790> 1%<00:04:03.329> not<00:04:03.810> 20%<00:04:04.939> and<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.449> sign

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
monsters only 1% not 20% and the sign

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.709 
monsters only 1% not 20% and the sign
intensity<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.560> less<00:04:08.009> the<00:04:09.000> only<00:04:09.180> thing<00:04:09.449> really

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:09.719 
intensity is less the only thing really

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.020 
intensity is less the only thing really
does<00:04:10.169> better<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.769> it<00:04:10.979> does<00:04:11.159> more<00:04:11.400> damage<00:04:11.430> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
does better is it does more damage and
