00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the way past the all-star weekend and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.090 
the way past the all-star weekend and
I'm<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.480> sure<00:00:48.719> how<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:48.989> happened<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:49.920> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
I'm not sure how that happened because I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.939 
I'm not sure how that happened because I
was<00:00:50.280> sure<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.480> all-star<00:00:51.930> weekend<00:00:52.440> was

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
was sure that the all-star weekend was

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.549 
was sure that the all-star weekend was
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> key<00:00:53.879> game<00:00:54.180> considering<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
going to be a key game considering that

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.799 
going to be a key game considering that
I<00:00:55.710> was<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> leak<00:00:56.340> leader<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.300> am<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
I was the leak leader or that I am the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
I was the leak leader or that I am the
league<00:00:57.960> leader<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.430> three-pointers<00:00:59.430> made<00:00:59.460> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
league leader in three-pointers made and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
league leader in three-pointers made and
with<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> being<00:01:00.840> said<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.379> fully<00:01:01.890> expected<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
with that being said I fully expected to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.429 
with that being said I fully expected to
be<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.300> three-point<00:01:03.780> shooting<00:01:04.170> contest

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
be in the three-point shooting contest

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.520 
be in the three-point shooting contest
as<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> all-star<00:01:06.270> game<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.229> guess

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
as well as the all-star game but I guess

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.219 
as well as the all-star game but I guess
none<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.430> has<00:01:08.850> happened<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.630> now<00:01:09.810> whoo

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
none of that has happened and now whoo

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
none of that has happened and now whoo
look<00:01:10.530> at<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> beautiful<00:01:11.010> crossover<00:01:11.760> move

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
look at that beautiful crossover move

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.109 
look at that beautiful crossover move
but<00:01:12.450> now<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.530> focus<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:14.250> getting<00:01:14.310> some

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
but now we have to focus on getting some

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.300 
but now we have to focus on getting some
wins<00:01:15.390> because<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.170> have<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.560> make<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.920> into<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
wins because we have to make it into the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.270 
wins because we have to make it into the
NBA<00:01:17.640> playoffs<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.840> only<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.320> around<00:01:19.500> 29

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
NBA playoffs we only have around 29

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.789 
NBA playoffs we only have around 29
games<00:01:20.610> left<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.360> season<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:22.110> those<00:01:22.530> are

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
games left in this season and those are

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.980 
games left in this season and those are
not<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> lot<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> games<00:01:23.729> left<00:01:24.030> considering<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
not a lot of games left considering that

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
not a lot of games left considering that
we're<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> team<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> nowhere<00:01:26.340> near<00:01:26.850> its

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
we're a team that is nowhere near its

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.499 
we're a team that is nowhere near its
full<00:01:27.390> potential<00:01:27.960> but<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.590> there<00:01:29.150> 360<00:01:30.150> dunk

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
full potential but right there 360 dunk

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
full potential but right there 360 dunk
like<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.079> breeze

point<00:04:18.110> where<00:04:18.440> we're<00:04:18.590> back<00:04:18.860> in<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.160> starting

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
point where we're back in the starting

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.120

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
lineup playing around 38 minutes a game

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.610 
lineup playing around 38 minutes a game
because<00:04:22.430> that<00:04:22.790> makes<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.330> huge<00:04:23.930> difference

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
because that makes a huge difference

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.770 
because that makes a huge difference
right<00:04:24.740> there<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.550> as<00:04:25.910> we're<00:04:26.120> back<00:04:26.330> on<00:04:26.570> offense

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
right there and as we're back on offense

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.020 
right there and as we're back on offense
oh<00:04:27.230> I<00:04:27.260> almost<00:04:27.680> tripled<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.220> basketball<00:04:28.850> off

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
oh I almost tripled that basketball off

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.330 
oh I almost tripled that basketball off
of<00:04:29.210> Kobe<00:04:29.540> Bryant's<00:04:29.900> legs<00:04:30.170> but<00:04:30.470> instead<00:04:30.860> we<00:04:31.190> are

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
of Kobe Bryant's legs but instead we are

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.370 
of Kobe Bryant's legs but instead we are
getting<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.730> assist<00:04:32.180> and<00:04:32.450> Kobe<00:04:32.840> pride<00:04:33.140> is

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
getting that assist and Kobe pride is

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.800 
getting that assist and Kobe pride is
certainly<00:04:34.040> looking<00:04:34.520> like<00:04:34.670> someone<00:04:34.970> who<00:04:35.540> wants

Lakers could do about that I could have

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.380

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
that would have left a great three-point

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.720 
that would have left a great three-point
shooter<00:05:22.669> with<00:05:23.120> mr.<00:05:23.510> Kamin<00:05:24.020> wide<00:05:24.500> open<00:05:25.100> once

getting that wide open layup to go where

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.270 
getting that wide open layup to go where
is<00:05:49.880> the<00:05:50.270> defense<00:05:50.510> on<00:05:51.050> this<00:05:51.290> team<00:05:51.620> and<00:05:52.010> at<00:05:52.100> this

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
is the defense on this team and at this

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.100 
is the defense on this team and at this
point<00:05:52.610> I'm<00:05:52.910> pretty<00:05:52.970> much<00:05:53.390> seeing<00:05:53.720> that<00:05:53.960> we're

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
point I'm pretty much seeing that we're

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.250 
point I'm pretty much seeing that we're
down<00:05:54.350> by<00:05:54.560> 13<00:05:55.130> make<00:05:55.729> it<00:05:55.940> a<00:05:56.060> 10-point<00:05:56.600> deficit

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
down by 13 make it a 10-point deficit

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.230 
down by 13 make it a 10-point deficit
with<00:05:57.740> around<00:05:58.070> three<00:05:58.430> minutes<00:05:58.760> left
