you may look wonder what this handle is
here<00:01:23.040> well<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.000> reversing<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.490> when<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
here well it's reversing and when you

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.230 
here well it's reversing and when you
see<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:29.610> turns<00:01:30.329> these<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:32.100> where<00:01:32.369> 30

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
see it turns these in one where 30

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.350 
see it turns these in one where 30
degrees<00:01:33.810> from<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> horizontal<00:01:35.360> downwards

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
degrees from the horizontal downwards

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.060 
degrees from the horizontal downwards
and<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> other<00:01:37.890> direction<00:01:39.140> they're<00:01:40.140> 30

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and in the other direction they're 30

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.200 
and in the other direction they're 30
degrees<00:01:41.840> upwards<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> let<00:01:44.790> me<00:01:44.969> show<00:01:45.180> you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
degrees upwards and so let me show you

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.020 
degrees upwards and so let me show you
there<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.930> again<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.979> see<00:01:47.280> how<00:01:47.520> which

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
there and again you can see how which

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.260 
there and again you can see how which
way<00:01:48.740> yes<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:50.040> see<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.000> now<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:53.270> looking

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
way yes you see it's now going looking

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.480 
way yes you see it's now going looking
in<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.020> direction<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:57.360> going

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
in this direction it's going

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.139 
in this direction it's going
counterclockwise<00:02:00.710> okay

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
counterclockwise okay

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.499 
counterclockwise okay
now<00:02:03.829> change<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.719> it<00:02:06.719> will<00:02:06.899> go<00:02:07.109> clockwise

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
now change it and it will go clockwise

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.380 
now change it and it will go clockwise
go<00:02:09.509> slowly<00:02:09.869> there<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.410> go<00:02:11.150> clockwise

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
go slowly there we go clockwise

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.869 
go slowly there we go clockwise
it's<00:02:14.390> still<00:02:14.780> quite<00:02:15.110> well<00:02:15.410> it'll<00:02:16.310> do<00:02:16.489> like

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
it's still quite well it'll do like

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.130 
it's still quite well it'll do like
anything<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.629> oh<00:02:18.050> five<00:02:18.920> pounds<00:02:19.519> pressure<00:02:20.140> but

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
anything on oh five pounds pressure but

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.160 
anything on oh five pounds pressure but
I<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:22.129> just<00:02:22.430> make<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.700> go<00:02:23.090> by<00:02:23.360> blow<00:02:23.750> into<00:02:23.959> that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
I can just make it go by blow into that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.800 
I can just make it go by blow into that
tube<00:02:24.379> but<00:02:24.950> I'm<00:02:25.069> not<00:02:25.220> gonna<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:26.390> it<00:02:26.569> now<00:02:28.090> and<00:02:29.090> try

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
tube but I'm not gonna do it now and try

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.050 
tube but I'm not gonna do it now and try
and<00:02:29.959> make<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.459> slowly<00:02:31.459> you<00:02:34.930> can<00:02:35.930> see<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
and make it go slowly you can see the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
and make it go slowly you can see the
reaction

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:08.200 

to<00:03:00.950> give<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:06.490> an<00:03:07.490> idea

oh there we go
that's<00:03:22.550> good<00:03:26.680> counterclockwise<00:03:29.290> looking<00:03:30.290> in

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
that's good counterclockwise looking in

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.490 
that's good counterclockwise looking in
that<00:03:30.590> direction<00:03:31.390> now<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.420> change<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.440> you

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500

valves not no makeup takes too long but
but<00:04:21.669> that's<00:04:22.669> all<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.330> valves<00:04:23.570> now<00:04:24.700> I'll<00:04:25.700> show

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
but that's all the valves now I'll show

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:35.950 
but that's all the valves now I'll show
you<00:04:27.400> these<00:04:28.720> tubular<00:04:29.720> things<00:04:33.880> keep<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.120> piston

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
you these tubular things keep the piston

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.330 
you these tubular things keep the piston
rod<00:04:36.260> straight<00:04:36.770> when<00:04:37.700> it's<00:04:37.880> pushing<00:04:38.210> down<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
rod straight when it's pushing down the

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.080 
rod straight when it's pushing down the
connecting<00:04:40.340> rod<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.910> the<00:04:40.940> crank<00:04:41.390> shaft

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
connecting rod to the crank shaft

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.540 
connecting rod to the crank shaft
otherwise<00:04:44.090> there<00:04:44.450> be<00:04:44.630> side<00:04:45.500> movements<00:04:46.250> on<00:04:46.400> it

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
otherwise there be side movements on it

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.719 
otherwise there be side movements on it
and<00:04:46.780> they're<00:04:47.780> called<00:04:48.050> cross<00:04:48.410> heads<00:04:48.740> or<00:04:49.280> cross

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
and they're called cross heads or cross

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:55.000 
and they're called cross heads or cross
head<00:04:49.970> guides<00:04:50.620> then

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.680 

on<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:56.180> crank<00:04:56.510> just<00:04:56.990> having<00:04:57.500> different<00:04:57.920> here

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
on the crank just having different here

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.390 
on the crank just having different here
difficult<00:04:59.690> to<00:04:59.840> see<00:05:00.110> let<00:05:00.590> me<00:05:00.740> see<00:05:00.950> if<00:05:01.010> I<00:05:01.160> can

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
difficult to see let me see if I can

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.790 
difficult to see let me see if I can
point<00:05:01.730> it<00:05:01.970> out<00:05:02.260> well<00:05:03.260> I<00:05:03.290> can't<00:05:03.770> really<00:05:04.070> but<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
point it out well I can't really but the

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.410 
point it out well I can't really but the
there<00:05:09.800> is<00:05:09.950> a<00:05:09.980> central<00:05:10.670> little<00:05:10.970> flywheel<00:05:11.660> and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
there is a central little flywheel and

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.580 
there is a central little flywheel and
then<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:15.380> crankshaft<00:05:15.830> the<00:05:17.230> the<00:05:18.230> actual

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
then the crankshaft the the actual

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.280 
then the crankshaft the the actual
cranks<00:05:19.040> are<00:05:19.190> set<00:05:19.400> at<00:05:19.580> 90<00:05:20.390> degrees<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:21.110> one

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
cranks are set at 90 degrees to one

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.430 
cranks are set at 90 degrees to one
another<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.010> with<00:05:23.000> two<00:05:23.240> cylinders<00:05:23.870> itself

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
another so with two cylinders itself

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.990 
another so with two cylinders itself
starting<00:05:25.160> and<00:05:27.130> on<00:05:28.300> the<00:05:29.300> outside<00:05:29.840> of<00:05:30.260> each<00:05:31.000> you

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
starting and on the outside of each you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:40.450 
starting and on the outside of each you
see<00:05:32.270> here<00:05:32.690> is<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:36.880> eccentric<00:05:37.880> which<00:05:38.870> is<00:05:39.460> driving

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
see here is a eccentric which is driving

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.320 
see here is a eccentric which is driving
a<00:05:41.050> sort<00:05:42.050> of<00:05:42.190> connecting<00:05:43.190> rod<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:44.060> these

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
a sort of connecting rod to these

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:48.160 
a sort of connecting rod to these
sliders<00:05:44.810> and<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.850> sliders<00:05:46.850> in<00:05:47.030> turn<00:05:47.420> make

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
sliders and the sliders in turn make

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.150 
sliders and the sliders in turn make
these<00:05:48.440> little<00:05:48.920> connecting<00:05:49.700> rods<00:05:50.890> work<00:05:51.890> the

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
these little connecting rods work the

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.380 
these little connecting rods work the
valves<00:05:52.730> but<00:05:53.770> anyway<00:05:54.770> that's<00:05:55.700> my<00:05:56.030> little

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
valves but anyway that's my little

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:02.770 
valves but anyway that's my little
engine<00:05:57.220> a<00:05:59.440> supply<00:06:00.440> wheel<00:06:01.150> that's<00:06:02.150> looking<00:06:02.690> at

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
engine a supply wheel that's looking at

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.750 
engine a supply wheel that's looking at
the<00:06:02.930> other<00:06:03.080> side<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.500> can<00:06:03.830> get<00:06:04.010> a<00:06:04.040> better<00:06:04.550> idea

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
the other side you can get a better idea

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:11.020 
the other side you can get a better idea
of<00:06:05.480> the<00:06:06.790> let<00:06:07.790> me<00:06:07.820> see<00:06:07.940> I'll<00:06:08.300> turn<00:06:08.660> it<00:06:08.900> you<00:06:10.030> well

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.030 
of the let me see I'll turn it you well

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.350 
of the let me see I'll turn it you well
