00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.150
to all my people

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.220
East Africa

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.060
in Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.130
in Dar es Salaam
in Arusha

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.000
wherever you are

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.060
kneel and pray to God

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.090
what's the offence of the poor?
What is lawful and what is unlawful?

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.190
is this politics, religion, slavery
judgement day, Sodom and Gomorrah?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.090
stand strong
take a look around each corner

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.060
left,right, front, back
make sure you look everywhere

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.000
just listen and be patient
so that you won’t regret later on

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.050
this goes out to my people
the cripple, blind, albinos or insane

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.080
street children, beggars
and those who are mentally sane

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.100
we're pulling the rope against those in power
fat bellies and cheeks

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.200
it’s no longer a fair game
the referee is biased, the field is dry

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.210
work is hard to find, payment is little
what’s left is to play the hard way

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.240
tired of upper class, capitalism, dictatorship
this is the time of redemption

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.140
I demand that the poor
should get that wine

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.240
I pour poison over your opponents
to make them scratch themselves without shame

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.220
a salute to those who passed away before us
let us pray to God

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.040
our father,give us our daily bread
fill us with strength to succeed

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.050
on the day of judgement
give us the chance to regret

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.160
because we know
we are eating forbidden fruits

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.070
we use every possible method, juju, trickery
so we can sustain ourselves

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.190
but that shouldn’t be a reason 
for others to rob our rights

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.020
to call us infidels and insult us

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.050
what have we done wrong?

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.200
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong,what is right?

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.190
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.110
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong,what is right?

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.110
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.090
if we would all be intellectuals and rich

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.070
who'd do the dirty and dangerous work
in the mortuary, sweeping the street, watchmen...

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.220
everyone here in town came for a business
even a human skin is for sale

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.180
some are fake healers and wizards
others gentle-mannered like Born-again Christians

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.010
in the afternoon offices are buzzing
while the night is hard, prostitutes,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.040
sugar daddies,criminals
and other things to be covered up

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.170
those who died fighting for their lives
their memories remain in the graveyard

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.020
those who lost hope that they will ever win
they have taken out a mortgage on their souls

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.070
when they stop you in the road
You give them your last coins

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.170
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong, what is right?

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.180
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.070
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong, what is right?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.010
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.120
in Tanzania you need to find your way
you may not own more than a pair of shorts

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.230
protect your plans like a goalkeeper
those you trust may let you drown 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.220
you’re not educated, don’t have a special talent
but you have strength, your speech,your economy

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.100
to gain and to loose, it’s all normal

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.190
sometimes you sleep, dream and eat
and make love to a nice girl

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.170
when you wake up, the place is empty

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:41.050
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong, what is right?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.060
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.040
what’s the offense of the poor?
what is wrong, what is right?

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.070
everyone just wants their destiny
but you can’t look into the future
