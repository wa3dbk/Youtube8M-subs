00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.640
This is the ROnaldinho Sombrero trick.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.419
An awesome football soccer dribbling made
famous by Ronaldinho and executed perfectly

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:30.260
by him
The right leg very close to the ball.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:41.190
The left goes in front of the ball.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.920
You will lift the ball and swing your leg
throwing the ball over yourself.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.800
It can be done from the ground...

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.090
You can use two fast close touches, the lift
and the kick-over..

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.269
Or you can make it from one extended move
, the ball staying in long contact with your

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.580
foot until you will launch it up in the air.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.530
Be careful not to move the ball too strong
or too much in front on horizontal direction,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.500
because you will lose control.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:27.130
And there's that sombrero done when the ball
bounces in front of 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.320
you a few inches from the ground...

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:47.830
You will surprise your adversary by kicking
the ball hooking it and throwing it over him

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.619
and/or yourself.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:08.709
Use your ankle and knee joint to hook it.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:31.319
He will never know what hit him :)
