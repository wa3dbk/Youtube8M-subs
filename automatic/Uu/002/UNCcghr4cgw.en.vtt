turning<00:00:05.970> jig<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:07.170> have<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.410> start<00:00:07.680> with<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
turning jig we have to start with the

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.709 
turning jig we have to start with the
rough<00:00:08.189> piece<00:00:08.429> of<00:00:08.639> wood<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.059> that<00:00:09.120> which<00:00:09.570> you

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
rough piece of wood and that which you

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.049 
rough piece of wood and that which you
see<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.050> front<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.500> I<00:00:10.740> think<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.700> piece

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
see in front of you I think is a piece

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.480 
see in front of you I think is a piece
of<00:00:12.090> Hulk<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:12.809> not<00:00:13.019> sure<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.440> I'm<00:00:14.099> going<00:00:14.400> to

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
of Hulk I'm not sure but I'm going to

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.450 
of Hulk I'm not sure but I'm going to
turn<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.910> round<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.480> I'll<00:00:15.750> take<00:00:16.020> another

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
turn that round and I'll take another

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.160 
turn that round and I'll take another
shot<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.699> as<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> lathe<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
shot of it as I get it on the lathe and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.029 
shot of it as I get it on the lathe and
start<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.560> turn<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> round<00:00:21.320> there's<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.650> block

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
start to turn it round there's the block

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.500 
start to turn it round there's the block
of<00:00:23.189> wood<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.490> started<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.150> turns<00:00:24.330> out

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
of wood we started with it turns out

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.210 
of wood we started with it turns out
it's<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.810> piece<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.050> sumac<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:26.099> our

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
it's a piece of sumac from our

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730 
it's a piece of sumac from our
neighbor's<00:00:26.580> yard<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.090> had<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.019> waxed<00:00:28.170> over<00:00:28.650> on

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
neighbor's yard I had it waxed over on

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
neighbor's yard I had it waxed over on
the<00:00:28.830> end<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.160> was<00:00:29.279> kind<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.519> hard<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the end so it was kind of hard to

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
the end so it was kind of hard to
identify<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.599> bark<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.289> it's<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.560> piece<00:00:31.740> of

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
identify the bark but it's a piece of

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
identify the bark but it's a piece of
sumac<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.059> pretty<00:00:33.210> dry<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:33.899> see<00:00:34.020> if<00:00:34.079> we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sumac so it's pretty dry let's see if we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.540 
sumac so it's pretty dry let's see if we
can<00:00:34.320> make<00:00:34.440> something<00:00:34.680> round<00:00:35.010> out<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.280> this

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
can make something round out of this

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.459 
can make something round out of this
I'll<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.420> sphere<00:00:39.420> cutting<00:00:39.780> jig<00:00:39.960> set<00:00:40.290> up

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
I'll get the sphere cutting jig set up

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.709 
I'll get the sphere cutting jig set up
and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.920> way<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:44.090> here<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.360> see<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
and the way will go here you can see the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.860 
and the way will go here you can see the
jig<00:00:45.989> mounted<00:00:46.320> on<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.559> lathe<00:00:47.539> piece<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.719> work

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
jig mounted on the lathe piece of work

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.410 
jig mounted on the lathe piece of work
is<00:00:49.079> suspended<00:00:49.620> between<00:00:49.820> centers<00:00:50.820> on<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.210> end

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
is suspended between centers on this end

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
is suspended between centers on this end

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
cutter tip

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.270 
cutter tip
to<00:00:59.640> be<00:00:59.790> manipulated<00:01:00.570> through<00:01:00.890> pushing<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.160> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to be manipulated through pushing it in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.420 
to be manipulated through pushing it in
and<00:01:02.400> out<00:01:02.930> there's<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.050> bronze<00:01:04.380> bushing<00:01:04.980> here

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
and out there's a bronze bushing here

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.060 
and out there's a bronze bushing here
and<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.900> whole<00:01:07.170> device<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.740> made<00:01:07.950> out

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
and here this whole device is made out

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.210 
and here this whole device is made out
of<00:01:08.100> medium<00:01:08.490> density<00:01:08.820> fiberboard<00:01:09.920> it's<00:01:10.920> quite

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
of medium density fiberboard it's quite

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.160 
of medium density fiberboard it's quite
dense<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.760> everything<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.300> quite<00:01:12.510> stable<00:01:12.810> too

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
dense and everything in quite stable too

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
dense and everything in quite stable too
so<00:01:13.980> by<00:01:14.600> pushing<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.230> out<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.590> buried

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
so by pushing that in and out you buried

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.770 
so by pushing that in and out you buried
the<00:01:17.280> cut<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.760> can<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> pin

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
the cut and you can see there's a pin

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.580 
the cut and you can see there's a pin
down<00:01:19.020> here<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:20.370> allows<00:01:20.640> them<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.940> pivot<00:01:21.210> so

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.010 

by<00:01:25.860> pushing

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
by pushing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.179 
by pushing
the<00:01:28.470> cutting<00:01:28.950> tool<00:01:29.189> around<00:01:29.600> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.020> it

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
the cutting tool around you can see it

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.240 
the cutting tool around you can see it
cut<00:01:32.189> in<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.430> continuous<00:01:33.390> heart<00:01:33.630> let<00:01:34.590> me<00:01:34.710> make

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
cut in a continuous heart let me make

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.660 
cut in a continuous heart let me make
sure<00:01:35.460> everything<00:01:35.790> is<00:01:35.820> tight<00:01:36.409> here

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.719 

actually<00:01:41.450> I<00:01:41.479> need<00:01:41.659> to<00:01:41.689> readjust<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.799> I<00:01:43.009> lost

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
actually I need to readjust this I lost

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.040 
actually I need to readjust this I lost
about<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.119> quarter<00:01:44.450> of<00:01:44.509> an<00:01:44.600> inch<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.080> stand<00:01:45.470> by

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.380 

they<00:01:49.530> readjusted<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.730> slid<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.090> further

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they readjusted it I slid it further

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.570 
they readjusted it I slid it further
towards<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.870> headstock<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:53.250> are<00:01:53.400> two

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
towards the headstock there are two

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.910 
towards the headstock there are two
bolts<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.240> tightens<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:55.080> whole<00:01:55.290> assembly

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
bolts that tightens the whole assembly

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.170 
bolts that tightens the whole assembly
the<00:01:56.040> whole<00:01:56.190> plate<00:01:56.490> down<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.850> should<00:02:03.060> be

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
the whole plate down and we should be

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.200 
the whole plate down and we should be
good<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.480> go<00:02:03.660> so<00:02:04.250> make<00:02:05.250> sure<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.760> focused

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
good to go so make sure this is focused

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:28.440 
good to go so make sure this is focused
in<00:02:06.390> on<00:02:06.830> that<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.070> bit<00:02:13.430> okay<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.790> go

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.050 

okay

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
okay

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.910 
okay
maybe<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.750> spinning<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.350> gotta<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.680> out<00:02:31.770> around

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
maybe the spinning I gotta go out around

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.810 
maybe the spinning I gotta go out around
the<00:02:32.160> corner<00:02:32.520> here<00:02:34.880> kind<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:35.940> find<00:02:37.700> turning<00:02:38.700> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
the corner here kind of find turning the

now let's bring it all the way around
and<00:04:28.580> see<00:04:28.729> if<00:04:28.820> we're<00:04:28.940> starting<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.270> form<00:04:29.510> the

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and see if we're starting to form the

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:40.719 
and see if we're starting to form the
balls<00:04:38.350> one<00:04:39.350> modification<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:40.250> going<00:04:40.460> to<00:04:40.550> make

balls one modification I'm going to make
is<00:04:40.910> I'm<00:04:41.030> going<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.210> put<00:04:41.360> a<00:04:41.389> knob<00:04:41.630> insert<00:04:42.500> on

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
is I'm going to put a knob insert on

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.189 
is I'm going to put a knob insert on
each<00:04:42.800> side<00:04:43.160> that<00:04:43.880> way<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.479> I'm<00:04:44.600> doing<00:04:44.930> this

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
each side that way if I'm doing this

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.340 
each side that way if I'm doing this
this<00:04:45.979> part<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:46.750> ball<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:47.780> can<00:04:48.110> put<00:04:48.260> the

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
this part of the ball I can put the

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.379 
this part of the ball I can put the
tightening<00:04:48.740> knob<00:04:48.889> over<00:04:49.250> here<00:04:49.639> it<00:04:50.180> actually

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
tightening knob over here it actually

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.120 
tightening knob over here it actually
works<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.229> I'll<00:04:51.290> show<00:04:51.560> you<00:04:51.620> it<00:04:51.949> actually

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
works and I'll show you it actually

00:04:52.130 --> 00:05:00.480 
works and I'll show you it actually
works<00:04:52.580> just<00:04:52.729> to<00:04:53.060> loosen<00:04:53.210> up<00:04:53.570> and<00:04:53.900> free<00:04:54.229> hand

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:16.420 

for<00:05:01.490> roughing<00:05:01.850> in<00:05:02.000> this<00:05:02.240> works<00:05:02.479> okay<00:05:15.430> around

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
for roughing in this works okay around

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:46.890 
for roughing in this works okay around
here

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.210 

the<00:05:47.900> reason<00:05:48.229> I'm<00:05:48.319> pushing<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:48.800> all<00:05:48.949> the<00:05:48.979> way

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
the reason I'm pushing it all the way

00:05:49.220 --> 00:06:22.650 
the reason I'm pushing it all the way
back<00:05:49.400> started

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.650 

it's<00:06:23.660> raiven<00:06:24.610> the<00:06:25.610> drive<00:06:25.880> at<00:06:26.090> this<00:06:26.210> end<00:06:26.450> it's<00:06:26.600> a

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
it's raiven the drive at this end it's a

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.750 
it's raiven the drive at this end it's a
large<00:06:26.900> step<00:06:27.350> center<00:06:27.800> and<00:06:27.920> it<00:06:28.010> will<00:06:28.040> slip<00:06:28.580> if

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
large step center and it will slip if

00:06:28.760 --> 00:07:17.880 
large step center and it will slip if
you<00:06:28.880> take<00:06:29.120> too<00:06:29.300> much

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:17.890 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:21.700 

right<00:07:18.890> now<00:07:18.980> we've<00:07:19.190> completed<00:07:19.610> that<00:07:20.710> roughly

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:21.710 
right now we've completed that roughly

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.370 
right now we've completed that roughly
completed<00:07:22.280> the<00:07:22.820> main<00:07:23.000> fall<00:07:23.330> I'm<00:07:23.900> gonna<00:07:24.080> put<00:07:24.260> on

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
completed the main fall I'm gonna put on

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.960 
completed the main fall I'm gonna put on
a<00:07:24.410> different<00:07:24.860> tool<00:07:25.100> and<00:07:25.460> see<00:07:25.610> if<00:07:25.670> I<00:07:25.760> can't

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970 
a different tool and see if I can't

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.530 
a different tool and see if I can't
smooth<00:07:26.330> this<00:07:26.480> out<00:07:26.690> just<00:07:26.930> a<00:07:27.110> little<00:07:27.380> bit
