00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that but overall the episode was okay

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.649 
that but overall the episode was okay
that<00:03:05.519> was<00:03:05.609> the<00:03:05.700> part<00:03:05.879> I<00:03:05.970> liked<00:03:06.150> about<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> some

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
that was the part I liked about it some

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.449 
that was the part I liked about it some
part<00:03:06.780> didn't<00:03:07.049> like<00:03:07.139> about<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.409> but<00:03:08.280> it

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
part didn't like about it but it

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.430 
part didn't like about it but it
admitted<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.209> animation<00:03:09.720> was<00:03:09.810> perfect<00:03:10.319> I

cannot<00:03:11.040> really<00:03:11.220> say<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:12.569> thought<00:03:13.290> itself<00:03:13.709> is

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
cannot really say the thought itself is

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.910 
cannot really say the thought itself is
basic<00:03:14.129> crap<00:03:14.310> but<00:03:14.879> I<00:03:14.909> can't<00:03:15.269> say<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
basic crap but I can't say that the the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.129 
basic crap but I can't say that the the
animation<00:03:17.669> and<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.030> opening<00:03:18.510> was<00:03:18.810> pretty
