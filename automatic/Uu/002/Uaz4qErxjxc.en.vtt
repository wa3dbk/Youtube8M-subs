00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230 

what<00:00:00.299> we<00:00:00.390> have<00:00:00.570> here<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.310> the<00:00:02.310> starter<00:00:02.730> which<00:00:03.120> I

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
what we have here is the starter which I

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.200 
what we have here is the starter which I
mixed<00:00:03.570> last<00:00:03.840> night<00:00:04.110> with<00:00:04.560> about<00:00:05.009> two<00:00:05.850> cups<00:00:06.060> of

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
mixed last night with about two cups of

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.089 
mixed last night with about two cups of
milk<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.720> two<00:00:07.049> cups<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.440> flour<00:00:07.500> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
milk and two cups of flour the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.879 
milk and two cups of flour the
proportions<00:00:08.910> are<00:00:09.000> not<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.540> critical

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
proportions are not that critical

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.419 
proportions are not that critical
and<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.030> it's<00:00:12.330> risen<00:00:12.780> overnight<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.740> this<00:00:14.309> is

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and so it's risen overnight and this is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.250 
and so it's risen overnight and this is
the<00:00:14.549> most<00:00:14.730> critical<00:00:14.969> part<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.109> whole

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the most critical part of the whole

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.980 
the most critical part of the whole
operation<00:00:16.789> I'm<00:00:17.789> going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> stir<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.390> down<00:00:18.630> some

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
operation I'm going to stir it down some

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
operation I'm going to stir it down some
you<00:00:19.170> see<00:00:19.320> how<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.650> risen<00:00:19.859> it's<00:00:20.189> all<00:00:20.340> kind<00:00:20.640> of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
you see how it's risen it's all kind of

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.730 
you see how it's risen it's all kind of
bubbly<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.270> I'm<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.080> take<00:00:22.260> some<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.619> it

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
bubbly and I'm going to take some of it

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.109 
bubbly and I'm going to take some of it
and<00:00:22.890> save<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:24.090> next<00:00:24.240> time<00:00:25.580> the<00:00:26.580> organisms

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
and save it for next time the organisms

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
and save it for next time the organisms
that<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:28.050> basically<00:00:28.590> its<00:00:29.010> milk<00:00:29.189> flour

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
that are in it basically its milk flour

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.319 
that are in it basically its milk flour
and<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.660> some<00:00:30.960> little<00:00:31.109> ecosystem<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.329> yeasts

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
and then some little ecosystem of yeasts

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.870 
and then some little ecosystem of yeasts
and<00:00:33.450> bacteria<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.590> no<00:00:34.739> idea<00:00:35.040> what

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and bacteria and I have no idea what

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.860 
and bacteria and I have no idea what
particular<00:00:36.390> ones<00:00:36.570> are<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> starter<00:00:37.610> and

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
particular ones are in this starter and

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.540 
particular ones are in this starter and
we've<00:00:39.870> it's<00:00:40.140> been<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.770> family<00:00:40.980> for<00:00:41.190> about

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
we've it's been in our family for about

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.690 
we've it's been in our family for about
70<00:00:42.090> years<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.129> so<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.340> probably

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
70 years or so and so it's probably

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.700 
70 years or so and so it's probably
evolved<00:00:45.210> over<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.570> period<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.960> time<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.469> don't

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
evolved over that period of time I don't

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.000 
evolved over that period of time I don't
know<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.340> still<00:00:47.640> works<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> that's

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
know but it still works and that's

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.240 
know but it still works and that's
long-lived<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> very<00:00:50.489> robust<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
long-lived and very robust so at this

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.180 
long-lived and very robust so at this
point<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> make<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.329> pancakes

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
point I'm going to make some pancakes

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.599 
point I'm going to make some pancakes
you<00:00:56.190> can<00:00:56.370> do<00:00:56.520> anything<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:57.000> want<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.690> this

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
you can do anything you want with this

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:01.400 
you can do anything you want with this
material<00:00:59.609> now<00:00:59.780> because<00:01:00.780> you've<00:01:00.960> saved<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
material now because you've saved the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.170 
material now because you've saved the
starter<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.219> could<00:01:02.430> make<00:01:02.579> bread<00:01:02.820> with<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
starter so you could make bread with it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
starter so you could make bread with it
I'm<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> make<00:01:03.750> pancakes<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.559> could

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
I'm going to make pancakes you could

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.359 
I'm going to make pancakes you could
experiment<00:01:06.590> personally<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.100> when<00:01:08.340> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
experiment personally I know that when I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.929 
experiment personally I know that when I
was<00:01:09.260> 10<00:01:10.260> 12<00:01:10.500> years<00:01:10.680> old<00:01:11.010> my<00:01:11.189> mother<00:01:11.369> had<00:01:11.670> some

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
was 10 12 years old my mother had some

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.090 
was 10 12 years old my mother had some
of<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.210> starter<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.110> she<00:01:13.350> had<00:01:13.590> obtained

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
of this starter that she had obtained

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700 
of this starter that she had obtained
from<00:01:14.280> her<00:01:14.460> mother<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> that's<00:01:15.659> what<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
from her mother and that's what we have

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.649 
from her mother and that's what we have
we'd<00:01:16.860> have<00:01:17.009> pancakes<00:01:17.430> maybe<00:01:17.759> every<00:01:18.240> week<00:01:18.420> or

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
we'd have pancakes maybe every week or

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 
we'd have pancakes maybe every week or
so<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.229> that's<00:01:19.799> basically<00:01:20.189> all<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.580> she<00:01:20.909> did

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so and that's basically all that she did

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.590 
so and that's basically all that she did
with<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
with it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.240 
with it
she<00:01:21.900> didn't<00:01:22.170> make<00:01:22.259> bread<00:01:22.590> or<00:01:22.830> anything<00:01:22.979> like

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
she didn't make bread or anything like

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.359 
she didn't make bread or anything like
that<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> I'm<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> mix<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> all<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
that and I'm going to mix that all in

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.030 
that and I'm going to mix that all in
there<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.990> we're<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> wait<00:01:28.500> until<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
there and we're going to wait until the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
there and we're going to wait until the
frying<00:01:29.490> pan<00:01:29.729> gets<00:01:30.000> good<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.270> hot<00:01:30.799> certainly

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
frying pan gets good and hot certainly

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
frying pan gets good and hot certainly
it<00:01:32.159> could<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> family<00:01:33.869> tradition

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
it could be a family tradition

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
it could be a family tradition
somebody<00:01:35.280> could<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> starter<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.329> me<00:01:36.479> or

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
somebody could get the starter for me or

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.600 
somebody could get the starter for me or
they<00:01:36.750> could<00:01:36.930> start<00:01:37.170> their<00:01:37.229> own<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:38.369> I

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they could start their own as I

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.340 
they could start their own as I
mentioned<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> water-based<00:01:39.750> starters

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
mentioned for the water-based starters

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.370 
mentioned for the water-based starters
or<00:01:40.470> even<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> milk<00:01:40.920> based<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.729> can<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.060> leave

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
or even a milk based you can just leave

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.410 
or even a milk based you can just leave
your<00:01:43.380> batter<00:01:43.890> out<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> couple<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.939> days<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
your batter out for a couple of days but

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.060 
your batter out for a couple of days but
then<00:01:45.479> that's<00:01:45.750> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.560> miss<00:01:46.680> you're

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
then that's kind of hit or miss you're

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.230 
then that's kind of hit or miss you're
not<00:01:47.100> quite<00:01:47.399> sure<00:01:47.430> what<00:01:47.729> you're<00:01:47.909> going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> get

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
not quite sure what you're going to get

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.440 
not quite sure what you're going to get
in<00:01:48.390> there<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.590> obtain<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.460> an<00:01:50.820> established

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
in there you can obtain a an established

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.270

history<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> family<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.290> I

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
history in the family and as I

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.710 
history in the family and as I
said<00:02:14.130> before<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.490> like<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.880> distribute<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.510> as

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
said before I like to distribute it as
widely<00:02:16.110> as<00:02:16.290> possible<00:02:16.770> but<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.920> think<00:02:17.160> once<00:02:18.060> it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
widely as possible but I think once it

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.730 
widely as possible but I think once it
gets<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.510> certain<00:02:18.600> age<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.530> don't

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
gets to a certain age you just don't

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.350 
gets to a certain age you just don't
want<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> one<00:02:20.340> who<00:02:20.520> lets<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> die<00:02:21.180> off

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
want to be the one who lets it die off

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.910 
want to be the one who lets it die off
basically<00:02:24.360> every<00:02:24.810> year<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.170> put<00:02:25.380> out<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> call

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
basically every year we put out a call

basically every year we put out a call
for<00:02:26.270> exhibitors<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:28.320> do<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.770> typically

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
for exhibitors and we do that typically

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.880 
for exhibitors and we do that typically
a<00:02:29.370> couple<00:02:29.760> months<00:02:30.030> before<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.570> event<00:02:30.660> we<00:02:31.590> hope

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
a couple months before the event we hope

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.790 
a couple months before the event we hope
that<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.280> will<00:02:32.430> have<00:02:32.640> more<00:02:33.120> home<00:02:33.800> fermentation

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.890 
that we will have more home fermentation
folks<00:02:35.100> than<00:02:35.460> business<00:02:35.790> fermentation<00:02:36.690> folks

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900
