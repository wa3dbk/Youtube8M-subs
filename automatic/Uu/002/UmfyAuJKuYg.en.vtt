just<00:01:17.659> so<00:01:17.780> it's<00:01:17.930> sort<00:01:18.110> of<00:01:18.170> not<00:01:18.409> too<00:01:18.800> tiny<00:01:19.130> as<00:01:19.340> far

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
just so it's sort of not too tiny as far

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.940

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
here I have a pattern that we chose and

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.130 
here I have a pattern that we chose and
first<00:01:25.790> step<00:01:26.150> would<00:01:26.300> be<00:01:26.360> to<00:01:26.479> put<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.870> pattern

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
first step would be to put the pattern

first step would be to put the pattern

of fun watching you do this well it's
very<00:03:46.720> easy<00:03:47.079> because<00:03:47.380> the<00:03:47.709> shapes<00:03:47.980> are<00:03:48.220> random

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
very easy because the shapes are random

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.059 
very easy because the shapes are random
so<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.180> can<00:03:49.450> find<00:03:49.780> one<00:03:50.079> that<00:03:50.109> fits<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.769> all<00:03:50.950> the

so you can find one that fits in all the

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.309 
so you can find one that fits in all the
little<00:03:51.280> nooks<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:51.730> crannies<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:53.049> I<00:03:53.109> would

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
little nooks and crannies so I would

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.740 
little nooks and crannies so I would
fill<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.769> each<00:03:54.069> of<00:03:54.310> my<00:03:54.340> flower<00:03:54.819> colors<00:03:55.420> and

fill in each of my flower colors and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.119 
fill in each of my flower colors and
then<00:03:56.200> I'll<00:03:56.290> come<00:03:56.500> over<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.890> this<00:03:57.040> piece

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
then I'll come over to this piece

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:03.119 
then I'll come over to this piece

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
begin with the leaf area and continue

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.550 
begin with the leaf area and continue
doing<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.940> same<00:04:04.209> thing<00:04:04.629> the<00:04:04.840> same<00:04:05.050> procedure

now<00:04:06.340> I<00:04:06.370> noticed<00:04:07.000> too<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.300> while<00:04:07.660> when<00:04:08.260> you

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
now I noticed too that while when you

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.050 
now I noticed too that while when you
put<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.709> paint<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.190> there<00:04:09.459> it<00:04:09.640> was<00:04:09.730> like<00:04:09.790> an

put the paint on there it was like an
orchid<00:04:10.510> color<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.980> the<00:04:12.280> acrylic<00:04:12.910> pieces

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
orchid color and the the acrylic pieces

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.129 
orchid color and the the acrylic pieces
are<00:04:13.540> deep<00:04:13.930> purple<00:04:14.379> but<00:04:14.709> when<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.980> dries<00:04:15.660> is<00:04:16.660> did

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
are deep purple but when it dries is did

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.930 
are deep purple but when it dries is did
you<00:04:17.260> say<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.859> is<00:04:17.889> transparent<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.760> looks

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
you say that it is transparent it looks

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.699 
you say that it is transparent it looks
it<00:04:19.180> looks<00:04:19.209> almost<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.840> same<00:04:19.900> color<00:04:20.320> than<00:04:20.590> what

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
it looks almost the same color than what

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.070 
it looks almost the same color than what
you<00:04:20.799> can<00:04:21.010> see<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.519> it<00:04:21.549> yes<00:04:21.970> it's<00:04:22.270> it's<00:04:22.600> works

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
you can see of it yes it's it's works

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.530 
you can see of it yes it's it's works
well<00:04:23.320> with<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.770> pieces<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.790> notice<00:04:25.389> over

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
well with the pieces and I notice over

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.440 
well with the pieces and I notice over
here<00:04:25.660> with<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.889> with<00:04:27.460> the<00:04:27.610> dried<00:04:27.880> leaves<00:04:28.150> it's

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
here with the with the dried leaves it's

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.060 
here with the with the dried leaves it's
the<00:04:28.540> same<00:04:28.750> thing<00:04:29.050> that's<00:04:29.229> almost<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.770> turquoise

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
the same thing that's almost a turquoise

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.120 
the same thing that's almost a turquoise
there<00:04:30.639> right<00:04:31.240> it'll<00:04:31.780> dry<00:04:32.020> your<00:04:32.290> dark<00:04:32.919> green

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.940 
there right it'll dry your dark green
and<00:04:33.550> enhance<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.300> project<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.650> I<00:04:35.680> would

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
and enhance the project so I would

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.280 
and enhance the project so I would
finish<00:04:36.160> all<00:04:36.460> my<00:04:36.490> leaves<00:04:36.850> uh-huh<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:37.570> then<00:04:38.020> go

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
finish all my leaves uh-huh and then go

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.990 
finish all my leaves uh-huh and then go
on<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.740> I'd<00:04:38.860> be<00:04:39.010> ready<00:04:39.130> to<00:04:39.280> fill<00:04:39.639> in<00:04:39.820> my

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
on and I'd be ready to fill in my

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.250 
on and I'd be ready to fill in my
background<00:04:40.690> my<00:04:41.620> background<00:04:41.910> here<00:04:43.229> could<00:04:44.229> be

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
background my background here could be

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.340 
background my background here could be
crystal<00:04:44.830> clear<00:04:44.910> but<00:04:45.910> bumpy<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.660> textured

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
crystal clear but bumpy and textured

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.790 
crystal clear but bumpy and textured
using<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.889> textured<00:04:48.490> paint<00:04:49.410> another<00:04:50.410> choice

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
using the textured paint another choice

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.100 
using the textured paint another choice
and<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.340> piece<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:51.760> front<00:04:51.940> of<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:52.360> you<00:04:52.900> can

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
and the piece in front of you you can

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.909 
and the piece in front of you you can
see<00:04:53.350> I've<00:04:53.470> added<00:04:53.650> a<00:04:53.919> little<00:04:54.190> color<00:04:54.460> oh<00:04:55.919> that's

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
see I've added a little color oh that's

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.980 
see I've added a little color oh that's
interesting<00:04:57.340> though<00:04:57.760> to<00:04:57.790> us<00:04:58.090> it<00:04:58.300> is<00:04:58.450> bumpy<00:04:58.870> and

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
interesting though to us it is bumpy and

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.250 
interesting though to us it is bumpy and
lumpy<00:04:59.430> so<00:05:00.430> to<00:05:00.490> do<00:05:00.880> that<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.479> would<00:05:01.750> add<00:05:01.900> a<00:05:01.930> little

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
lumpy so to do that I would add a little

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.480 
lumpy so to do that I would add a little
bit<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.590> the<00:05:02.860> colored<00:05:03.600> paint<00:05:04.600> and<00:05:05.110> then<00:05:06.039> fill

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
bit of the colored paint and then fill

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.600 
bit of the colored paint and then fill
in<00:05:06.729> the<00:05:06.760> entire<00:05:07.139> background<00:05:08.139> in<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.979> swirling

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
in the entire background in a swirling

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.800 
in the entire background in a swirling
pattern

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
pattern

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.930 
pattern
and<00:05:12.290> that's<00:05:12.620> all<00:05:12.800> you<00:05:12.920> do<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.310> get<00:05:13.460> the<00:05:13.639> effect

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
and that's all you do to get the effect

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.700 
and that's all you do to get the effect
that<00:05:14.000> you<00:05:14.090> have<00:05:14.210> over<00:05:14.540> here<00:05:14.690> right<00:05:14.930> it's<00:05:15.470> going

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
that you have over here right it's going

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.010 
that you have over here right it's going
to<00:05:15.830> dry<00:05:16.040> clear<00:05:16.070> all<00:05:16.639> setting<00:05:17.270> but<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.750> will

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
to dry clear all setting but it will

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.440 
to dry clear all setting but it will
dress<00:05:18.290> it<00:05:18.500> will<00:05:18.740> do<00:05:18.950> that<00:05:19.130> swirly<00:05:19.580> look<00:05:19.790> mm-hmm

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
dress it will do that swirly look mm-hmm

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:22.990 
dress it will do that swirly look mm-hmm
isn't<00:05:21.410> that<00:05:21.440> interesting<00:05:22.160> how<00:05:22.639> long<00:05:22.790> does<00:05:22.880> it

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
isn't that interesting how long does it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.030 
isn't that interesting how long does it
take<00:05:23.210> to<00:05:23.300> drive<00:05:23.540> up<00:05:23.720> um<00:05:24.290> well<00:05:24.680> overnight

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
take to drive up um well overnight

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.640 
take to drive up um well overnight
usually<00:05:25.820> sometimes<00:05:26.419> under<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.110> pieces<00:05:27.530> it

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
usually sometimes under the pieces it

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.040 
usually sometimes under the pieces it
takes<00:05:27.889> a<00:05:28.010> little<00:05:28.190> longer<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.700> dry<00:05:29.060> well<00:05:29.900> let's

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
takes a little longer to dry well let's

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:31.300 
takes a little longer to dry well let's
take<00:05:30.260> a<00:05:30.290> quick<00:05:30.560> look<00:05:30.740> at<00:05:30.889> some<00:05:30.919> of<00:05:31.190> these

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
take a quick look at some of these

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.280 
take a quick look at some of these
others<00:05:31.760> this<00:05:32.000> is<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.330> one<00:05:32.540> that's<00:05:32.810> I<00:05:33.080> guess

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
others this is the one that's I guess

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.560 
others this is the one that's I guess
like<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.770> one<00:05:33.919> you're<00:05:34.070> working<00:05:34.460> on<00:05:34.580> right<00:05:34.639> yes

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
like the one you're working on right yes

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.930 
like the one you're working on right yes
okay<00:05:36.110> and<00:05:36.350> in<00:05:36.770> front<00:05:37.040> of<00:05:37.160> that<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:37.520> can<00:05:37.700> see

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
okay and in front of that you can see

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.210 
okay and in front of that you can see
with<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.120> different<00:05:38.600> color<00:05:38.840> choice<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.830> really

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
with a different color choice it really

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.730 
with a different color choice it really
changes<00:05:40.730> the<00:05:40.790> whole<00:05:41.120> project<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:42.260> then<00:05:42.710> I

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
changes the whole project and then I

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.370 
changes the whole project and then I
notice<00:05:43.160> two<00:05:43.310> we<00:05:43.430> have<00:05:43.550> one<00:05:43.730> up<00:05:43.850> here<00:05:44.240> very<00:05:45.230> very

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
notice two we have one up here very very

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.080 
notice two we have one up here very very
different<00:05:45.980> look<00:05:46.010> to<00:05:46.280> it<00:05:46.310> but<00:05:46.550> done<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:46.880> same

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
different look to it but done the same

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.880 
different look to it but done the same
way<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.270> guess<00:05:47.630> with<00:05:47.840> just<00:05:47.990> the<00:05:48.140> square<00:05:48.440> tiles

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
way I guess with just the square tiles

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.480 
way I guess with just the square tiles
yes<00:05:49.610> yes<00:05:50.090> those<00:05:50.450> pieces<00:05:50.720> are<00:05:51.140> another<00:05:51.890> version

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
yes yes those pieces are another version

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.460 
yes yes those pieces are another version
that<00:05:52.669> are<00:05:52.760> available<00:05:52.970> and<00:05:53.600> they're

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
that are available and they're

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.770 
that are available and they're
transparent<00:05:55.130> they're<00:05:55.520> not<00:05:55.730> marble<00:05:56.150> oh<00:05:56.240> that's

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
transparent they're not marble oh that's

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.290
