lot<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> grabs<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.899> mean<00:00:58.079> my<00:00:58.170> only<00:00:58.350> complaint

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
lot of grabs I mean my only complaint

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.169 
lot of grabs I mean my only complaint
was<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.160> had<00:00:59.309> this<00:00:59.519> one<00:00:59.670> we<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:00.120> at

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
was and I had this one we got to look at

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.669 
was and I had this one we got to look at
the<00:01:00.300> Marvel<00:01:00.570> Legends<00:01:00.840> last<00:01:01.079> year<00:01:01.289> at<00:01:01.379> Comic

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
the Marvel Legends last year at Comic

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.410 
the Marvel Legends last year at Comic
Con<00:01:01.710> was<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.129> these<00:01:02.309> tendrils<00:01:02.879> are<00:01:03.210> not

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
Con was that these tendrils are not

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.260 
Con was that these tendrils are not
bendy<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.800> Dwight<00:01:05.280> Stiles<00:01:05.789> I<00:01:05.880> gave<00:01:06.030> Dwight

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
bendy and as Dwight Stiles I gave Dwight

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.760 
bendy and as Dwight Stiles I gave Dwight
how<00:01:06.630> come<00:01:06.780> they're<00:01:06.899> not<00:01:06.929> bendy<00:01:07.350> man<00:01:07.500> that'd<00:01:07.649> be

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
how come they're not bendy man that'd be

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.499 
how come they're not bendy man that'd be
so<00:01:07.950> badass<00:01:08.160> for<00:01:08.490> their<00:01:08.580> bending<00:01:08.820> he<00:01:09.119> said<00:01:09.360> that

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
so badass for their bending he said that

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.570 
so badass for their bending he said that
they<00:01:10.170> weren't<00:01:10.530> thick<00:01:11.009> enough<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
they weren't thick enough that the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.040 
they weren't thick enough that the
design<00:01:11.910> for<00:01:12.149> them<00:01:12.270> wasn't<00:01:12.570> thick<00:01:12.720> enough<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
design for them wasn't thick enough so

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.899 
design for them wasn't thick enough so
that<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.289> could<00:01:13.440> fit<00:01:13.649> bendy<00:01:14.130> wire<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.640> there

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
that they could fit bendy wire in there

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
that they could fit bendy wire in there
and<00:01:15.259> there's<00:01:16.259> some<00:01:16.409> kind<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.619> regulation<00:01:17.190> that

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
and there's some kind of regulation that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.430 
and there's some kind of regulation that
has<00:01:17.399> to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> certain<00:01:17.940> thickness<00:01:18.300> I<00:01:18.750> was<00:01:19.320> like

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
has to be a certain thickness I was like

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.499 
has to be a certain thickness I was like
okay<00:01:19.800> well<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.369> compared<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.390> know

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
okay well and I compared it to you know

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.880 
okay well and I compared it to you know
the<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:21.720> figures<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.259> that<00:01:22.560> bendy

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the other figures I have that bendy

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.649 
the other figures I have that bendy
wires<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.429> is<00:01:23.640> thinner<00:01:24.060> than<00:01:24.149> like<00:01:24.539> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
wires and this is thinner than like the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.530 
wires and this is thinner than like the
Nightcrawler<00:01:25.110> tail<00:01:25.440> so<00:01:25.800> that's<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.240> I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Nightcrawler tail so that's that so I

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.749 
Nightcrawler tail so that's that so I
went<00:01:28.079> ahead<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.770> tried<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> make<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> bendy

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
went ahead and tried to make it bendy

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.020 
went ahead and tried to make it bendy
myself<00:01:30.149> so<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> took<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:31.250> twisty<00:01:32.250> tie<00:01:32.280> stripped

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
myself so I took a twisty tie stripped

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.999 
myself so I took a twisty tie stripped
off<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.270> plastic<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:33.899> then<00:01:34.020> how<00:01:34.500> glue<00:01:34.770> gunned

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
off the plastic and then how glue gunned

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.289 
off the plastic and then how glue gunned
it<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> bottom<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.060> kind<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
it to the bottom there and it kind of

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.200 
it to the bottom there and it kind of
looks<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.890> bendy<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.180> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
looks like but it's bendy so now I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.139 
looks like but it's bendy so now I
have<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> bendy<00:01:39.899> 10<00:01:40.350> tendril<00:01:41.009> thingy<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.610> here

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
have a bendy 10 tendril thingy on here

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.240 
have a bendy 10 tendril thingy on here
I'm<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.899> there's<00:01:43.170> customizers<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.100> could

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
I'm sure there's customizers I could

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.590 
I'm sure there's customizers I could
think<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.549> better<00:01:44.670> ways<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.939> doing<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
think of better ways to doing this

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.149 
think of better ways to doing this
century<00:01:45.930> productions<00:01:46.409> had<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> idea<00:01:47.040> of

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
century productions had the idea of

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.069 
century productions had the idea of
actually<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.969> clear<00:01:48.270> bands<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.990> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
actually using the clear bands and just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.700 
actually using the clear bands and just
tying<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> figure<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> you're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
tying it to to the figure that you're

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.200 
tying it to to the figure that you're
having<00:01:53.009> him<00:01:53.130> wrap<00:01:53.310> around<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
having him wrap around but I like the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.660 
having him wrap around but I like the
idea<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.509> having<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.020> bend<00:01:55.740> around<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.369> bit

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
idea of having this bend around a bit

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.120 
idea of having this bend around a bit
more<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.140> kinda<00:01:58.500> looks<00:01:58.649> like

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
more so you know kinda looks like

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.039 
more so you know kinda looks like
but<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.640> works<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.060> well<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.840> think

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
but it works pretty well so I think

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.209 
but it works pretty well so I think
they'll<00:02:01.530> be<00:02:01.680> okay

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
they'll be okay
