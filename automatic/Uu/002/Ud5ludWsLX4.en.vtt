and let's get like to it okay so first

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.639 
and let's get like to it okay so first
off<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.920> need<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.460> main<00:00:59.670> container<00:01:00.649> continue

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
off we need the main container continue

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.729 
off we need the main container continue
and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:03.090> now<00:01:03.329> need<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.989> hole

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and then we now need to make a hole

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.280 
and then we now need to make a hole
okay<00:01:05.369> so<00:01:05.430> I've<00:01:05.700> made<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.150> small<00:01:06.540> hole<00:01:06.810> just

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
okay so I've made it a small hole just

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.200 
okay so I've made it a small hole just
by<00:01:07.409> poking<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.890> pencil<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.820> you<00:01:09.030> could

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
by poking a pencil in and out you could

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
by poking a pencil in and out you could
use<00:01:09.390> something<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.750> sharper<00:01:10.140> body<00:01:10.320> didn't<00:01:11.250> have

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
use something a sharper body didn't have

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
use something a sharper body didn't have
one<00:01:11.840> but<00:01:12.840> uh<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> need<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
get some string so you can get a string

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
get some string so you can get a string
this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> like<00:01:19.680> garden<00:01:20.159> string<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.090> can<00:01:21.299> even

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this is like garden string and can even

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.950 
this is like garden string and can even
use<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.020> post<00:01:22.409> string<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.720> I'm<00:01:24.720> gonna

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
use like post string like this I'm gonna

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.410 
use like post string like this I'm gonna
use<00:01:25.229> this<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.830> softer<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.000> should<00:01:27.240> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
use this as it's softer and it should be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.380 
use this as it's softer and it should be
easier<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.080> water<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:29.360> travel<00:01:30.360> up<00:01:31.189> and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
easier for the water to travel up and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.770 
easier for the water to travel up and
then<00:01:33.390> you've<00:01:34.049> got<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.259> poke<00:01:34.890> these<00:01:35.130> two<00:01:35.490> parts

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.140 

it<00:01:39.530> doesn't<00:01:39.920> matter<00:01:40.040> really<00:01:40.610> hot<00:01:40.850> on<00:01:41.000> your

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
it doesn't matter really hot on your

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.350 
it doesn't matter really hot on your
string<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:42.020> song<00:01:42.860> it's<00:01:43.070> deep<00:01:43.490> enough<00:01:43.760> to

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
string is a song it's deep enough to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.340 
string is a song it's deep enough to
suck<00:01:44.690> up<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:44.900> water<00:01:49.070> you<00:01:49.220> like<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
wait that's in catch it the other side

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.360 
wait that's in catch it the other side
like<00:01:56.840> that<00:01:57.340> okay<00:01:58.340> just<00:01:59.560> keep<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.800> bringing<00:02:01.130> it

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
like that okay just keep on bringing it

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
make some knots in it and the reason why

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.350 
make some knots in it and the reason why
you<00:02:08.060> want<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.390> do<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.780> is<00:02:09.670> for<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.850> to<00:02:11.030> stop

you want to do this is for it to stop

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.380 
you want to do this is for it to stop
falling<00:02:11.900> back<00:02:12.080> out<00:02:12.350> and<00:02:12.640> for<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.730> water<00:02:13.940> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
falling back out and for the water to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.770 
falling back out and for the water to
actually<00:02:14.750> run<00:02:15.230> off<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:16.150> start<00:02:17.150> going<00:02:17.420> into

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
actually run off and start going into

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.710
