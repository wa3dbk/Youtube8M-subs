a<00:03:18.020> concealer<00:03:19.340> what<00:03:24.110> let's<00:03:25.110> see<00:03:25.940> definitely

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
a concealer what let's see definitely

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.540 
a concealer what let's see definitely
feels<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> concealer<00:03:28.590> I<00:03:28.800> mean<00:03:29.459> that's

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
feels like a concealer I mean that's

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.229 
feels like a concealer I mean that's
probably<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.239> it<00:03:30.270> is<00:03:30.480> I'm<00:03:30.750> guessing<00:03:32.180> it's<00:03:33.180> a

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
probably what it is I'm guessing it's a

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.300 
probably what it is I'm guessing it's a
little<00:03:33.480> dark<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.780> my<00:03:34.140> skin<00:03:34.410> tone<00:03:34.620> but<00:03:34.890> what<00:03:35.160> is

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
little dark for my skin tone but what is

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.620 
little dark for my skin tone but what is
this<00:03:35.519> I'm<00:03:35.700> gonna<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:35.910> to<00:03:36.030> look<00:03:36.120> at<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.300> card

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
this I'm gonna have to look at the card

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.900 
this I'm gonna have to look at the card
and<00:03:36.840> see<00:03:36.989> if<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.489> it<00:03:38.489> doesn't<00:03:38.790> actually

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
and see if this is it doesn't actually

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.810 
and see if this is it doesn't actually
say<00:03:39.390> what<00:03:39.660> it<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.920> just<00:03:41.160> says<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.340> brand

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
say what it is it just says the brand

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.699 
say what it is it just says the brand
well<00:03:42.420> I'm<00:03:42.570> just<00:03:42.780> guessing<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
well I'm just guessing that this is a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.620 
well I'm just guessing that this is a
concealer<00:03:44.280> because<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:45.060> has<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.450> consistency

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
concealer because it has the consistency

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.890 
concealer because it has the consistency
of<00:03:46.200> lines<00:03:46.470> very<00:03:46.709> creamy<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.660> think<00:03:48.660> there<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.870> a

on this lipstick really quick and see

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.620 
on this lipstick really quick and see
what<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:23.850> looks<00:05:24.000> like<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:27.240> feels<00:05:27.450> really

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:27.630 
what it looks like it feels really

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.950 
what it looks like it feels really
smooth<00:05:28.110> applying<00:05:28.860> it<00:05:29.040> to<00:05:29.070> the<00:05:29.250> lips<00:05:29.490> I<00:05:29.960> like

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
smooth applying it to the lips I like

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.200 
smooth applying it to the lips I like
that<00:05:30.990> texture<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:32.520> that's<00:05:32.700> what<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.000> color

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
that texture so that's what the color

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.800 
that texture so that's what the color
looks<00:05:33.330> like<00:05:34.340> anyway<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.400> I<00:05:35.880> think<00:05:36.540> that's<00:05:36.690> a

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
looks like anyway so I think that's a

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.960 
looks like anyway so I think that's a
pretty<00:05:36.990> pink<00:05:37.290> color<00:05:37.380> and<00:05:37.830> then<00:05:37.950> let<00:05:38.610> me<00:05:38.730> just

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
pretty pink color and then let me just

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.420 
pretty pink color and then let me just
do<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> little<00:05:39.690> bit<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.080> this<00:05:40.530> nail<00:05:40.710> polish<00:05:41.130> on

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
do a little bit of this nail polish on

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.720 
do a little bit of this nail polish on
my<00:05:42.420> finger<00:05:43.290> just<00:05:43.980> so<00:05:44.070> we<00:05:44.190> can<00:05:44.310> see<00:05:44.520> what<00:05:44.640> it

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
my finger just so we can see what it

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.960 
my finger just so we can see what it
looks<00:05:44.760> like<00:05:45.710> this<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.890> just<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.190> very<00:05:47.220> rough

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
looks like this is just a very rough

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:51.320 
looks like this is just a very rough
first<00:05:48.930> coat<00:05:49.380> it<00:05:50.160> looks<00:05:50.370> kind<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.700> white<00:05:51.060> on

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
first coat it looks kind of white on

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.690 
first coat it looks kind of white on
camera<00:05:51.870> it's<00:05:52.320> very<00:05:52.710> light<00:05:53.070> blue<00:05:53.340> that<00:05:53.370> it

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
camera it's very light blue that it

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.120 
camera it's very light blue that it
looks<00:05:53.910> white<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.540> wonder<00:05:55.380> if<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.800> would<00:05:55.950> be<00:05:56.100> a

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
looks white I wonder if it would be a

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.760 
looks white I wonder if it would be a
little<00:05:56.310> bit<00:05:56.550> darker<00:05:57.000> with<00:05:57.150> two<00:05:57.360> coats

little bit darker with two coats

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.930 
little bit darker with two coats
probably<00:05:58.770> all<00:05:59.010> right<00:05:59.310> and<00:05:59.490> just<00:05:59.640> to<00:05:59.730> show<00:05:59.760> you
