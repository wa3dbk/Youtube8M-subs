00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:11.049
 discs for rod production company 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.570
 build sports stuff of these discs 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:17.320
 reinforced concrete it goes concrete foundation 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.960
 with a disk inside it we reinforce a special 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.660
 double-layer reinforcement also in the center 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.310
 there is a metal sleeve on top 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.919
 painted special paint on 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.630
 latex based 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.130
 the question immediately arises as the strength that 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.059
 will be if these disks fall out 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.660
 whether they disagree once and did not write 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.660
 burst 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.180
 let's say so in Yiddish -1 disk volume that 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.600
 when falling possible from their cola 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.360
 how do we see water which affects 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.360
 the appearance of the steep absolutely nothing 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.320
 not affected because they are minor 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.900
 refuses to master 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.540
 paint with a small layer 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.880
 concrete 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.950
 this happens in cases where the disk 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.170
 falls and is removed from the metal or 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.280
 cardonia fight with great strength of mind 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.200
 dishes if the disk falls from a tree or 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.010
 image well what do we most often use 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.630
 to cover your room 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.270
 but no problems with it 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.100
 I can never split these discs in half 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.120
 will not fall apart because they are reinforced 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.190
 that is, it is physically impossible so well 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.260
 if something in you is not satisfied with these 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
 drives can always return within 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.490
 14 days from the date of purchase 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.490
 even if you damaged the disk 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.150
 working and for more than two years 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:06.190
 sold over 70 volume drives no problem 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.190

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.890
 We will be glad to cooperate in good luck
