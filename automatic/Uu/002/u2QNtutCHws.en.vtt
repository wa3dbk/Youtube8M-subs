00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think it's kind of half and half of the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.010 
think it's kind of half and half of the
network<00:01:51.689> itself<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.799> phone<00:01:53.689> but<00:01:54.689> anyway

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
network itself and the phone but anyway

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.940 
network itself and the phone but anyway
