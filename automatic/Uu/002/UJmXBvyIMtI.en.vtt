okay and then we're going to pull the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.960 
okay and then we're going to pull the
twine<00:00:23.169> tight<00:00:24.169> onto<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:24.739> ring<00:00:24.919> as<00:00:25.310> we<00:00:25.669> did<00:00:25.849> with

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
twine tight onto the ring as we did with

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.749 
twine tight onto the ring as we did with
the<00:00:26.089> net<00:00:26.239> board<00:00:27.279> then<00:00:28.279> we're<00:00:28.369> going<00:00:28.489> to<00:00:28.519> tie<00:00:28.699> it

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:28.759 
the net board then we're going to tie it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.719 
the net board then we're going to tie it
off<00:00:28.999> exactly<00:00:29.210> the<00:00:29.630> same<00:00:30.189> so<00:00:31.189> throw<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:31.429> loop

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:31.729 
off exactly the same so throw the loop

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.619 
off exactly the same so throw the loop
around<00:00:31.989> come<00:00:32.989> around<00:00:33.019> the<00:00:33.440> back<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:33.890> them<00:00:34.039> all

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
around come around the back of them all

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.310 
around come around the back of them all
and<00:00:35.629> come<00:00:36.350> between<00:00:36.530> them<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:38.510> then<00:00:38.719> tie<00:00:39.260> the

and come between them and then tie the
knot<00:00:39.710> off<00:00:39.949> tight<00:00:40.850> against<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.359> ring<00:00:42.489> okay

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
knot off tight against the ring okay

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.569 
knot off tight against the ring okay
we're<00:00:44.960> going<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.379> go<00:00:45.589> down<00:00:45.980> through<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> ring

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
we're going to go down through the ring

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.799 
we're going to go down through the ring
again<00:00:47.050> pick<00:00:48.050> up<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.350> next<00:00:48.679> mesh<00:00:49.510> down<00:00:50.510> through

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
again pick up the next mesh down through

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.079 
again pick up the next mesh down through
the<00:00:50.899> ring<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.609> through<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.699> same<00:00:52.910> mesh<00:00:53.239> again

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
the ring and through the same mesh again

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.180 
the ring and through the same mesh again
okay<00:00:56.120> now<00:00:56.629> when<00:00:56.809> we<00:00:56.929> tie<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:57.410> ring<00:00:57.679> off<00:00:57.920> when

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
okay now when we tie this ring off when

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.079 
okay now when we tie this ring off when
we<00:00:58.519> tie<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:59.140> knot<00:01:00.140> off<00:01:00.440> we<00:01:01.219> want<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.579> join<00:01:01.820> it

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
we tie this knot off we want to join it

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.279 
we tie this knot off we want to join it
-<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:02.329> one<00:01:02.570> is<00:01:02.659> all<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:02.899> that<00:01:03.050> they<00:01:03.140> don't

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
- this one is all so that they don't

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.250 
- this one is all so that they don't
separate<00:01:03.859> too<00:01:04.160> much<00:01:04.630> on<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.840> on<00:01:05.960> the<00:01:06.080> ring

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
separate too much on the on the ring

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.060 
separate too much on the on the ring
itself<00:01:07.000> so<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.240> time<00:01:08.570> we're<00:01:09.380> going<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.740> throw

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
itself so this time we're going to throw

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.010 
itself so this time we're going to throw
the<00:01:10.310> twine<00:01:11.150> over<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.540> back<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.900> hand

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the twine over the back of the hand

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.460 
the twine over the back of the hand
again<00:01:12.400> and<00:01:13.400> we're<00:01:13.490> going<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.670> pick<00:01:13.940> up<00:01:14.320> one<00:01:15.320> of

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
again and we're going to pick up one of

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.320 
again and we're going to pick up one of
the<00:01:15.560> threads<00:01:15.860> of<00:01:16.070> twine<00:01:16.400> from<00:01:16.760> the<00:01:16.850> previous

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
the threads of twine from the previous

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.110 
the threads of twine from the previous
loop<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:19.070> we're<00:01:19.220> now<00:01:19.370> going<00:01:19.610> around<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:19.970> back

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
loop so we're now going around the back

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.830 
loop so we're now going around the back
of<00:01:20.270> three<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.640> then<00:01:22.970> round<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.360> back<00:01:23.600> of

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
of three and then round the back of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.680 
of three and then round the back of
either<00:01:24.590> one<00:01:24.920> or<00:01:25.130> two<00:01:25.460> okay<00:01:26.180> go<00:01:26.420> around<00:01:26.600> the

either one or two okay go around the

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.650 
either one or two okay go around the
back<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.960> two<00:01:27.140> on<00:01:27.290> this<00:01:27.440> one

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
back of two on this one

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.330 
back of two on this one
tie<00:01:29.660> it<00:01:29.720> off<00:01:30.460> and<00:01:32.050> continue<00:01:33.130> okay<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:34.190> we're
