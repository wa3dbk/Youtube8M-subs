00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
Passat we have the electronic handbrake

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.420 
Passat we have the electronic handbrake
which<00:04:25.760> is<00:04:26.030> located<00:04:26.210> in

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
which is located in

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.460 
which is located in
suitable<00:04:27.850> position<00:04:28.000> I<00:04:28.389> feel<00:04:28.630> than<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:28.930> the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
suitable position I feel than the the

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.400 
suitable position I feel than the the
predecessor<00:04:30.449> what's<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.600> advantage<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:32.229> that

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
predecessor what's the advantage of that

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.249 
predecessor what's the advantage of that
then<00:04:32.680> well<00:04:33.220> I<00:04:33.250> suppose<00:04:33.660> it's<00:04:34.660> very<00:04:34.870> easy<00:04:35.050> to

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:35.259 
then well I suppose it's very easy to

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:37.050 
then well I suppose it's very easy to
operate<00:04:35.380> simply<00:04:36.039> my<00:04:36.160> foot<00:04:36.370> on<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.610> brake<00:04:36.820> you

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
operate simply my foot on the brake you

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.400 
operate simply my foot on the brake you
just<00:04:37.240> press<00:04:37.419> the<00:04:37.570> button<00:04:37.870> and<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.169> releases

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
just press the button and that releases

just press the button and that releases
the<00:04:38.620> handbrake<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.310> vice<00:04:39.910> versa<00:04:40.210> just<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:41.009> very

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
the handbrake and vice versa just a very

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.340 
the handbrake and vice versa just a very
easy<00:04:42.190> use<00:04:42.370> but<00:04:42.850> also<00:04:43.030> from<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.630> security<00:04:44.050> point

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
easy use but also from a security point

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.650 
easy use but also from a security point
of<00:04:44.530> view<00:04:44.759> without<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.970> keys<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.479> won't

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.540 
of view without the keys that won't
operate<00:04:46.780> so<00:04:47.259> somebody<00:04:47.590> tries<00:04:47.830> to<00:04:48.070> remove<00:04:48.370> the
