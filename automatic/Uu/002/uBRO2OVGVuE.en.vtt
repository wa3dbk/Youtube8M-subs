today so let's wake up quickly first the
southern<00:00:07.850> filaments<00:00:08.389> held<00:00:08.570> true<00:00:08.870> while

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 
southern filaments held true while

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.710 
southern filaments held true while
facing<00:00:09.379> earth<00:00:09.769> but<00:00:10.099> one<00:00:10.519> destabilized<00:00:11.330> as<00:00:11.570> it

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
facing earth but one destabilized as it

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.020

began<00:00:12.019> to<00:00:12.080> parting<00:00:12.590> yesterday<00:00:13.070> there<00:00:13.639> was<00:00:13.760> no

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
began to parting yesterday there was no

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.420 
began to parting yesterday there was no
CA<00:00:14.360> me<00:00:14.690> but<00:00:14.960> that<00:00:15.200> filament<00:00:15.559> is<00:00:15.830> indeed<00:00:16.219> now

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
CA me but that filament is indeed now

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.420 
CA me but that filament is indeed now
gone<00:00:16.790> it<00:00:17.480> began<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.020> day<00:00:18.200> as<00:00:18.410> calm<00:00:18.770> as<00:00:18.919> it<00:00:19.099> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
gone it began the day as calm as it and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.700 
gone it began the day as calm as it and
the<00:00:19.610> others<00:00:19.970> had<00:00:20.210> crested<00:00:20.720> this<00:00:20.899> week<00:00:21.200> but<00:00:21.470> a

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
the others had crested this week but a
