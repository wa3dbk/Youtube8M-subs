00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
and you're going to start marking out

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.550 
and you're going to start marking out
how<00:00:45.539> big<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.899> want<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> mouth<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.710> such

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.350 

I<00:00:53.680> just<00:00:54.340> put<00:00:54.520> a<00:00:54.550> little<00:00:54.580> thought<00:00:54.730> there<00:00:55.090> so<00:00:55.270> it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
I just put a little thought there so it

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:08.069 
I just put a little thought there so it
kind<00:00:55.540> of<00:00:55.570> knew<00:00:56.400> what<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.550> wanted<00:00:57.820> to<00:00:57.970> go

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.330 

so<00:01:09.079> I<00:01:09.140> decided<00:01:09.409> to<00:01:09.619> take<00:01:09.770> it<00:01:09.920> up<00:01:09.979> a<00:01:10.070> little<00:01:10.189> bit

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
so I decided to take it up a little bit

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.889 
so I decided to take it up a little bit
farther<00:01:10.520> because<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:11.149> realized<00:01:11.509> that<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.689> was

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
farther because I realized that I was

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:14.499 
farther because I realized that I was
like<00:01:12.049> only<00:01:12.350> down<00:01:12.710> here<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.100> I<00:01:13.159> needed<00:01:13.360> to<00:01:14.360> be

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
like only down here and I needed to be

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.529 
like only down here and I needed to be
um<00:01:15.009> obviously<00:01:16.009> close<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.789> so<00:01:17.299> I'm<00:01:17.360> going<00:01:17.509> to

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.710 
a little bit on the back of my hand so I
don't<00:02:33.630> have<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.840> keep<00:02:34.050> squeezing<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:35.130> out

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
don't have to keep squeezing it out

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.500 
don't have to keep squeezing it out
shouldn't<00:02:36.720> need<00:02:36.810> too<00:02:36.990> much<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.240> start

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
shouldn't need too much and just start

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.600 
shouldn't need too much and just start
putting<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.930> in<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.590> boxes<00:02:40.980> now<00:02:41.160> also<00:02:41.400> with

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
putting it in the boxes now also with

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.980 
putting it in the boxes now also with
the<00:02:41.730> black<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.450> optional<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.900> can

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
the black you it's optional you can

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.800 
the black you it's optional you can
decide<00:02:43.710> instead<00:02:44.130> of<00:02:44.760> 0<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.090> doing<00:02:45.330> black<00:02:45.540> you

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
decide instead of 0 here doing black you

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.240 
decide instead of 0 here doing black you
can<00:02:45.960> do<00:02:46.080> purple<00:02:46.350> because<00:02:46.710> that's<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.040> color

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
can do purple because that's the color

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.620 
can do purple because that's the color
of<00:02:47.310> him<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.760> stuff<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:48.450> I<00:02:48.510> just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
of him and stuff like that but I just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:03:21.700 
of him and stuff like that but I just
decided<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.320> go<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.590> plain<00:02:49.890> black

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.650 

so<00:03:22.710> once<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.980> put<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.370> all<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.700> white<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.480> can

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so once you put in all the white you can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:34.370 
so once you put in all the white you can
see<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.990> look<00:03:25.170> coming<00:03:25.440> together<00:03:27.470> like<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:33.380> so

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
see the look coming together like so so

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.360 
see the look coming together like so so

some pink again the same thing you're

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.230 
some pink again the same thing you're
going<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.340> put<00:05:37.490> it<00:05:37.580> right<00:05:37.700> here<00:05:37.760> at<00:05:37.910> the<00:05:38.060> outer

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
going to put it right here at the outer

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.710 
going to put it right here at the outer
corner<00:05:38.390> and<00:05:39.820> then<00:05:40.820> you're<00:05:41.300> going<00:05:41.420> to<00:05:41.480> put<00:05:41.630> it

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
corner and then you're going to put it

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.010 
corner and then you're going to put it
in<00:05:41.780> the<00:05:41.900> inner<00:05:42.050> corner<00:05:42.140> skipping<00:05:42.920> the<00:05:43.010> middle

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
in the inner corner skipping the middle

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.940 
in the inner corner skipping the middle
so<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.080> gives<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.410> like<00:05:45.560> a<00:05:45.590> stripe<00:05:47.770> it's<00:05:48.770> hard
