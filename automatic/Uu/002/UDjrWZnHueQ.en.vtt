time<00:02:00.479> they<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:00.899> found<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.740> could<00:02:01.890> hold

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
time they they found that it could hold

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270 
time they they found that it could hold
just<00:02:02.549> under<00:02:03.090> a<00:02:03.119> hundred<00:02:03.390> thousand<00:02:04.229> people<00:02:04.649> but

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
just under a hundred thousand people but

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
just under a hundred thousand people but
of<00:02:05.429> course<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.819> I<00:02:05.850> always<00:02:06.090> say<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
of course as I always say you have to

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.809 
of course as I always say you have to
take<00:02:07.080> that<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.349> a<00:02:07.439> pinch<00:02:07.679> of<00:02:07.830> salt<00:02:08.069> because

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
take that with a pinch of salt because

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.150 
take that with a pinch of salt because
the<00:02:09.299> there<00:02:09.959> were<00:02:10.049> less<00:02:10.229> safety<00:02:10.530> rules<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
the there were less safety rules the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.069 
the there were less safety rules the
fans<00:02:11.400> were<00:02:11.610> crammed<00:02:11.880> in<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.209> lot<00:02:12.450> tighter<00:02:12.720> you

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
fans were crammed in a lot tighter you

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.690 
fans were crammed in a lot tighter you
could<00:02:13.260> fit<00:02:13.440> more<00:02:13.650> people<00:02:13.709> they<00:02:14.130> were<00:02:14.190> standing

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
could fit more people they were standing

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.380 
could fit more people they were standing
up<00:02:15.319> but<00:02:16.319> as<00:02:16.500> time<00:02:17.130> progressed<00:02:17.700> more<00:02:18.060> rules

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
up but as time progressed more rules

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
up but as time progressed more rules
more<00:02:18.660> safety<00:02:19.110> rules<00:02:19.319> came<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.799> and<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:22.170> meant

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
more safety rules came in and that meant

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.680 
more safety rules came in and that meant
the<00:02:22.530> stadium<00:02:23.010> capacity<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.970> lowered<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.510> no

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the stadium capacity was lowered and no

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.220 
the stadium capacity was lowered and no
until<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.140> was<00:02:25.260> down<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.470> about<00:02:25.819> 50,000<00:02:27.230> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
until it was down to about 50,000 and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.000 
until it was down to about 50,000 and
that<00:02:29.190> meant<00:02:29.489> that<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:31.489> what<00:02:32.489> was<00:02:32.640> it<00:02:34.970> 1992<00:02:35.970> in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
that meant that in what was it 1992 in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.190 
that meant that in what was it 1992 in
1992<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.190> club<00:02:38.459> closed<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:39.450> stadium<00:02:39.900> again

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
1992 the club closed the stadium again

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960 
1992 the club closed the stadium again
for<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> year<00:02:40.799> or<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.069> played<00:02:41.370> somewhere<00:02:41.760> else

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
for a year or two played somewhere else

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.690 
for a year or two played somewhere else
I<00:02:42.209> think<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.690> built<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.799> top<00:02:44.100> tier<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.579> you

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I think and built the top tier that you

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.479 
I think and built the top tier that you
can<00:02:44.880> see<00:02:45.150> there<00:02:45.590> which<00:02:46.590> meant<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:47.010> stadium

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
can see there which meant the stadium

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.440 
can see there which meant the stadium
capacity<00:02:47.959> rose<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.200> what<00:02:49.350> it<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.530> now<00:02:50.450> 85,000

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
capacity rose to what it is now 85,000

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.569 
capacity rose to what it is now 85,000
but<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> wasn't<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.260> end<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.829> their

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
but that wasn't the end of their

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.240 
but that wasn't the end of their
construction<00:02:54.329> works<00:02:54.650> because<00:02:55.650> since<00:02:55.920> then

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
construction works because since then

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.979 
construction works because since then
because<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.970> stadium<00:02:57.299> was<00:02:57.359> quite<00:02:57.600> old<00:02:57.840> when

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
because the stadium was quite old when

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.449 
because the stadium was quite old when
they<00:02:58.200> did<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.709> first<00:02:58.950> place

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
they did that in the first place

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.830 
they did that in the first place
so<00:02:59.850> they<00:02:59.940> had<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.209> do<00:03:00.329> some<00:03:00.569> sort<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
so they had to do some sort of

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.690 
so they had to do some sort of
structural<00:03:01.319> works<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.889> get<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.100> third<00:03:02.430> tier

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
structural works to get the third tier

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.650 
structural works to get the third tier
on<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:03.030> without<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.299> whole<00:03:03.450> thing

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
on there without the whole thing

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.870 
on there without the whole thing
collapsing<00:03:04.139> under<00:03:04.260> its<00:03:04.380> own<00:03:04.620> way<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.069> since

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
collapsing under its own way and since

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.490 
collapsing under its own way and since
then<00:03:06.150> they've<00:03:06.389> been<00:03:06.420> trying<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.989> catch<00:03:07.200> up

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
then they've been trying to catch up

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.750 
then they've been trying to catch up
putting<00:03:07.799> more<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.100> more<00:03:08.310> up-to-date

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
putting more and more up-to-date

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.379 
putting more and more up-to-date
facilities<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.380> if<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.730> play<00:03:11.970> FIFA

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
facilities in there and if you play FIFA

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:14.330 
facilities in there and if you play FIFA
13<00:03:12.420> and<00:03:13.139> you<00:03:13.290> play<00:03:13.470> at<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> Berner<00:03:13.829> bow<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.100> lot

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
13 and you play at the Berner bow a lot

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.400 
13 and you play at the Berner bow a lot
you've<00:03:14.549> probably<00:03:14.790> heard<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.840> two<00:03:16.049> English

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
you've probably heard the two English

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.940 
you've probably heard the two English
commentators<00:03:17.060> saying<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.900> for<00:03:19.590> years<00:03:19.620> now

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
commentators saying that for years now

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.349

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.729 
they've been coming to the Bern of bow

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739

commentators in very famous stadiums

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.070 
commentators in very famous stadiums
they<00:03:55.700> do<00:03:55.850> a<00:03:55.880> little<00:03:56.180> bit<00:03:56.330> about<00:03:56.510> how<00:03:56.690> they<00:03:56.870> turn

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.480 
they do a little bit about how they turn
up<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.410> they're<00:03:57.560> never<00:03:57.710> quite<00:03:57.950> sure<00:03:58.250> what

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490

up and they're never quite sure what
side<00:03:58.790> they're<00:03:59.030> going<00:03:59.180> to<00:03:59.270> be<00:03:59.420> on<00:03:59.600> because<00:04:00.200> the

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
side they're going to be on because the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.180 
side they're going to be on because the
stadium<00:04:00.920> has<00:04:01.010> been<00:04:01.040> updated<00:04:01.960> I'm<00:04:02.960> nearly<00:04:03.800> done

stadium has been updated I'm nearly done

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.890 
stadium has been updated I'm nearly done
here<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.610> only<00:04:04.790> thing<00:04:04.910> I've<00:04:05.180> got<00:04:05.210> to<00:04:05.360> say<00:04:05.660> now

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
here the only thing I've got to say now

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.900 
here the only thing I've got to say now
is<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.350> they're<00:04:06.800> planning<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.190> expand<00:04:07.760> it

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
is that they're planning to expand it

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.510 
is that they're planning to expand it
again<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:09.020> president<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.620> Real<00:04:09.830> Madrid<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.280> few

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
again the president of Real Madrid a few

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.250 
again the president of Real Madrid a few
years<00:04:10.790> ago<00:04:10.940> I<00:04:11.090> think<00:04:11.210> when<00:04:11.450> Joe<00:04:11.630> say<00:04:11.840> Mourinho

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
years ago I think when Joe say Mourinho

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.440 
years ago I think when Joe say Mourinho
turned<00:04:12.530> up<00:04:12.770> said<00:04:13.040> and<00:04:13.340> they<00:04:13.850> need<00:04:14.000> to<00:04:14.120> compete

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
turned up said and they need to compete

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.970

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
with the Nou Camp which is obviously the

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.800 
with the Nou Camp which is obviously the
only<00:04:16.130> stadium<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.880> Spain<00:04:17.150> bigger<00:04:17.450> than<00:04:17.660> this

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
only stadium in Spain bigger than this

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.140 
only stadium in Spain bigger than this
one<00:04:18.110> to<00:04:18.620> my<00:04:18.770> knowledge<00:04:18.799> they<00:04:19.580> need<00:04:19.640> to<00:04:19.790> compete

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
one to my knowledge they need to compete

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.490 
one to my knowledge they need to compete
with<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.360> more<00:04:20.750> now<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.110> they're<00:04:21.230> planning

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
with that more now and they're planning

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.420 
with that more now and they're planning
to<00:04:21.530> expand<00:04:21.980> it<00:04:22.100> up<00:04:22.190> to<00:04:22.370> over<00:04:22.570> 90,000<00:04:23.570> seats<00:04:24.430> so

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
to expand it up to over 90,000 seats so

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.920 
to expand it up to over 90,000 seats so
yeah<00:04:26.150> so<00:04:26.540> clearly<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.890> works<00:04:28.130> aren't<00:04:28.520> done<00:04:28.930> at

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
yeah so clearly the works aren't done at

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.560 
yeah so clearly the works aren't done at
this<00:04:30.470> stadium<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.220> they<00:04:31.940> clearly<00:04:32.210> think<00:04:32.390> they

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
this stadium and they clearly think they

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.650 
this stadium and they clearly think they
can<00:04:32.750> get<00:04:32.990> more<00:04:33.260> out<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.560> it<00:04:33.950> but<00:04:34.760> that's<00:04:35.420> all<00:04:35.630> I

can get more out of it but that's all I

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.100 
can get more out of it but that's all I
