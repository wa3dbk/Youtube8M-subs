00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
debut after an injury kept him out of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
debut after an injury kept him out of
the<00:01:42.329> first<00:01:42.509> two<00:01:42.689> games<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:44.100> converted

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the first two games and they converted

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.300 
the first two games and they converted
from<00:01:44.759> back<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> back<00:01:46.079> three<00:01:46.590> that's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
from back for to a back three that's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.039 
from back for to a back three that's
really<00:01:47.579> allowed<00:01:47.880> Ralston<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.540> feel

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
really allowed Ralston to feel

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.120 
really allowed Ralston to feel
comfortable<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.619> think<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> midfield

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
comfortable I think in the midfield

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
comfortable I think in the midfield
where<00:01:50.490> they<00:01:50.549> were<00:01:50.610> five<00:01:50.880> Greg<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.960> you're

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
where they were five Greg I think you're

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230 
where they were five Greg I think you're
right<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.040> big<00:01:53.430> believer<00:01:53.460> there's<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
right I'm not a big believer there's a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.480 
right I'm not a big believer there's a
huge<00:01:54.479> difference<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:56.070> New<00:01:56.159> England<00:01:56.460> I

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
huge difference but for New England I

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.100 
huge difference but for New England I
think<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.759> difference<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.450> Steve<00:01:57.659> Ralston

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
think the difference is of Steve Ralston

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.020 
think the difference is of Steve Ralston
Steve<00:01:58.350> Ralston's<00:01:58.890> presence<00:01:59.430> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.850> midfield

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Steve Ralston's presence in the midfield

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.090 
Steve Ralston's presence in the midfield
really<00:02:00.930> gives<00:02:01.110> everybody<00:02:01.409> confidence

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
really gives everybody confidence

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.469 
really gives everybody confidence
especially<00:02:02.310> without<00:02:02.729> Taylor<00:02:03.060> Twellman<00:02:03.240> up

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
especially without Taylor Twellman up

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.450 
especially without Taylor Twellman up
top<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:04.140> got<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.500> he's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> go-to<00:02:05.100> guy

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
top you got it because he's a go-to guy

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.280 
top you got it because he's a go-to guy
knows<00:02:05.969> how<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> get<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> ball<00:02:06.659> knows<00:02:07.049> how<00:02:07.229> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
knows how to get the ball knows how to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
knows how to get the ball knows how to
look<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> quick<00:02:08.580> fair<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.300> he

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
look up make a quick fair so I think he

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.960 
look up make a quick fair so I think he
opens<00:02:09.929> things<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.440> probably<00:02:11.250> better<00:02:11.520> you're

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
opens things up probably better you're

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.500 
opens things up probably better you're

system<00:02:16.269> really<00:02:16.540> helps<00:02:16.810> it'll<00:02:17.049> be<00:02:17.110> interesting

struggling right now which actually
seems<00:02:30.129> to<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.430> what<00:02:30.579> we<00:02:30.670> say<00:02:30.879> every<00:02:31.060> week<00:02:31.390> and

seems to be what we say every week and

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.330 
seems to be what we say every week and
at<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.019> beginning<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.470> every<00:02:32.709> season<00:02:32.950> we<00:02:33.099> talk

at the beginning of every season we talk
about<00:02:33.459> Houston<00:02:33.879> struggling<00:02:34.299> most<00:02:35.140> concerning

about Houston struggling most concerning

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.380 
about Houston struggling most concerning
only<00:02:36.069> three<00:02:36.370> goals<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:36.819> their<00:02:36.940> first<00:02:37.120> four

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
only three goals in their first four

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.759 
only three goals in their first four
games<00:02:37.629> I<00:02:37.870> don't<00:02:38.230> think<00:02:38.379> there's<00:02:38.500> any<00:02:38.620> question

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
games I don't think there's any question

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.949 
games I don't think there's any question
I'm<00:02:39.310> not<00:02:39.489> a<00:02:39.519> big<00:02:39.730> believer<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:40.150> KY<00:02:40.450> Kamara

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
I'm not a big believer that KY Kamara

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.770 
I'm not a big believer that KY Kamara
really<00:02:41.739> complements<00:02:42.609> Brian<00:02:42.879> Ching<00:02:43.209> up<00:02:43.359> Tom<00:02:43.599> I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
really complements Brian Ching up Tom I

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.080 
really complements Brian Ching up Tom I
think<00:02:44.019> he<00:02:44.170> he<00:02:44.680> instead<00:02:45.250> of<00:02:45.280> using<00:02:45.519> his<00:02:45.760> speed

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
think he he instead of using his speed

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.940 
think he he instead of using his speed
to<00:02:46.299> get<00:02:46.420> out<00:02:46.599> wide<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.870> think<00:02:47.260> he's<00:02:47.409> cramming

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
to get out wide I think he's cramming

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.710 
to get out wide I think he's cramming
things<00:02:48.250> trying<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.909> win<00:02:49.120> balls<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.690> air

things trying to win balls in the air

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.259 
things trying to win balls in the air
and<00:02:50.079> really<00:02:50.709> cramping<00:02:51.129> Brian<00:02:51.370> Shane<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.120> and

they are two-time MLS champs with a
couple<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.180> years<00:03:25.209> ago<00:03:25.389> which<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.079> why<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> think

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
couple of years ago which is why I think

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.930 
couple of years ago which is why I think
actually<00:03:26.799> this<00:03:27.040> is<00:03:27.160> a<00:03:27.190> big<00:03:27.459> test<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.790> the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
actually this is a big test for the

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.849 
actually this is a big test for the
Colorado<00:03:28.329> Rapids<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.870> think<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.139> win<00:03:29.379> would<00:03:29.650> put

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.400 
Colorado Rapids I think a win would put
them<00:03:30.040> squarely<00:03:30.579> into<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.030> conversation

them squarely into the conversation
