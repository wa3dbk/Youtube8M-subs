00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
fullscreen is to drag it to the top and

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.340 
fullscreen is to drag it to the top and
it<00:01:43.619> really<00:01:44.159> fills<00:01:44.490> up<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> full<00:01:45.000> screen<00:01:45.350> and

bit of space if you want them closer
together<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:33.040> really<00:02:33.730> use<00:02:34.060> every<00:02:34.329> pixel

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
together to really use every pixel

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.610 
together to really use every pixel

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
that was a right-click and it brings up

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.099 
that was a right-click and it brings up
all<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.970> options<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:07.180> can<00:03:07.359> achieve<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.870> same

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
all the options you can achieve the same

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
that same thing like so and then we can

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.520 
that same thing like so and then we can
do<00:03:16.780> let's<00:03:17.380> say<00:03:17.560> bottom<00:03:18.040> left<00:03:18.340> on<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.510> one<00:03:19.690> so

take one minute to show you one thing

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.369 
take one minute to show you one thing
that<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.590> don't<00:03:29.709> like<00:03:30.280> about<00:03:30.310> it<00:03:30.819> so<00:03:31.049> let's<00:03:32.049> say

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379 
that I don't like about it so let's say

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.280 
that I don't like about it so let's say
I<00:03:32.769> have<00:03:33.430> this<00:03:33.639> Safari<00:03:34.239> window<00:03:34.660> down<00:03:34.840> here<00:03:35.169> I

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
I have this Safari window down here I

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.069 
I have this Safari window down here I
have<00:03:35.470> scooted<00:03:35.889> it<00:03:36.040> down<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> corner<00:03:37.329> but

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
have scooted it down to the corner but

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.979 
have scooted it down to the corner but
let's<00:03:38.500> say<00:03:38.650> I<00:03:38.709> want<00:03:38.769> that<00:03:39.099> size<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.540> I<00:03:40.599> wanted

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
let's say I want that size but I wanted

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.740 
let's say I want that size but I wanted
up<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.500> middle<00:03:41.859> so<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.340> top<00:03:42.910> here<00:03:43.540> is

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
up in the middle so that the top here is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.140 
up in the middle so that the top here is
right<00:03:44.139> around<00:03:44.290> here<00:03:44.940> theoretically<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:46.060> should

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
right around here theoretically I should

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.360 
right around here theoretically I should
be<00:03:46.419> able<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.720> click<00:03:46.989> here<00:03:47.349> and<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:48.099> drag

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
be able to click here and just drag

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.789 
be able to click here and just drag
upwards<00:03:48.970> but<00:03:49.510> when<00:03:49.629> I<00:03:49.660> do<00:03:49.780> that<00:03:50.230> watch<00:03:50.530> what

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
upwards but when I do that watch what

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.140 
upwards but when I do that watch what
happens<00:03:52.349> it<00:03:53.349> automatically<00:03:54.220> changes<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:55.000> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
happens it automatically changes to a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.720 
happens it automatically changes to a
bigger<00:03:55.389> size<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.959> didn't<00:03:56.680> tell<00:03:56.919> it<00:03:56.949> to<00:03:57.250> change

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
bigger size I didn't tell it to change

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.729 
bigger size I didn't tell it to change
to<00:03:57.819> a<00:03:58.000> bigger<00:03:58.239> size<00:03:58.510> and<00:03:58.840> I<00:03:59.260> don't<00:03:59.500> see

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
to a bigger size and I don't see

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.520 
to a bigger size and I don't see
anywhere<00:04:00.069> in<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.459> Preferences<00:04:02.639> where<00:04:03.639> I<00:04:04.530> can

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
anywhere in the Preferences where I can

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.680 
anywhere in the Preferences where I can
prevent<00:04:06.069> that<00:04:06.280> from<00:04:06.340> happening<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:09.190> let's<00:04:09.699> do

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
prevent that from happening so let's do

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.900 
prevent that from happening so let's do
it<00:04:10.720> again

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
it again

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.939 
it again
up<00:04:12.910> here<00:04:13.419> and<00:04:13.690> actually<00:04:13.900> we<00:04:14.230> can<00:04:14.410> accomplish

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
up here and actually we can accomplish

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.420 
up here and actually we can accomplish
it<00:04:16.199> we're<00:04:17.199> gonna<00:04:17.320> make<00:04:17.530> this<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:17.889> full<00:04:18.160> size

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
it we're gonna make this one full size

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.509 
it we're gonna make this one full size
let's<00:04:19.359> go<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> Google<00:04:20.169> Chrome<00:04:20.560> let's<00:04:21.159> say<00:04:21.370> we

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
let's go to Google Chrome let's say we

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.610 
let's go to Google Chrome let's say we
drag<00:04:21.820> this<00:04:22.030> to<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:22.300> lower<00:04:22.570> right<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:23.229> happens

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
drag this to the lower right it happens

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.050 
drag this to the lower right it happens
with<00:04:23.800> chrome<00:04:24.099> as<00:04:24.400> well

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
with chrome as well

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.620 
with chrome as well
and<00:04:26.870> lips<00:04:27.500> if<00:04:27.860> I<00:04:27.980> go<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.220> finder<00:04:29.000> let's<00:04:29.389> get<00:04:29.600> a

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and lips if I go to finder let's get a

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.600 
and lips if I go to finder let's get a
new<00:04:29.870> window<00:04:30.260> open<00:04:30.680> it<00:04:31.130> happens<00:04:31.460> with

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
new window open it happens with

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.400 
new window open it happens with
everything<00:04:31.880> so<00:04:32.180> it's<00:04:32.300> not<00:04:32.420> limited<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.900> Safari

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
everything so it's not limited to Safari

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.720 
everything so it's not limited to Safari
and<00:04:33.530> Chrome

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
and Chrome

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.050 
and Chrome
quarter-sized<00:04:36.100> drag<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.580> increases

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
quarter-sized drag it and it increases

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.950 
quarter-sized drag it and it increases
let's<00:04:38.480> go

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
let's go

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.190 
let's go
half<00:04:39.380> size<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.450> now<00:04:41.450> I'm<00:04:41.570> going<00:04:41.690> to<00:04:41.750> drag<00:04:41.990> it

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
half size and now I'm going to drag it

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.750 
half size and now I'm going to drag it
and<00:04:44.050> magically<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.290> stays<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.800> same<00:04:45.830> so

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
and magically that stays the same so

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.400 
and magically that stays the same so
it's<00:04:46.790> something<00:04:47.210> that<00:04:47.360> is<00:04:47.540> only<00:04:47.780> happening

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
it's something that is only happening

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.620 
it's something that is only happening

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
corner but let's say I go fullscreen and

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.970 
corner but let's say I go fullscreen and
now<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:53.600> want<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.050> move<00:04:54.230> it<00:04:54.410> maybe<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.680> want<00:04:54.889> to
