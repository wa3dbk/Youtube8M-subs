00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the liner but she does sometimes kind of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.170 
the liner but she does sometimes kind of
switch<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.290> up<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.860> bronzy<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.850> even<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
switch it up and do a bronzy I or even a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.330 
switch it up and do a bronzy I or even a
shimmery<00:01:39.570> kind<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> gold<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.500> lid<00:01:40.680> so<00:01:41.310> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
shimmery kind of gold on the lid so it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.980 
shimmery kind of gold on the lid so it
all<00:01:41.490> depends<00:01:41.820> on<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.780> what

palette<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.590> taking<00:02:04.830> it<00:02:04.890> on<00:02:05.010> a<00:02:05.040> fluffy

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
palette I'm just taking it on a fluffy

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.910 
palette I'm just taking it on a fluffy
brush<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.780> I'm<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.440> sweep<00:02:07.710> this

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
brush and I'm just going to sweep this

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.040 
brush and I'm just going to sweep this
all<00:02:08.190> over<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> lid<00:02:08.820> and<00:02:09.060> even<00:02:09.360> up<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> brow

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
all over the lid and even up to the brow

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.830 
all over the lid and even up to the brow
bone<00:02:10.520> because<00:02:11.520> her<00:02:11.670> whole<00:02:11.850> entire<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
bone because her whole entire I is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.600 
bone because her whole entire I is
usually<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.170> really<00:02:13.560> mad<00:02:13.800> but<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.490> can

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
usually just really mad but you can

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.480 
usually just really mad but you can
definitely<00:02:14.760> something<00:02:15.600> there<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.860> because<00:02:17.400> i

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
definitely something there and because i

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.800 
definitely something there and because i
do<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.670> oily<00:02:18.360> lids<00:02:18.810> i<00:02:19.170> do<00:02:19.260> like<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> do<00:02:20.190> this

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
do have oily lids i do like to do this

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.750 
do have oily lids i do like to do this
so<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.840> way<00:02:22.230> doesn't<00:02:22.650> crease<00:02:23.190> already<00:02:23.550> think

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
so that way doesn't crease already think

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.310 
so that way doesn't crease already think
throughout<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> day<00:02:24.270> so<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:24.990> crease<00:02:25.170> i'm

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
throughout the day so for the crease i'm

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.420 
throughout the day so for the crease i'm
going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> use<00:02:25.590> this<00:02:25.709> color<00:02:25.920> right<00:02:26.010> here<00:02:26.130> which

just<00:03:25.280> goes<00:03:25.459> in<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:25.760> flow<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.450> just<00:03:26.630> follows

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
just goes in a flow and it just follows

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.630 
just goes in a flow and it just follows
her<00:03:27.170> eye<00:03:27.350> so<00:03:27.830> that's<00:03:28.010> exactly<00:03:28.160> what<00:03:28.400> i'm<00:03:28.550> going

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
her eye so that's exactly what i'm going

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.920 
her eye so that's exactly what i'm going
to<00:03:28.700> do<00:03:28.850> i'm<00:03:28.970> just<00:03:29.000> going<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.270> do<00:03:29.330> a<00:03:29.390> very<00:03:29.600> thin

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
to do i'm just going to do a very thin

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.080 
to do i'm just going to do a very thin
and<00:03:30.200> short<00:03:30.620> line<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.160> doesn't<00:03:31.250> go<00:03:31.519> up<00:03:31.700> too<00:03:31.910> much

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and short line it doesn't go up too much

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.839 
and short line it doesn't go up too much
it<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.540> stays<00:03:32.780> right<00:03:33.050> on<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.430> lid<00:03:34.610> area

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
it just stays right on like the lid area

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.390 
it just stays right on like the lid area
basically<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.959> just<00:03:36.110> extends<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.860> little<00:03:37.280> bit

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
basically it just extends a little bit

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.820 
basically it just extends a little bit
more<00:03:37.580> so<00:03:38.030> for<00:03:38.630> this<00:03:38.750> i'm<00:03:38.989> going<00:03:39.110> to<00:03:39.170> use<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.530> very

Urban Decay 24-7 liner and perversion is
no<00:05:00.199> but<00:05:00.349> we<00:05:00.409> have<00:05:00.439> that<00:05:00.889> on<00:05:01.129> as<00:05:01.279> you<00:05:01.370> can<00:05:01.550> see<00:05:01.729> it

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:01.849 
no but we have that on as you can see it

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:03.700 
no but we have that on as you can see it
creates<00:05:02.120> a<00:05:02.180> really<00:05:02.270> nice<00:05:02.479> smoky<00:05:02.990> edgy<00:05:03.349> effect

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
creates a really nice smoky edgy effect

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.619 
creates a really nice smoky edgy effect
and<00:05:04.189> it<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:04.639> looks<00:05:04.939> really<00:05:05.240> nice<00:05:05.360> on<00:05:05.569> her

and it just looks really nice on her

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:07.809 
and it just looks really nice on her
eyes<00:05:05.960> as<00:05:06.289> well<00:05:06.500> because<00:05:07.250> she<00:05:07.370> has<00:05:07.490> smaller

00:05:07.809 --> 00:05:07.819 
eyes as well because she has smaller

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.490 
eyes as well because she has smaller
eyes<00:05:08.089> so<00:05:08.419> it<00:05:08.539> just<00:05:08.719> makes<00:05:08.930> her<00:05:09.080> eye<00:05:09.229> color

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
eyes so it just makes her eye color

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.589 
eyes so it just makes her eye color
stand<00:05:09.860> out<00:05:10.039> even<00:05:10.189> more<00:05:10.370> so<00:05:11.060> now<00:05:11.089> we<00:05:11.210> have<00:05:11.330> that

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 
stand out even more so now we have that

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:13.420 
stand out even more so now we have that
is<00:05:11.719> time<00:05:11.900> to<00:05:12.050> move<00:05:12.080> on<00:05:12.349> into<00:05:12.560> the<00:05:12.770> lashes<00:05:13.250> and

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
is time to move on into the lashes and

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.610 
is time to move on into the lashes and
for<00:05:13.610> her<00:05:13.729> lashes<00:05:13.939> she<00:05:14.599> has<00:05:14.719> very<00:05:14.870> full<00:05:15.289> and

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:15.620 
for her lashes she has very full and

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.890 
for her lashes she has very full and
thick<00:05:15.830> lashes<00:05:16.129> so<00:05:16.580> I'm<00:05:16.789> assuming<00:05:17.029> she<00:05:17.569> uses

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
thick lashes so I'm assuming she uses

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.899 
thick lashes so I'm assuming she uses
false<00:05:18.110> lashes<00:05:18.409> most<00:05:18.800> of<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:18.979> time<00:05:19.189> so<00:05:19.789> what

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909 
false lashes most of the time so what

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:21.519 
false lashes most of the time so what
I'm<00:05:19.999> going<00:05:20.180> to<00:05:20.389> use<00:05:20.539> is<00:05:20.689> the<00:05:20.810> individual

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:21.529 
I'm going to use is the individual

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.170 
I'm going to use is the individual
lashes<00:05:21.800> and<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.400> reason<00:05:22.610> why<00:05:22.729> i'm<00:05:22.789> using<00:05:23.060> this

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
lashes and the reason why i'm using this

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.209 
lashes and the reason why i'm using this
is<00:05:23.360> because<00:05:23.750> i<00:05:23.960> haven't<00:05:24.229> done<00:05:24.500> last<00:05:24.800> shopping

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:25.219 
is because i haven't done last shopping

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:26.379 
is because i haven't done last shopping
in<00:05:25.310> a<00:05:25.370> while<00:05:25.520> so<00:05:25.789> i<00:05:25.849> don't<00:05:26.060> really<00:05:26.089> have

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
in a while so i don't really have
