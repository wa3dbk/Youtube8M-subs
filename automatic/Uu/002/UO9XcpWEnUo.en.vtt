00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.719
 screwed to the end and just hang out 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 so getting there 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:31.629

 add oak woodworking teams 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.339
 here so the politics here is real 

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:33.149
 and she's such that you canâ€™t say at all 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:34.329

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.589
 really 2 but there are still 22 virtual ones and they 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.549
 really work 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.749
 this is felt on the marginal regimes 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:52.229
 motor work 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:54.499
 at the moment when he starts 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.849
 increase 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.639

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.979
 work opened on the hood of acapulco 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.729

 the car really starts it myself 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.219
 According to the schedule I was written off based on the results 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.240
 I can in one part 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.870
 it made a key 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.430
 right turns 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.430

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.900
 no effort matter for art 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.759

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.569
 one dollar tons of snow 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.569
