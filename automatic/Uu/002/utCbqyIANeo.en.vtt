to get one because I am interested in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.249 
to get one because I am interested in
learning<00:01:32.490> how<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> solve<00:01:33.180> one<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.600> right<00:01:34.110> away

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
don't know how to solve one but i will

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.740 
don't know how to solve one but i will
scramble<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:59.299> you'd<00:02:00.299> be<00:02:00.450> probably

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
scramble one so you'd be probably

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.109

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.499 
cringed watching me do that because that
was<00:02:03.329> very<00:02:03.710> hideous<00:02:04.710> as<00:02:04.950> i<00:02:05.100> turned<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:06.210> it

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
was very hideous as i turned it but it

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.809 
was very hideous as i turned it but it
turns<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.140> really<00:02:07.469> nicely<00:02:07.680> absolutely<00:02:08.640> no

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
turns really really nicely absolutely no

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.249 
turns really really nicely absolutely no
reason<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.539> bit<00:02:09.690> i<00:02:09.869> wasn't<00:02:10.229> even

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
reason a little bit i wasn't even

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.470 
reason a little bit i wasn't even
planning<00:02:10.619> on<00:02:10.800> doing<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.069> anyway<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:12.120> I'm

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
planning on doing that anyway but I'm

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.300 
planning on doing that anyway but I'm
actually<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.019> try<00:02:14.319> solving<00:02:14.709> it<00:02:15.069> real

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
actually going to try solving it real

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.309 
actually going to try solving it real
quick<00:02:15.580> it's<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:16.330> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.659> happen<00:02:16.780> more<00:02:17.050> than

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
quick it's not going to happen more than

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.080 
quick it's not going to happen more than
likely<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.010> I<00:02:18.069> still<00:02:18.489> thought<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.849> I<00:02:18.879> would

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
likely but I still thought that I would

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.949 
likely but I still thought that I would
try<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:24.430> was<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.610> very<00:02:24.700> failed<00:02:25.269> attempt<00:02:25.840> at

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
try it that was a very failed attempt at

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.100 
try it that was a very failed attempt at
attempting<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.769> solve<00:02:27.010> this<00:02:27.310> but<00:02:28.060> there<00:02:28.930> we

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
attempting to solve this but there we

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.289 
attempting to solve this but there we
have<00:02:29.290> this<00:02:29.470> cube<00:02:29.950> I'm<00:02:30.370> sorry<00:02:30.879> that<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.090> wasn't

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
have this cube I'm sorry that I wasn't

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.449 
have this cube I'm sorry that I wasn't
able<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.690> solve<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:31.989> for<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.170> guys<00:02:32.260> but<00:02:32.860> that

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
able to solve it for you guys but that

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.539 
able to solve it for you guys but that
was<00:02:33.640> not<00:02:33.819> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.060> happen<00:02:34.269> at<00:02:34.629> all<00:02:35.519> so<00:02:36.519> far

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
was not going to happen at all so far

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.699 
was not going to happen at all so far
really<00:02:37.150> like<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.480> puzzle<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.080> got<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.560> figure

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
really like this puzzle I got to figure

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.990 
really like this puzzle I got to figure
out<00:02:38.830> how<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.980> solve<00:02:39.220> it<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.610> then<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.760> will

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
out how to solve it and then I will

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.369 
out how to solve it and then I will
probably<00:02:40.180> end<00:02:40.450> up<00:02:40.510> putting<00:02:40.690> an<00:02:40.840> average<00:02:41.200> out

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
probably end up putting an average out

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.580 
probably end up putting an average out
there<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.519> have<00:02:42.790> an<00:02:42.879> average<00:02:43.030> of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
there just so that I have an average of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.650 
there just so that I have an average of
skewed<00:02:44.590> when<00:02:44.829> I<00:02:44.860> first<00:02:45.159> started<00:02:45.519> doing<00:02:45.700> it<00:02:46.000> so

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
skewed when I first started doing it so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.330 
skewed when I first started doing it so
I<00:02:46.959> hope<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.349> enjoyed<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.709> unboxing<00:02:47.769> is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I hope you enjoyed this unboxing is

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.979 
I hope you enjoyed this unboxing is
really<00:02:48.579> short<00:02:48.760> there<00:02:49.030> really<00:02:49.209> wasn't<00:02:49.390> much<00:02:49.569> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
really short there really wasn't much to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.240 
really short there really wasn't much to
it<00:02:50.019> this<00:02:50.590> is<00:02:50.829> part<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.129> my<00:02:51.190> Christmas<00:02:51.670> cubes<00:02:52.060> um

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
it this is part of my Christmas cubes um

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.190 
it this is part of my Christmas cubes um
so<00:02:54.250> I'm<00:02:54.489> probably<00:02:54.670> not<00:02:54.879> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.090> unbox<00:02:55.390> or

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
so I'm probably not going to unbox or

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.140 
so I'm probably not going to unbox or
put<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> unboxing<00:02:57.040> out<00:02:57.190> until<00:02:57.430> after<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.910> make

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
put the unboxing out until after I make

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.210 
put the unboxing out until after I make
my<00:02:58.269> Christmas<00:02:58.420> cubes<00:02:58.900> video<00:02:59.170> oh<00:02:59.410> hey<00:02:59.920> look<00:03:00.099> I
