00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.740
 still in the interior of the continent to investigate the climate changes the 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.990
 study of the Antarctic and climate research center of the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.619
 federal university of rio grande do sul 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.300
 integrated the fourth year that the international referee scientists from 64 countries 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.000
 worked for two years until March 2009 to learn more about the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.110
 polar regions glaciologist jefferson simões she walked the important 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.110
 brazilian initiative the desert of crystal expedition 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.240
 of these five are formed by snow and ice 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.110
 all the works provided for a series of physical-chemical analyzes and from there 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.339
 of these analyzes 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.529
 I can not tell the environmental history of planet earth through thousands of 

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:55.099
 millions of years at the moment is what we are going to merit knowing that he 

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:56.660
 carry with you 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.479
 the whole history of philosophy 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:59.269
 for example 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.550
 volcanic eruptions of great emotions 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.750
 n 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 anxious in the project processes of great desertification on planet earth 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.450
 it's more important 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.520
 after the air bubbles that have been retained in which they are 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 history of atmosphere chemistry last year 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.060
 the breasts reveal for example 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.439
 carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in a given period 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.070
 as it is one of the gases that intensify the greenhouse effect 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 it helps raise the temperature on earth 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.460
 more than 10,000 scientists from 60 countries 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.170
 including Brazil come to a conclusion is not fantastic how much 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.840
 vasco 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.850
 we are trying faster than we imagined this has influence of the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 global warming the ice sheets are melting 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.010
 previously it was believed that in Antarctica 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.939
 only the western part of the peninsula facing South America 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.679
 and that the part therefore has such that it forms two-thirds of the continent 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.910
 It would be cold today, so much kartika is known. 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.349
 all her parents 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.539
 when practiced by the coolers of the planet 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:17.620
 tropical regions receive five times more heat from the sun 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.770
 what settlers the continent helps to balance 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.960
 for this difference 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.420
 the interaction between these regions chera cold rain fronts 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.520
 the movement of servers like everything that happens in the Antarctic has repercussions 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.489
 in Brazil the olympic national institute of space research cptec / inpe in this 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.489
 station at the Brazilian base 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.340
 on the day of our visit on the departure in tries of up to 107 kilometers by 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:51.200
 hour here are collected pressure temperature states with humility 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.119
 radiation salary 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:57.539
 in addition to being available on the inter site are sent to services 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:03:04.399
 world weather the researcher the offer if you want to see with 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:07.409
 caution the temperature oscillations 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.519
 specifically in the case of the region of each Brazilian coffee station and up to 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.609
 north of the Antarctic peninsula 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.989
 In the last 60 years there is a 2005 warming 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.439
 which is one of the largest on the planet outside you talk the presents is mine 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.139
 only brazilian team 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:33.509
 we verified a company even with the distance in 2007 year 

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:39.089
 the other injured in the last 20 years coming close to the prices of less than 31 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.850
 degrees 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.590
 I really trust him 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.760
 the sides condemned the two sides that fuel the station so we had 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.699
 lack of water in summer 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.799
 after all, it was not admissible that it was not very complicated in this session 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.009
 starting from the front 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.059
 ninety days 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:04:00.029
 the ice bridge fall holding continent the wilkins platform 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.850
 a major conflict eight times the size of the city of são paulo was a 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.340
 warnings about the effects of global warming on the continent 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.410
 if all ice in Antarctica melts, the level of 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.410
 oceans would rise 60 meters 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.759
 the glacier larsen of the south peninsula lake also singer saying a lot 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:24.450
 animation 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:30.260
 in 16 years the third was of an area of ​​37 times the size of the city of são 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:31.379
 Paulo 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.789
 the region also recorded an increase in the intensity frequency of the cyclones 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.319
 which may indicate that the new surveys show that the 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.669
 curiosity to wal-mart we are without burns in amazon the chains of 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.819
 wind in certain circumstances lead to emissions of 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:50.480
 region 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.889
 succeed 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.389
 in which you have as a result the contamination has not yet 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.249
 contamination of the Luanda region's judgment 

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.219
 it was that part of the world 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.729
 in another place the document and research the solar radiation in the highest layer was 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:10.750
 from a cell 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.870
 by means of the radio waves, news coming out of here fuels the discussions 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.740
 on global warming we are now in a period that we call 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.740
 minimum of school activity 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.350
 and properties 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.560
 Magnetic fields of salt are indicating that it was decaying upwards 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.409
 stage of activity is going to be 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.479
 and this occurred basically in 1816 when the small age of the ice is caught in 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:43.729
 transmission is frozen 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:46.839
 and there are some fans some theoretical issue 

00:05:46.839 --> 00:05:52.209
 a society yes with him also a possible arrival of a new one in the region 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:58.900
 I need to investigate further. 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.130
 but greece and suffer the increase of the global temperature there are other 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.130
 factors at play with the temperature of the oceans 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.220
 a block 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
 more than 2,500 scientists from one 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.860
 in these surveys 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.830
 in the following the penalty of kings is how to punish someone expanding the coverage in 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.160
 time after all or nothing the global actress 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:31.680
 on your return 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.180
 second castro 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.099
 brazilwiki 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.099
 no matter what happens 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:53.519
 you will see in the region another number as was the life in the Brazilian station 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:58.930
 the arigon general ship meeting with another pioneer in Antarctic research 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.650
 bas at age 72 died at that time the basin of fields still facing the cold 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:08.509
 extreme in search of scientific knowledge do not miss
