00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.749 
to do a weak sound quality review of the
condenser<00:00:08.760> microphone<00:00:09.179> named<00:00:09.450> as<00:00:09.719> if

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
condenser microphone named as if

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:15.379 
condenser microphone named as if
six-six-six<00:00:11.759> so<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.809> can<00:00:12.990> see<00:00:14.210> this<00:00:15.210> is

six-six-six so as you can see this is

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.090 
six-six-six so as you can see this is
the<00:00:15.540> distance<00:00:15.870> between<00:00:16.109> me<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.859> my

the distance between me and my
microphone<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:18.750> if<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.320> get<00:00:19.500> too<00:00:20.070> closer<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
microphone and a if I get too closer to

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.700 
microphone and a if I get too closer to
this<00:00:20.789> microphone<00:00:21.300> this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.960> voice<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
this microphone this is the voice you

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.470 
this microphone this is the voice you
can<00:00:22.949> get<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> let's<00:00:25.289> see<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
can get so let's see some of the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.509 
can get so let's see some of the
features<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> specifications<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.800> this

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
features and specifications that this

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.749 
features and specifications that this
microphone<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.480> suffering<00:00:31.189> so<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
microphone is suffering so this is the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.970 
microphone is suffering so this is the
microphone<00:00:33.210> that<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.630> am<00:00:33.750> talking<00:00:34.050> about<00:00:34.170> SF

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
microphone that I am talking about SF

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.920 
microphone that I am talking about SF
666

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
666

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.979 
666
so<00:00:36.930> if<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.530> go<00:00:37.860> down<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.570> model

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
so if I go down and this is the model

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.330 
so if I go down and this is the model
number<00:00:40.020> safe<00:00:40.620> 686<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.320> in<00:00:43.320> these<00:00:43.590> product

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
number safe 686 so in these product

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.459 
number safe 686 so in these product
features<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.879> want<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.300> especially<00:00:45.600> focus<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
features I want to especially focus on

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.180 
features I want to especially focus on
one<00:00:47.010> product<00:00:47.520> feature<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.770> noise

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
one product feature that is the noise

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
one product feature that is the noise
cancellation<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:52.610> I<00:00:53.610> must<00:00:53.969> say<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
cancellation and I must say that this

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
cancellation and I must say that this
noise<00:00:55.260> cancellation<00:00:55.890> feature<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.309> working

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
noise cancellation feature is working

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.900 
noise cancellation feature is working
very<00:00:57.090> well<00:00:57.410> I'm<00:00:58.410> saying<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
very well I'm saying that because at the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.939 
very well I'm saying that because at the
moment<00:01:00.300> also

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
moment also

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:04.490 
moment also
there<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> huge<00:01:02.430> ceiling<00:01:03.090> fan<00:01:03.329> working<00:01:03.899> in

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
there is a huge ceiling fan working in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.240 
there is a huge ceiling fan working in
my<00:01:04.680> arrow<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:12.240> my<00:01:12.479> ceiling<00:01:13.049> fan<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.130> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
my arrow that's my ceiling fan so it is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.600 
my arrow that's my ceiling fan so it is
making<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:15.030> big<00:01:15.600> noise<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.340> can't

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
making a very big noise but you can't

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
making a very big noise but you can't
hear<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.030> noise<00:01:18.590> from<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:20.180> microphone<00:01:21.180> so

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
hear that noise from this microphone so

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
hear that noise from this microphone so
that<00:01:21.780> means<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.740> noise<00:01:23.220> cancellation

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
that means that noise cancellation

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.100 
that means that noise cancellation
feature<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> working<00:01:25.290> very<00:01:25.590> well<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
feature is working very well so that is

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
feature is working very well so that is
a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.320> news<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.860> could<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.060> this

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
a good news I could say that this

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
a good news I could say that this
microphone<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.079> worth<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> price<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
