the<00:00:45.600> manager<00:00:45.989> since<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.350> day<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.530> walked<00:00:46.770> in

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
the manager since the day I walked in

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.180 
the manager since the day I walked in
lamps<00:00:49.200> something<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> Faustian<00:00:49.920> I've

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
lamps something the Faustian I've

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.590 
lamps something the Faustian I've
continued<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.180> don't<00:00:51.239> think<00:00:51.360> it's

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
continued to and I don't think it's

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.939 
continued to and I don't think it's
funny<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> change<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:52.920> a

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
funny it's going to change here for a

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.069 
funny it's going to change here for a
long<00:00:53.129> time<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.579> even<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> manager<00:00:54.899> who's

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
long time I even think the manager who's

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.319 
long time I even think the manager who's
just<00:00:55.289> left<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.620> think<00:00:55.739> he<00:00:55.949> continuing<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.059> was

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
just left I think he continuing it was

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.560 
just left I think he continuing it was
landing<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.870> job<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> we're<00:00:59.670> I'm

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
landing the job as well so we're I'm

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.360 
landing the job as well so we're I'm
relatively<00:01:01.050> new<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:02.100> still

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
relatively new to it so I'm still

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.920 
relatively new to it so I'm still
welling<00:01:02.699> up<00:01:02.789> everything<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.600> has<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
welling up everything about it has that

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.210 
welling up everything about it has that
week<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.260> been<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.409> microcosm<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.129> what

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
week there been a microcosm but what

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.620 
week there been a microcosm but what
it's<00:01:05.339> about<00:01:05.400> maybe<00:01:05.970> stand<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.479> your<00:01:06.570> shoes

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it's about maybe stand in your shoes

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.289 
it's about maybe stand in your shoes
though<00:01:07.159> well<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.220> think<00:01:08.280> if<00:01:08.490> your<00:01:08.610> point<00:01:08.820> begins

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
though well I think if your point begins

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.760 
though well I think if your point begins
I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.689> that's<00:01:09.840> part<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.470> clubs

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
I think that's part of it as clubs

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
I think that's part of it as clubs
always<00:01:11.040> play<00:01:11.189> big<00:01:11.430> games<00:01:11.670> food<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:11.939> big

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
finals or knowing things which really

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.749

big pressure would imagine for you does

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.889 
big pressure would imagine for you does
it<00:01:56.280> get<00:01:56.399> easier<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.719> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
you so you're learning things all times

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.310 
you so you're learning things all times
that<00:01:59.340> pressure<00:01:59.610> change<00:01:59.939> as<00:02:00.180> well<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.630> think

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
that pressure change as well I think

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.780 
that pressure change as well I think
when<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.649> first<00:02:01.829> come<00:02:02.040> into<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> job<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
when you first come into the job as a

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.370 
when you first come into the job as a
young<00:02:03.030> manager<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.259> be

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
young manager and I think it can be

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.200 
young manager and I think it can be
difficult<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.979> found<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.579> when<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.880> young

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
difficult I found it when I was a young

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.059 
difficult I found it when I was a young
manager<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.630> Preston<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.649> found<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.039> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
manager at Preston and I found it when I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.190 
manager at Preston and I found it when I
was<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.220> young<00:02:08.369> manager<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.789> Everton<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:10.170> I

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
was a young manager at Everton but I

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.380 
was a young manager at Everton but I
feel<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.500> inventing<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:10.920> job<00:02:11.190> experienced

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
feel like inventing this job experienced

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.510 
feel like inventing this job experienced
you<00:02:12.450> know<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.830> done<00:02:13.830> a<00:02:13.860> lot<00:02:14.069> of<00:02:14.190> years<00:02:14.340> in<00:02:14.460> a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120 
you committed these football management
jobs<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:33.900> does<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.590> pressure<00:02:34.800> of<00:02:35.010> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
jobs and does the pressure of the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.460 
jobs and does the pressure of the
Premier<00:02:35.459> League<00:02:35.490> change<00:02:36.150> in<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.660> cup<00:02:36.900> game<00:02:37.200> or

I<00:02:40.010> think<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.190> games<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.580> also<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.880> think<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
I think the games can also I think the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.670 
I think the games can also I think the
drawers<00:02:42.390> can<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:43.050> change<00:02:43.319> how<00:02:43.500> you're
