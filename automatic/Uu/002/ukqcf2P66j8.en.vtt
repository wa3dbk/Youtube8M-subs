okay<00:00:02.159> so<00:00:02.220> we've<00:00:02.750> we've<00:00:03.750> positioned<00:00:04.020> our

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay so we've we've positioned our

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.079 
okay so we've we've positioned our
object<00:00:04.920> the<00:00:05.069> point<00:00:05.310> of<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.549> right<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> edge

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
object the point of it right on the edge

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.540 
object the point of it right on the edge
of<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.390> viewing<00:00:06.750> plane<00:00:06.990> and<00:00:07.680> we've<00:00:08.340> come

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
of this viewing plane and we've come

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.879 
of this viewing plane and we've come
back<00:00:08.700> now<00:00:08.910> thirty<00:00:09.330> degrees<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:10.380> either<00:00:10.500> side

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
back now thirty degrees on either side

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.919 
back now thirty degrees on either side
the<00:00:11.460> two<00:00:11.670> edges<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:12.030> at<00:00:12.240> right<00:00:12.389> angles<00:00:12.599> and

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
the two edges are at right angles and

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.900 
the two edges are at right angles and
therefore<00:00:13.349> they'll<00:00:14.219> come<00:00:14.429> back<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.730> thirty

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
therefore they'll come back at thirty

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.609 
therefore they'll come back at thirty
degrees<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.540> in<00:00:15.780> isometrics<00:00:16.470> you'll

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
degrees and in isometrics you'll

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.120 
degrees and in isometrics you'll
remember<00:00:17.420> isometric<00:00:18.420> projection<00:00:18.570> all<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
remember isometric projection all the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.010 
remember isometric projection all the
links<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.640> true<00:00:20.820> lengths<00:00:21.210> so<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.689> we've<00:00:21.840> got<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
links are true lengths so if we've got a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.720 
links are true lengths so if we've got a
fifty<00:00:22.470> millimeter<00:00:22.650> cube<00:00:23.189> which<00:00:23.400> we're<00:00:23.609> going

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
fifty millimeter cube which we're going

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
fifty millimeter cube which we're going
to<00:00:23.789> draw<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.359> means<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.439> don't<00:00:25.560> have<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
to draw it means that we don't have to

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.560 
to draw it means that we don't have to
force<00:00:26.039> shorten<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> length<00:00:26.760> as<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.180> come<00:00:27.390> back

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
force shorten the length as we come back

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
force shorten the length as we come back
from<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> viewing<00:00:28.080> plane<00:00:28.380> as<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.830> would<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.130> an

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
from the viewing plane as we would in an

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.429 
from the viewing plane as we would in an
oblique<00:00:29.550> projection<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.810> just<00:00:31.019> measure<00:00:31.230> those

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
oblique projection we just measure those

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.850 
oblique projection we just measure those
dimensions<00:00:31.920> straight<00:00:32.160> off<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> one

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
dimensions straight off so this one

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.200 
dimensions straight off so this one
there's<00:00:34.860> fifty<00:00:35.160> millimeters<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.030> inch

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
there's fifty millimeters on one inch

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.540 
there's fifty millimeters on one inch
and<00:00:36.390> we'll<00:00:36.780> do<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> same<00:00:37.370> coming<00:00:38.370> back<00:00:38.489> on

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and we'll do the same coming back on

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.180 
and we'll do the same coming back on
this<00:00:38.790> other<00:00:38.969> edge<00:00:39.149> over<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:39.710> mark<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.890> 50

this other edge over here mark the 50

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.940 
this other edge over here mark the 50
millimeter<00:00:41.399> point<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> dot<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> now<00:00:43.739> I'm

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
millimeter point with a dot and now I'm

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.139 
millimeter point with a dot and now I'm
going<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> use<00:00:44.660> my<00:00:46.760> thirty-six<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> trot

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
going to use my thirty-six to trot

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to use my thirty-six to trot
sesqui<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:50.129> draw<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:50.550> construction

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
sesqui and just draw some construction

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.380 
sesqui and just draw some construction
lines<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:52.340> now<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.610> not<00:00:53.820> measuring<00:00:54.149> you

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
lines going up now I'm not measuring you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
lines going up now I'm not measuring you
notice<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.809> lines<00:00:55.140> I'm<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.590> drawing<00:00:55.890> them

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
notice these lines I'm just drawing them

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.410 
notice these lines I'm just drawing them
lightly<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.579> later<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.059> I'm<00:00:57.180> going<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
lightly because later on I'm going to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.139 
lightly because later on I'm going to
firm<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.699> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
firm those in now we know that the it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
firm those in now we know that the it's
a<00:01:00.300> cube<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.020> going<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.379> fifty

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
a cube so it's going up fifty

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
a cube so it's going up fifty
millimeters<00:01:02.250> as<00:01:02.399> well<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.820> this<00:01:02.940> side<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.629> I'm

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
millimeters as well on this side so I'm

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
millimeters as well on this side so I'm
going<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.930> measure<00:01:04.049> fifty<00:01:04.470> millimeters<00:01:05.000> make

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
going to measure fifty millimeters make

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
going to measure fifty millimeters make
a<00:01:06.030> mark<00:01:06.390> that's<00:01:06.600> see<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> know<00:01:07.740> it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
a mark that's see the you know it's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.230 
a mark that's see the you know it's
important<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.700> marks<00:01:09.090> right

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
important you get these marks right

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.219 
important you get these marks right
because<00:01:09.540> when<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:09.810> come<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:11.159> measuring<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
because when we come to to measuring and

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:14.929 
because when we come to to measuring and
working<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.380> our<00:01:13.500> isometric<00:01:14.100> circles<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.760> the

construction line down there and I'm
going<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> follow<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.180> construction<00:01:24.750> line

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
going to follow this construction line

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
going to follow this construction line
across<00:01:25.170> using<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:25.650> thirty<00:01:25.920> sixty<00:01:26.340> set<00:01:26.610> square

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
across using my thirty sixty set square

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.080 
across using my thirty sixty set square
and<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> notice<00:01:28.020> now<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:29.610> starting<00:01:29.880> to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and you notice now that I'm starting to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.280 
and you notice now that I'm starting to
get<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> shape<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.689> don't<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> measure

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
get the shape I don't have to measure

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
get the shape I don't have to measure
this<00:01:31.560> second<00:01:31.920> distance<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.640> simply<00:01:32.939> trace

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
this second distance I can simply trace

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
this second distance I can simply trace
it<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.540> till<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.200> reach<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.439> front<00:01:34.950> edge<00:01:35.159> and

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it down till I reach the front edge and

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
it down till I reach the front edge and
then<00:01:35.880> move<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> across<00:01:36.299> using<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:36.930> thirty

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
then move it across using my thirty

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.990 
then move it across using my thirty
sixty<00:01:37.560> set<00:01:37.799> square<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.490> I'm<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.850> do<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
sixty set square now I'm going to do the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300 
sixty set square now I'm going to do the
same<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> top<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.159> back

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
same at the top so this will be the back

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
same at the top so this will be the back
edge<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> cube<00:01:42.329> as<00:01:43.170> accurately<00:01:43.649> as<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.890> can

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
edge of the cube as accurately as I can

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
edge of the cube as accurately as I can
and<00:01:44.430> I'm<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:44.759> flipping<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:45.360> set<00:01:45.600> square<00:01:45.840> around

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
and I'm by flipping my set square around

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
and I'm by flipping my set square around
I<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:47.070> bring<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.369> thirty<00:01:47.579> degrees<00:01:47.939> across<00:01:48.210> in

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I can bring the thirty degrees across in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.450 
I can bring the thirty degrees across in
the<00:01:48.630> other<00:01:48.750> direction<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:50.070> should<00:01:50.310> line

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the other direction and that should line

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.810 
the other direction and that should line
up<00:01:50.670> perfectly<00:01:51.200> like<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.520> now<00:01:53.520> these<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
up perfectly like that now these are

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.819 
up perfectly like that now these are
light<00:01:53.970> construction<00:01:54.570> lines<00:01:54.780> or<00:01:55.290> firm<00:01:55.560> them<00:01:55.740> in

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
light construction lines or firm them in

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.300 
light construction lines or firm them in
in<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> minute

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
in a minute

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.120 
in a minute
now<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:57.509> our<00:01:57.689> cube<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.409> see<00:01:58.619> edges

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
now that's our cube so you can see edges

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.459 
now that's our cube so you can see edges
to<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> sides<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.939> front<00:02:00.360> edges<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.229> top

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
to the sides here front edges the top

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.219 
to the sides here front edges the top
edges<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.149> going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> show<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.540> how<00:02:04.200> to

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
edges now I'm going to show you how to

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.350 
edges now I'm going to show you how to
do<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:04.860> isometric<00:02:05.040> circle<00:02:05.909> actually<00:02:06.060> better

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
do an isometric circle actually better

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.940 
do an isometric circle actually better
before<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:06.990> let's<00:02:07.290> firm<00:02:07.530> these<00:02:07.740> in

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
before we do that let's firm these in

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.130 
before we do that let's firm these in
now<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> do<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.239> just<00:02:09.479> by<00:02:09.660> hand<00:02:09.929> if<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
now you can do this just by hand if you

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
now you can do this just by hand if you
like<00:02:10.349> but<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.739> use<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.920> set<00:02:11.250> square<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:12.030> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
like but you can use a set square if you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.320 
like but you can use a set square if you
do<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.390> by<00:02:12.540> hand<00:02:12.569> make<00:02:13.080> sure

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
do it by hand make sure

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.530 
do it by hand make sure
the<00:02:13.570> edges<00:02:14.290> line<00:02:14.500> up<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.880> you're<00:02:16.240> tracing

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the edges line up so that you're tracing

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.990 
the edges line up so that you're tracing
right<00:02:16.900> over<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> top<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.500> your<00:02:18.000> construction

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
right over the top of your construction

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.090 
right over the top of your construction
line<00:02:19.420> you're<00:02:20.110> not<00:02:20.230> creating<00:02:20.710> a<00:02:20.770> different

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
line you're not creating a different

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.320 
line you're not creating a different
shape<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.520> is<00:02:21.610> wasn't<00:02:22.000> there<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.240> first

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.790 
shape that is wasn't there in the first
place<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:24.660> firm<00:02:25.660> in<00:02:25.840> those<00:02:25.990> edges<00:02:26.380> so<00:02:26.410> now<00:02:26.740> you

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
place so firm in those edges so now you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.560 
place so firm in those edges so now you
can<00:02:27.070> start<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.490> see<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.820> shape<00:02:28.030> looking<00:02:28.360> nice

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
can start to see the shape looking nice

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.450 
can start to see the shape looking nice

and<00:02:46.930> do<00:02:46.990> this<00:02:47.080> yourself<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:48.550> here<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.850> go<00:02:49.030> we'll

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
and do this yourself so here we go we'll

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.490 
and do this yourself so here we go we'll
do<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.540> fairly<00:02:49.810> quickly

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
do this fairly quickly

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.920 
do this fairly quickly
and<00:02:50.830> down<00:02:51.730> here<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:52.240> there's<00:02:52.420> my<00:02:52.630> shape<00:02:52.900> and

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
and down here so there's my shape and

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.360 
and down here so there's my shape and
setting<00:02:53.350> one<00:02:53.470> more<00:02:53.620> edge<00:02:53.740> to<00:02:53.770> do<00:02:54.100> and<00:02:54.220> that's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
setting one more edge to do and that's

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.670 
setting one more edge to do and that's
the<00:02:54.460> vertical<00:02:54.820> edge<00:02:55.290> remember<00:02:56.290> in<00:02:56.350> isometric

drawing so this our shape now to do an

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.080 
drawing so this our shape now to do an
isometric<00:03:08.310> circle<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.550> a<00:03:09.610> little<00:03:09.820> bit<00:03:09.910> more

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
isometric circle it's a little bit more

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.570 
isometric circle it's a little bit more
complicated<00:03:10.420> but<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.870> lot<00:03:10.990> of<00:03:11.020> fun<00:03:11.230> actually<00:03:11.580> we

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
complicated but a lot of fun actually we

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.490 
complicated but a lot of fun actually we
need<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.880> find<00:03:13.120> the<00:03:13.240> midway<00:03:13.540> points<00:03:13.990> you<00:03:14.350> can

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
need to find the midway points you can

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.780 
need to find the midway points you can
do<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.740> with<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.890> compass<00:03:15.310> so<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.490> can<00:03:15.640> do<00:03:15.760> it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
do this with a compass so you can do it

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.120 
do this with a compass so you can do it
just<00:03:16.030> measuring<00:03:16.420> it's<00:03:16.690> 15<00:03:17.020> millimeters<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.680> 25

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
just measuring it's 15 millimeters so 25

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.590 
just measuring it's 15 millimeters so 25
millimeters<00:03:18.670> I'm<00:03:18.790> going<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> mark<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.300> here

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
millimeters I'm going to mark it here

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.800 
millimeters I'm going to mark it here
now<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.650> beauty<00:03:20.980> of<00:03:21.010> tech<00:03:21.970> drawing<00:03:22.390> here<00:03:22.690> is

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
now the beauty of tech drawing here is

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.570 
now the beauty of tech drawing here is
that<00:03:22.989> you<00:03:23.530> can<00:03:23.680> use<00:03:23.860> your<00:03:24.040> set<00:03:24.220> square<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
that you can use your set square to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.250 
that you can use your set square to
transfer<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.330> mark<00:03:25.600> if<00:03:25.900> you<00:03:25.930> do<00:03:26.170> it

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
transfer that mark if you do it

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.560 
transfer that mark if you do it
accurately<00:03:26.680> all<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.160> way<00:03:27.310> across<00:03:27.580> both

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
accurately all the way across both

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.510 
accurately all the way across both
vertically<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:29.260> horizontally<00:03:29.739> I'm<00:03:30.310> going<00:03:30.459> to

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
vertically and horizontally I'm going to

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.690 
vertically and horizontally I'm going to
use<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.730> 45<00:03:31.060> now<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.709> I<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.890> move<00:03:33.310> these

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
use the 45 now just so I can move these

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.340 
use the 45 now just so I can move these
halfway<00:03:34.209> points<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.720> should<00:03:35.020> now<00:03:35.170> be

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
halfway points so that should now be

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.250 
halfway points so that should now be
half<00:03:35.560> way<00:03:35.830> on<00:03:36.070> this<00:03:36.730> edge<00:03:36.970> on<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.750> edge<00:03:37.959> and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
half way on this edge on this edge and

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.310 
half way on this edge on this edge and
down<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> bottom<00:03:39.160> here<00:03:39.340> as<00:03:39.430> well<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.630> you<00:03:41.170> can

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
down the bottom here as well so you can

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.590 
down the bottom here as well so you can
quickly<00:03:41.590> kind<00:03:42.130> of<00:03:42.220> move<00:03:42.489> and<00:03:42.760> Mark<00:03:43.000> out<00:03:43.239> shapes

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
quickly kind of move and Mark out shapes

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.000 
quickly kind of move and Mark out shapes
and<00:03:43.870> dimensions<00:03:44.380> as<00:03:44.560> long<00:03:44.680> as<00:03:44.770> you<00:03:44.860> do<00:03:44.980> it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
and dimensions as long as you do it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.970 
and dimensions as long as you do it
reasonably<00:03:45.400> accurately<00:03:45.880> so<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:46.660> I've<00:03:46.980> got

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
reasonably accurately so now I've got

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.330 
reasonably accurately so now I've got
half<00:03:48.220> way<00:03:48.520> on<00:03:48.820> all<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.450> these<00:03:49.830> four<00:03:50.830> edges<00:03:50.980> I'm

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
half way on all of these four edges I'm

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.890 
half way on all of these four edges I'm
going<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.760> isometric<00:03:52.030> circle<00:03:52.630> on<00:03:52.780> this

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
going to the isometric circle on this

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.460 
going to the isometric circle on this
top<00:03:53.170> plane<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:54.520> cube<00:03:55.080> right<00:03:56.080> once<00:03:56.290> we've

top plane of the cube right once we've

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.960 
top plane of the cube right once we've
done<00:03:56.620> those<00:03:56.800> halfway<00:03:57.220> points<00:03:57.640> it's<00:03:57.760> now<00:03:57.910> time

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
done those halfway points it's now time

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.540 
done those halfway points it's now time
to<00:03:58.480> join<00:04:01.530> making<00:04:02.530> light<00:04:02.739> construction<00:04:03.190> lines

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
to join making light construction lines

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.860 
to join making light construction lines
because<00:04:03.790> we<00:04:03.940> do<00:04:04.060> these<00:04:04.360> things<00:04:04.600> we'll<00:04:04.750> be

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
because we do these things we'll be

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.390 
because we do these things we'll be
wanting<00:04:05.020> to<00:04:05.530> rub<00:04:05.739> out<00:04:05.920> we<00:04:06.040> don't<00:04:06.130> want<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
wanting to rub out we don't want to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.640 
wanting to rub out we don't want to
stick<00:04:06.580> out<00:04:06.730> too<00:04:06.910> much<00:04:07.110> like<00:04:08.110> construction

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
stick out too much like construction

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.890 
stick out too much like construction
lines<00:04:08.830> we're<00:04:09.010> going<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.250> create<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:10.450> shape

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
lines we're going to create this shape

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.620 
lines we're going to create this shape
where<00:04:11.110> we<00:04:11.260> join<00:04:11.530> from<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.340> vertices<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:13.030> the

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
opposite edge like that now the reason

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.370 
opposite edge like that now the reason
we're<00:04:19.330> doing<00:04:19.419> that<00:04:19.630> because<00:04:19.690> we<00:04:19.930> need<00:04:20.169> these

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
we're doing that because we need these

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.560 
we're doing that because we need these
points<00:04:20.799> of<00:04:20.919> intersection<00:04:20.980> here<00:04:21.520> for<00:04:22.419> to

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
points of intersection here for to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.790 
points of intersection here for to
create<00:04:22.720> an<00:04:22.990> arc

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
create an arc

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.499 
create an arc
and<00:04:24.310> not<00:04:24.460> you'll<00:04:24.669> see<00:04:24.879> why<00:04:25.060> in<00:04:25.120> just<00:04:25.330> a<00:04:25.479> minute

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
and not you'll see why in just a minute

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:28.230 
and not you'll see why in just a minute
so<00:04:26.110> once<00:04:26.319> we've<00:04:26.470> done<00:04:26.500> these<00:04:27.280> these<00:04:28.120> little

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
so once we've done these these little

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.749 
so once we've done these these little
like<00:04:28.569> construction<00:04:29.169> lines<00:04:29.379> we've<00:04:30.129> worked<00:04:30.580> out

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
like construction lines we've worked out

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.460 
like construction lines we've worked out
those<00:04:30.970> points<00:04:31.240> as<00:04:31.479> time<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.930> bring<00:04:32.139> it<00:04:32.289> to

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
those points as time to bring it to

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.529 
those points as time to bring it to
service<00:04:32.889> our<00:04:33.039> compass<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:34.030> I've<00:04:34.150> used<00:04:34.419> this

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
service our compass and I've used this

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.600 
service our compass and I've used this
compass<00:04:34.960> here<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.379> you<00:04:35.830> may<00:04:36.009> be<00:04:36.069> able<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.430> see

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
compass here and you may be able to see

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.640 
compass here and you may be able to see
the<00:04:36.729> point<00:04:37.000> often<00:04:37.539> compass<00:04:38.110> LEDs<00:04:38.470> are

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
the point often compass LEDs are

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.159 
the point often compass LEDs are
sharpened<00:04:39.099> with<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.250> chisel<00:04:39.550> point<00:04:39.990> so<00:04:40.990> the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
sharpened with a chisel point so the

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.140 
sharpened with a chisel point so the
chisel<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.889> bevel<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.310> this<00:04:42.490> chisel<00:04:42.909> point

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
chisel the bevel of this chisel point

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.589 
chisel the bevel of this chisel point
points<00:04:43.720> outwards<00:04:44.199> and<00:04:44.409> the<00:04:45.069> flat<00:04:45.310> surface<00:04:45.909> is

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
points outwards and the flat surface is

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.740 
points outwards and the flat surface is
up<00:04:47.229> against<00:04:47.770> or<00:04:48.039> closest<00:04:48.550> to<00:04:48.789> where<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.449> metal

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
up against or closest to where the metal

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.779 
up against or closest to where the metal
point<00:04:50.020> is<00:04:50.259> that<00:04:50.740> gives<00:04:50.979> you<00:04:51.069> a<00:04:51.129> fairly<00:04:51.340> sharp

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
point is that gives you a fairly sharp

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:53.990 
point is that gives you a fairly sharp
and<00:04:52.000> accurate<00:04:52.120> and<00:04:52.569> we'll<00:04:52.930> long<00:04:53.110> wearing<00:04:53.409> edge

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
and accurate and we'll long wearing edge

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.100 
and accurate and we'll long wearing edge
okay<00:04:55.000> so<00:04:55.060> that's<00:04:55.360> how<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.539> should<00:04:55.659> have<00:04:55.930> you

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
okay so that's how you should have you

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.170 
okay so that's how you should have you
your<00:04:56.560> lid<00:04:56.770> so<00:04:56.949> if<00:04:57.099> you<00:04:57.190> do<00:04:57.370> have<00:04:57.550> a<00:04:57.580> chance<00:04:57.879> to

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
your lid so if you do have a chance to

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.790 
your lid so if you do have a chance to
be<00:04:58.300> able<00:04:58.389> to<00:04:58.479> do<00:04:58.569> that<00:04:58.719> okay<00:04:59.110> your<00:04:59.259> first<00:04:59.500> arc

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
be able to do that okay your first arc

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.510 
be able to do that okay your first arc
you're<00:05:00.430> gonna<00:05:00.550> place<00:05:00.879> your<00:05:00.909> compass<00:05:01.509> point

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
you're gonna place your compass point

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.809 
you're gonna place your compass point
right<00:05:03.569> down<00:05:04.569> right<00:05:05.020> on<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.319> corner<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.889> one<00:05:06.789> of

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
right down right on the corner of one of

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.390 
right down right on the corner of one of
these<00:05:07.060> vertices<00:05:07.659> down<00:05:08.229> in<00:05:08.409> there<00:05:08.620> okay<00:05:09.250> and

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
these vertices down in there okay and

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.089 
these vertices down in there okay and
then<00:05:10.030> using<00:05:10.509> your<00:05:10.539> compass<00:05:11.080> gradually<00:05:11.860> wind

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
then using your compass gradually wind

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.020 
then using your compass gradually wind
out<00:05:12.370> till<00:05:12.819> you<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.680> touch<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:15.400> edge<00:05:15.669> of

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
out till you just touch the edge of

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.600 
out till you just touch the edge of
where<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.539> construction<00:05:17.440> line<00:05:17.770> hits<00:05:18.129> the

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
where that construction line hits the

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.580 
where that construction line hits the
edge<00:05:18.789> and<00:05:19.449> it<00:05:19.569> should<00:05:19.780> be<00:05:19.870> exactly<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.379> same

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
edge and it should be exactly the same

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.499 
edge and it should be exactly the same
spot<00:05:20.949> on<00:05:21.159> the<00:05:21.430> other<00:05:21.550> side<00:05:21.849> so<00:05:22.090> when<00:05:22.240> you<00:05:22.330> draw

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
spot on the other side so when you draw

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.830 
spot on the other side so when you draw
an<00:05:22.629> arc<00:05:22.810> like<00:05:23.800> that<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.460> produce<00:05:24.699> a<00:05:25.180> nice<00:05:25.449> arc

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
an arc like that you produce a nice arc

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.689 
an arc like that you produce a nice arc
that's<00:05:26.110> neat<00:05:26.469> that<00:05:26.680> stays<00:05:26.949> within<00:05:27.250> the<00:05:27.460> lines

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:27.699 
that's neat that stays within the lines

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:30.180 
that's neat that stays within the lines
now<00:05:28.330> it's<00:05:28.479> not<00:05:28.599> always<00:05:28.779> easy<00:05:29.020> to<00:05:29.110> do<00:05:29.349> this<00:05:29.560> so

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
now it's not always easy to do this so

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.950 
now it's not always easy to do this so
if<00:05:30.279> it<00:05:30.400> doesn't<00:05:30.669> work<00:05:30.940> exactly<00:05:31.120> right<00:05:31.599> for<00:05:31.630> you

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
if it doesn't work exactly right for you

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.490 
if it doesn't work exactly right for you
don't<00:05:32.919> be<00:05:33.039> discouraged<00:05:34.289> first<00:05:35.289> guys

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
don't be discouraged first guys

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.959 
don't be discouraged first guys
sometimes<00:05:35.979> it<00:05:36.130> doesn't<00:05:36.279> always<00:05:36.430> work<00:05:36.580> out<00:05:36.909> for

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
sometimes it doesn't always work out for

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:38.820 
sometimes it doesn't always work out for
you<00:05:37.300> but<00:05:37.779> you<00:05:37.870> should<00:05:37.900> get<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.319> general<00:05:38.620> bit

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
you but you should get the general bit

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.510 
you but you should get the general bit
so<00:05:39.130> I'm<00:05:39.279> going<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.460> draw<00:05:39.639> the<00:05:39.699> second<00:05:40.120> arc<00:05:40.389> now

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
so I'm going to draw the second arc now

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.430 
so I'm going to draw the second arc now
now<00:05:42.520> they're<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.940> two<00:05:43.210> larger<00:05:43.750> arcs<00:05:44.139> of<00:05:44.289> my

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
now they're the two larger arcs of my

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.080 
now they're the two larger arcs of my
isometric<00:05:45.159> circle<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:45.639> can<00:05:45.759> see<00:05:45.969> it's

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
isometric circle you can see it's

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.360 
isometric circle you can see it's
starting<00:05:46.389> to<00:05:46.479> take<00:05:46.630> place<00:05:46.800> to<00:05:47.800> do<00:05:47.919> the<00:05:48.039> smaller

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
starting to take place to do the smaller

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.879 
starting to take place to do the smaller
arc<00:05:48.639> we're<00:05:49.419> going<00:05:49.630> to<00:05:49.810> set<00:05:50.229> the<00:05:50.409> point<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:50.800> the

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
arc we're going to set the point of the

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.279 
arc we're going to set the point of the
compass<00:05:51.340> right<00:05:52.029> in<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.270> middle<00:05:52.449> of<00:05:52.569> that<00:05:52.719> two

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
compass right in the middle of that two

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.290 
compass right in the middle of that two
construction<00:05:54.129> lines<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.580> have<00:05:54.669> intersected

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
construction lines that have intersected

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.339 
construction lines that have intersected
hope<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:56.020> can<00:05:56.169> see<00:05:56.379> that<00:05:56.669> yeah<00:05:57.669> there<00:05:58.169> and<00:05:59.169> why

00:05:59.339 --> 00:05:59.349 
hope you can see that yeah there and why

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:02.040 
hope you can see that yeah there and why
the<00:05:59.409> compass<00:05:59.919> point<00:06:00.219> in<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:01.090> the<00:06:01.750> lid<00:06:02.020> just

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
the compass point in to the lid just

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.249 
the compass point in to the lid just
touches<00:06:03.009> the<00:06:03.729> outer<00:06:03.969> edge<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.539> that<00:06:04.719> wide<00:06:04.960> arc

00:06:05.249 --> 00:06:05.259 
touches the outer edge of that wide arc

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.019 
touches the outer edge of that wide arc
that<00:06:05.469> we've<00:06:05.590> done<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.099> it<00:06:06.190> should<00:06:06.430> match<00:06:06.729> up

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.029 
that we've done and it should match up

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:09.089 
that we've done and it should match up
on<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.719> other<00:06:07.870> side<00:06:08.199> so<00:06:08.500> when<00:06:08.680> we<00:06:08.770> draw<00:06:08.949> our

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
on the other side so when we draw our

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.499 
on the other side so when we draw our
line<00:06:09.340> that<00:06:10.199> should<00:06:11.199> come<00:06:11.560> pretty<00:06:11.800> close<00:06:12.509> to

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
line that should come pretty close to

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.240 
line that should come pretty close to
joining<00:06:13.930> together<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:14.440> that<00:06:14.469> as<00:06:15.069> I<00:06:15.190> said

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:15.250 
joining together like that as I said

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:16.830 
joining together like that as I said
don't<00:06:15.610> be<00:06:15.699> disappointed<00:06:16.240> if<00:06:16.330> it<00:06:16.389> doesn't<00:06:16.449> join

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
don't be disappointed if it doesn't join

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.920 
don't be disappointed if it doesn't join

I'm<00:06:48.790> trying<00:06:49.060> to<00:06:49.150> shade<00:06:49.420> this<00:06:50.110> this<00:06:51.040> cue<00:06:51.340> but<00:06:51.520> I

I'm trying to shade this this cue but I

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.070 
I'm trying to shade this this cue but I
don't<00:06:51.700> think<00:06:51.850> it<00:06:51.910> was<00:06:51.970> very<00:06:52.060> successful<00:06:52.780> but

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
don't think it was very successful but

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.300 
don't think it was very successful but

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
shading think in terms of light the

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.500 
shading think in terms of light the
light<00:06:59.860> strike<00:07:00.280> surfaces<00:07:00.910> are<00:07:01.000> the<00:07:01.030> closest<00:07:01.480> to

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
light strike surfaces are the closest to

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.570 
light strike surfaces are the closest to
it<00:07:01.690> they<00:07:01.960> should<00:07:02.140> be<00:07:02.170> lighter<00:07:02.470> the<00:07:03.040> surfaces

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
it they should be lighter the surfaces

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:04.830 
it they should be lighter the surfaces
that<00:07:03.700> are<00:07:03.820> further<00:07:04.060> away<00:07:04.240> from<00:07:04.390> the<00:07:04.660> light

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
that are further away from the light

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.120 
that are further away from the light
like<00:07:05.050> the<00:07:05.170> ones<00:07:05.350> that<00:07:05.500> I'm<00:07:05.590> drawing<00:07:05.890> around

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
like the ones that I'm drawing around

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.770 
like the ones that I'm drawing around
here<00:07:06.340> the<00:07:06.460> back<00:07:06.610> of<00:07:06.760> the<00:07:06.850> square<00:07:07.150> they<00:07:07.600> should

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:07.780 
here the back of the square they should

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.750 
here the back of the square they should
be<00:07:07.900> just<00:07:08.440> should<00:07:08.590> be<00:07:08.680> darker<00:07:09.130> so<00:07:09.430> when<00:07:09.580> you<00:07:09.640> do

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
be just should be darker so when you do

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.750 
be just should be darker so when you do
your<00:07:09.910> shading<00:07:10.360> keep<00:07:11.080> the<00:07:11.200> surfaces<00:07:11.800> that<00:07:11.830> come

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
your shading keep the surfaces that come

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.790 
your shading keep the surfaces that come
further<00:07:13.090> away<00:07:13.480> darker<00:07:14.050> and<00:07:14.200> the<00:07:14.260> surfaces

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
further away darker and the surfaces

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.650 
further away darker and the surfaces
that<00:07:14.860> are<00:07:15.010> closer<00:07:15.250> to<00:07:15.430> the<00:07:15.580> light<00:07:15.850> lighter<00:07:16.300> and

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:16.660 
that are closer to the light lighter and

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:18.900 
that are closer to the light lighter and
you'll<00:07:17.170> gain<00:07:17.320> some<00:07:17.590> more<00:07:17.710> realism<00:07:18.040> now<00:07:18.340> little

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:18.910 
you'll gain some more realism now little

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.300 
you'll gain some more realism now little
edges<00:07:19.300> like<00:07:19.600> edges<00:07:20.230> that<00:07:20.410> are<00:07:20.560> right<00:07:21.010> up<00:07:21.160> close

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
edges like edges that are right up close

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.520 
edges like edges that are right up close
they<00:07:21.790> should<00:07:22.030> always<00:07:22.150> always<00:07:22.390> be<00:07:22.720> white<00:07:22.930> if<00:07:23.410> it

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
they should always always be white if it

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.870 
they should always always be white if it
was<00:07:23.650> a<00:07:23.680> shiny<00:07:23.980> object<00:07:24.100> you<00:07:24.490> see<00:07:24.670> light

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 
was a shiny object you see light

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:27.030 
was a shiny object you see light
glinting<00:07:25.150> off<00:07:25.390> these<00:07:25.630> edges<00:07:26.020> and<00:07:26.470> of<00:07:26.740> course<00:07:26.920> I

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
glinting off these edges and of course I

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.920 
glinting off these edges and of course I
haven't<00:07:27.220> shown<00:07:27.490> that<00:07:27.520> over<00:07:27.910> here<00:07:28.120> but<00:07:28.690> you're

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
haven't shown that over here but you're

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.180 
haven't shown that over here but you're
sure<00:07:29.140> you're<00:07:29.290> gonna<00:07:29.440> do<00:07:29.620> a<00:07:29.650> better<00:07:29.830> job<00:07:29.890> than

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
sure you're gonna do a better job than

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.490 
sure you're gonna do a better job than
me<00:07:30.250> on<00:07:30.490> that<00:07:30.670> so<00:07:31.210> that's<00:07:31.450> some<00:07:31.810> how<00:07:32.110> to<00:07:32.140> do<00:07:32.350> your

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:32.500 
me on that so that's some how to do your

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.290 
me on that so that's some how to do your
construct<00:07:32.920> your<00:07:33.070> cube<00:07:33.370> and<00:07:33.550> your<00:07:33.790> isometric

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
construct your cube and your isometric

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.660 
construct your cube and your isometric
circle
