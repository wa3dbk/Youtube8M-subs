 underpants to your subscribers I say 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.780
 Of course we are going to teach 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.520
 men who are super pretty in case 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.869
 they just want to buy, well, come on 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 here as you see we are going to see in this 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.970
 glitch a walk bridge they are called in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.590
 English and is more than anything a place 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150
 hidden location secret of those that 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 you get inside the map by going through 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.420
 walls and nothing else is another place more 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.010
 where can we hide trolling 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.030
 and good these places especially come 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.620
 very good especially when you see them 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 cornered by enemies and is that you 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.399
 pursue and so you come here the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.539
 you leave crazy you leave it crazy because 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.190
 you have seen from that alley 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.659
 we ascend to these stairs that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.039
 we will have to go up and then to these 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:48.839
 others that we have just to the left 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.519
 as we upload the previous ones once 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.379
 let's go up to this roof we'll have to 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.089
 catch us a gun and to do it well 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.979
 it's in the wÃ¡yar plan as they judge a weapon 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.449
 take a somersault and sneak to where it is 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.519
 there will be down there only that you are going to 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.739
 see that I'm a bit one-armed and I get 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.479
 something like that you will see how I cross 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.390
 now I try to do the somersault but I 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.369
 come out this is worth something and super 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.140
 miss an inverted flip with 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.490
 half host against the roof and then 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.259
 another complete host against the ground 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.330
 but good basically what we have 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.220
 to do is get this to what 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.170
 would be this here is this area of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.520
 here of the building and place us as a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.409
 zebra esther against the wall as if we 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.970
 we were covering worth what's going to 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 happen when we cover ourselves is that 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.720
 we can see what is behind the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.220
 building and sneak in the vale there you see 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.840
 as I cover myself against the wall you see 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.670
 I see it and I can flight 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.830
 quickly and we would go inside what 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.420
 what would this building be worth here 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.100
 we see cobraste it gets like that covering and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.140
 when your body rotates when the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.960
 body sneaks inside what I know 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.100
 the building as nothing to hide and ice 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.080
 it is very difficult for them to meet 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.110
 logically no player who does not 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.700
 know this that will know where you are 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.350
 logically and also if you know where 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.420
 you are trying to get in then you can 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.920
 kill when I went in basically so 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 I hope you liked this video if 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.190
 so do not hesitate to give him likes 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.380
 favorites as you see has nothing else 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.970
 we hid here and we can give a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.920
 walk if you walk is much more you are going to 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 fall and you're going to go down below the map 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.280
 and you will reappear then in the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.140
 street is worth so this has been all 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.959
 colleagues here ends one of the videos 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.870

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.550
