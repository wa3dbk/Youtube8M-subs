00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.630 
better place compared to what was before
her<00:03:36.380> idea<00:03:36.590> of<00:03:36.620> coming<00:03:36.890> to<00:03:36.950> university<00:03:37.459> was

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
her idea of coming to university was

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.860 
her idea of coming to university was
probably<00:03:37.910> more<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.150> dream<00:03:38.390> I<00:03:38.510> didn't<00:03:38.750> really

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
probably more a dream I didn't really

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.080 
probably more a dream I didn't really
think<00:03:39.110> I'd<00:03:40.010> actually<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.580> able<00:03:40.700> to<00:03:40.880> go<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
think I'd actually be able to go to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.180 
think I'd actually be able to go to
university<00:03:41.330> cos<00:03:41.989> well<00:03:42.500> we<00:03:42.620> were<00:03:42.709> told<00:03:42.890> by<00:03:43.040> many

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
university cos well we were told by many

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.009 
university cos well we were told by many
doctors<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:44.390> probably<00:03:44.660> wouldn't<00:03:44.930> be

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
doctors that it probably wouldn't be

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.290 
doctors that it probably wouldn't be
practical<00:03:45.260> or<00:03:45.980> employer<00:03:46.850> would<00:03:46.970> be<00:03:47.090> likely

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
practical or employer would be likely

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.170 
practical or employer would be likely
like<00:03:47.570> last<00:03:47.840> long<00:03:48.170> but<00:03:48.500> I<00:03:48.800> always<00:03:49.459> wanted<00:03:49.880> to<00:03:49.940> go

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
like last long but I always wanted to go

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
so I kind of just gave it a shot gun

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.540 
so I kind of just gave it a shot gun
it's<00:03:54.290> given<00:03:54.500> me<00:03:54.530> a<00:03:54.590> new<00:03:54.650> focus<00:03:54.950> on<00:03:55.160> what<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.370> want
