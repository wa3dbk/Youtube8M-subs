go rotate it and let me try to pry these
parts<00:06:01.759> again<00:06:02.090> okay<00:06:02.900> got<00:06:03.169> these<00:06:03.379> pieces<00:06:03.590> apart

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
parts again okay got these pieces apart

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.399 
parts again okay got these pieces apart
a<00:06:04.279> lot<00:06:04.580> faster<00:06:05.240> and<00:06:05.270> a<00:06:05.449> lot<00:06:05.599> easier<00:06:05.840> than<00:06:06.110> the

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
a lot faster and a lot easier than the

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.469 
a lot faster and a lot easier than the
other<00:06:06.560> ones<00:06:06.800> mostly<00:06:07.789> because<00:06:07.999> they<00:06:08.300> weren't

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
other ones mostly because they weren't

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.339 
other ones mostly because they weren't
bonded<00:06:09.199> for<00:06:09.860> that<00:06:10.009> long<00:06:10.279> of<00:06:10.460> a<00:06:10.520> time<00:06:10.759> so<00:06:11.719> it<00:06:12.169> was

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.939 
bonded for that long of a time so it was
a<00:06:12.379> lot<00:06:12.589> easier<00:06:13.240> but<00:06:14.240> now<00:06:14.900> that<00:06:15.229> it's<00:06:15.560> been

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
a lot easier but now that it's been

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.249 
a lot easier but now that it's been
bonding<00:06:16.310> twice<00:06:16.969> I'm<00:06:17.689> not<00:06:17.930> going<00:06:18.080> to<00:06:18.139> lubricate
