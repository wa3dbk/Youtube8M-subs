00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.110
 animal gameplay crossing you live 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
 another tutorial and this time I bring you the 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.250
 round rocks because you have it 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 asked a lot so let's do the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.810
 same method as with the stone floor 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.600
 let's make a grass filling what 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.090
 I'll do it again so you can see how it looks 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.400
 and we will do it step by step it is worth then 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.060
 first we make the little stuffing in the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.320
 ground 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.320
 in our soil 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.980
 in Chinese 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.960
 simple and something we have to do 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.430
 is to catch the circle of agreement and good 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.230
 the color table so you can see which one 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.380
 is this is the grayscale that I've 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.300
 followed and the green scale of agreement 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.200
 the rest are no longer valid only 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.120
 here 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.960
 Well, with the little circle, we're going to 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.150
 take the intermediate color this here and 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.510
 from this little point here we go to 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.670
 end up here 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:20.950
 an improvement let's make it smaller 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.509
 we count 1 2 and 3 from a being from there 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.100
 until there are 12 up there 1 2 and 3 of 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.930
 agreement we have then the form of the 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.650
 rock let's fill it 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.720
 very simple to fill 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.120
 so that if you are wrong you can 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.960
 correct it well and now what we have 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.420
 what to do is with this we will choose 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.250
 From the first color we will choose 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.250
 the finest and we make a line 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.520
 then with this and we follow 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:08.060
 it's all painted does not have much much 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.450
 much secret the next color and from 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.599
 up here 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.670
 we do it again but this time we're going to 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.670
 circle up like this 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.260
 painting all the time 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.750
 mate let's correct the mistakes 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.330
 general and now because as we have 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.860
 used this let's start 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.310
 use this color to make the light of 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.310
 the red 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.990
 we are going to make little pics around here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:57.310
 and with this we are going to make piquitos for 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 here they will be much more real 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.739
 and with this one that is this color here we go 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:05.739
 to make piquitos down 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.629
 Get super real if you want a rock 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.489
 so much more much more real and now 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.120
 let's make a point of light more 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.120
 powerful 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.820
 yes 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.050
 and now with the black then we are going to 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.189
 make it a little more shadow and 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.659
 we highlight the rock 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.659
 with dark colors below 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
 s 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.420
 and now with the color this darker 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:58.490
 we are going to make shade here illuminate 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.310
 below to highlight a little more 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.310
 the rock with its shadow 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:16.069
 and so it will be better and everything 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.069
 the leg 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.020
 A) Yes 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.570
 Y 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.960
 and we have done what is the rock 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.120
 so now let's see how it's going to 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.740
 stay in the town and he taught it to us 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.100
 this is the round rock such when 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.100
 you have asked 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:46.939
 and so it remains on the ground this is the 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.499
 effect that gives the floor a path of 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.969
 rojitas round 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.729
