00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 ah 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.170
 and the year 400 before Christ 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.410
 the Chinese emperor asked one of 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.139
 his great medical advisers type what 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.030
 was his advice to generate get a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.220
 good health but also a lot 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.939
 longevity 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.099
 to this question this adviser answered 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.739
 First you have to observe and know your 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:30.380
 environment also told him he had to 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.180
 stay calm that you did not have to 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.870
 go to extremes neither cold nor heat anymore 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.579
 that you had to know but also 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.220
 that they had to learn to balance their 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.960
 emotions 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.760
 today one of the great challenges that we have 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.860
 is that we do not even know what they are 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.950
 the emotions that we feel 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.890
 the face is a great tool that 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.960
 it helps us first to know us but what 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.000
 do you believe also because of their language of 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.220
 the dark circles on the eyes 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.710
 depth of wrinkles does not start 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.630
 to talk about what those emotions are 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.620
 we have not worked or we have 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.930
 still as very skin 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.260
 Chinese culture and especially the 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.000
 traditional medicine is thought that all 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.100
 emotions that are not worked 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.820
 generate certain blockages that in the long run 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 they can make us sick 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 these locks can also be seen 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 materialized in our face if 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.030
 we learn to observe and that's why 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.640
 I have the great joy of informing you that 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.110
 comes one of the great points ready and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.850
 also knowledgeable about the subject of 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.420
 facial communication just to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 talk to us where we can find 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.900
 this type of information in our 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 face to start then nothing else 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.790
 to improve in emotional terms but 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.250
 also in terms of health your face 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
 speak your face screams and at the moment in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.030
 that you learn to dialogue this 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.320
