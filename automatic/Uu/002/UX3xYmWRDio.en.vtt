gonna pull it across 2 feet and down 3.5

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.619 
gonna pull it across 2 feet and down 3.5
feet<00:00:37.460> next<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.730> take<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.149> from<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
now you can take the rectangle tool and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:04.770 
now you can take the rectangle tool and
just<00:00:54.370> make<00:00:54.520> them<00:00:54.789> rectangles<00:01:03.509> and<00:01:04.509> you<00:01:04.629> can

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
just make them rectangles and you can

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.469 
just make them rectangles and you can
delete<00:01:05.049> all<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.320> guidelines<00:01:05.530> and<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:07.240> little
