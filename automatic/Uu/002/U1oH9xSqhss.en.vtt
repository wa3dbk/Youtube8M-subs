00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 but 

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.200
 but 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.500
 but 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 hello friends you gave birth Zuko we 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.369
 continue the mortal kombat tournament 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.759
 don't hold us now 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.000
 you 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.269
 and glare and you can point previous 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.730
 battles where don't hallway sensationally 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.040
 beat smog posad one of the main 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.550
 contenders for the championship in our 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.410
 the tournament and now we have 2 main 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.930
 challenger is black white 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.800
 eternal now and do not know who yet 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:48.460
 fights now let's see so miles 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.540
 opposite sabiro 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.540
 Well let friends 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.960
 so the duel still has tension 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.960
 becomes 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.370
 so sub-zero reads a little too 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.540
 raking the pad is very surprising 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.790
 we have no sensation today 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.340
 before 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:38.380
 froze hit 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:42.649
 and the first round of the tail of gold is very good 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.609
 new and then something new is something not 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:51.740
 I expected you have every chance of an hour 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:56.350
 take and respond different opponents 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.350
 have been online 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.360
 so you will have started a little 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.360
 recoup 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.920
 and perk 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.840
 after frame freeze sub-zero goes 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 hitting herbor ordered 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.080
 and froze well x-ray 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:44.430
 and black &amp; white in 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:47.020
 rips out second round with root and stomach 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.500
 I am sorry that I almost did not last a week 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:56.560
 played generally requiring a leg similar to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.750
 had to train and everyone regretted it 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.310
 already been a week just not getting out of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.310
 games after qualifying fights 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.550
 yes fight for so much intense that I 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.610
 just don't even know what to comment on 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.840
 just keep quiet silent 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.840
 breathless watching what is happening 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.349
 how much is happening technically 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.840

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:04.810
