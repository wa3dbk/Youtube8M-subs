00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.760
 hello hello how are you good at 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.830
 today what we are going to prepare is a 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.680
 pectin extract from one 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.820
 apple or some apples the pectin 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.520
 if you do not know what it is, it's the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.150
 natural gelling substance that has 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.880
 the cells of the good fruits 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.190
 general but good, not everyone has the 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.739
 same amount some have very doses 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.280
 very very short and we need this to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:45.879
 make the jams for example those that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.980
 have higher doses of pectin 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.850
 naturally, in the apple 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.579
 blueberries currants plum 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:59.000
 then with this with this neighbor that 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.030
 bring these fruits you can do with 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.339
 other fruits that do not bring as much quantity 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.870
 you can make a good jam and 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.150
 how am I going to make a jam of 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.510
 Strawberry or strawberries Strawberry 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.670
 really has very little pectin and 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.920
 it is also very very short in acid 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.780
 so that's why I'm going to make a 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.729
 natural pectin tractor sell them 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.290
 this also sells it but I'm going to 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.750
 do you had some apples at home 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.720
 vital aspects the three apples 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.880
 whole because here I have the seeds 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.659
 the shells that are the wand and 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.340
 also in let's say the food the 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.200
 Little apple I have here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.899
 also diluted let's occupy a cloth 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.330
 a clean cloth well the foot quoted 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.850
 one habits is possible as well as this one that 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.080
 it is so it has as if it were in 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.159
 grate one a rope to a pitilla one 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.000
 pita to tie and we will also occupy 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:58.069
 look in this case 1500 a liter and a half 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.200
 for this amount of apples I think 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.030
 we are going to place the shells and the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.840
 seeds and we're going to make you a nudite 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.840
 so that it does not escape 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.610
 ah 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 make it an appointment to a long appointment agreement 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.950
 short long so they can tie it 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.180
 to the handle of the pot for the apple and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.549
 now I am going to add the water 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.489
 good and here we are going to light it with fire 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.920
 strong and we're going to let him continue 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.239
 heating then boil and the bayern goes 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.489
 until you see that more or less 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.280
 reduced roughly half 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.260
 there they will be good and the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.760
 cooking reduced in half then 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.129
 this is ready now is to take out 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 what we had inside with the 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.980
 shells and seeds and take out everything 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.930
 this rather said strain it and already reactor 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 of pectin so good now we're going 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 to reserve let's let it cool 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.409
 to be able to close the bottle but I 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.129
 I'm going to make a jam so I'm going to 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.180
 occupy about 60 cc of this except of 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.150
 question I hope you liked it 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.069
