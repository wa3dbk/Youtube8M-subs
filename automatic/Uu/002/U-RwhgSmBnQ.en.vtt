00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.090

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.290

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.940
 Certainly than happy that I can handle the winter 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.110
 make training hard on also with the trainer 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.750
 long shots 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.629
 so yes it was beautiful i am happy brian 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.129
 I scored so there was already one 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.049
 very close 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.000
 number of matches you see they are one 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.860
 shape goes up and needs some simple 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.989
 learn to play but you just see that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.860
 make the progression 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.400
 and for that nice detail is that goal 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.019
 market 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.629
 yes i owe fernandez training too 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.980
 the fact that I am allowed to play and 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.530
 also the fact that I shoot him again 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.510
 he has practiced as it were 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.700
 art taught me a bit because it 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.769
 is a shot of 20 meters and that 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.930
 we train hard until second so eh yes 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.970
 that's why I had to celebrate with 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.440
 it was against him two means that 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.120
 you also end up a little further 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.000
 the on the rankings that makes it extra 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.900
 nice yes of course you wanted you want to 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.849
 that elite group 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.420
 do you want to come have 4 games so 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:47.530
 You are now six points ahead of Heracles 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.209
 and you think I am 4 points ahead of az 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.010
 that 's where the magic is and you just have to 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.840
 look at yourself and for the 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.150
 home game against go ahead that must 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.989
 we just try to win and then have to 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.209
