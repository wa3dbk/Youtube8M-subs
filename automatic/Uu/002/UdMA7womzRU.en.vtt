really<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.549> using<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:38.000> Kat<00:03:38.209> Von<00:03:38.419> D<00:03:38.540> pencil

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
really like using the Kat Von D pencil

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.750 
really like using the Kat Von D pencil
because<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.410> blends<00:03:39.799> so<00:03:39.829> easily<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.459> powder

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
because it blends so easily to a powder

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.580 
because it blends so easily to a powder
finish<00:03:41.269> but<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.840> have<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.200> work<00:03:42.319> quickly

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
finish but you have to work quickly

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.839 
finish but you have to work quickly
because<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.250> dries<00:03:43.430> waterproof<00:03:45.639> so<00:03:46.639> now<00:03:46.760> that
