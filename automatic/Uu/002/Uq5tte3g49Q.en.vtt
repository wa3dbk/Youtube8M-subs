00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.910 

this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.760> an<00:00:02.879> example<00:00:03.210> of<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.659> well<00:00:04.620> this<00:00:04.770> is<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
this is an example of a well this is a

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.369 
this is an example of a well this is a
Roma<00:00:05.370> tomato<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.779> haven't<00:00:06.990> staked<00:00:07.259> this

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
Roma tomato and we haven't staked this

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.320 
Roma tomato and we haven't staked this
one<00:00:07.560> yet<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:08.730> here's<00:00:08.910> probably<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
one yet actually here's probably a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.669 
one yet actually here's probably a
little<00:00:09.480> better<00:00:09.690> example<00:00:10.170> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> just<00:00:10.590> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
little better example this is just a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.390 
little better example this is just a
basic<00:00:10.889> early<00:00:11.460> girl<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.820> think<00:00:12.150> but<00:00:12.540> as<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.400> as

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
basic early girl I think but as the as

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.890 
basic early girl I think but as the as
the<00:00:14.549> plant<00:00:14.759> starts<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.120> lay<00:00:15.360> down<00:00:15.570> on<00:00:15.780> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
the plant starts to lay down on the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.920 
the plant starts to lay down on the
ground<00:00:16.109> it'll<00:00:16.440> actually<00:00:16.619> begin<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.130> reroute

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
ground it'll actually begin to reroute

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.090 
ground it'll actually begin to reroute
naturally<00:00:18.930> so<00:00:19.140> wherever<00:00:19.500> it's<00:00:19.590> touching<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
naturally so wherever it's touching it

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800 
naturally so wherever it's touching it
will<00:00:20.189> start<00:00:20.400> rooting<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.060> growing<00:00:21.630> more

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
will start rooting and then growing more

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.580 
will start rooting and then growing more
like<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> vine<00:00:22.699> of<00:00:23.699> course<00:00:24.300> that's<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.380> way<00:00:25.470> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
like a vine of course that's the way the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.109 
like a vine of course that's the way the
plant<00:00:25.800> wants<00:00:25.920> to<00:00:26.099> grow<00:00:26.250> naturally<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.970> you'll

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
plant wants to grow naturally but you'll

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.429 
plant wants to grow naturally but you'll
lose<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> your<00:00:27.750> fruit<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.260> it'll

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
lose a lot of your fruit because it'll

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
lose a lot of your fruit because it'll
be<00:00:28.560> laying<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> ground<00:00:29.189> it'll<00:00:29.550> rot<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
be laying on the ground it'll rot do the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.319 
be laying on the ground it'll rot do the
water<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.170> exposure<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> ground<00:00:32.399> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
water and just exposure to the ground so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.610 
water and just exposure to the ground so
ideally<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.960> want<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> want

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
ideally what you want to do is you want

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.959 
ideally what you want to do is you want
to<00:00:34.649> stake<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> plant<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:35.700> we've<00:00:35.850> already

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
to stake this plant up now we've already

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.240 
to stake this plant up now we've already
cut<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.480> plant<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.840> trimmed<00:00:37.079> its<00:00:37.290> or

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
cut this plant and trimmed its or

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.600 
cut this plant and trimmed its or
pinched<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.700> off<00:00:38.790> as<00:00:39.030> they<00:00:39.210> say<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.399> just

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
pinched it off as they say and I just

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.250 
pinched it off as they say and I just
started<00:00:41.879> staking<00:00:42.360> down<00:00:42.750> here<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.079> I'm<00:00:43.170> going

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
started staking down here so I'm going

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.250 
started staking down here so I'm going
to<00:00:43.320> show<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.530> how<00:00:44.370> I've<00:00:44.550> staked<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.870> tomato

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
to show you how I've staked these tomato

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.660 
to show you how I've staked these tomato
plants<00:00:46.559> down<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:47.039> it's<00:00:47.910> very<00:00:48.120> simple<00:00:48.450> just

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
plants down here it's very simple just

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.760 
plants down here it's very simple just
use<00:00:50.670> any<00:00:50.850> kind<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.149> stick<00:00:51.440> these<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.620> about

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
use any kind of stick these are about

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.639 
use any kind of stick these are about
three<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.250> half<00:00:53.340> foot<00:00:53.550> long<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.649> just

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
three and a half foot long and just

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.580 
three and a half foot long and just
drive<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> ground<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.870> just<00:00:57.870> tie

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
drive them into the ground and just tie

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.660 
drive them into the ground and just tie
with<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.399> bailing<00:01:00.239> twine<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.469> any<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
with the bailing twine or any kind of

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
with the bailing twine or any kind of
string<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.239> plant<00:01:03.750> up<00:01:03.989> against<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> fence

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
string you plant up against the fence

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.770 
string you plant up against the fence
the<00:01:05.610> stake<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> keep<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the stake now see it's going to keep the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.500 
the stake now see it's going to keep the
tomatoes<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.970> plant<00:01:09.180> will<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> a

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
tomatoes up and the plant will have a

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.170 
tomatoes up and the plant will have a
tendency<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.960> wanting<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.290> grow<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> vine

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
tendency of wanting to grow up the vine

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
tendency of wanting to grow up the vine
as<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> see<00:01:13.140> my<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.320> ones<00:01:13.770> over

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
as we you can see my other ones over

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.730 
as we you can see my other ones over
here<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> you'll<00:01:15.299> get<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.509> bushier<00:01:15.869> plan<00:01:16.140> it'll

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
here so you'll get a bushier plan it'll

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.219 
here so you'll get a bushier plan it'll
be<00:01:16.860> more<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.220> bush<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.970> most<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.960> your<00:01:19.049> fruit

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
be more of a bush and most of your fruit

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.880 
be more of a bush and most of your fruit
will<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.700> above<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> ground<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.890> protected

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
will be above the ground and protected

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.820 
will be above the ground and protected
from<00:01:23.009> rot<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.580> least<00:01:23.850> somewhat<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.680> only

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
from rot at least somewhat so the only

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.899 
from rot at least somewhat so the only
thing<00:01:26.009> you'll<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.310> deal<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.549> at<00:01:26.880> that

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
thing you'll need to deal with at that

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.609 
thing you'll need to deal with at that
point<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.479> getting<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.840> fruit<00:01:28.049> off<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.470> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
point is getting the fruit off as it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.770 
point is getting the fruit off as it
ripens<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> insect<00:01:29.909> level<00:01:30.570> stays

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
ripens so that the insect level stays

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.469 
ripens so that the insect level stays
low<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.579> guess<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> share<00:01:33.270> your

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
low and I guess you have to share your

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.539 
low and I guess you have to share your
portion<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> insects<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.189> you're<00:01:35.430> going

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
portion with the insects if you're going

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920 
portion with the insects if you're going
to<00:01:35.640> grow<00:01:35.759> organically<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:36.750> use

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
to grow organically and not use

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.080 
to grow organically and not use
pesticides<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.770> it's<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.549> really<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> problem

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
pesticides and it's not really a problem

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
pesticides and it's not really a problem
because<00:01:39.329> they're<00:01:39.630> only<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> they're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
because they're only going to they're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.830 
because they're only going to they're
only<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> get<00:01:41.360> basically<00:01:42.360> their<00:01:42.570> share

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
only going to get basically their share

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.319 
only going to get basically their share
so<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.649> staking<00:01:44.009> Tomatoes<00:01:44.430> really
