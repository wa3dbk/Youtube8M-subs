probably<00:00:47.700> one<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> few<00:00:48.600> teams<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
probably one of the few teams in a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
probably one of the few teams in a
country<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> hasn't<00:00:49.649> had<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:49.920> open<00:00:50.250> date<00:00:50.430> yet

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
country that hasn't had an open date yet

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.889 
country that hasn't had an open date yet
everybody<00:00:51.570> has<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.379> ours<00:00:53.160> are<00:00:53.460> after<00:00:53.899> six

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
everybody has to and ours are after six

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
everybody has to and ours are after six
games<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.590> then<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.949> think<00:00:56.160> after<00:00:56.280> nine<00:00:56.640> games

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
games and then I think after nine games

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
games and then I think after nine games
so<00:00:57.870> we'll<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.379> three<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> row<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.039> have

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so we'll have three in a row and have

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
so we'll have three in a row and have
another<00:00:59.520> open<00:00:59.850> date<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:01.140> I've<00:01:01.260> always<00:01:01.500> let

schedule at the beginning of the season

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.790 
schedule at the beginning of the season
we<00:02:07.920> thought<00:02:08.099> was<00:02:08.250> very<00:02:08.340> favorable<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.679> we

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
we thought was very favorable and and we

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.500 
we thought was very favorable and and we
you<00:02:11.220> know<00:02:11.340> we've<00:02:11.520> had<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> couple<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.150> losses

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you know we've had a couple of losses

you know we've had a couple of losses
here<00:02:12.690> in<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.840> row

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
here in a row

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.620 
here in a row
we<00:02:13.430> couldn't<00:02:13.700> hold<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.000> lead<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.390> fourth

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
we couldn't hold the lead in the fourth

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.620 
we couldn't hold the lead in the fourth
quarter<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:16.000> we're<00:02:17.000> not<00:02:17.030> playing<00:02:17.420> our<00:02:17.600> best

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
quarter so we're not playing our best

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.760

couple<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.820> teams<00:03:44.000> we<00:03:44.180> didn't<00:03:44.420> do<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.630> and<00:03:44.980> got

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
couple of teams we didn't do it and got

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.449

I I thought sky more should have been
first<00:05:05.780> or<00:05:05.990> second<00:05:06.320> team<00:05:06.500> or<00:05:06.710> something<00:05:06.860> like

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
first or second team or something like

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.700 
first or second team or something like
yet<00:05:07.250> some<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.550> these<00:05:07.639> other<00:05:07.850> guys<00:05:08.410> but<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.560> way

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
yet some of these other guys but the way

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.129 
yet some of these other guys but the way
we've<00:05:09.950> played<00:05:09.979> this<00:05:10.310> year<00:05:10.520> on<00:05:10.639> defense<00:05:11.139> maybe

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
we've played this year on defense maybe

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.719 
we've played this year on defense maybe
that's<00:05:12.380> that's<00:05:12.860> where<00:05:13.040> we<00:05:13.160> are<00:05:13.190> we're<00:05:13.610> just

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:13.729 
that's that's where we are we're just

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:15.969 
that's that's where we are we're just
not<00:05:14.180> quite<00:05:14.419> as<00:05:14.570> good<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:15.350> just<00:05:15.560> hasn't<00:05:15.800> worked

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
not quite as good it just hasn't worked

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.520 
not quite as good it just hasn't worked
out<00:05:16.310> and<00:05:16.700> I<00:05:17.120> think<00:05:17.600> we<00:05:17.690> could<00:05:17.900> have<00:05:17.930> coasted<00:05:18.380> a

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
out and I think we could have coasted a

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.230 
out and I think we could have coasted a

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
little bit better on offense and defense

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.060 
little bit better on offense and defense
and<00:05:20.419> special<00:05:20.660> teams<00:05:20.870> special<00:05:21.500> teams<00:05:21.710> has<00:05:21.889> done

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.750 
and special teams special teams has done

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
lucky I love the way he plays he tries

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.830 
lucky I love the way he plays he tries
he<00:06:13.400> might<00:06:13.580> miss<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:13.940> tackle<00:06:14.300> or<00:06:14.360> two<00:06:14.539> here<00:06:14.810> and

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
he might miss the tackle or two here and

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.270 
he might miss the tackle or two here and
there<00:06:14.930> and<00:06:15.169> he<00:06:15.229> might<00:06:15.380> drop<00:06:15.620> an<00:06:15.830> interception

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 
there and he might drop an interception

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.520 
there and he might drop an interception
but<00:06:17.120> he<00:06:17.210> tries<00:06:17.419> as<00:06:17.539> hard<00:06:17.570> as<00:06:17.840> he<00:06:17.900> can<00:06:18.110> he's<00:06:18.380> all

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
but he tries as hard as he can he's all

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.820 
but he tries as hard as he can he's all
over<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:18.770> place<00:06:18.860> playing<00:06:19.280> fast<00:06:19.610> and<00:06:19.910> I<00:06:20.900> wish

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
over the place playing fast and I wish

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.950 
over the place playing fast and I wish
we<00:06:22.039> had<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.400> whole<00:06:22.430> team<00:06:22.880> doing<00:06:23.180> that<00:06:23.389> but

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
we had the whole team doing that but

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.719 
we had the whole team doing that but
that's<00:06:24.560> just<00:06:24.650> sort<00:06:24.950> of<00:06:25.070> where<00:06:25.430> we<00:06:25.580> are<00:06:25.610> right

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
that's just sort of where we are right

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.990 
that's just sort of where we are right
now<00:06:26.030> but<00:06:26.960> again<00:06:27.260> you<00:06:28.010> know<00:06:28.130> a<00:06:28.160> few<00:06:28.430> place<00:06:28.669> here

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
now but again you know a few place here

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.310 
now but again you know a few place here
there<00:06:29.180> could<00:06:29.210> be<00:06:29.510> better<00:06:29.870> or<00:06:30.080> it<00:06:30.169> could<00:06:30.289> be

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
there could be better or it could be

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.930 
there could be better or it could be
worse<00:06:30.440> I<00:06:30.860> mean<00:06:31.220> we<00:06:31.310> could<00:06:31.490> have<00:06:31.580> lost<00:06:31.700> to

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
worse I mean we could have lost to

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.420 
worse I mean we could have lost to
George<00:06:32.180> in<00:06:32.360> East<00:06:32.510> Carolina<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:33.260> Vanderbilt

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
George in East Carolina and Vanderbilt

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.820 
George in East Carolina and Vanderbilt
so<00:06:35.090> we're<00:06:35.330> not<00:06:35.750> a<00:06:35.780> dominant<00:06:36.290> team<00:06:36.470> by<00:06:36.650> any

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
so we're not a dominant team by any

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.340 
so we're not a dominant team by any
means<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.600> we<00:06:38.600> just<00:06:38.630> got<00:06:38.870> to<00:06:38.960> keep<00:06:39.080> coaching

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
means and we just got to keep coaching

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.440 
means and we just got to keep coaching
harden<00:06:39.890> trying<00:06:40.370> to<00:06:40.550> maybe<00:06:41.090> get<00:06:41.300> some

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
harden trying to maybe get some

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.180 
harden trying to maybe get some
different<00:06:41.780> guys<00:06:41.900> on<00:06:42.140> the<00:06:42.260> field<00:06:42.410> find<00:06:42.830> out<00:06:43.040> who

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
different guys on the field find out who

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.730 
different guys on the field find out who
your<00:06:43.370> players<00:06:43.640> are<00:06:43.930> big<00:06:44.930> part<00:06:45.170> of<00:06:45.230> coaching<00:06:45.590> is

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740 
your players are big part of coaching is

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.190 
your players are big part of coaching is
recognizing<00:06:46.550> who's<00:06:46.850> a<00:06:46.880> ball<00:06:47.120> player<00:06:47.420> you<00:06:48.110> know

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:48.200 
recognizing who's a ball player you know

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.840 
recognizing who's a ball player you know
some<00:06:48.410> guys<00:06:48.590> may<00:06:48.800> look<00:06:48.980> good<00:06:49.190> in<00:06:49.280> practice<00:06:49.460> and

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:49.850 
some guys may look good in practice and

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.360 
some guys may look good in practice and
the<00:06:49.940> game<00:06:49.970> starts<00:06:50.210> don't<00:06:51.050> play<00:06:51.230> very<00:06:51.410> well<00:06:51.530> so

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
the game starts don't play very well so

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.460
