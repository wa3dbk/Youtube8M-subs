00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.430
 Hello everyone and I know how good it is 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.619
 here we are in watercress I missed a lot of 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.740
 minus these maps and I wanted to have 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.779
 a few rounds here and well what better than 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.029
 the map of watercress from which we had taken 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.040
 the other day the theories of the quoted you 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.680
 I saw that and the truth is that I missed a lot 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.630
 unless these maps and is that this map 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.100
 it's amazing to me has always 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.130
 delighted this map and the strategy of 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.469
 here that I have had and good is to remind you 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.390
 that the strategy still have the 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.579
 white is one what happens and good if you 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.960
 you want to laugh a bit about me from the voices 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.969
 I had and that at the beginning when 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.589
 I took the first videos because there 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:49.719
 you have almost not heard because 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.940
 I had problems with audio but good 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.030
 the theories are good and there are the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.559
 forgiveness strategies in two ways I'm going 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.329
 to continue taking things out of this time 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.690
 in when and the same as today then 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.969
 Well today I made it from a player 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.979
 I want you to see how good I've been 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.710
 could have arrived because I had to go to 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.450
 work that is now 25 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.950
 when I'm talking right now and 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.080
 now a center works and touch do it 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.890
 fast then we go in the strategy 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.050
 quickie then now we have all 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.170
 the weapons 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.380
 we always start from the kitchen what 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.020
 I have caught 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.420
 the titan in the quick recharge the revive 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.549
 fast logically and double shot 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.399
 I have not caught the three stars 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.289
 because I find it useless and 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.159
 I prefer to take the double shot the truth 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.110
 to shoot faster then 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.600
 we are going to start from the kitchen 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.490
 always worth in round 11 still 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.259
 comes the slow and then we have to a 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.270
 little bit more slowly, but here 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.729
 we always go down the stairs fast 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.530
 we always go down fast then we go 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.689
 giving time for them to regroup 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.549
 from behind let's go let's go give it 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.099
 time we are always doing circles 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.560
 let's go zig zag always 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.569
 let's go give them time because 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.090
 as we move forward a lot 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.890
 those that are coming out of the windows 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.269
 previous where we have started are going to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.819
 turn around and we will want to do 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:16.700
 the trap and up is then always worth 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.410
 we are giving you time you see so that 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.430
 they go back because they come behind 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.200
 always worth then here later 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.740
 we keep with the trap but now 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.020
 same 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.790
 how am I teaching the circuit of 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.950
 We will not show you how I kill 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.320
 but this would be the circuit for what 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.560
 I saw and here we are doing that and I 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.390
 I say we go making zigzag let 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.230
 waiting for him to go making a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.019
 ball is worth then 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.200
 later on we will always kill down there 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.560
 down where is the room this is the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.569
 only place where we are going to notice is worth with 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.069
 in long rounds we will kill in the 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.349
 electric trap that I told you 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.160
 but here for example here we can kill 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.560
 Right now we're in round 11 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.970
 we can calmly kill here and in 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.230
 the other side right where the other is 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.420
 trap that is what we are going to do now 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.360
 round 11 perfectly of time 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.730
 important hammer or of coÃ±a are caught 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.250
 like how to take a hammer we are 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.019
 dead because all the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.150
 windows and like the zombies always 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.730
 they are in the yard they leave there the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.500
 Most of you, wherever you are, will leave you 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.480
 and you do not know where you are going and they come 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.769
 front if you come from behind it closes 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.019
 in the whole window they start to come out 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.959
 everywhere and you're a corpse then 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.489
 hammer and I tell you neither one is always worth 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.590
 we went through that part of the 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.440
 We always close that little window 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.099
 because if it goes down one that can not 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.250
 kill 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.959
 it's worth then perfect round 11 we 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.489
 we go quickly to the kitchen because 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.140
 we always start from the kitchen to 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.750
 so as not to lose our 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.420
 our habit is always good we start 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.940
 from here now set round 40 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.040
 perfect reach round 40 this was the 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.440
 last of round 40 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.500
 go 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.300
 round 40 who sees perfect route gentlemen 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.360
 so I wanted to get here because 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.540
 I was going bad now and we're going on time 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.730
 I could not could not take it could not take 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.980
 more because good 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.019
 apart from these things from the videos 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.489
 I have my daily things that you do good 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.590
 There are days that I can do more than the day 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.919
 I can do less but it's not 40 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.290
 perfect then what do we do 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:30.620
 we started round 41 here you come out already 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.330
 well then you get 20,000 fixed 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.790
 all I have and in that window 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.530
 it's crazy I always close it to give 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.180
 a little bit of time give a little bit of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.550
 margin of time to get out by 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.960
 back is worth here as always quick to 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.850
 down quickly because they can catch us 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.820
 it's worth that window from the right 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.330
 first always has to be closed 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:54.470
 we always never kill here from 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.340
 of round 28 29 30 as many already there 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.800
 he never kills himself because we can kill 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.510
 ok we can kill but I recommend you 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.139
 that where when I was like they are 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:08.510
 the traps better use the traps and 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.150
 that the weapons save them for a moment 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.330
 crucial is valid for a moment that is 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.349
 necessary because they are going to kill you 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.240
 then we continue forward good 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:21.460
 I remember how I tell you that you do not know 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.810
 they killed me once they sent me once and 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.900
 Now, afterwards, you will see what 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.370
 happens they killed me once then I had 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.750
 to go quickly for the drink but as 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.259
 I had monkeys because I did not have any 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.120
 problem then here always careful 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.460
 we can not entertain ourselves much because 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.379
 they leave those down there and they catch you very 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.530
 well we can not entertain much 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:44.469
 always just the right time for them to come 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.789
 quickie but neither run too much nor 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:47.199
 too slow because we can 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.210
 catch those who go out there for that 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.870
 ladder up then good what 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.840
 I said I 'm already regrouping it already 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.580
 I have behind always like that and doing that 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.180
 so that to give them time to be 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.350
 regroup as I was saying and now 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:06.580
 already 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.350
 as it was I already say I wanted to finish 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.350
 because it was round 41 and I was pretty 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.540
 well because I now come up here without 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.520
 fix the queue that I have and we're 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.380
 hoping that regrouping is that 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.730
 all do not enter the trap but the 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.340
 majority of the vast majority always 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.100
 come in then I already hit the trap 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:25.960
 is and now that I did for the same I have 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.120
 the risk a but as I have my profile 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.730
 original and I follow it unfortunately 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.640
 I can not teach it, I cut it there and 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:35.560
 now it's worth now I'm here reborn and 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.300
 now I say I can not kill you believe me 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.820
 kill me and I have to revive and look 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.800
 I've been crazy to get there 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.950
 out I do not know how but I got out and 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.390
 then the only thing I had left was 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:48.040
 was can throw in a large habitat and 

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.900
 I went alone instead of killing myself 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.970
 zombies and people I hope that I have 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.770
 liked the rondilla and the strategy and 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.460
 you know how to like and subscribe 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:56.460
