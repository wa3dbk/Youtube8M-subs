00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.130
 of this square here and we go to the 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.340
 important details of this tool 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:55.259
 I'm going to make a video note here 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.740
 about self adhesive sticky notes app 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.890
 watch this source here is a source 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.149
 application and can not be 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.640
 altered 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.959
 I'm good for you guys that I did 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 a survey is and listen to suggestions of 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.060
 people who spoke ah 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.220
 it uses a font x you delete this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.110
 x source okay you will pay this 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.360
 source it will choose another source 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.190
 to use it 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.770
 this other source 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.200
 sometimes it's worse than that then it is okay 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.540
 You better leave it with the source. 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.739
 What 's his pattern? 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.560
 if you want to copy paste a text 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.000
 from word to here it comes with the font that 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.130
 you set the word 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.880
 then this would be the way for you to have the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.550
 source 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:52.330
 so if I get this comment here 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.350
 I'm going to open the word that I'm going to have to 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.970
 source 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.610
 put arial ok now i'll go back 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.950
 there in the application 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.709
 notice that you have changed the one that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.560
 exactly with the source you will define in the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.220
 today there are now some shortcuts 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.360
 to format the text, then I go 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.299
 do the formatting test here 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.760
 So I'll select that text from you. 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:25.120
 the control handle and tighten the letter b 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.030
 ball it will leave it bold by pressing 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.930
 again against the baby back here pro 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:34.239
 for original formatting control and it 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.040
 leave the text in italics 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.610
 if I push back control again 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:44.079
 for original formatting against the 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:46.980
 underlined against the tax t is then I 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:49.920
 Can I use bold and tabular here ? 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.799
 underlined also all the 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.940
 formatting here I define only for 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.579
 test it 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.489
 I can also use it against the tim chip and 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:04.600
 letter l that the bulleted list 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.390
 So I 'm squeezing it's jack against the 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.570
 shift l it is changing here the type of 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.280
 highlighter 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.489
 If you do not want the marker, I just came here to 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.400

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.890
 I have how to increase and decrease the 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.130
 The size of this text is also the 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.880
 I use to do this against the shift and 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:31.180
 the major signal 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.940
 signal to increase and the signal 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.670
 lower or decrease the size of the 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.600
 source 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:48.600
 right and here I can create several notes 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:51.460
