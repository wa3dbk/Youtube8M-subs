00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
especially in the playoffs we gotta move

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.040 
especially in the playoffs we gotta move
and<00:00:41.850> share<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> ball<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.510> that's<00:00:42.629> still<00:00:42.870> at

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
and share the ball but that's still at

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.270 
and share the ball but that's still at
the<00:00:43.140> same<00:00:43.290> time<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.890> we<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.129> have<00:00:44.250> our

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the same time you know we can have our

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.850 
the same time you know we can have our
isos<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.940> can<00:00:45.059> have<00:00:45.239> our<00:00:45.469> quick<00:00:46.469> shots<00:00:46.710> in

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
isos we can have our quick shots in

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
isos we can have our quick shots in
transition<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:48.030> better<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.420> start<00:00:48.660> off

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
transition but it's better to start off

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.029 
transition but it's better to start off
moving<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> ball<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:49.649> seeing<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
moving the ball and then seeing how the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
moving the ball and then seeing how the
game<00:00:50.280> goes<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.449> forward<00:00:51.750> from<00:00:51.960> there

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
game goes on and then forward from there

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.479 
game goes on and then forward from there
you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.289> decide<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.710> many<00:00:52.860> quick<00:00:53.190> shots<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you can decide how many quick shots you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.639 
you can decide how many quick shots you
can<00:00:53.520> do

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.099

right balance and um you know we focused
in<00:01:22.840> we<00:01:23.049> honed<00:01:23.289> in<00:01:23.500> on<00:01:23.649> it<00:01:23.860> through<00:01:24.789> our

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
in we honed in on it through our

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.210 
in we honed in on it through our
practice<00:01:25.270> today<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.780> do<00:01:26.560> it<00:01:26.649> again<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.009> shoot
