time Dean Ambrose got a win at a
pay-per-view<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:09.000> was<00:02:09.209> something<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.629> was

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
pay-per-view this was something that was

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.990 
pay-per-view this was something that was
a<00:02:09.899> long<00:02:10.170> time<00:02:10.410> coming<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.860> Dean<00:02:11.370> Ambrose
