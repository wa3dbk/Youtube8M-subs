00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.210
 10 w tests 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.160
 kid ray slipper rider 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.430
 now it's theoretical 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.070
 the old luxury became a luxury 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.830
 and explains why is this such 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:08.030
 It is a little less viscous it is founded 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 more and helps to break the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.440
 Inertia knows that it comes strong in movement 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.180
 and attendants and body the body and the bike and 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.240
 fall forward when more profusely 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.000
 pulling facilitates braking 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 has it slightly breaks this effect 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.820
 and this year for being a little less 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.890
 then it sinks more lonely than 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.890
 end of course in aquino in cane 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.920
 so kidding, right? 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:39.290

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 so just as here is more 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.489
 regularity the asphalt is so good and such 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.790
 I think that at first 10w 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.770
 It got better 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.120
 the data that would be a carpet knows that 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.140
 lane was a captain I really fight there 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.300
 worth it 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.220
 but score even with the rain on the lane I 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.240
 I think I know now if you 're a little more 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.020
 fast on the ball is pitiful 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.020

 eyes are very good is that it sinks a 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.870
 little more 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.180
 So, for those who do not like 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.070
