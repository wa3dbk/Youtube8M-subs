00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.670 
and has such good agility
however<00:02:02.969> he<00:02:03.299> pretty<00:02:03.840> much<00:02:04.020> does<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> mean<00:02:04.500> he's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
however he pretty much does I mean he's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
however he pretty much does I mean he's
dribbling<00:02:04.920> he<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.579> weave<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.119> out<00:02:06.210> of

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
dribbling he can weave in and out of

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.760 
dribbling he can weave in and out of
defenders<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.020> saw<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.469> couple

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
defenders I know you saw that a couple

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.109 
defenders I know you saw that a couple
of<00:02:07.829> Clips<00:02:08.009> ago<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.250> mean<00:02:08.429> he<00:02:08.640> could<00:02:08.849> seriously

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of Clips ago I mean he could seriously

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.089 
of Clips ago I mean he could seriously
dance<00:02:09.539> around<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:10.080> defenders<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.009> only

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
dance around some defenders and not only

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
dance around some defenders and not only
that<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:11.550> he<00:02:11.670> does<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.209> forced<00:02:12.599> our<00:02:12.720> skin

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
that but he does have forced our skin

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.670 
that but he does have forced our skin
was<00:02:13.080> as<00:02:13.230> well

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
was as well

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.830 
was as well
it<00:02:13.890> makes<00:02:14.310> things<00:02:14.519> even<00:02:15.030> better<00:02:15.180> weaving<00:02:15.659> in

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it makes things even better weaving in

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.059 
it makes things even better weaving in
and<00:02:15.870> out<00:02:16.049> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.290> finish<00:02:16.620> pulling<00:02:16.920> off<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069

great<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.140> only<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.500> but<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.769> does<00:02:19.950> have

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
great not only that but it does have

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.160 
great not only that but it does have
some<00:02:20.280> okay<00:02:20.579> string<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.090> so<00:02:21.329> even<00:02:21.810> when<00:02:21.930> you<00:02:22.019> are

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
some okay string to so even when you are

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.569 
some okay string to so even when you are
pulling<00:02:22.500> out<00:02:22.560> some<00:02:22.709> skill<00:02:22.950> moves<00:02:23.159> he<00:02:23.340> won't

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
pulling out some skill moves he won't

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.000 
pulling out some skill moves he won't
get<00:02:23.849> bullied<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.629> easy<00:02:25.079> as<00:02:25.290> some<00:02:25.500> other<00:02:25.739> skills

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
get bullied as easy as some other skills

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.949 
get bullied as easy as some other skills
on<00:02:26.250> his<00:02:26.370> game<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:26.760> definitely<00:02:27.390> one<00:02:27.599> thing<00:02:27.780> that

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
on his game so definitely one thing that

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.229 
on his game so definitely one thing that
I<00:02:27.989> did<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.500> about<00:02:28.530> him<00:02:29.040> also<00:02:29.310> he<00:02:29.970> has<00:02:30.090> some

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239

very solid pace on him as well I mean

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.589 
very solid pace on him as well I mean
it's<00:02:32.010> definitely<00:02:32.370> not<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.489> fastest<00:02:33.030> but<00:02:33.060> if

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
it's definitely not the fastest but if

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:34.940 
it's definitely not the fastest but if
you<00:02:33.720> want<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.930> put<00:02:34.019> him<00:02:34.140> at<00:02:34.230> left<00:02:34.439> leg<00:02:34.650> or<00:02:34.769> left

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
forward I do not think he will be slow

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.080 
forward I do not think he will be slow
