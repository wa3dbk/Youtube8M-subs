00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 from there is a milan killer inter 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.400
 derby not together with fabio canino 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.590
 like to look for that foot queue network 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 against apple per cent to look at one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.630
 broker within the scope says 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.040
 that didn't all pass in the shower 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.080
 fabio caressa a of sports journalists 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.840
 most important in Italy 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.730
 how important to you is the figure 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 of the technical commentary next to a 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.440
 great commentator you ask me that 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.530
 I owe a lot of what I do to the fact 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.230
 that has the great beppe beppe beside it 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.480
 Bergomi is a person who for the first 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.030
 first together with serena of mediaset 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.030
 introduced the idea that that is a 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.800
 work that you must therefore prepare and not 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.230
 you can go there and say things at home 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.290
 c was the first to do so scored 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:56.870
 a road and I believe that for this the 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.579
 commentator has become a trade and 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.380
 many prefer to do what they do 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.210
 maybe try to do the coach that 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.380
 involves much more stress 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.360
 I noticed that in your commentary 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.940
 the last five are fundamental 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.030
 minutes of each technical time 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.670
 you give it everything and I put it in particular 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.810
 emphasis is true especially I am wrong 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.920
 all five minutes of the game 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.899
 generally with the score in the balance 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.369
 because in my opinion the moment when 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.110
 start looking at the stopwatch 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.670
 I try to immerse myself in what 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
 I am a fan as basically 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.720
 the football fan company and therefore how 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.009
 I hear the parts in the last ten 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.590
 minutes I try to make them feel who it has 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.910
 home in this conference you said it is 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.819
 fundamental for a young journalist 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.819
 do not expose yourself too early on 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.130
 internet note is your passion for the 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.679
 rome as you see the zeman team in 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.300
 this year but not true 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:46.849
 I don't have a soccer team 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.560
 keep saying this kind of thing 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.140
 sometimes I know about Rome sometimes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.340
 of juve but in reality it is not so the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.569
 zeman to having a great team 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.300
 growth after a very Zemanian start 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.920
 outside of football you have also done 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.050
 a very important transmission 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.300
 good morning afghanistan in which in the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.050
 which followed our military in 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.830
 afghanistan 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.660
 what's left of this experience 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.020
 you can agree or not 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.510
 usage 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.730
 of military resources in these cases yes 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.860
 may or may not agree on the concept 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.830
 of war in general even if no one is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.830
 agree on the war on operations 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.060
 peace or peacekeeping as they come 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.430
 defined 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.810
 I, however, believe that we cannot but 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.700
 be all close to our soldiers 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.580
 who are doing work 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.230
 extraordinary aid to the population 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.050
 that they are not there as perhaps oppressive 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.690
 they are not even considered as such 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.060
 who struggle and work and repeat it 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.980
 every day for the daily smile of 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.410
 a child or a girl especially 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.210
 Afghan or a mother who may 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.210
 to show a smile in Afghanistan for 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.600
 once under the burqa I also believe that 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.520
 is a fundamental job is great 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.270
 ethical and cultural importance 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.200
 back to your main profession 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.060
 sports journalist 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.710
 what is the fundamental advice that 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.430
 you would give to a young man he wants 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:15.540
 become want to emulate them if you think of 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.130
 know and think you have studied tomorrow 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.350
 study a little more because surely 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.209
 there is something you don't know is something that 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.750
 can stimulate your curiosity and that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.300
 of others 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.520
 studying is the basis of every profession 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.930
 but of this in particular because one 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.300
 profession that everyone wants to do 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 everyone is convinced they know football 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:36.350
 and sports and therefore have 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.350
 more information makes the difference
