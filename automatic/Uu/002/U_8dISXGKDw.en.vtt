detail give us a comment and we can try
to<00:00:27.180> explain<00:00:27.779> something<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.590> little<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.220> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
to explain something a little better but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.299 
to explain something a little better but
here<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.599> are<00:00:30.630> just<00:00:31.230> taking<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.710> whole<00:00:31.949> front

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
here we are just taking the whole front

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.560 
here we are just taking the whole front
end<00:00:32.460> apart<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.719> get<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.550> driveline<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.790> right

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
end apart to get that driveline in right

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.069 
end apart to get that driveline in right
there<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:38.040> bulkhead<00:00:38.700> where<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.420> center

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
there is the bulkhead where the center

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.020 
there is the bulkhead where the center
differential<00:00:40.649> goes<00:00:41.280> or<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.670> front

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
differential goes or the front

differential goes or the front
differential<00:00:42.649> those<00:00:43.649> are<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> two<00:00:44.100> large

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
differential those are the two large

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
differential those are the two large
bearings<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.000> I've<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.539> put<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.309> right

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
bearings that I've just put in right

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.760 
bearings that I've just put in right
there<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.969> see<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.469> differential<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
there you can see the differential and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.020 
there you can see the differential and
the<00:00:49.860> ring<00:00:50.250> gear<00:00:50.780> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.410> bulkhead<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.340> pinion

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the ring gear in the bulkhead the pinion

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240 
the ring gear in the bulkhead the pinion
gear<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.600> installed<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> two<00:00:55.770> bearings

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
gear is installed with the two bearings

those<00:00:56.940> are<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.329> parts<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.899> need<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.370> do<00:00:59.370> this

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
those are all parts you need to do this

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.929 
those are all parts you need to do this
build<00:01:02.660> also<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.640> add<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> little

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
build also you want to add a little

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
build also you want to add a little
grease<00:01:06.270> inside<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.439> keep<00:01:07.590> things

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
grease inside there to keep things

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.210 
grease inside there to keep things
flowing<00:01:08.369> nicely<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.750> put<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.920> back

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
flowing nicely and put that back

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.679 
flowing nicely and put that back
together<00:01:11.520> making<00:01:12.000> sure<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:14.689> differential

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
together making sure your differential

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.800 
together making sure your differential
is<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.439> right<00:01:16.680> side<00:01:17.479> or<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> correct<00:01:18.960> side

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
is on the right side or the correct side

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
is on the right side or the correct side
because<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> wrong<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.100> put<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
because if you get that wrong and put it

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.580 
because if you get that wrong and put it
on<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> other<00:01:23.850> side<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.900> front<00:01:25.110> tires<00:01:25.380> will

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
on the other side the front tires will

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.140 
on the other side the front tires will
turn<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:26.009> way<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.430> back<00:01:26.610> tires<00:01:26.880> will

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
turn one way and the back tires will

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.870 
turn one way and the back tires will
turn<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> other<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> make<00:01:29.850> sure

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
turn the other so you want to make sure

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.260 
turn the other so you want to make sure
that<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:33.000> there

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that you get that in right right there

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.789 
that you get that in right right there

careful<00:02:22.769> not<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.370> over-tighten<00:02:24.360> them<00:02:25.310> if<00:02:26.310> you

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
careful not to over-tighten them if you

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.400 
careful not to over-tighten them if you
do<00:02:26.700> strip<00:02:27.239> out<00:02:27.420> one<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:27.810> screws<00:02:28.110> it's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
do strip out one of these screws it's

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.430 
do strip out one of these screws it's
extremely<00:02:29.010> difficult<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.459> repair<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:31.349> you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
extremely difficult to repair so you

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.160 
extremely difficult to repair so you
want<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.890> take<00:02:32.040> great<00:02:32.400> care<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.209> tightening

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
want to take great care in tightening

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.960 
want to take great care in tightening
these<00:02:34.349> screws<00:02:35.120> there's<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.650> center<00:02:37.970> skid

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
these screws there's the center skid

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.750 
these screws there's the center skid
plate<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.840> has<00:02:40.260> numerous<00:02:40.950> screws<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.610> all

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
plate that has numerous screws that all

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.990 
plate that has numerous screws that all
have<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.180> tightened<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.670> there<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.819> can

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
have to be tightened up there you can

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.600 
have to be tightened up there you can
see<00:02:45.180> I<00:02:45.650> put<00:02:46.650> them<00:02:46.739> in<00:02:46.860> with<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.040> drill<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.549> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
see I put them in with a drill but I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.110 
see I put them in with a drill but I
also<00:02:47.849> tighten<00:02:48.660> them<00:02:48.780> by<00:02:48.989> hand<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:50.099> then<00:02:50.940> the

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
also tighten them by hand and then the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.180 
also tighten them by hand and then the
suspension<00:02:51.690> parts<00:02:52.049> go<00:02:52.260> back<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
suspension parts go back on with the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.729 
suspension parts go back on with the
front<00:02:53.519> skid<00:02:54.090> plate<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:59.099> want<00:02:59.400> to<00:03:00.560> be<00:03:01.560> also

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
front skid plate and you want to be also

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.130 
front skid plate and you want to be also
careful<00:03:01.920> with<00:03:02.489> those<00:03:02.700> pieces<00:03:03.030> -<00:03:03.480> those<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:04.019> be

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
careful with those pieces - those can be

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.369 
careful with those pieces - those can be
stripped<00:03:04.440> out<00:03:04.620> easily

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
stripped out easily

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.140 
stripped out easily
there's<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.709> suspension<00:03:08.340> arms<00:03:08.640> going<00:03:08.849> back

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
there's the suspension arms going back

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:18.020 
there's the suspension arms going back
on<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:12.200> then<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.620> front<00:03:15.049> body<00:03:16.049> melt<00:03:17.030> that

on and then the front body melt that
goes<00:03:18.269> back<00:03:18.569> on<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.260> then<00:03:20.040> after<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.549> will<00:03:20.790> be

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
goes back on and then after that will be

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.120 
goes back on and then after that will be
the<00:03:21.209> bumper<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:23.540> also<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:25.530> front<00:03:25.799> drive

the bumper and also the front drive

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.270 
the bumper and also the front drive
lines<00:03:27.440> after<00:03:28.440> you<00:03:28.530> put<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> couple<00:03:29.099> of<00:03:29.190> those

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
lines after you put a couple of those

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.400 
lines after you put a couple of those
drive<00:03:29.609> lines<00:03:29.910> together<00:03:30.389> it<00:03:30.630> becomes<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.200> little

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
drive lines together it becomes a little

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.870 
drive lines together it becomes a little
more<00:03:31.560> easy<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.389> first<00:03:33.599> couple<00:03:33.810> are

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
more easy but the first couple are

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.449 
more easy but the first couple are
extremely<00:03:35.880> tough<00:03:36.150> those<00:03:36.540> little<00:03:37.230> balls<00:03:38.220> that

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
extremely tough those little balls that

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.670 
extremely tough those little balls that
go<00:03:38.760> inside<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.209> universal<00:03:40.049> joint<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.500> have

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
go inside that universal joint you have

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.089 
go inside that universal joint you have
to<00:03:40.829> hold<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.459> real<00:03:41.700> tight<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.540> then<00:03:43.099> kind

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
to hold on to real tight and then kind

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.460 
to hold on to real tight and then kind
of<00:03:44.190> bend<00:03:44.459> those<00:03:44.700> ears<00:03:45.209> on<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.750> Universal

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
of bend those ears on that Universal

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.250 
of bend those ears on that Universal
axle<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.220> get<00:03:47.370> them<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.780> they're<00:03:48.780> not<00:03:49.049> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
axle to get them in they're not the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.789 
axle to get them in they're not the
funnest<00:03:49.590> thing<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.069> do<00:03:50.250> but<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.530> guess<00:03:52.530> after

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
funnest thing to do but I guess after

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.830 
funnest thing to do but I guess after
you've<00:03:53.040> done<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:53.609> done<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.060> couple<00:03:54.359> of<00:03:54.660> them

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you've done but done a couple of them

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.400 
you've done but done a couple of them
they<00:03:55.379> tend<00:03:55.950> to<00:03:56.040> get<00:03:56.190> easier<00:03:59.329> that<00:04:00.329> screw<00:04:01.230> right

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
they tend to get easier that screw right

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.190 
they tend to get easier that screw right
there<00:04:01.470> is<00:04:01.919> taking<00:04:02.849> out<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.120> pillow<00:04:03.450> ball<00:04:03.780> that

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
there is taking out the pillow ball that

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.939 
there is taking out the pillow ball that
takes<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.829> front<00:04:05.340> hub<00:04:06.000> carrier<00:04:06.540> off<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.829> you

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
takes the front hub carrier off so you

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.930 
takes the front hub carrier off so you
can<00:04:08.099> get<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.400> drive<00:04:08.760> axle<00:04:09.299> in<00:04:09.449> there<00:04:10.940> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
can get that drive axle in there and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.119 
can get that drive axle in there and
that'll<00:04:12.449> give<00:04:12.660> us<00:04:12.690> our<00:04:13.139> four-wheel<00:04:13.799> drive

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
that'll give us our four-wheel drive

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.410 
that'll give us our four-wheel drive
that<00:04:14.340> we<00:04:14.459> need

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:28.200 

then<00:04:19.420> we'll<00:04:20.040> put<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.160> wheels<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:27.210> here

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
then we'll put the wheels on and here

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.490 
then we'll put the wheels on and here
you<00:04:28.360> see<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.780> last<00:04:28.990> axle<00:04:29.740> going<00:04:30.100> in<00:04:31.350> adjust<00:04:32.350> in

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
you see the last axle going in adjust in

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.200 
you see the last axle going in adjust in
those<00:04:32.710> pillow<00:04:32.980> balls<00:04:36.000> making<00:04:37.000> sure

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
those pillow balls making sure

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.780 
those pillow balls making sure
everything's<00:04:37.810> in<00:04:38.020> there<00:04:38.230> nice<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.790> getting

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
everything's in there nice and getting

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.420 
everything's in there nice and getting
the<00:04:39.910> wheels<00:04:40.090> back<00:04:40.450> on<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:42.100> that<00:04:42.280> will

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the wheels back on and that will

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.100 
the wheels back on and that will
conclude<00:04:42.820> our<00:04:43.380> build<00:04:44.380> before<00:04:45.960> putting<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
conclude our build before putting that

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.320 
conclude our build before putting that
together<00:04:47.710> and<00:04:50.190> that<00:04:51.190> right<00:04:51.400> there<00:04:51.430> concludes

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
together and that right there concludes

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.100 
together and that right there concludes
our<00:04:53.760> modification<00:04:54.760> that<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.420> four-wheel

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
our modification that the four-wheel

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.620 
our modification that the four-wheel
drive<00:04:57.390> build<00:04:58.390> we've<00:04:59.380> got<00:04:59.680> the<00:05:00.630> excellent

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
drive build we've got the excellent

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.560 
drive build we've got the excellent
through<00:05:01.990> here<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.220> drive<00:05:03.460> axles<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.210> so

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
through here and the drive axles in so

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.560 
through here and the drive axles in so
now<00:05:04.780> I'm<00:05:05.770> going<00:05:05.950> to<00:05:06.070> spin<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.850> rear<00:05:07.270> wheels

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
now I'm going to spin the rear wheels

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.950 
now I'm going to spin the rear wheels
we've<00:05:08.230> got<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.680> front<00:05:08.980> tires<00:05:09.570> turning<00:05:10.570> also

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
we've got the front tires turning also

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.910 
we've got the front tires turning also
so<00:05:11.260> we've<00:05:11.500> got<00:05:11.740> a<00:05:12.240> four-wheel<00:05:13.240> drive<00:05:13.920> grave

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
so we've got a four-wheel drive grave

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
digger with a little wheelie bar so we

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.780 
digger with a little wheelie bar so we
can<00:05:18.220> do<00:05:18.370> wheelies<00:05:18.760> and<00:05:19.080> hopefully<00:05:20.080> it<00:05:20.830> will

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
can do wheelies and hopefully it will

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:27.350 
can do wheelies and hopefully it will
run<00:05:22.780> a<00:05:23.170> little<00:05:23.860> better<00:05:24.040> than<00:05:24.700> stock<00:05:25.600> so<00:05:26.560> anyway

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
run a little better than stock so anyway

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.730 
run a little better than stock so anyway
stick<00:05:28.360> around<00:05:28.480> and<00:05:28.840> you'll<00:05:29.140> see<00:05:29.170> it<00:05:29.530> running

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740
