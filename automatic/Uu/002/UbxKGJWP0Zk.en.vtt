injection<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:55.059> injections<00:00:56.059> are<00:00:57.280> relatively

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
injection the injections are relatively

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.619 
injection the injections are relatively
painless<00:00:58.909> compared<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.510> other

painless compared to the other

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.299 
painless compared to the other
injectables<00:01:00.289> because<00:01:00.589> it's<00:01:00.739> a<00:01:00.829> little<00:01:01.100> bit<00:01:01.219> of

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
injectables because it's a little bit of

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.270 
injectables because it's a little bit of
lidocaine<00:01:01.670> within<00:01:02.149> each<00:01:02.269> syringe<00:01:03.280> the

lidocaine within each syringe the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.340 
lidocaine within each syringe the
downside<00:01:04.850> of<00:01:04.879> collagen<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:05.540> that<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:06.170> only

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
downside of collagen is that it only

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.140 
downside of collagen is that it only
lasts<00:01:06.740> about<00:01:06.800> two<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.280> three<00:01:07.310> months<00:01:07.640> at<00:01:07.880> most

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
lasts about two to three months at most

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.180 
lasts about two to three months at most
the<00:01:08.990> upside<00:01:09.320> is<00:01:09.380> that<00:01:09.620> it's<00:01:09.950> one<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.130> the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
the upside is that it's one of the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.610

finest as far as molecular structure so

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.950 
finest as far as molecular structure so
