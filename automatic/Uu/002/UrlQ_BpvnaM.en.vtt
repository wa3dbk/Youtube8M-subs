00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
weirdest thing about it is that here is

the<00:01:50.550> fruit<00:01:50.849> I<00:01:51.979> had<00:01:52.979> no<00:01:53.160> idea<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.240> could

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
the fruit I had no idea like this could

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.559 
the fruit I had no idea like this could
even<00:01:54.569> happen<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:56.239> didn't<00:01:57.239> know<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.450> could

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
even happen I didn't know you could

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:59.479 
even happen I didn't know you could
propagate<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> prickly<00:01:58.500> pear<00:01:58.739> cactus<00:01:58.770> from<00:01:59.459> a

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
propagate a prickly pear cactus from a

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.279 
propagate a prickly pear cactus from a
fruit<00:01:59.819> like<00:02:00.300> of<00:02:00.479> course<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.810> knew<00:02:00.989> that<00:02:01.170> the

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
fruit like of course I knew that the

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:02.779 
fruit like of course I knew that the
fruit<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.739> seeds<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.429> can<00:02:02.610> grow

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
fruit have seeds that you can grow

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.199 
fruit have seeds that you can grow
prickly<00:02:03.420> pear<00:02:03.599> cactus<00:02:03.660> is<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:04.349> but<00:02:05.190> I<00:02:05.459> didn't

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
prickly pear cactus is from but I didn't

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.729 
prickly pear cactus is from but I didn't
know<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.599> they<00:02:06.780> could<00:02:06.959> actually<00:02:07.080> grow<00:02:07.410> out

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739 
know that they could actually grow out

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.600 
know that they could actually grow out
of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.009> fruit<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
of the fruit so as you can see it is a

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.900 
of the fruit so as you can see it is a
fruit<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.020> was<00:02:13.140> wondering<00:02:13.590> maybe<00:02:13.739> if<00:02:13.950> if

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
fruit and I was wondering maybe if if

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.790 
fruit and I was wondering maybe if if
the<00:02:15.150> fruit<00:02:15.390> falls<00:02:15.660> off<00:02:15.900> early<00:02:16.290> before<00:02:16.500> it's

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
the fruit falls off early before it's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.979 
the fruit falls off early before it's
ripe<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.370> they<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.150> can<00:02:18.420> grow<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.780> this

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
ripe then they can it can grow like this

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.170 
ripe then they can it can grow like this
but<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.590> really<00:02:20.400> wouldn't<00:02:20.580> have<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.790> clue<00:02:20.969> I've

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
but I really wouldn't have a clue I've

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.149 
but I really wouldn't have a clue I've
never<00:02:21.390> never<00:02:21.959> seen<00:02:22.260> this<00:02:22.409> type<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.890> thing

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
never never seen this type of thing

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.510 
never never seen this type of thing
before<00:02:24.110> so<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.230> any<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.469> you<00:02:25.650> have<00:02:25.950> come

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
before so if any of you have come

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.880 
before so if any of you have come
across<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.880> before<00:02:27.210> or<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.660> growing<00:02:28.050> prickly

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
across this before or if growing prickly

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.530 
across this before or if growing prickly
pear<00:02:29.100> cactuses<00:02:29.550> from<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.030> fruit<00:02:30.270> I'd<00:02:30.450> be

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
pear cactuses from the fruit I'd be

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.440 
pear cactuses from the fruit I'd be
interested<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.880> because<00:02:32.880> yeah<00:02:33.360> I've

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
interested to know because yeah I've

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.330 
interested to know because yeah I've
never<00:02:33.600> never<00:02:34.200> seen<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.710> before<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.130> thought

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
never never seen this before I thought

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.880 
never never seen this before I thought
it<00:02:35.460> was<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:35.970> interesting<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:37.440> this<00:02:37.710> one

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
it was just so interesting and this one

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.740 
it was just so interesting and this one

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
thing at the bottom near these roots

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.270 
thing at the bottom near these roots
growing<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.240> at<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.230> top<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.860> prickly<00:02:44.250> pear

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
growing and at the top is a prickly pear

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
the middle here actually has new growth

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.770 
the middle here actually has new growth
on<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.820> like<00:03:03.030> those<00:03:03.180> other<00:03:03.420> fruit

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780

on it so just like those other fruit
that<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.320> showed<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.860> which<00:03:05.010> have<00:03:05.250> cactus<00:03:05.760> pads

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
that I showed you which have cactus pads

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.060 
that I showed you which have cactus pads
growing<00:03:06.390> out<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.630> them<00:03:06.750> this<00:03:07.470> one<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.770> doing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
growing out of them this one is doing

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.700 
growing out of them this one is doing
the<00:03:08.220> same<00:03:08.400> thing<00:03:08.870> so<00:03:09.870> right<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
the same thing so right there in the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.160 
the same thing so right there in the
middle<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.580> new<00:03:12.210> cactus<00:03:12.720> pad<00:03:12.960> that's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
middle is a new cactus pad that's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.590 
middle is a new cactus pad that's
growing<00:03:13.460> here's<00:03:14.460> some<00:03:14.790> new<00:03:14.970> growth<00:03:15.180> just

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
growing here's some new growth just

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.150 
growing here's some new growth just
there<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:17.160> around<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.700> other<00:03:17.790> side<00:03:18.320> also<00:03:19.320> is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
there and around the other side also is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.450 
there and around the other side also is
some<00:03:20.730> growing<00:03:21.180> beard<00:03:21.740> so<00:03:22.740> such<00:03:23.310> an

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
some growing beard so such an

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.220 
some growing beard so such an
interesting<00:03:23.730> way<00:03:23.940> of<00:03:24.210> propagating<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.930> prickly

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
interesting way of propagating a prickly

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.020 
interesting way of propagating a prickly
pear<00:03:25.440> cactus

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.760 

so<00:03:30.300> just<00:03:30.600> be<00:03:30.720> very<00:03:30.750> careful<00:03:31.170> when<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.680> remove

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
so just be very careful when you remove

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.150 
so just be very careful when you remove
these<00:03:32.220> prickly<00:03:32.670> pears<00:03:32.910> from<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.330> cactus<00:03:33.510> pear

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
these prickly pears from the cactus pear

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.320 
these prickly pears from the cactus pear
preferably<00:03:35.160> use<00:03:35.430> something<00:03:35.790> other<00:03:35.940> than<00:03:36.120> your

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
preferably use something other than your

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.680 
preferably use something other than your
hands<00:03:36.750> otherwise<00:03:37.170> just<00:03:37.680> avoid<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:39.330> little

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
hands otherwise just avoid the little

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.270 
hands otherwise just avoid the little
black<00:03:39.930> spots<00:03:40.260> because<00:03:40.530> that's<00:03:40.740> where<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.160> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
black spots because that's where all the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.220 
black spots because that's where all the
spines<00:03:41.640> are<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.720> should<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.020> able<00:03:43.110> to

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
spines are and you should be able to

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.390 
spines are and you should be able to
just<00:03:43.440> twist<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.830> off<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:45.090> that<00:03:46.190> so<00:03:47.190> I'm<00:03:47.340> just

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
just twist it off like that so I'm just

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.220 
just twist it off like that so I'm just
going<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.760> use<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> knife<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.360> fork<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.690> get<00:03:49.110> rid

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
going to use a knife and fork to get rid

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.740 
going to use a knife and fork to get rid
of<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.380> skin<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.800> this<00:03:49.920> prickly<00:03:50.280> pear<00:03:50.520> and

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
of the skin on this prickly pear and

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.960 
of the skin on this prickly pear and
these<00:03:51.750> little<00:03:52.080> black<00:03:52.230> dots<00:03:52.530> are<00:03:53.459> covered<00:03:53.850> in

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
these little black dots are covered in

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.610 
these little black dots are covered in
spines<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.660> did<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:54.990> some<00:03:55.230> into<00:03:55.470> my

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
spines and I did get some into my

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.170 
spines and I did get some into my
fingers<00:03:56.270> and<00:03:57.270> it's<00:03:57.690> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:58.880> very<00:03:59.880> difficult

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
fingers and it's kind of very difficult

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.310 
fingers and it's kind of very difficult
to<00:04:00.540> get<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> little<00:04:01.080> spines<00:04:01.380> out

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:15.569 

so<00:04:05.320> anyway<00:04:05.710> let's<00:04:05.950> cut<00:04:06.190> into<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.550> thing

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.550 

so<00:04:16.579> here<00:04:16.910> I've<00:04:17.030> got<00:04:17.060> the<00:04:17.329> fruit<00:04:17.540> and<00:04:17.810> this<00:04:18.410> is

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
so here I've got the fruit and this is

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.650 
so here I've got the fruit and this is
what<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:19.040> looks<00:04:19.340> like<00:04:19.549> on<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.970> inside

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
what it looks like on the inside

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.480 
what it looks like on the inside
now<00:04:21.109> there's<00:04:21.380> every<00:04:21.590> chance<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:22.010> it's<00:04:22.190> not

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
now there's every chance that it's not

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.120 
now there's every chance that it's not
fully<00:04:22.790> ripe<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:24.500> not<00:04:24.710> sure<00:04:24.919> if<00:04:25.040> you're

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
fully ripe and I'm not sure if you're

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.700 
fully ripe and I'm not sure if you're
supposed<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.639> cut<00:04:26.030> off<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.840> light<00:04:27.320> outer

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
supposed to cut off this light outer

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.860 
supposed to cut off this light outer
ring<00:04:28.130> but<00:04:28.610> I'm<00:04:28.820> you<00:04:29.120> know<00:04:29.270> it's<00:04:29.419> still<00:04:29.570> fleshy

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
ring but I'm you know it's still fleshy

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.040 
ring but I'm you know it's still fleshy
and<00:04:30.169> stuff<00:04:30.470> and<00:04:31.060> I've<00:04:32.060> cut<00:04:32.479> quite<00:04:32.720> a<00:04:32.750> bit<00:04:32.960> of

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
and stuff and I've cut quite a bit of

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.379 
and stuff and I've cut quite a bit of
the<00:04:33.139> skin<00:04:33.380> off<00:04:33.530> anyway<00:04:33.979> so<00:04:34.039> I<00:04:34.580> might<00:04:34.820> just<00:04:35.210> give

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
the skin off anyway so I might just give

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:45.129 
the skin off anyway so I might just give
it<00:04:35.479> a<00:04:35.539> try<00:04:35.810> just<00:04:36.460> like<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.789> I<00:04:43.810> actually<00:04:44.810> don't

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
it a try just like that I actually don't

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.600 
it a try just like that I actually don't
mind<00:04:45.289> that<00:04:45.560> fruit<00:04:45.830> at<00:04:45.979> all<00:04:46.070> it<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.430> has<00:04:46.580> a

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
mind that fruit at all it just has a

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.420 
mind that fruit at all it just has a
really<00:04:47.000> mild<00:04:47.270> flavor<00:04:47.750> a<00:04:48.080> tiny<00:04:49.070> bit<00:04:49.310> of

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
really mild flavor a tiny bit of

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.510 
really mild flavor a tiny bit of
sweetness<00:04:49.760> but<00:04:50.000> not<00:04:50.270> very<00:04:50.510> sweet<00:04:50.840> at<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.520> I

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
sweetness but not very sweet at all I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.550 
sweetness but not very sweet at all I
have<00:04:53.240> heard<00:04:53.479> from<00:04:53.690> some<00:04:53.960> people<00:04:54.289> that<00:04:54.440> the

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
have heard from some people that the

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.790 
have heard from some people that the
seeds<00:04:54.800> can<00:04:55.010> be<00:04:55.039> very<00:04:55.430> very<00:04:55.699> hard<00:04:56.000> like<00:04:56.800> guava

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
seeds can be very very hard like guava

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.219 
seeds can be very very hard like guava
seeds<00:04:58.160> and<00:04:58.550> in<00:04:59.120> this<00:04:59.300> case<00:04:59.510> they're<00:04:59.750> not<00:04:59.960> hard

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:00.229 
seeds and in this case they're not hard

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:02.560 
seeds and in this case they're not hard
at<00:05:00.410> all<00:05:00.669> I'm<00:05:01.669> guessing<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.300> fruit

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
at all I'm guessing that the fruit

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.870 
at all I'm guessing that the fruit
wasn't<00:05:03.110> fully<00:05:03.380> ripe<00:05:03.949> or<00:05:04.220> fully<00:05:04.460> mature

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
wasn't fully ripe or fully mature

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.330 
wasn't fully ripe or fully mature
meaning<00:05:05.330> that<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.570> seeds<00:05:05.870> as<00:05:06.110> well<00:05:06.320> we're<00:05:07.160> not

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
meaning that the seeds as well we're not

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.400 
meaning that the seeds as well we're not
fully<00:05:08.380> mature<00:05:09.380> and<00:05:09.650> ready<00:05:09.880> so<00:05:11.229> hence<00:05:12.229> the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
fully mature and ready so hence the

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.760 
fully mature and ready so hence the
reason<00:05:12.710> they're<00:05:12.830> probably<00:05:13.070> not<00:05:13.430> hard<00:05:13.789> to<00:05:14.270> eat

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
reason they're probably not hard to eat

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.170 
reason they're probably not hard to eat
there<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:16.190> wasn't<00:05:16.550> a<00:05:16.580> bad<00:05:17.050> experience<00:05:18.050> at<00:05:18.440> all

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
there it wasn't a bad experience at all

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:24.219 
there it wasn't a bad experience at all
so<00:05:20.180> yeah<00:05:20.510> not<00:05:21.349> a<00:05:21.590> two-bed<00:05:22.340> result<00:05:23.199> anyway<00:05:24.199> I

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
so yeah not a two-bed result anyway I

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.390 
so yeah not a two-bed result anyway I
hope<00:05:24.440> you<00:05:24.590> guys<00:05:24.710> learned<00:05:24.949> something<00:05:25.370> from

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
hope you guys learned something from

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.790 
hope you guys learned something from
this<00:05:25.849> video<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.419> I<00:05:27.020> will<00:05:27.080> talk<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.380> you<00:05:27.560> soon
