00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.649 
airport kits from parts express
precision<00:01:38.100> ports<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.149> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.539> they

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
precision ports and this is what they

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.880 
precision ports and this is what they
look<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:45.259> this<00:01:46.259> is<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.560> they<00:01:46.590> look<00:01:46.859> like

about the clarity of this bed we got two
thousand<00:03:13.540> dollars<00:03:13.750> invested<00:03:14.200> in<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.410> new

thousand dollars invested in this new

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.979 
thousand dollars invested in this new
setup<00:03:15.760> so<00:03:16.060> hopefully<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.600> looks<00:03:16.720> pretty

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
setup so hopefully it looks pretty

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.229 
setup so hopefully it looks pretty
decent

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
decent

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.360 
decent
anyway<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:20.080> the<00:03:20.230> Box<00:03:20.410> can<00:03:20.530> go<00:03:20.709> in<00:03:20.860> between<00:03:20.920> here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
anyway so the Box can go in between here

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.110 
anyway so the Box can go in between here
just<00:03:21.640> like<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.420> old<00:03:22.660> one<00:03:22.690> did<00:03:23.730> box<00:03:24.730> can<00:03:24.940> be<00:03:24.970> in

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
just like the old one did box can be in

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.850 
just like the old one did box can be in
between<00:03:25.239> here<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.290> don't<00:03:26.350> know<00:03:26.590> I'm<00:03:26.769> gonna

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
between here and I don't know I'm gonna

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.800 
between here and I don't know I'm gonna
try<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.100> keep<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.910> wanted<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.510> keep<00:03:28.660> it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
try to keep it I wanted to keep it

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.170 
try to keep it I wanted to keep it
around<00:03:28.959> 12<00:03:29.319> inches<00:03:29.410> tall<00:03:29.890> but<00:03:30.250> they<00:03:30.819> say<00:03:31.030> with

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
around 12 inches tall but they say with

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.759 
around 12 inches tall but they say with
the<00:03:31.209> way<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.660> I'm<00:03:31.810> doing<00:03:31.840> it

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
the way that I'm doing it

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.130 
the way that I'm doing it
well<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.580> port's<00:03:34.000> happen<00:03:34.300> to<00:03:34.360> be<00:03:34.510> 28<00:03:34.900> inches

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
well the port's happen to be 28 inches

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.600 
well the port's happen to be 28 inches
long<00:03:35.350> one<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.530> I'm<00:03:35.860> gonna<00:03:36.010> report<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.459> back

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
long one that I'm gonna report it back

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.750 
long one that I'm gonna report it back
here<00:03:36.970> so<00:03:37.840> up<00:03:38.019> here<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:38.980> when<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.280> importance

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
here so up here so when the importance

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.670 
here so up here so when the importance
and<00:03:40.030> go<00:03:40.120> down<00:03:40.390> when<00:03:40.660> they<00:03:40.720> come<00:03:40.959> forward<00:03:41.319> I

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
and go down when they come forward I

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.559 
and go down when they come forward I
might<00:03:42.010> have<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.220> make<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:42.549> taller<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:43.209> increase

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
might have to make it taller to increase

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.820 
might have to make it taller to increase
the<00:03:43.750> box<00:03:44.049> volume<00:03:44.709> so<00:03:46.230> hopefully<00:03:47.230> we'll<00:03:47.680> be

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
the box volume so hopefully we'll be

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.270 
the box volume so hopefully we'll be
able<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.239> accommodate<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.690> so<00:03:50.040> as<00:03:51.040> you<00:03:51.160> can

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
able to accommodate that so as you can

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.539 
able to accommodate that so as you can
see<00:03:51.340> in<00:03:51.549> between<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.940> seats<00:03:52.830> roughly<00:03:53.830> it's

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
see in between the seats roughly it's

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.650 
see in between the seats roughly it's
right<00:03:54.730> at<00:03:54.880> about<00:03:55.030> 12<00:03:55.690> inches<00:03:55.959> but<00:03:57.209> or<00:03:58.209> 13

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
right at about 12 inches but or 13

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.120 
right at about 12 inches but or 13
that's<00:03:58.870> 13<00:03:59.290> inches<00:03:59.590> right<00:03:59.769> there<00:03:59.830> but<00:04:00.069> I

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
that's 13 inches right there but I

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.979 
that's 13 inches right there but I
wanted<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.370> get<00:04:01.269> myself<00:04:01.390> a<00:04:01.630> little<00:04:01.780> bit<00:04:01.930> of

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
wanted to get myself a little bit of

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.560 
wanted to get myself a little bit of
room<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.470> play<00:04:02.680> with<00:04:02.820> that's<00:04:03.820> why<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.000> said<00:04:04.239> 12

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
room to play with that's why I said 12

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.199 
room to play with that's why I said 12
but<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.870> can't<00:04:05.109> go<00:04:05.230> extra<00:04:05.620> inch<00:04:05.769> wide<00:04:06.209> to

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
but I can't go extra inch wide to

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.180 
but I can't go extra inch wide to
stagger<00:04:07.570> the<00:04:07.720> ports<00:04:08.079> I<00:04:08.410> think<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.519> did<00:04:10.980> what<00:04:11.980> was

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
stagger the ports I think I did what was

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.770 
stagger the ports I think I did what was
it<00:04:12.400> like<00:04:15.419> it<00:04:16.419> was<00:04:16.539> like<00:04:16.750> 36<00:04:17.410> long<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it like it was like 36 long from the

it like it was like 36 long from the
back<00:04:20.169> to<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> front<00:04:21.160> the<00:04:21.760> reason<00:04:22.030> why<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
back to the front the reason why I

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.210 
back to the front the reason why I
wanted<00:04:22.360> to<00:04:22.450> keep<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:22.750> around<00:04:22.840> 36<00:04:23.500> inches<00:04:23.830> as

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
wanted to keep it around 36 inches as

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.830 
wanted to keep it around 36 inches as
you<00:04:24.280> can<00:04:24.460> see<00:04:24.640> right<00:04:24.789> here<00:04:25.530> come<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:26.650> focus

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
anyway 36 inches give me a little bit of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.600 
anyway 36 inches give me a little bit of
play<00:04:31.330> room<00:04:31.570> back<00:04:31.780> there<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.260> as<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.340> see

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.529 
play room back there and as you can see
it<00:04:33.789> would<00:04:33.940> clear<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.750> -<00:04:35.410> piece<00:04:35.770> up<00:04:35.979> there<00:04:36.539> if

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:37.539 
it would clear the - piece up there if

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:48.719 
it would clear the - piece up there if
we<00:04:44.970> anyway<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:47.919> I<00:04:48.070> measure<00:04:48.280> from<00:04:48.610> the

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
we anyway so if I measure from the

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.659 
we anyway so if I measure from the
floors<00:04:49.410> this<00:04:50.410> excess<00:04:50.800> power<00:04:51.010> sticker<00:04:51.460> I

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
floors this excess power sticker I

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:57.240 
floors this excess power sticker I
measure<00:04:52.390> from<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.720> floor<00:04:52.890> up<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:56.039> the<00:04:57.039> bottom

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
measure from the floor up to the bottom

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.960 
measure from the floor up to the bottom
of<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.520> -<00:04:57.760> right<00:04:57.970> there<00:04:58.530> you<00:04:59.530> see<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:02.970> 16

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
of the - right there you see it is 16

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.710 
of the - right there you see it is 16
inches

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
inches

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.800 
inches
so<00:05:07.720> there's<00:05:08.080> 16<00:05:09.000> and<00:05:11.129> so<00:05:12.129> we<00:05:12.250> could<00:05:12.400> do<00:05:12.520> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
so there's 16 and so we could do that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.839 
so there's 16 and so we could do that
actually<00:05:13.810> it<00:05:14.289> could<00:05:14.409> be<00:05:14.470> 16<00:05:14.979> inches<00:05:15.250> tall<00:05:15.550> so

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
actually it could be 16 inches tall so

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:16.790 
actually it could be 16 inches tall so
maybe<00:05:16.060> we'll<00:05:16.180> do<00:05:16.360> a<00:05:16.389> little<00:05:16.449> bit<00:05:16.659> more

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
maybe we'll do a little bit more

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.420 
maybe we'll do a little bit more
reconfiguring<00:05:17.800> of<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.009> box

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
reconfiguring of the box

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.429 
reconfiguring of the box
I<00:05:18.580> think<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:19.030> subs<00:05:19.300> around<00:05:19.569> 11<00:05:20.020> inches<00:05:20.199> deep

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:20.439 
I think the subs around 11 inches deep

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.010 
I think the subs around 11 inches deep
is<00:05:20.590> pretty<00:05:20.800> deep<00:05:21.039> so<00:05:22.000> if<00:05:22.060> it's<00:05:22.240> 16<00:05:22.719> inches

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
is pretty deep so if it's 16 inches

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.020 
is pretty deep so if it's 16 inches
right<00:05:23.199> here<00:05:23.280> actually<00:05:24.280> they're<00:05:24.610> moving<00:05:24.909> to<00:05:24.969> be

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
right here actually they're moving to be

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.879 
right here actually they're moving to be
that<00:05:25.180> bag<00:05:25.389> because<00:05:25.659> I<00:05:25.719> put<00:05:25.930> my<00:05:26.080> arm<00:05:26.620> about

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
that bag because I put my arm about

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.589 
that bag because I put my arm about
right<00:05:27.069> here<00:05:27.250> if<00:05:27.370> you<00:05:27.460> like<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.120> decent<00:05:28.360> and

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
right here if you like a decent and

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.129 
right here if you like a decent and
armrests<00:05:28.870> for<00:05:29.319> it<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.580> I<00:05:30.610> might<00:05:30.819> do<00:05:30.969> that<00:05:31.180> so

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
armrests for it so I might do that so

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.619 
armrests for it so I might do that so
just<00:05:32.349> building<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.680> pretty<00:05:33.129> basic<00:05:33.699> box<00:05:34.180> for<00:05:34.509> it

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
just building a pretty basic box for it

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:35.670 
just building a pretty basic box for it
it's<00:05:34.750> not<00:05:34.870> gonna<00:05:34.990> be<00:05:35.199> anything<00:05:35.379> special

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
it's not gonna be anything special

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.520 
it's not gonna be anything special
because<00:05:36.069> I'm<00:05:36.310> not<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:37.000> good<00:05:37.930> at<00:05:38.259> building

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
because I'm not like good at building

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.110 
because I'm not like good at building
boxes<00:05:38.860> at<00:05:39.190> all<00:05:39.340> because<00:05:39.490> I've<00:05:39.580> never<00:05:39.699> done<00:05:39.849> it

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
boxes at all because I've never done it

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.170 
boxes at all because I've never done it
before<00:05:40.379> so<00:05:41.379> it's<00:05:41.680> gonna<00:05:41.830> just<00:05:42.009> be<00:05:42.099> a<00:05:42.219> nice

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
before so it's gonna just be a nice

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.990 
before so it's gonna just be a nice
rectangular<00:05:44.069> box<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:46.539> go<00:05:46.690> in<00:05:46.840> here<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.969> yeah<00:05:48.969> I

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
rectangular box to go in here and yeah I

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.059 
rectangular box to go in here and yeah I
don't<00:05:49.180> bring<00:05:49.330> you<00:05:49.509> up<00:05:49.569> today<00:05:49.690> but<00:05:50.110> I<00:05:50.319> went<00:05:50.889> in

don't bring you up today but I went in
Vault<00:05:51.280> as<00:05:51.669> you<00:05:51.879> can<00:05:52.030> see<00:05:52.180> out<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.419> Titebond<00:05:52.900> to

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
Vault as you can see out the Titebond to

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.670 
Vault as you can see out the Titebond to
would<00:05:54.940> screw<00:05:55.270> on<00:05:55.479> it<00:05:55.509> I<00:05:55.629> would<00:05:55.960> glue<00:05:56.229> and<00:05:56.560> got

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:56.680 
would screw on it I would glue and got

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.170 
would screw on it I would glue and got
the<00:05:56.800> wood<00:05:57.009> screws<00:05:57.159> over<00:05:57.639> there<00:05:59.580> and<00:06:00.580> yeah<00:06:01.029> like

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
the wood screws over there and yeah like

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.730 
the wood screws over there and yeah like
I<00:06:01.300> said<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.509> just<00:06:01.810> a<00:06:01.870> learning<00:06:02.409> experience

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
I said it's just a learning experience

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.429 
I said it's just a learning experience
and<00:06:03.599> hopefully<00:06:04.599> it'll<00:06:04.719> turn<00:06:05.110> out<00:06:05.169> pretty

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
and hopefully it'll turn out pretty

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:07.170 
and hopefully it'll turn out pretty
decent<00:06:05.680> but<00:06:06.069> I<00:06:06.099> believe<00:06:06.430> with<00:06:06.669> all<00:06:06.819> the<00:06:06.969> help

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
decent but I believe with all the help

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.459 
decent but I believe with all the help
that<00:06:07.240> I<00:06:07.389> have<00:06:07.419> from<00:06:07.779> several<00:06:08.319> different

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:08.469 
that I have from several different

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:12.180 
that I have from several different
individuals<00:06:10.440> we<00:06:11.440> won't<00:06:11.590> have<00:06:11.680> a<00:06:11.740> problem<00:06:12.099> with

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
individuals we won't have a problem with

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.890 
individuals we won't have a problem with
at<00:06:12.430> least<00:06:12.550> making<00:06:12.819> it<00:06:13.000> play<00:06:13.180> pretty<00:06:13.449> decent

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
at least making it play pretty decent

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.219 
at least making it play pretty decent
about<00:06:14.680> the<00:06:15.219> wiggler<00:06:15.759> the<00:06:16.000> screws<00:06:16.440> have<00:06:17.440> some

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
about the wiggler the screws have some

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:24.269 
about the wiggler the screws have some
have<00:06:20.229> a<00:06:20.259> soul<00:06:20.590> and<00:06:20.620> a<00:06:21.460> router<00:06:21.909> and<00:06:23.039> what<00:06:24.039> else

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
have a soul and a router and what else

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.959 
have a soul and a router and what else
about<00:06:25.240> birch<00:06:25.629> wood<00:06:26.199> to<00:06:26.500> make<00:06:26.650> it<00:06:26.800> out<00:06:26.919> of<00:06:26.969> so

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
about birch wood to make it out of so

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.249 
about birch wood to make it out of so
yeah<00:06:28.120> hopefully<00:06:28.599> it'll<00:06:28.839> turn<00:06:28.990> out<00:06:29.050> pretty

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
yeah hopefully it'll turn out pretty

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:30.600 
yeah hopefully it'll turn out pretty
decent<00:06:29.770> to<00:06:29.830> see<00:06:29.949> what<00:06:30.039> it<00:06:30.099> sounds<00:06:30.400> like

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:30.610 
decent to see what it sounds like

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.610 
decent to see what it sounds like
I'm<00:06:31.150> definitely<00:06:31.659> going<00:06:31.779> by<00:06:31.930> the<00:06:31.990> specs<00:06:32.349> on

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
I'm definitely going by the specs on

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.689 
I'm definitely going by the specs on
what<00:06:33.360> sundown<00:06:34.360> told<00:06:34.750> me<00:06:34.900> to<00:06:35.110> do<00:06:35.289> they<00:06:35.560> said<00:06:35.800> for

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:36.699 
what sundown told me to do they said for

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:38.969 
what sundown told me to do they said for
this<00:06:36.879> sub<00:06:37.210> to<00:06:37.449> perform<00:06:37.900> optimally<00:06:38.199> you<00:06:38.680> needed

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
this sub to perform optimally you needed

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:44.999 
this sub to perform optimally you needed
to<00:06:39.099> have<00:06:39.659> 2.1<00:06:40.659> cubes<00:06:42.210> netted<00:06:43.210> and<00:06:43.830> so<00:06:44.830> that's

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
to have 2.1 cubes netted and so that's

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.029 
to have 2.1 cubes netted and so that's
after<00:06:45.190> all<00:06:45.339> displacements<00:06:46.029> and<00:06:46.089> everything

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
after all displacements and everything

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:48.600 
after all displacements and everything
2.5<00:06:48.039> cubes

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610 
2.5 cubes

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:52.170 
2.5 cubes
net<00:06:49.029> and<00:06:49.710> be<00:06:50.710> tuned<00:06:51.009> at<00:06:51.159> 30<00:06:51.370> Hertz<00:06:51.580> for<00:06:51.969> it<00:06:52.060> to

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
net and be tuned at 30 Hertz for it to

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.869 
net and be tuned at 30 Hertz for it to
perform<00:06:53.009> awesomely<00:06:54.009> so<00:06:54.279> that's<00:06:54.639> what<00:06:54.759> we're

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:54.879
