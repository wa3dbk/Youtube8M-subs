00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.730
 hi i am andre and this is the nokia 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.650
 lumia 625 given its number you would 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.510
 think the successor is the nokia 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.070
 lumia 620 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.490
 however, there is a big difference between them 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.490
 these 2 models 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.930
 in addition to the lumia 625, there is still a box 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.130
 an adapter with a micro usb cable and 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.780
 a headset 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.000
 like all supplied headset mug 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.650
 don't expect too much from this 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.390
 Nokia pays a lot of attention to the 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.340
 design of a device and you notice that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.260
 directly at the lumia 625 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.120
 it fits completely in the place with the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.760
 other lumia models and yet he has 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.420
 its own character like we at Nokia 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.150
 accustomed, the 625 feels robust and 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.500
 again have to do with a mat 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.880
 polycarbonate device what you use is 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.140
 for the housing 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.940
 the rear case can be removed 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.050
 which also gives you the color of the device 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.460
 can change 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.920
 and behind that case find the micro 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.270
 SD card and the SIM card slot 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.610
 find the headset port on the top 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.440
 of the device the micro-usb port on the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.119
 bottom and the buttons 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.969
 just like with the other lumias on the 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.979
 with 1.2 on the right 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.340
 gigahertz qualcomm s4 dual core 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.170
 the lumia 625 is certainly not a processor 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.549
 slow especially if you do the comparison 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.740
 by migrating to other operating systems 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.510
 and more for a very good price and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.920
 faster operating device 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.750
 This is because Windows Phone 8 is one 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.190
 handle processor power much better 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.600
 that is available 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.210
 in the future it would be ram memory 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.040
 only 512 megabytes with some large ones 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.619
 applications still have problems 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.500
 can start worrying the screen is hefty 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.049
 larger compared to the lumia 620 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.150
 it measures 4.7 inches but still has it 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.680
 always with a resolution of 800 by 480 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.299
 pixels 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.890
 no amoled panel has been used though 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.830
 the is a standard lcd panel 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.780
 internally you have 8 gigabytes of storage 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.659
 space of which in practice 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.950
 about 5 gigabytes of remains 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.810
 it comes standard with 4g support 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.510
 built-in which ensures fast 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.730
 Internet connection 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.770
 the entire here software collection is 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.140
 supplied as standard and has a 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.220
 number of useful applications such as 100 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.290
 drive here 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.510
 with which you can also navigate offline and 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.100
 here you sit with which you also in public transport 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.230
 find your way 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.880
 You can take photos with the built-in 5 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.770
 megapixel camera 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.200
 these are great in good conditions 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.910
 and when it is dark then the 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.500
 flash with 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.960
 videos can be shot in the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.160
 maximum resolution of 1080 p 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.700
 one here you hear the sound of the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.700
 internal microphone 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.160
 the differences between 26 and 625 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.290
 its great that i actually dont really 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.880
 can speak of a successor 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.950
 Nokia seems just a new direction 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.050
 succeeded with the lumia 610 x 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.530
 smaller disadvantages are the low ones 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.410
 memory and the low number of pixels 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.200
 the 625 is a great device which works 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.260
 does well and is competitively priced do you want
