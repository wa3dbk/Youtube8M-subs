00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.179 

in<00:00:05.930> this<00:00:06.080> video<00:00:06.410> I'm<00:00:06.559> going<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:06.740> teach<00:00:06.889> you<00:00:07.040> how

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
in this video I'm going to teach you how

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.549 
in this video I'm going to teach you how
to<00:00:07.220> animate<00:00:07.729> this<00:00:07.910> robot<00:00:08.360> taking<00:00:08.959> a<00:00:09.019> box<00:00:09.260> off

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:09.559 
to animate this robot taking a box off

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.350 
to animate this robot taking a box off
of<00:00:09.769> the<00:00:09.830> big<00:00:10.039> stack<00:00:10.340> and<00:00:10.670> putting<00:00:10.910> it<00:00:11.000> onto<00:00:11.150> the

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:11.360 
of the big stack and putting it onto the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.490 
of the big stack and putting it onto the
pallet<00:00:13.509> so<00:00:14.509> let's<00:00:14.660> start<00:00:14.929> by<00:00:15.049> going<00:00:15.080> in<00:00:15.410> the

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
pallet so let's start by going in the

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.050 
pallet so let's start by going in the
set<00:00:15.709> key<00:00:15.919> mode<00:00:15.950> and<00:00:16.460> then<00:00:16.700> what<00:00:16.820> we're<00:00:16.970> going

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
set key mode and then what we're going

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.300 
set key mode and then what we're going
to<00:00:17.119> do<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.509> place<00:00:17.779> our<00:00:17.990> robot<00:00:18.410> into<00:00:18.830> a<00:00:18.860> neutral

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
to do is place our robot into a neutral

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.310 
to do is place our robot into a neutral
starting<00:00:19.669> position<00:00:20.119> and<00:00:20.720> set<00:00:20.960> our<00:00:21.080> initial

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
starting position and set our initial

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:35.150 
starting position and set our initial
keyframe

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.070 

so<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> looks<00:00:36.030> good<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.570> what<00:00:36.810> I'm<00:00:36.900> going<00:00:37.020> to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:37.080 
so this looks good so what I'm going to

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.620 
so this looks good so what I'm going to
do<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.590> take<00:00:37.770> control<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.910> select<00:00:38.940> all<00:00:39.420> my

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
do is take control a to select all my

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.260 
do is take control a to select all my
objects<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:41.220> a<00:00:41.310> big<00:00:41.490> key<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.760> keyframe

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
objects and it's a big key to keyframe

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.010 
objects and it's a big key to keyframe
this<00:00:43.610> that's<00:00:44.610> going<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:44.910> give<00:00:45.030> each<00:00:45.210> object<00:00:45.840> an

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this that's going to give each object an

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.010 
this that's going to give each object an
initial<00:00:46.110> starting<00:00:46.770> point<00:00:47.780> next<00:00:48.780> what<00:00:48.900> I'm

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
initial starting point next what I'm

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.050 
initial starting point next what I'm
going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.470> move<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.770> timeline<00:00:50.040> over<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
going to do is move the timeline over so

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.630 
going to do is move the timeline over so
we<00:00:51.180> can<00:00:51.300> start<00:00:51.540> our<00:00:51.690> next<00:00:51.840> keyframe<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:55.640> now

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we can start our next keyframe so now

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
we can start our next keyframe so now
let's<00:00:56.820> reposition<00:00:57.150> the<00:00:57.510> robot<00:00:57.870> until<00:00:58.290> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
let's reposition the robot until it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
let's reposition the robot until it's
over<00:00:58.650> the<00:00:58.739> Box<00:00:58.950> we<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> pick<00:00:59.550> up<00:00:59.840> now<00:01:00.840> what

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
over the Box we want to pick up now what

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.840 
over the Box we want to pick up now what
we<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.530> make<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.830> motion<00:01:02.100> look<00:01:02.640> more

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
we can do to make this motion look more

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.990 
we can do to make this motion look more
robotic<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:04.680> split<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.130> up<00:01:05.220> into<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.550> few<00:01:05.760> key

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
robotic is split it up into a few key

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.830 
robotic is split it up into a few key
frames<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.720> distinct<00:01:07.590> positions<00:01:08.780> so<00:01:09.780> I'm

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
frames and distinct positions so I'm

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.660 
frames and distinct positions so I'm
going<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.080> start<00:01:10.320> with<00:01:10.470> an<00:01:10.740> initial<00:01:11.040> position

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
going to start with an initial position

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
going to start with an initial position
here<00:01:14.060> once<00:01:15.060> we've<00:01:15.210> found<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.509> good<00:01:15.630> position<00:01:16.140> we

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
here once we've found a good position we

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.660 
here once we've found a good position we
can<00:01:16.470> go<00:01:16.650> ahead<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> select<00:01:17.190> all<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.520> our

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
can go ahead and select all of our

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.930 
can go ahead and select all of our
objects<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> set<00:01:18.660> a<00:01:18.690> new<00:01:18.869> keyframe<00:01:19.940> every

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
objects and set a new keyframe every

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.880 
objects and set a new keyframe every
time<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> set<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> new<00:01:21.570> keyframe<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.440> like<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.770> go

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
time I set a new keyframe I like to go

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
time I set a new keyframe I like to go
back<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.340> play<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> animation<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.360> just

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
back and play the animation and just

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.070 
back and play the animation and just
make<00:01:24.690> sure<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:25.020> looks<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> next<00:01:27.750> we<00:01:27.930> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
make sure it looks right so next we can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.480 
make sure it looks right so next we can
move<00:01:28.110> our<00:01:28.350> timeline<00:01:28.800> over<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.250> our<00:01:29.340> next

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
move our timeline over to our next

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.200 
move our timeline over to our next
keyframe<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:31.430> reposition<00:01:32.430> our<00:01:32.580> robot<00:01:32.940> in<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
keyframe and reposition our robot in the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:02:22.730 
keyframe and reposition our robot in the
final<00:01:33.509> position<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:34.110> pick<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.410> the<00:01:34.740> first<00:01:34.950> box

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.860 

once<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.520> found<00:02:23.700> our<00:02:23.880> final<00:02:24.180> position<00:02:24.270> we<00:02:24.750> can

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
once we found our final position we can

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.450 
once we found our final position we can
go<00:02:24.990> ahead<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.410> select<00:02:25.560> all<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.860> our<00:02:26.010> objects

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
go ahead and select all of our objects

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.270 
go ahead and select all of our objects
again<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.030> set<00:02:27.360> our<00:02:27.600> new<00:02:27.720> keyframe<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.500> then

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
again and set our new keyframe and then

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
again and set our new keyframe and then
replay<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.790> animation<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.600> see<00:02:30.630> if<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.930> looks

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
replay the animation to see if it looks

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.050 
replay the animation to see if it looks
right<00:02:31.320> now<00:02:33.620> we<00:02:34.620> can<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> slide<00:02:35.490> our<00:02:35.670> newest

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
right now we can do a slide our newest

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.690 
right now we can do a slide our newest
keyframe<00:02:36.660> over<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.050> few<00:02:37.320> frames<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:38.520> then

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
keyframe over a few frames and then

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.460 
keyframe over a few frames and then
we'll<00:02:38.850> give<00:02:39.000> our<00:02:39.120> robot<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.660> nice<00:02:39.870> pause<00:02:42.470> this

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
we'll give our robot a nice pause this

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.050 
we'll give our robot a nice pause this
next<00:02:43.800> part<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.220> video<00:02:44.400> I've<00:02:44.880> actually

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
next part of the video I've actually

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
next part of the video I've actually
readjusted<00:02:45.900> my<00:02:46.020> keyframes<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
readjusted my keyframes so that the

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.100 
readjusted my keyframes so that the
robot<00:02:47.460> looks<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.030> it's<00:02:48.210> coming<00:02:48.570> more<00:02:48.960> from

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
robot looks like it's coming more from

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.000 
robot looks like it's coming more from
the<00:02:49.230> top<00:02:49.470> instead<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.340> underneath<00:02:50.670> the<00:02:50.970> box

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the top instead of underneath the box

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.870 
the top instead of underneath the box
now<00:02:53.010> there's<00:02:53.160> two<00:02:53.340> ways<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.640> do<00:02:53.730> this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
now there's two ways to do this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.700 
now there's two ways to do this
animation<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.840> first<00:02:54.870> way<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> brute

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
animation the first way is the brute

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.280 
animation the first way is the brute
force<00:02:56.010> way<00:02:56.250> which<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.120> be<00:02:57.210> easier<00:02:57.600> but<00:02:58.170> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
force way which can be easier but the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.590 
force way which can be easier but the
animation<00:02:58.560> will<00:02:58.830> look<00:02:58.950> more<00:02:59.130> choppy<00:02:59.420> so<00:03:00.420> that

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
animation will look more choppy so that

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.390 
animation will look more choppy so that
way<00:03:00.810> involves<00:03:01.290> moving<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.710> robot<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
way involves moving the robot and the

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.820 
way involves moving the robot and the
Box<00:03:02.640> separately<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:04.200> lining<00:03:04.560> them<00:03:04.680> up

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
Box separately and just lining them up

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.870 
Box separately and just lining them up
so<00:03:05.040> they<00:03:05.160> look<00:03:05.370> like<00:03:05.400> they're<00:03:05.670> moving

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
so they look like they're moving

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.660 
so they look like they're moving
together<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.440> second<00:03:07.860> way<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> use<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
together the second way is to use a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.600 
together the second way is to use a
motion<00:03:09.210> controller<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:10.170> link<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.590> Box<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
motion controller to link the Box to the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.190 
motion controller to link the Box to the
head<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.060> robot<00:03:12.450> when<00:03:12.630> we<00:03:12.720> want<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.050> pick

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
head of the robot when we want to pick

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.620 
head of the robot when we want to pick
it<00:03:13.350> up<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.800> unlink<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> Box<00:03:14.790> what<00:03:15.180> we<00:03:15.300> want<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it up and unlink the Box what we want to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.160 
it up and unlink the Box what we want to
set<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.840> down<00:03:17.300> motion<00:03:18.300> controllers<00:03:18.810> can<00:03:18.990> help

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
set it down motion controllers can help

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.870 
set it down motion controllers can help
us<00:03:19.320> control<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.740> way<00:03:19.980> an<00:03:20.310> object<00:03:20.670> moves

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
us control the way an object moves

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.640 
us control the way an object moves
between<00:03:21.420> two<00:03:21.600> keyframes<00:03:21.900> during<00:03:22.530> an

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
between two keyframes during an

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.610 
between two keyframes during an
animation<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.570> motion<00:03:24.960> controllers<00:03:25.410> can<00:03:25.560> be

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
animation the motion controllers can be

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.520 
animation the motion controllers can be
found<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.370> motion<00:03:26.760> tab<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.990> if<00:03:28.050> we<00:03:28.170> select

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
found in the motion tab so if we select

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.370 
found in the motion tab so if we select
that<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.190> then<00:03:29.730> we<00:03:29.910> select<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.540> box<00:03:30.990> we<00:03:31.170> want

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
that and then we select the box we want

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.060 
that and then we select the box we want
to<00:03:31.470> add<00:03:31.620> our<00:03:32.010> links<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:33.470> we<00:03:34.470> go<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.740> where<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
to add our links to we go to where it

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.070 
to add our links to we go to where it
says<00:03:35.190> assigned<00:03:35.790> controller<00:03:36.270> and<00:03:36.690> click<00:03:36.900> on

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
says assigned controller and click on

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.440 
says assigned controller and click on
that<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:38.370> controller<00:03:38.760> options<00:03:39.000> will

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
that and the controller options will

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.500 
that and the controller options will
drop<00:03:39.690> down<00:03:40.580> now<00:03:41.580> there's<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:41.820> lot<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.180> different

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
drop down now there's a lot of different

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.270 
drop down now there's a lot of different
things<00:03:42.720> we<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:42.900> use<00:03:43.080> motion<00:03:43.620> controllers<00:03:44.040> for

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
things we can use motion controllers for

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.920 
things we can use motion controllers for
so<00:03:44.640> I'm<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:44.910> going<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.120> show<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.600> one<00:03:45.750> we

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
so I'm just going to show you the one we

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500 
so I'm just going to show you the one we
need<00:03:46.170> specifically<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.400> linking<00:03:47.790> an<00:03:48.030> object

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
need specifically for linking an object

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.430 
need specifically for linking an object
and<00:03:48.780> then<00:03:48.990> I'm<00:03:49.170> linking<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.990> reason<00:03:52.320> we

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and then I'm linking it the reason we

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.710 
and then I'm linking it the reason we
need<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.830> change<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.400> controller<00:03:53.850> is<00:03:54.270> because

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
need to change the controller is because

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.200 
need to change the controller is because
we<00:03:55.080> can't<00:03:55.350> actually<00:03:55.620> keyframe<00:03:56.520> the<00:03:56.820> normal

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
we can't actually keyframe the normal

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.150 
we can't actually keyframe the normal
link<00:03:57.390> command<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.110> we<00:03:58.230> use<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.680> link<00:03:58.860> all<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
link command that we use to link all the

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.880 
link command that we use to link all the
robot<00:03:59.520> pieces<00:03:59.940> together<00:04:00.620> so<00:04:01.620> what<00:04:01.740> we're

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
robot pieces together so what we're

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.620 
robot pieces together so what we're
going<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.550> select<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.910> top<00:04:03.210> level

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
going to do is select the top level

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.180 
going to do is select the top level
where<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:03.900> says<00:04:04.080> transform<00:04:04.860> position

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
where it says transform position

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.700 
where it says transform position
rotation<00:04:06.090> scale<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.810> then<00:04:07.050> click<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.500> box

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
rotation scale and then click the box

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:09.680 
rotation scale and then click the box
with<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.070> green<00:04:08.280> check<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.940> says<00:04:09.210> a<00:04:09.480> side

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
with the green check that says a side

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.870 
with the green check that says a side
controller<00:04:10.200> and<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.130> get<00:04:11.280> this<00:04:11.460> pop<00:04:11.670> out

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
controller and we get this pop out

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.900 
controller and we get this pop out
window<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:13.500> now<00:04:14.130> we<00:04:14.190> can<00:04:14.430> change<00:04:14.640> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
window and now we can change the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.840 
window and now we can change the
controller<00:04:15.420> from<00:04:16.080> position<00:04:16.799> rotation<00:04:17.250> scale

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
controller from position rotation scale

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.420 
controller from position rotation scale
to<00:04:18.690> link<00:04:18.930> constraint<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.859> then<00:04:20.310> select<00:04:20.670> ok

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
to link constraint and then select ok

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.070 
to link constraint and then select ok
now<00:04:23.430> we<00:04:23.490> have<00:04:23.760> a<00:04:23.790> new<00:04:24.060> menu<00:04:24.270> called<00:04:24.750> link

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
now we have a new menu called link

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.800 
now we have a new menu called link
params<00:04:25.700> which<00:04:26.700> will<00:04:26.910> help<00:04:27.030> us<00:04:27.240> control<00:04:27.600> what

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
params which will help us control what

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.830 
params which will help us control what
we're<00:04:27.990> linking<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.440> object<00:04:28.890> to<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.690> let's

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
we're linking the object to so let's

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.200 
we're linking the object to so let's
first<00:04:31.140> go<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.710> set<00:04:31.950> our<00:04:32.070> timeline<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.880> zero

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
first go and set our timeline to zero

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.170 
first go and set our timeline to zero
now<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.350> is<00:04:34.500> okay<00:04:34.830> to<00:04:34.890> do

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
now it is okay to do

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.029 
now it is okay to do
that's<00:04:35.419> not<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.840> Seki<00:04:36.320> or<00:04:36.530> Auto<00:04:36.710> key<00:04:37.009> mode

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
that's not in Seki or Auto key mode

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.820 
that's not in Seki or Auto key mode
first<00:04:37.940> what<00:04:38.240> we're<00:04:38.360> gonna<00:04:38.479> do<00:04:38.780> is<00:04:39.050> select<00:04:39.320> link

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
first what we're gonna do is select link

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.400 
first what we're gonna do is select link
to<00:04:40.039> world<00:04:40.419> what<00:04:41.419> this<00:04:41.600> is<00:04:41.750> going<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:41.990> do<00:04:42.169> is

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
to world what this is going to do is

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.320 
to world what this is going to do is
make<00:04:42.590> sure<00:04:42.770> that<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.100> box<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.520> independent

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
make sure that the box is independent

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.960 
make sure that the box is independent
from<00:04:44.509> any<00:04:44.690> other<00:04:44.930> object<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.680> begin<00:04:45.949> with<00:04:46.130> now

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
from any other object to begin with now

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.029 
from any other object to begin with now
that<00:04:47.150> we've<00:04:47.300> done<00:04:47.539> that<00:04:47.810> we<00:04:48.560> can<00:04:48.590> move<00:04:48.860> our

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
that we've done that we can move our

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.430 
that we've done that we can move our
timeline<00:04:49.580> slider<00:04:49.880> down<00:04:50.240> to<00:04:50.960> where<00:04:51.110> we<00:04:51.139> want

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
timeline slider down to where we want

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.140 
timeline slider down to where we want
the<00:04:51.590> box<00:04:51.830> to<00:04:52.130> start<00:04:52.310> linking<00:04:52.699> up<00:04:52.850> with<00:04:53.030> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
the box to start linking up with the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.370 
the box to start linking up with the
robot<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:55.370> then<00:04:55.550> we<00:04:55.669> can<00:04:55.880> select<00:04:56.060> add<00:04:56.539> link<00:04:57.110> in

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
robot and then we can select add link in

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.999 
robot and then we can select add link in
the<00:04:57.590> link<00:04:57.830> params<00:04:58.220> tab<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.810> then<00:05:00.650> select

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
the link params tab and then select

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.680 
the link params tab and then select
ahead<00:05:01.310> of<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> robot<00:05:01.880> that<00:05:02.120> we<00:05:02.240> want<00:05:02.449> to<00:05:02.539> link

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
ahead of the robot that we want to link

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.550 
ahead of the robot that we want to link
the<00:05:02.810> Box<00:05:03.020> to<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:08.360> now<00:05:08.509> that<00:05:08.570> our<00:05:08.870> initial<00:05:09.289> links

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
the Box to so now that our initial links

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.010 
the Box to so now that our initial links
are<00:05:09.710> set<00:05:09.949> up<00:05:10.130> what<00:05:10.520> we<00:05:10.639> can<00:05:10.820> do<00:05:11.030> is<00:05:11.360> readjust

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
are set up what we can do is readjust

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:19.170 
are set up what we can do is readjust
the<00:05:12.199> robot<00:05:12.620> and<00:05:13.070> it'll<00:05:13.490> take<00:05:13.669> the<00:05:13.820> box<00:05:14.060> with<00:05:14.330> it

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.700 

so<00:05:20.180> now<00:05:20.210> we<00:05:20.300> just<00:05:20.660> find<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.990> new<00:05:21.110> position<00:05:21.349> that

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
so now we just find a new position that

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:30.400 
so now we just find a new position that
we<00:05:22.130> want<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.430> robot<00:05:22.759> in<00:05:28.539> and<00:05:29.539> then<00:05:29.960> we<00:05:30.050> can<00:05:30.080> set

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
we want the robot in and then we can set

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.320 
we want the robot in and then we can set
some<00:05:30.620> key<00:05:30.800> frames<00:05:31.130> for<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.580> position<00:05:34.210> so<00:05:35.210> now

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
some key frames for this position so now

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.089 
some key frames for this position so now
let's<00:05:35.570> remove<00:05:35.780> all<00:05:36.050> of<00:05:36.229> our<00:05:36.320> pieces<00:05:36.590> you'll

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
let's remove all of our pieces you'll

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.710 
let's remove all of our pieces you'll
notice<00:05:37.400> that<00:05:37.520> the<00:05:37.639> box<00:05:37.849> is<00:05:38.060> still<00:05:38.240> linked<00:05:38.570> to

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
notice that the box is still linked to

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.390 
notice that the box is still linked to
the<00:05:38.810> head<00:05:38.960> of<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.110> robot<00:05:45.159> so<00:05:46.159> once<00:05:46.280> you've

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
the head of the robot so once you've

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.040 
the head of the robot so once you've
found<00:05:46.520> a<00:05:46.669> good<00:05:46.699> position<00:05:47.270> you<00:05:47.449> select<00:05:47.780> all<00:05:47.930> the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
found a good position you select all the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.909 
found a good position you select all the
objects<00:05:48.590> and<00:05:48.680> set<00:05:48.949> a<00:05:48.979> new<00:05:49.159> keyframe<00:05:53.800> then<00:05:54.800> we

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
objects and set a new keyframe then we

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.430 
objects and set a new keyframe then we
can<00:05:55.070> move<00:05:55.190> our<00:05:55.370> timeline<00:05:55.820> slider<00:05:56.120> down<00:05:56.479> and

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
can move our timeline slider down and

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.560 
can move our timeline slider down and
set<00:05:57.710> an<00:05:57.830> intermediate<00:05:58.430> position<00:05:58.580> before<00:05:59.240> we

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
set an intermediate position before we

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:07.300 
set an intermediate position before we
drop<00:05:59.750> the<00:05:59.930> box<00:06:05.380> once<00:06:06.380> that's<00:06:06.650> done<00:06:06.889> we<00:06:07.039> can<00:06:07.190> go

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
drop the box once that's done we can go

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.629 
drop the box once that's done we can go
ahead<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.940> set<00:06:08.150> this<00:06:08.330> new<00:06:08.539> keyframe<00:06:09.520> and<00:06:10.520> then

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
ahead and set this new keyframe and then

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:12.490 
ahead and set this new keyframe and then
we<00:06:10.729> can<00:06:10.880> replay<00:06:11.210> the<00:06:11.360> animation<00:06:11.930> to<00:06:12.139> see<00:06:12.320> how

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
we can replay the animation to see how

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.060 
we can replay the animation to see how
it<00:06:12.620> looks<00:06:12.860> now<00:06:17.110> I'm<00:06:18.110> just<00:06:18.259> gonna<00:06:18.380> skip<00:06:18.740> ahead<00:06:18.860> a

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
it looks now I'm just gonna skip ahead a

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.070 
it looks now I'm just gonna skip ahead a
little<00:06:19.159> bit<00:06:19.550> to<00:06:19.880> where<00:06:20.030> I<00:06:20.090> found<00:06:20.449> the<00:06:20.720> final

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
little bit to where I found the final

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.110 
little bit to where I found the final
position<00:06:21.590> where<00:06:21.979> I<00:06:22.009> want<00:06:22.250> my<00:06:22.310> robot<00:06:22.820> to

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.120 
position where I want my robot to

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.770 
position where I want my robot to
release<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.599> box<00:06:25.360> once<00:06:26.360> you've<00:06:26.509> found<00:06:26.630> your

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
release the box once you've found your

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.110 
release the box once you've found your
final<00:06:27.169> position<00:06:27.650> go<00:06:28.250> ahead<00:06:28.550> and<00:06:28.880> set<00:06:29.090> your

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
final position go ahead and set your

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.040 
final position go ahead and set your
last<00:06:29.449> keyframe<00:06:30.849> then<00:06:31.849> what<00:06:32.000> we<00:06:32.150> can<00:06:32.360> do<00:06:32.539> is<00:06:32.840> go

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
last keyframe then what we can do is go

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.999 
last keyframe then what we can do is go
back<00:06:33.080> into<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.860> motion<00:06:34.280> tab<00:06:35.680> it's<00:06:36.680> like

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:37.009 
back into the motion tab it's like

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:38.620 
back into the motion tab it's like
linked<00:06:37.340> to<00:06:37.490> world<00:06:37.699> again<00:06:38.060> which<00:06:38.270> is<00:06:38.419> going<00:06:38.570> to

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:38.630 
linked to world again which is going to

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.089 
linked to world again which is going to
unlink<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:39.229> box<00:06:39.470> from<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:39.800> head<00:06:39.949> of<00:06:40.039> the

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
unlink the box from the head of the

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.870 
unlink the box from the head of the
robot<00:06:41.380> now<00:06:42.380> we<00:06:42.440> can<00:06:42.770> reposition<00:06:43.370> the<00:06:43.490> robot

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
robot now we can reposition the robot

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:54.000 
robot now we can reposition the robot
again<00:06:44.180> without<00:06:45.080> the<00:06:45.380> box<00:06:45.590> following<00:06:46.159> it

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.590 

so<00:06:55.010> once<00:06:55.160> that's<00:06:55.370> done<00:06:55.730> you<00:06:55.940> can<00:06:55.970> keyframe

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:56.600 
so once that's done you can keyframe

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.050 
so once that's done you can keyframe
that<00:06:56.630> and<00:06:57.230> then<00:06:57.650> replay<00:06:57.980> your<00:06:58.130> animation<00:06:58.670> to

00:06:59.050 --> 00:06:59.060 
that and then replay your animation to

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.690 
that and then replay your animation to
see<00:06:59.210> what<00:06:59.360> happens<00:06:59.980> so<00:07:00.980> you<00:07:01.040> notice<00:07:01.370> the<00:07:01.400> box

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
see what happens so you notice the box

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.910 
see what happens so you notice the box
States<00:07:02.090> with<00:07:02.270> the<00:07:02.390> robot<00:07:02.720> and<00:07:02.960> then<00:07:03.500> the<00:07:03.620> robot

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
States with the robot and then the robot

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.530 
States with the robot and then the robot
leaves<00:07:04.160> it<00:07:04.340> at<00:07:04.430> the<00:07:04.550> pallet<00:07:04.910> just<00:07:05.210> like<00:07:05.420> we

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
leaves it at the pallet just like we

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.300 
leaves it at the pallet just like we
wanted<00:07:05.840> it<00:07:05.990> to<00:07:07.030> and<00:07:08.500> then<00:07:09.500> we<00:07:09.650> can<00:07:09.800> just<00:07:09.950> repeat

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
wanted it to and then we can just repeat

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.310 
wanted it to and then we can just repeat
this<00:07:10.490> process<00:07:10.760> to<00:07:11.390> make<00:07:11.540> the<00:07:11.660> robot<00:07:11.990> move<00:07:12.020> the

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320 
this process to make the robot move the

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:14.860 
this process to make the robot move the
second<00:07:12.710> box
