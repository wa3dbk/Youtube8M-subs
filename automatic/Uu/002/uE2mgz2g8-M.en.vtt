a<00:00:32.099> really<00:00:32.520> light<00:00:32.700> foundation<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:34.050> have

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
a really light foundation if you have

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.930 
a really light foundation if you have
good<00:00:34.500> skin<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.370> recommend<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
good skin then I would recommend this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.400 
good skin then I would recommend this
for<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.200> light

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
for you just because it's a really light

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
for you just because it's a really light
coverage<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.399> have<00:00:38.670> more<00:00:38.850> problematic

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
coverage if you have more problematic

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.930 
coverage if you have more problematic
skin<00:00:39.719> i<00:00:39.899> probably<00:00:40.290> wouldn't<00:00:40.800> advise<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.550> just

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
skin i probably wouldn't advise it just

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.220 
skin i probably wouldn't advise it just
because<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.750> going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.989> cover

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
because it's not really going to cover

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
because it's not really going to cover
anything<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.629> to

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
anything up it's just kind of going to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.619 
anything up it's just kind of going to
give<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.649> finish<00:00:47.039> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.370> skin<00:00:47.730> it's

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
give you a nice finish on the skin it's

give you a nice finish on the skin it's
great<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.079> summertime<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.100> want

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
great for summertime if you just want

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.369 
great for summertime if you just want
something<00:00:50.489> light<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.660> got<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.110> gel

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
something light so it's got like a gel

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.709 
something light so it's got like a gel
serum<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.760> foundation<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.539> just

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
serum in with the foundation so it just

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
serum in with the foundation so it just
glides<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.350> nicely<00:00:55.559> onto<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> skin<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
glides really nicely onto the skin so it

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.630 
glides really nicely onto the skin so it
says<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.719> radiant<00:00:58.440> boosting<00:00:58.920> foundation

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
says it's a radiant boosting foundation

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.400 
says it's a radiant boosting foundation
and<00:00:59.940> anti<00:01:00.359> fatigue<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:00.960> it's<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
and anti fatigue so it's just going to

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
and anti fatigue so it's just going to
give<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.340> radiant<00:01:02.850> glow<00:01:03.449> on

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.410 
that I also use on a majority of my
clients<00:01:51.899> when<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.829> makeup<00:01:53.189> jobs<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
clients when I have makeup jobs and so I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.959 
clients when I have makeup jobs and so I
think<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.960> does<00:01:55.079> really<00:01:55.380> suit<00:01:55.770> any<00:01:56.070> skin<00:01:56.729> tone

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
think it does really suit any skin tone

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.810 
think it does really suit any skin tone
as<00:01:57.299> long<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:58.170> powder<00:01:58.950> over<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.430> top<00:01:59.640> if

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
as long as you powder over the top if

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.719 
as long as you powder over the top if
you<00:01:59.850> do<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.630> oily<00:02:01.049> skin<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.430> am

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
you do have more oily skin and so I am

on all different skin tones it's also

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.800 
on all different skin tones it's also
really<00:03:05.430> buildable<00:03:05.970> with<00:03:06.120> it's<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.510> light

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
really buildable with it's a light

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.990 
really buildable with it's a light
coverage<00:03:07.380> but<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.950> I<00:03:08.220> said<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.580> buildable

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
coverage but as I said it is buildable

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.330 
coverage but as I said it is buildable
so<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.690> build<00:03:09.900> her<00:03:10.050> up<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:11.010> higher

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
so you can build her up to a higher

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.910 
so you can build her up to a higher
coverage<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.240> it's<00:03:13.050> got<00:03:13.290> quite<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> dreamy

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
coverage and it's got quite a dreamy

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.370 
coverage and it's got quite a dreamy
finish<00:03:14.370> on<00:03:14.610> its<00:03:14.850> own<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.510> if<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.110> want<00:03:16.320> to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
finish on its own so if you just want to

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.410 
finish on its own so if you just want to
match<00:03:16.620> it<00:03:16.770> out<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.160> recommend<00:03:17.580> going<00:03:17.820> over<00:03:18.300> it

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.170 
thing is that although it's called sheer
glow<00:05:18.110> I<00:05:18.440> find<00:05:18.889> it<00:05:19.009> quite<00:05:19.159> matte<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.639> my<00:05:19.759> skin

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
glow I find it quite matte on my skin

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.480 
glow I find it quite matte on my skin
and<00:05:20.360> I'm<00:05:20.539> not<00:05:20.750> sure<00:05:20.960> why<00:05:21.169> I<00:05:21.199> do<00:05:21.470> have<00:05:21.860> dry<00:05:22.430> to

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
and I'm not sure why I do have dry to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.420 
and I'm not sure why I do have dry to
medium<00:05:22.970> skin<00:05:23.530> so<00:05:24.530> maybe<00:05:24.740> I<00:05:24.860> just<00:05:25.190> need<00:05:25.400> to

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
medium skin so maybe I just need to

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.450 
medium skin so maybe I just need to
moisturize<00:05:25.789> a<00:05:26.479> bit<00:05:26.990> more<00:05:27.169> before<00:05:27.380> but<00:05:28.039> I<00:05:28.070> don't

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
moisturize a bit more before but I don't

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:30.879 
moisturize a bit more before but I don't
feel<00:05:28.669> like<00:05:28.820> it<00:05:28.970> really<00:05:29.090> gives<00:05:29.330> me<00:05:29.509> a<00:05:29.889> glowing

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:30.889 
feel like it really gives me a glowing

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:32.560 
feel like it really gives me a glowing
finish<00:05:31.310> although<00:05:31.699> I<00:05:31.729> do<00:05:31.880> know<00:05:32.150> people<00:05:32.330> that
