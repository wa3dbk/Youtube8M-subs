00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
know how to do that but in this version

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.560 
know how to do that but in this version
we're<00:03:10.850> gonna<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:12.430> muting<00:03:13.430> beats<00:03:14.000> two<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.299> four

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.020 

so<00:03:21.570> we<00:03:21.690> do<00:03:21.900> what's<00:03:22.110> called<00:03:22.410> a<00:03:23.030> percussive

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
so we do what's called a percussive

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:35.090 
so we do what's called a percussive
strum<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.780> how<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.650> do<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.100> is<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.930> on<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.770> fret

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
strum and how I do that is I on the fret

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.930 
strum and how I do that is I on the fret
the<00:03:35.310> chord<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.260> then<00:03:37.260> do<00:03:37.680> my<00:03:37.890> strum<00:03:40.940> my

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
the chord and then do my strum my

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.740 
the chord and then do my strum my
fingers<00:03:42.330> are<00:03:42.480> still<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:43.020> the<00:03:43.500> strings<00:03:44.690> but<00:03:45.690> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
fingers are still on the strings but I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:57.670 
fingers are still on the strings but I
just<00:03:45.960> lift<00:03:46.230> off<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.530> want<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:56.040> -<00:03:56.370> you<00:03:57.120> can

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
just lift off if you want to - you can

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.290 
just lift off if you want to - you can
do<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:59.010> percussive<00:03:59.610> strum<00:03:59.700> with<00:03:59.880> your<00:04:00.120> right

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
do that percussive strum with your right

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.100 
do that percussive strum with your right
hand<00:04:00.920> in<00:04:01.920> which<00:04:02.130> case<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.670> take<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.690> part<00:04:04.050> of

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
hand in which case you take this part of

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.660 
hand in which case you take this part of
your<00:04:04.230> hand<00:04:04.820> place<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.450> strings

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
your hand place it on the strings

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.010 
your hand place it on the strings
immediately<00:04:08.670> before<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.210> strum<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.840> it's

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
immediately before you strum so it's

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:23.840 
immediately before you strum so it's
like<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.950> two<00:04:11.990> one<00:04:12.990> two<00:04:13.340> together<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.700> got

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
like a one two one two together you got

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.700
