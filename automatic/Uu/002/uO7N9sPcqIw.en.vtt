you<00:01:26.729> notice<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.210> see<00:01:27.390> how<00:01:28.009> both<00:01:29.009> sides<00:01:29.399> are

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
you notice you see how both sides are

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.899 
you notice you see how both sides are
actually<00:01:30.899> turning<00:01:31.259> white<00:01:31.530> another<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.610> raw

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
actually turning white another that raw

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.260 
actually turning white another that raw
pink<00:01:34.280> that's<00:01:35.280> because<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.580> keep<00:01:35.700> turning<00:01:36.000> it

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
pink that's because I keep turning it

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.680 
pink that's because I keep turning it
and<00:01:36.450> see<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.409> both<00:01:37.590> sides<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.220> even<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.479> can

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
and see if both sides are even you can

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.900 
and see if both sides are even you can
see<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.920> because<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.160> keep<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> moving

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
see that because I just keep it moving

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.460 
see that because I just keep it moving
so<00:01:42.119> make<00:01:42.270> sure<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.630> keep<00:01:42.810> moving<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so make sure you just keep moving and I

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.680 
so make sure you just keep moving and I
know<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.890> pain<00:01:44.179> but<00:01:45.179> if<00:01:45.300> you<00:01:45.390> keep<00:01:45.539> it

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
know it's a pain but if you keep it

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.270 
know it's a pain but if you keep it
moving<00:01:45.989> a<00:01:46.110> little<00:01:46.410> definitely<00:01:46.830> cook<00:01:47.009> better<00:01:47.190> i

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
moving a little definitely cook better i

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.740 
moving a little definitely cook better i
think<00:01:47.450> it'll<00:01:48.450> cook<00:01:48.660> more<00:01:48.840> evenly<00:01:50.720> okay<00:01:51.720> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
think it'll cook more evenly okay I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.490 
think it'll cook more evenly okay I
think<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.170> chicken<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.709> definitely<00:01:53.190> done<00:01:54.500> so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
think this chicken is definitely done so

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.169 
think this chicken is definitely done so

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
I'm going to put this off to the side

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.399 
I'm going to put this off to the side
