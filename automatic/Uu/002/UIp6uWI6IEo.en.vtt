schedule bit there yeah I think he sees
that<00:01:55.530> it's<00:01:55.649> not<00:01:55.740> only<00:01:55.799> him<00:01:56.070> who<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.450> what<00:01:57.450> is

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
that it's not only him who can what is

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.030

this<00:03:23.940> himself<00:03:24.390> so<00:03:24.540> he's<00:03:24.660> building<00:03:25.050> his<00:03:25.080> own

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
this himself so he's building his own

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.320 
this himself so he's building his own
knowledge<00:03:25.950> base<00:03:26.430> about<00:03:26.459> a<00:03:26.760> tune<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.120> car

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
knowledge base about a tune in the car

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.180 
knowledge base about a tune in the car
so<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.630> set<00:03:27.840> them<00:03:27.959> up<00:03:28.050> how<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.230> build<00:03:28.500> them<00:03:28.709> so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
so to set them up how to build them so

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.310 
so to set them up how to build them so
yeah<00:03:29.910> to<00:03:30.209> put<00:03:30.390> them<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.570> fifth<00:03:30.750> place<00:03:30.959> is

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
yeah to put them in fifth place is

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.830 
yeah to put them in fifth place is
probably<00:03:31.739> generous<00:03:32.310> but<00:03:32.520> maybe<00:03:33.000> 8th<00:03:33.209> 9th<00:03:33.540> 10th

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
probably generous but maybe 8th 9th 10th

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
can happen I mean this track layout here

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.080 
can happen I mean this track layout here
is<00:03:57.480> behind<00:03:57.840> us<00:03:58.019> that<00:03:58.080> is<00:03:58.500> not<00:03:59.459> an<00:03:59.610> easy<00:03:59.730> track

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
is behind us that is not an easy track

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.270 
is behind us that is not an easy track
to<00:04:00.209> drive<00:04:00.420> very<00:04:00.720> very<00:04:01.080> demanding<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.799> lot<00:04:02.160> of

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
to drive very very demanding a lot of

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.710 
to drive very very demanding a lot of
work<00:04:02.370> for<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> drivers<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.239> conditions

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
work for the drivers and the conditions

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.000 
work for the drivers and the conditions
aren't<00:04:03.930> as<00:04:04.080> good<00:04:04.200> as<00:04:04.290> they<00:04:04.350> could<00:04:04.530> be<00:04:04.769> on<00:04:04.799> the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
aren't as good as they could be on the

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.620 
aren't as good as they could be on the
track<00:04:05.190> surface<00:04:05.459> the<00:04:05.850> track<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.269> little<00:04:06.360> bit

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
track surface the track is a little bit

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.080 
track surface the track is a little bit
oily<00:04:06.780> may<00:04:07.170> be<00:04:07.230> slippery<00:04:07.590> which<00:04:08.190> compounds<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
oily may be slippery which compounds the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.270 
oily may be slippery which compounds the
problem<00:04:09.120> so<00:04:09.750> now<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.680> hard<00:04:10.860> enough<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.160> get

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
problem so now it's hard enough to get

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.100 
problem so now it's hard enough to get
around<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.670> track<00:04:11.880> when<00:04:12.030> the<00:04:12.150> car<00:04:12.299> works<00:04:12.570> when

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
around the track when the car works when

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.330 
around the track when the car works when
we're<00:04:13.290> struggling<00:04:13.530> to<00:04:13.739> make<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> car<00:04:14.160> work

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
we're struggling to make the car work

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.949 
we're struggling to make the car work
better<00:04:14.549> than<00:04:14.760> it's<00:04:14.940> even<00:04:15.180> harder<00:04:15.510> so<00:04:15.690> to<00:04:15.750> make

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
better than it's even harder so to make

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.900 
better than it's even harder so to make
eight<00:04:16.169> minutes<00:04:16.560> with<00:04:16.650> without<00:04:17.190> mistakes<00:04:17.580> is

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
eight minutes with without mistakes is

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.150 
eight minutes with without mistakes is
is<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.630> very<00:04:18.720> hard<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.380> do<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:19.769> this<00:04:19.919> can<00:04:20.130> be

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
is is very hard to do so this can be

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.770 
is is very hard to do so this can be
