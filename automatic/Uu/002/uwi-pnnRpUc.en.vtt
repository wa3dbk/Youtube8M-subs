00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.830
 nobody and nothing 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:33.740
 getting close to our dome 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:04.440
 got inside so we see outside 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.590
 what we have plus 4

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.840

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.100
 the height of the dome is five and a half meters 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.100
 total area 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:38.040
 there is no house of 76 square meters 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.840
 floors no insulation insulation nothing 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 no, here and so the dome keeps the temperature 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:00.650
 all over the snow all the snow in our dome 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.650
