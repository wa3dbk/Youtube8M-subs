00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.490
 solution of habitable boats this 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.610
 feature came up with the disk 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.279
 additional sims 3 dream island 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.619
 by the way he went out and war so 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.130
 when you live in a world like that 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:35.239
 do this bridgeport valley where all the 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.120
 other world come with with the disc 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.839
 additional store it does not have 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 two feet so to do that it takes 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:47.480
 you go in the options and from there 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.010
 change the city but I'm already there 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.930
 so I have not there I do not have the option a 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.059
 time you 've changed the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.320
 city ​​you have to click on the icon 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.449
 publishers of the world 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.239
 that one that's right next to the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.449
 bulldozer once selected or 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:10.729
 choose any terrain I 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:13.670
 take in 64 64 then you place it 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:19.850
 where you want provided you 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:22.340
 let some spas centers the gold 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.869
 what I mean you have a foot 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.770
 on a foot down here you place the 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.600
 ground 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.689
 once it's placed you click 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.520
 above no we selected you with the 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.840
 arrow and you select your land 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.200
 then we 'll have to change the type of 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.649
 ground 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.969
 so that and community so you go 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.959
 at the very bottom of the list and you 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:56.899
 select port once selected 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:58.640
 or done ok and again ok you re 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.069
 select your 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.250
 terrain you have in the mode 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:10.729
 construct h to the icon with the brush 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.180
 and so here is his 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.069
 charge 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.870
 it takes a little bit of time what I 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.870
 think it must reform the terrain 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.110

 you will go to answer them 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.380
 So here we are in the field 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.830
 you have to go into the 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.710
 foundations so selected foundation and 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:02.880
 you take any of them 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:04.380
 last foundation so the thing 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.140
 important what to start from 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.320
 the ocean and come back to the dull 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:18.710
 that's when you're done 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:24.740
 go to the purchase method you do 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:30.440
 sort by function you enter the code 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.440
 intended to chips and Nabeul 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.330
 once entered done ok and 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.710
 you redo control maj it's you 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:52.230
 enter the code or straw of the rings 1 

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:54.840
 and that's it will activate the little one on the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.840
 menu of bugs one finds all the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.060
 objects the different add-on that you 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.820
 do not see in the different 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.400
 categories 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.880
 so to do a more research 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.640
 quick I propose to filter and 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.140
 select the last recon he 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.080
 behind 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.120
 and here we are now 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.910
 must make the bridge that will allow 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.850
 also we be bound to the boats you 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.380
 select the link gateway and 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.380
 you put it on the edge 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.530
 and that's it 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:42.150
 there once placed it is necessary that you 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.150
 back to changing the city so f 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.000
 and this is where we will choose the 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.460
 shape of your boat that needs to be 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.139
 square or with a rounded barge all 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:03.610
 case we will take it we say well 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:09.050
 sure and it will curbet courbet the ark 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.020
 and that's how it is and creates the 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.430
 boat it's like that 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.700
 then to change that creates a new 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.290
 a new terrain you just have to 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.150
 go into buy construction mode 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.680
 then went sibra your creativity 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.080
 and that's the way it ends 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.690
 all our tutorial thank you very much 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.430
 have listened and I tell you to a 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.430
 next time this one dies
