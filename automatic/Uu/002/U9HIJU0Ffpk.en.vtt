something<00:00:49.600> any<00:00:49.719> skinny<00:00:51.120> any<00:00:52.120> C's<00:00:52.719> on<00:00:52.960> there

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
something any skinny any C's on there

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.729 
something any skinny any C's on there
the<00:00:53.920> electric<00:00:54.339> closest<00:00:54.910> Thompson<00:00:55.620> around<00:00:56.620> so

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
the electric closest Thompson around so

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.459 
the electric closest Thompson around so
I<00:00:56.800> dielectric<00:00:57.460> grease<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:58.539> I<00:00:58.809> put<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.109> on<00:00:59.260> there

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
I dielectric grease as I put it on there

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.410 
I dielectric grease as I put it on there
and<00:00:59.649> cut<00:00:59.949> that<00:01:00.129> nice<00:01:00.339> and<00:01:00.519> greasy<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.239> comes

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
the spark plugs will be loose you'll

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.110 
the spark plugs will be loose you'll
unscrew<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.010> you'll<00:02:03.310> get<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.730> the<00:02:03.850> top

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.120 
unscrew it you'll get it to the top

using this little ones the next

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.369 
using this little ones the next
extension<00:02:06.730> is<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:06.940> little<00:02:07.720> turning<00:02:08.170> thing

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
extension is a little turning thing

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:09.960 
extension is a little turning thing
there<00:02:08.590> then<00:02:09.340> you're<00:02:09.490> going<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.670> take<00:02:09.850> the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.400 
there then you're going to take the
fingers<00:02:10.300> you're<00:02:10.390> going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.570> pop<00:02:10.869> that<00:02:10.899> 1<00:02:11.290> inch

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
fingers you're going to pop that 1 inch

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.900 
fingers you're going to pop that 1 inch
extension<00:02:11.860> out

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
extension out

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.580 
extension out
right<00:02:13.590> grab<00:02:14.590> what's<00:02:14.860> left<00:02:15.160> here<00:02:16.320> actually<00:02:17.320> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
right grab what's left here actually I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.320 
right grab what's left here actually I
don't<00:02:17.710> have<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.310> didn't<00:02:18.700> actually<00:02:18.820> take<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
don't have I didn't actually take the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330 
don't have I didn't actually take the
spark<00:02:19.570> plug<00:02:19.840> out<00:02:20.020> so<00:02:20.320> this<00:02:21.040> would<00:02:21.310> actually

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
spark plug out so this would actually

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.250 
spark plug out so this would actually
this<00:02:22.270> let<00:02:22.540> ledge<00:02:22.750> right<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:22.990> would<00:02:23.200> actually

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
this let ledge right here would actually

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.410 
this let ledge right here would actually
be<00:02:23.650> high<00:02:24.190> enough<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.550> me<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.760> grab<00:02:24.910> my<00:02:25.090> fingers

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
be high enough for me to grab my fingers

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.120 
be high enough for me to grab my fingers
and<00:02:25.540> it<00:02:25.600> goes<00:02:25.780> right<00:02:25.960> up<00:02:26.110> into<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.410> cavity<00:02:26.920> here

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
and it goes right up into a cavity here

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.910 
and it goes right up into a cavity here
and<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:27.970> can<00:02:28.120> pull<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.480> all<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.720> way<00:02:28.840> out

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
and you can pull it all the way out

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.020 
and you can pull it all the way out
which<00:02:29.920> I'll<00:02:30.070> probably<00:02:30.280> be<00:02:30.460> able<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.670> do<00:02:30.820> with

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
which I'll probably be able to do with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.200 
which I'll probably be able to do with
my<00:02:31.290> extension<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.410> there<00:02:32.560> No<00:02:33.010> so<00:02:33.640> now<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:33.970> got

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
my extension on there No so now I got

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.600 
my extension on there No so now I got
out<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.600> top<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.080> off<00:02:35.910> using<00:02:36.910> a<00:02:38.340> spark<00:02:39.340> plug

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
out and top it off using a spark plug

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.560 
out and top it off using a spark plug
out<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:41.230> three<00:02:41.500> tools<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> need<00:02:43.240> to<00:02:43.330> remove

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
out these three tools you need to remove

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.680 
out these three tools you need to remove
plastics<00:02:44.230> or<00:02:44.440> anything<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.690> real

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
plastics or anything like that real

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.490 
plastics or anything like that real
simple<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:51.630> may<00:02:52.630> want<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:52.870> put<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> little<00:02:53.290> bit

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
simple you may want to put a little bit

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.190 
simple you may want to put a little bit
of<00:02:53.650> dielectric<00:02:54.280> grease<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.050> around<00:02:56.050> the

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
of dielectric grease on it around the

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.260 
of dielectric grease on it around the
boot<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.650> on<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.890> top<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.400> porcelain<00:02:57.940> of

boot and on the top on the porcelain of

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.600 
boot and on the top on the porcelain of
the<00:02:58.330> spark<00:02:58.630> plug<00:02:58.890> makes<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.040> easy<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> furry

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the spark plug makes it easy to furry

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.570 
the spark plug makes it easy to furry
removal<00:03:01.180> later<00:03:01.300> on
