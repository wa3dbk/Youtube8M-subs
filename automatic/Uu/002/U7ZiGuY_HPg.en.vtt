00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.139
 and that's obviously the art of knowing 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.619

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.820

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.029
 fries 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.380
 two years ago I always wanted to 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.959

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.160
