00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.500
 the huge asparagus sprout out of the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.889
 earth especially in the north of germany 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 Around 25,000 wind turbines are already available 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.530
 land and the expansion continues 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.330
 Ahead 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.859
 but how safe are they? 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.140
 generated monstrous stream 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 more and more people are wondering about that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 all in high pritz in mecklenburg 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.410
 pomeranian two weeks ago started there 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.410
 Pinwheel fire became a huge one 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.790
 flamethrower apparently not a single case 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.940
 sylvia bleÃŸmann the machine shop completely 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.230
 burnt out a wing broken off 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.000
 wind turbines are today small power stations 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 in the sky why it is here in high pritz 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.989
 suddenly burned is still unclear the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.000
 operators of such systems are in the 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.739
 generally well insured the wind turbine 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
 and everything that happens around it 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 if it burns down the wings 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
 should fall or be part of one 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.250
 burning wing and it happened 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.440
 he is of course a fire damage 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.300
 insured in such a case is called 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.289
 the official strategy is controlled 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.820
 let it burn 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.530
 The fire department can often only pass out 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 Of course you would like to see something 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.519
 Do act but in such a case is 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.979
 of course, the danger that someone 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.510
 injured is too big there are none 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.979
 hub rescue at this altitude that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 means no turntable or other 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
 we have to eat on falling parts 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.400
 Make sure that no harm is done to you 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.590
 can come in many oil 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.299
 gear plastic at the gondola to the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.369
 wings and even if fires in 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.200
 Wind turbines are very rare alone 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
 six times in the newspaper 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.799
 last year about the celebration torches up 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.409
 the fields in the summer also to 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.540
 Surface fires could cause wind turbines 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.079
 are getting higher and always come 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.689
 closer 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.000
 only 780 meters away is the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.650
 first windmill of otto press teens farm 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 since the plant burned nearby 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.009
 he does not feel safe anymore 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.610
 who wonders who his house 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.439
 the operators are not protected 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.880
 responsible for the maximum 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.100
 security of the population of 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.240
 plots of land and our nature 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.649
 to take care of course 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.960
 I do not really care about that 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.790
 known control and maintenance are 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.500
 standard but no operator needs 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.689
 prove if he also fulfills his obligations 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.520
 Compliance is not standard 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.799
 automatic extinguishing systems 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.289
 although there are technical solutions like these 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.090
 The legislature only writes in 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.760
 such as near by 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.379
 such extinguishing systems before the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.220
 Operators lack the high cost 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.060
 the incentive if it theoretically one 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.250
 insurance bonus to 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.420
 example would give to such plants 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.730
 I could possibly equip myself 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.980
 imagine that there is a large number 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.750
 Equipment can equip with technology 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.489
 and remote monitoring are getting better 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.349
 but whether the maintenance intervals too 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.209
 always be controlled 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.870
 nobody as long as the wind wheels on 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.870
 turn sky
