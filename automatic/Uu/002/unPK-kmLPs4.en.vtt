or just hit minus on the keyboard and we

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.250 
or just hit minus on the keyboard and we
don't<00:02:37.549> need<00:02:37.670> these<00:02:37.879> guys<00:02:37.940> anymore<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.840> we<00:02:39.140> can

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
don't need these guys anymore so we can

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.380 
don't need these guys anymore so we can
just<00:02:39.409> delete<00:02:39.620> those<00:02:40.480> ok<00:02:41.480> we're<00:02:41.750> almost<00:02:41.959> there

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
just delete those ok we're almost there

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.460 
just delete those ok we're almost there
just<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.569> move<00:02:44.750> this<00:02:44.930> up<00:02:44.989> a<00:02:45.230> little<00:02:45.319> bit

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
just going to move this up a little bit

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.250 
just going to move this up a little bit
so<00:02:45.709> we<00:02:45.799> can<00:02:45.920> see<00:02:46.160> better<00:02:46.840> now<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> don't<00:02:48.140> really

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
so we can see better now I don't really

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.530 
so we can see better now I don't really
like<00:02:48.500> how<00:02:48.769> these<00:02:48.980> edges<00:02:49.519> aren't<00:02:49.790> nice<00:02:50.180> and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
like how these edges aren't nice and

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.080 
like how these edges aren't nice and
rounded<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.260> smooth<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:52.099> we<00:02:52.129> can<00:02:52.489> change<00:02:52.760> that

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
rounded and smooth so we can change that

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.550 
rounded and smooth so we can change that
the<00:02:53.930> first<00:02:54.170> thing<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.440> like<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> do<00:02:55.129> is<00:02:56.560> drag

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
the first thing I like to do is drag

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.500 
the first thing I like to do is drag
from<00:02:58.459> our<00:02:58.700> ruler<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.500> guideline<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:02.090> that<00:03:02.269> both

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
from our ruler a guideline so that both

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
from our ruler a guideline so that both
sides<00:03:02.569> will<00:03:03.230> be<00:03:03.379> totally<00:03:04.099> even<00:03:05.410> then<00:03:06.410> I'm

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
sides will be totally even then I'm

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.349 
sides will be totally even then I'm
going<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.769> use<00:03:06.950> my<00:03:07.190> direct<00:03:07.819> selection<00:03:08.180> tool

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
going to use my direct selection tool

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:14.710 
going to use my direct selection tool
again<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:11.540> drag<00:03:12.489> this<00:03:13.489> handle<00:03:14.120> down<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
again and just drag this handle down and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.420 
again and just drag this handle down and
that's<00:03:14.840> going<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.139> round<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:15.919> curve<00:03:16.220> a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
that's going to round out that curve a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.990 
that's going to round out that curve a
little<00:03:16.549> bit<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:18.380> do<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.739> same<00:03:19.010> on<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.970> other

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
little bit and do the same on the other

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.250 
little bit and do the same on the other
side<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:25.400> we<00:03:25.579> go

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
side there we go

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.349 
side there we go
and<00:03:27.260> now<00:03:27.380> we<00:03:27.440> have<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> perfect<00:03:28.099> art<00:03:28.370> now<00:03:29.209> if

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
and now we have a perfect art now if

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.780 
and now we have a perfect art now if
that's<00:03:29.569> a<00:03:29.870> little<00:03:30.079> too<00:03:30.230> round<00:03:30.709> for<00:03:31.190> your<00:03:31.400> taste

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
that's a little too round for your taste

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.030 
that's a little too round for your taste
we<00:03:32.660> can<00:03:32.810> use<00:03:32.989> our<00:03:33.169> direct<00:03:33.500> selection<00:03:33.859> tool

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
we can use our direct selection tool

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.800 
we can use our direct selection tool
again<00:03:35.680> choose<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.980> point<00:03:37.400> and<00:03:37.669> store<00:03:38.630> it

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
again choose this point and store it

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.589 
again choose this point and store it
hold<00:03:39.079> down<00:03:39.230> shift<00:03:39.650> and<00:03:39.950> stretch<00:03:40.609> out<00:03:40.849> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140 
shaped arts where I can kind of
manipulate<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:51.769> shape<00:03:52.010> a<00:03:52.190> little<00:03:52.220> bit<00:03:52.489> so

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.319 
manipulate the shape a little bit so
it's<00:03:53.359> not<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.410> perfect<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.519> feels<00:03:58.879> a<00:03:59.150> little
