 hello everyone I 'm working with windows 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.670
 and today I 'm going to show you how 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.190
 uninstall any version of 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.529
 internet explorer in any version 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.320
 of windows can be windows xp windows 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.600
 7 windows 8 or windows 8 internet point 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.830
 explorer is therefore all is perfect what 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.420
 first thing we would have to do would be 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.890
 go to the control panel I have it here 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.289
 since I have windows 8 and I 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.079
 we would give to uninstall a program now 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.989
 in windows 7 and in windows xp we would give 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.030
 to see installed updates and here 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:40.210
 we would appear internet explorer in 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.040
 your case on 8 or 9 or whatever and it 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.170
 we would give right button uninstall 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.739
 perfect there would already be uninstalled 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.690
 for that is the video for those who have 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.670
 windows xp or windows 7 for those who 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.809
 Windows 8 are like me you 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.660
 we would have to give activate or deactivate 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.430
 the features of windows and here 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.440
 we would look for the internet explorer in my 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.660
 case would be the internet is the internet 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.550
 explorer 11 and we would give it to unmark 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.199
 here you put and disable interests but the 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.820
 11 may be affected other 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.680
 windows features and programs 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.810
 installed on it 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.650
 including the default configuration 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.930
 I give myself and I will accept 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.030
 perfect now says find files 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.410
 looking for necessary files when there 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.520
 delayed this process that takes quite 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.660
 we would give it a restart now since 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.250
 will tell windows full the changes 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.960
 requested windows will have to network 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.940
 start the equipment to finish the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.520
 installation we would give you to restart 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.410
 now and already uninstall completely 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.180
