00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599

gameplay yeah I know right now i'm using
the<00:00:09.690> Uzi<00:00:10.019> but<00:00:10.230> i<00:00:10.500> think<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.490> actual<00:00:12.030> streak<00:00:12.690> i

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
the Uzi but i think the actual streak i

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.570 
the Uzi but i think the actual streak i
get<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.380> only<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> model<00:00:14.340> i<00:00:14.400> don't

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
get on is only with the model i don't

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.390 
get on is only with the model i don't
think<00:00:14.700> i<00:00:14.759> end<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:14.940> using<00:00:15.179> any<00:00:15.690> easy<00:00:16.289> at<00:00:16.410> all<00:00:16.529> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
think i end up using any easy at all so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.730 
think i end up using any easy at all so
this<00:00:18.060> was<00:00:18.210> actually<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:19.289> will<00:00:19.439> probably<00:00:19.619> go

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
this was actually this will probably go

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.679 
this was actually this will probably go
down<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.189> history<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.609> one<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.880> my<00:00:21.060> best<00:00:21.449> nukes

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
and as you can see right there the power

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.730 
and as you can see right there the power
of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.880> models<00:00:24.269> uh<00:00:24.480> if<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.470> guys<00:00:25.590> have

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.810 
followed me since the mana work for two
days<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.560> that's<00:00:28.650> quite<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.279> few<00:00:29.490> years<00:00:29.640> ago

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
days and that's quite a few years ago

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.700 
days and that's quite a few years ago
you<00:00:30.599> know<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> models<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.500> always

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you know that the models have always

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.799 
you know that the models have always
been<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:31.949> go-to<00:00:32.189> weapons<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:32.969> game<00:00:33.210> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
been my go-to weapons in this game I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.870 
been my go-to weapons in this game I
think<00:00:34.050> right<00:00:34.770> when<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.980> got<00:00:35.100> model<00:00:35.399> 42<00:00:35.579> when<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
think right when I got model 42 when I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.479 
think right when I got model 42 when I
was<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> noob<00:00:36.420> even<00:00:37.260> then<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.980> always

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
was a noob even then like I always

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.950 
was a noob even then like I always
wanted<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> get<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.120> models<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.780> heard

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
wanted to get the models because I heard

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.479 
wanted to get the models because I heard
about<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.320> good<00:00:40.530> they<00:00:40.710> were<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> don't

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
about how good they were if you don't

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.740 
about how good they were if you don't
remember<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> models<00:00:42.210> were<00:00:42.329> insanely

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
remember the models were insanely

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.319 
remember the models were insanely
overpowered<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.710> point<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> always

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
overpowered at one point and I always

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.270 
overpowered at one point and I always
wanted<00:00:45.719> them<00:00:45.899> because<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.680> wanted<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.980> try<00:00:47.129> them

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
wanted them because I wanted to try them

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
wanted them because I wanted to try them
out<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> remember<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.420> sucked<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
out and then I remember I sucked so it

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.779 
out and then I remember I sucked so it
took<00:00:49.620> me<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> long<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.160> love<00:00:50.340> LA<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:50.550> then

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
took me a long time to love LA but then

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
took me a long time to love LA but then
by<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.969> time<00:00:51.090> i<00:00:51.300> leveled<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> they<00:00:52.320> were

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
by the time i leveled up the they were

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.950 
by the time i leveled up the they were
patched<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.090> all<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.690> time

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
patched so it was like all that time

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
patched so it was like all that time
wasted<00:00:55.670> but<00:00:56.670> uh<00:00:56.730> either<00:00:57.390> way<00:00:57.690> right<00:00:57.719> when<00:00:58.050> i

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
wasted but uh either way right when i

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
wasted but uh either way right when i
unlock<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.770> actually<00:00:58.949> still<00:00:59.280> used<00:00:59.640> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
get on this game if you know i'm

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.850 
get on this game if you know i'm
thinking<00:01:33.060> about<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> shotgun<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.900> put<00:01:34.200> i<00:01:34.439> always

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
thinking about a shotgun to put i always

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
thinking about a shotgun to put i always
run<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> models<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.900> it's<00:01:36.900> always<00:01:37.079> bothered

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
run the models and it's always bothered

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.050 
run the models and it's always bothered
me<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.829> people<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.400> models<00:01:38.850> especially

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
me the way people use models especially

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
me the way people use models especially
after<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.780> got<00:01:39.930> patched<00:01:40.229> especially<00:01:40.950> when

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
after they got patched especially when

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.520 
after they got patched especially when
they<00:01:41.130> were<00:01:41.460> they<00:01:41.610> weren't<00:01:41.820> patch<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.530> people

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
they were they weren't patch to people

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
they were they weren't patch to people
have<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.829> thing<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.909> only<00:01:45.119> double

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
have this thing that they only double

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.940 
have this thing that they only double
shoot<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> models<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.680> really

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
shoot the models and that's really

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
shoot the models and that's really
stupid<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:48.090> always<00:01:48.780> viewed<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.409> models<00:01:49.770> as<00:01:49.979> a

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
stupid I always viewed the models as a

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.160 
stupid I always viewed the models as a
similar<00:01:50.820> weapon<00:01:51.119> as<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> black<00:01:51.899> ops<00:01:52.110> 1

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
similar weapon as the black ops 1

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
similar weapon as the black ops 1
Olympia<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.579> guys<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> watch

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
Olympia and you guys know if you watch

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
Olympia and you guys know if you watch
my<00:01:54.479> black<00:01:55.020> ops<00:01:55.170> 1<00:01:55.290> videos<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:56.250> use<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
my black ops 1 videos that i use the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.780 
my black ops 1 videos that i use the
olympia<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> lot<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.159> feel<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.579> they're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
olympia a lot so I feel like they're

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.300 
olympia a lot so I feel like they're
very<00:02:00.000> similar<00:02:00.680> because<00:02:01.680> it's<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.189> have

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
very similar because it's like you have

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
very similar because it's like you have
two<00:02:02.549> quick<00:02:02.909> shots<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:03.960> right

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
two quick shots that you have all right

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.929 
two quick shots that you have all right
and<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:05.040> really<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.430> think<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.729> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
and you really have to think about the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.850 
and you really have to think about the
way<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.119> use<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:07.110> only<00:02:07.290> shoot<00:02:07.560> one

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
way you use them you can only shoot one

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.440 
way you use them you can only shoot one
and<00:02:08.280> it's<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.789> same<00:02:08.970> with<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> Olympia

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and it's like the same with the Olympia

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
and it's like the same with the Olympia
you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.629> only<00:02:09.720> shoot<00:02:09.899> one<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.440> then<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.129> know

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
you can only shoot one and then you know

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.589 
you can only shoot one and then you know
you<00:02:11.310> got<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.550> take<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:11.970> risk<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.450> whether

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
you got to take that risk of whether

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.520 
you got to take that risk of whether
you're<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> get<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.200> one

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
you're going to get that one

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.160 
you're going to get that one
shot<00:02:13.709> or<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.520> could<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:15.480> double<00:02:15.930> tot

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
shot or you could just do double tot

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.230 
shot or you could just do double tot
double<00:02:16.650> shoot<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.459> Olympia<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.030> then<00:02:18.120> you

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
double shoot the Olympia and then you

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.120 
double shoot the Olympia and then you
you're<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.110> much<00:02:19.230> guaranteed<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.740> kill<00:02:19.920> I

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
you're pretty much guaranteed a kill I

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.410 
you're pretty much guaranteed a kill I
think<00:02:20.610> it's<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:20.819> similar<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
think it's really similar with the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.580 
think it's really similar with the
models<00:02:21.750> in<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:21.930> game<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> know<00:02:22.350> you<00:02:22.410> could

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
models in this game you know you could

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.680 
models in this game you know you could
shoot<00:02:22.770> once<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> risk<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.910> dying<00:02:24.180> or

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
shoot once and then the risk of dying or

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.890 
shoot once and then the risk of dying or
you<00:02:25.050> could<00:02:25.260> shoot<00:02:25.950> twice<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.580> then<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.750> know

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you could shoot twice and then you know

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.360 
you could shoot twice and then you know
you<00:02:27.959> definitely<00:02:28.530> cleaned<00:02:28.950> him<00:02:29.069> up<00:02:29.160> on<00:02:29.310> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you definitely cleaned him up on that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.940 
you definitely cleaned him up on that
second<00:02:29.819> shot<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> yeah<00:02:31.290> that's<00:02:31.650> just<00:02:31.890> my

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
second shot so yeah that's just my

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.990 
second shot so yeah that's just my
recommendation<00:02:32.130> if<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> guys<00:02:32.819> are<00:02:32.970> ever

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
recommendation if you guys are ever

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.270 
recommendation if you guys are ever
going<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.420> hop<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.750> mono<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.110> four<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.410> use<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
going to hop on mono or four to use the

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.820 
going to hop on mono or four to use the
models<00:02:35.640> never<00:02:35.970> double<00:02:36.330> shoot<00:02:36.540> only<00:02:36.830> single

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
models never double shoot only single

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
models never double shoot only single
shoot<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.340> then<00:02:39.120> use<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> other<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.840> I

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
shoot then then use the other one I

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.300 
shoot then then use the other one I
think<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:40.680> just<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.890> better<00:02:41.010> strategy

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
think that's just a better strategy

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.250 
think that's just a better strategy
because<00:02:41.730> if<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.360> don't<00:02:42.540> clean<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> guy<00:02:42.959> up<00:02:43.140> on

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
because if you don't clean the guy up on

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.449 
because if you don't clean the guy up on
that<00:02:43.350> first<00:02:43.590> shot<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:44.010> can<00:02:44.100> always<00:02:44.280> finish

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that first shot you can always finish

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.949 
that first shot you can always finish
him<00:02:44.700> off<00:02:44.819> on<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.120> second<00:02:45.420> shot<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.720> always

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
him off on the second shot I always

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.440 
him off on the second shot I always
thought<00:02:46.110> that<00:02:46.170> was<00:02:46.410> interesting<00:02:46.940> nice<00:02:47.940> Josiah

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
thought that was interesting nice Josiah

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.699 
thought that was interesting nice Josiah
we<00:02:48.630> thought<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.050> good<00:02:49.200> strategy<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
we thought that was a good strategy to

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.930 
we thought that was a good strategy to
use<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.130> worked<00:02:50.459> really<00:02:50.580> well<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:50.790> me

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
use it's worked really well for me

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.640 
use it's worked really well for me
because<00:02:51.180> I've<00:02:51.269> done<00:02:51.989> I've<00:02:52.140> gotten<00:02:52.410> really

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
because I've done I've gotten really

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.270 
because I've done I've gotten really
insane<00:02:53.010> game<00:02:53.250> plays<00:02:53.519> with<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.790> model<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
insane game plays with the model I

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.890 
insane game plays with the model I
remember<00:02:56.280> one<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.459> my<00:02:56.640> videos<00:02:57.090> i<00:02:57.360> posted<00:02:57.390> back

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
remember one of my videos i posted back

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.229 
remember one of my videos i posted back
in<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.110> day<00:02:58.230> was<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.440> 30<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:58.980> seven<00:02:59.459> which<00:03:00.060> for
