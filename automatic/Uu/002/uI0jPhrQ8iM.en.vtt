00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.919
 hello and welcome to this video where 

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:09.340
 I'm going to do a colorful manicure with 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:11.590
 sponge you will see how simple it is and how 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.810
 although we do not know much about design of 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.180
 nails do something different beyond 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.710
 paint us what a normal tone we're going to 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.740
 celebrations because it's very simple very 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:23.170
 easy and you do not need almost any 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.000
 material of any material I mean 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.030
 so exceptional glazes obviously 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.340
 well then what we are going to need 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.980
 it's just going to be for touch-ups 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.129
 final nail polish remover and a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.429
 little stick and as for enamel what 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.469
 only thing we're going to need is going to be a 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.120
 white enamel of any brand I go 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.499
 to use this zinc a color that the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.019
 I really recommend it because it's very 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.670
 baratito and is very good brand apart 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.460
 of the white enamel we're going to have to 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.559
 choose certain colors with which we 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.929
 let's perform the manicure and now yes 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.269
 I can not tell you what visual color 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.519
 I'm going to use purple pink and yellow 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.440
 I'm going to combine them in this way 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.570
 it's worth as they are ladder colors I think 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.250
 I can not be quite well 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.240
 However you must use colors that 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.180
 you want me 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 is from china at six o'clock and well we 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.079
 I recommend either because it's something 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.729
 Quite fond although the quality if it is 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:17.530
 good but good so I have you 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.869
 to say that the value for money 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.180
 maybe it's not worth spending eight 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.399
 euros that is worth in this having those of 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.130
 endless color is worth the quality 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.140
 established that by way of subsection and 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.210
 then nothing is simply from a 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.549
 bazaar but they are pretty pretty 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.289
 pretty then I tell you, I 've 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.420
 chosen three colors because you can see that 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.280
 my nails are not too big they are 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.190
 rather small to enter neither what 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.750
 I can put a lot but if you 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.700
 you have the longest nails you want 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.670
 use more colors or just two 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.350
 colors and choose other colors that do not 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.420
 be these as that is already a bit of 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.090
 your choice is worth I have chosen these 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.119
 three and finally we're going to need a 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.920
 transparent enamel a top coat for 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.390
 put as last layer is worth to give 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.310
 a little bit of brightness and protect us the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.560
 design yes that's also true that this 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.289
 It is optional but I recommend it 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.179
 and we're going to need like not a bit 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.489
 of sponge is worth any sponge that already 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.160
 let's not use what I do is the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.349
 sponges that no longer used labor in 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.860
 pieces to have more bits and pieces 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.760
 use it for nail design worth 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
 so what we are going to do is what 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.410
 next with our white enamel 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.230
 let's put a section of other 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.150
 that we see so that it is uniform in 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.950
 our nail because because the colors are 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.920
 they will notice a lot more on a base 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.680
 white has a normal base then 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.260
 We apply a white base and 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 we wait for it to dry I already expected that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.709
 Dry has already applied the white to me 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.900
 that the video does not become so long 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.269
 then I will move on to how you do what 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.360
 of the colors what I'm going to do is 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.910
 take my little piece of sponge and 1,003 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.560
 nail polish here very pro piquito 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.690
 do because it does not meet even a whole 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.849
 I have to take a little piece that covers me 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.860
 the nail ballet to make it whole then 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.110
 What am I going to do? I'm going to paint a strip 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.819
 of each color that in my case will not be very 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.190
 before but before because I want me 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.510
 fit the three colors on the nail and I 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.400
 I do not have nails 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.849
 but just what I'm going to do is 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:20.480
 apply a line let's say you'll see 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.340
 As for each color, what I do is 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.989
 open the first one is ok because I do not 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.370
 I want it dried up then it's something 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.680
 that I think that the faster 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.709
 let's do better then we have to do it 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.140
 not very fast but often it's worth then 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:39.080
 I less often covering and I put 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.080
 a generous line of rose 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.070
 A) Yes 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.100
 It can be whatever you want, because 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.160
 then it 's excess, the excess is going to 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.350
 eating the sponge is not going to stay in 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.090
 the nails a very large excess all the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.160
 next color but good is that 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.900
 It does not matter that you touch what you already 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.700
 I painted if the yellow touches the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.910
 Rosa, I do not care, it's going to stay 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.930
 montadito and it will not be bad for me 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:12.440
 so good like that and finally I'm going to 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.150
 place the mural you will have to 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.400
 do this with the colors as I said 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.980
 before you have chosen, you will have 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.940
 your preferences or the colors that 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.150
 you want to take at this time 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.430
 well I already have it then now what 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.960
 What I do is put my finger like this 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.300
 this where you think they'll match the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.320
 three colors and apply in my line with 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.320
 a swinging movement 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.830
 and now it's just what I 'm going to 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.050
 to do is what I told you lame themselves 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.810
 nail polish remover because as you see it has come out 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.069
 outside the color and it is normal and a 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.460
 very easy way and it's going to me 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:53.280
 remove I'm going to take my nail polish remover ya 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.199
 I say a normal nail polish and my 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.389
 little nail stick I do not know if 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.539
 you better have this that they are pencils with 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.069
 nail polish remover to remove it to correct 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.110
 let's say the imperfections of when we 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:06.350
 we came out good I do not use it because I 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.960
 it seems that it is 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.910
 not nonsense so it may be more 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.250
 comfortable and especially if we are out of 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.500
 home but I think that everyone is 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.450
 easier than we have a little stick of 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.060
 these normal and nail polish is worth 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.740
 then I do it like that but if you have 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.330
 the requirements these and you want them 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.790
 use then good much more comfortable and 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.410
 much better but good that you know that 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.000
 so you can do then nothing 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.009
 I'm just cleaning it up, you see 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.990
 well it is removed there is no problem 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:38.419
 so I'm cleaning the 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.419
 contour of the nails what has come out 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.870
 and I would be there once I see what's left 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.630
 all right 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.730
 I can now move on to apply the latest 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.170
 layer is worth when it has more or less 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:53.540
 dry does not need to be dry 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.670
 everything as the white base but more or 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.010
 less then let's see what 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.420
 that a little time is already worth 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:01.790
 that is not yet that effect of 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.950
 impairment liquid to apply then 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:07.130
 I put the top coat that will give you a 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.770
 very nice shine and will make me 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:12.560
 last longer my design and good because 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.630
 I would see how easy how fast and this 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.960
 is the result is worth I do not know if it looks 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:19.670
 well maybe in the degraded of 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.070
 colors but you see that they look very good 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.450
 very uniform and good if we painted it 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:27.410
 in all the nails the truth that is going to 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:29.780
 look much better so nothing like 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:33.639
 You see, for example, I just did it 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:37.490
 in another nail with the same one 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:40.920
 and I can do it in the other 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.080
 and you are taught a little what you 

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:45.290
 he said especially in these that looks like this 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.030
 better if you see the difference that was more 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:51.570
 colorful the color here that here that no 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:53.310
 was based then nothing that's the 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.170
 result you see it's easy 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:58.250
 simple and nothing because I hope that I have 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.250
 liked and you put it into practice
