00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
of me has the same exact bike but this

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.680 
of me has the same exact bike but this
is<00:04:24.940> his<00:04:25.060> 2008<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.670> he<00:04:27.670> actually<00:04:28.030> asked<00:04:28.300> me<00:04:28.420> to

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
is his 2008 and he actually asked me to

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.170 
is his 2008 and he actually asked me to
test<00:04:29.140> ride<00:04:29.320> it<00:04:29.410> because<00:04:29.530> he<00:04:29.920> has<00:04:30.610> never<00:04:30.850> owned

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
test ride it because he has never owned

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.450 
test ride it because he has never owned
or<00:04:31.420> ridden<00:04:31.780> motorcycles<00:04:31.900> before<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.340> he

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
or ridden motorcycles before so he

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.970 
or ridden motorcycles before so he
wasn't<00:04:33.700> really<00:04:33.880> sure<00:04:34.180> what<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.870> expect<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.710> I

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
wasn't really sure what to expect and I

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.280 
wasn't really sure what to expect and I
mean<00:04:36.340> I'm<00:04:36.430> not<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:37.000> either<00:04:37.180> but<00:04:37.570> I've<00:04:37.810> ride<00:04:38.110> my

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
mean I'm not so either but I've ride my

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.750 
mean I'm not so either but I've ride my
bike<00:04:38.470> for<00:04:38.650> a<00:04:38.710> long<00:04:38.770> time<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.340> I<00:04:39.370> just<00:04:39.550> was

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
bike for a long time so I just was

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.750 
bike for a long time so I just was
comparing<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.420> and<00:04:40.890> his<00:04:41.890> bike<00:04:42.130> definitely

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
comparing it and his bike definitely

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.090 
comparing it and his bike definitely
felt<00:04:43.120> like<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.540> was<00:04:43.690> used<00:04:43.930> a<00:04:44.230> lot<00:04:44.260> more<00:04:44.800> than<00:04:44.950> my

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
felt like it was used a lot more than my

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.590 
felt like it was used a lot more than my
mine<00:04:45.630> suspended<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.750> lot<00:04:46.780> softer<00:04:47.170> the<00:04:48.480> you<00:04:49.480> know

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
mine suspended a lot softer the you know

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.120 
mine suspended a lot softer the you know
the<00:04:49.720> throttle<00:04:50.110> and<00:04:50.200> my<00:04:50.350> bike<00:04:50.560> is<00:04:50.740> a<00:04:50.800> lot<00:04:50.920> more

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
the throttle and my bike is a lot more

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.730 
the throttle and my bike is a lot more
sensitive<00:04:51.400> in<00:04:51.700> his<00:04:51.880> my<00:04:52.570> idols<00:04:52.930> my<00:04:53.320> idol<00:04:53.620> was

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
sensitive in his my idols my idol was

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.200 
sensitive in his my idols my idol was
actually<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.130> lot<00:04:54.310> higher<00:04:54.520> than<00:04:54.580> his<00:04:55.030> because

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
actually a lot higher than his because

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.240 
actually a lot higher than his because
his<00:04:55.510> actually<00:04:56.050> had<00:04:56.170> a<00:04:56.200> hard<00:04:56.530> time<00:04:56.560> starting<00:04:57.010> X

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
his actually had a hard time starting X

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.770 
his actually had a hard time starting X
is<00:04:57.430> probably<00:04:57.760> so<00:04:57.970> low<00:04:58.030> and<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.360> had<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.510> hard<00:04:58.720> time

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
is probably so low and I had a hard time

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.880 
is probably so low and I had a hard time
keeping<00:04:59.320> in<00:04:59.590> neutral<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:01.240> then<00:05:02.230> if<00:05:02.350> his<00:05:02.440> rpms

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
keeping in neutral and then if his rpms

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.530 
keeping in neutral and then if his rpms
got<00:05:03.160> to<00:05:03.310> hide<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.850> bike<00:05:04.000> down<00:05:04.330> him<00:05:04.600> so<00:05:06.270> but<00:05:07.270> his

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
got to hide the bike down him so but his

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.540 
got to hide the bike down him so but his
his<00:05:08.080> bike<00:05:08.350> he<00:05:08.590> got<00:05:08.800> for<00:05:09.160> about<00:05:09.490> $1000<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.300> think

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
his bike he got for about $1000 I think

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.980 
his bike he got for about $1000 I think
it's<00:05:12.550> it's<00:05:12.910> still<00:05:13.120> it's<00:05:13.420> still<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.600> good<00:05:13.750> bike

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
it's it's still it's still a good bike

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.620 
it's it's still it's still a good bike

but you can tell it's definitely used a

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.050 
but you can tell it's definitely used a
lot<00:05:16.780> more<00:05:17.020> than<00:05:17.310> what<00:05:18.310> might<00:05:18.490> bikes<00:05:18.700> been<00:05:18.880> used

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
lot more than what might bikes been used

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.330 
lot more than what might bikes been used

whole lot cheaper I personally did not

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.750 
whole lot cheaper I personally did not
like<00:05:34.960> that<00:05:35.200> style<00:05:35.440> bike<00:05:35.860> because<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.640> the

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
like that style bike because of the

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.460 
like that style bike because of the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
I'm disused to having the position more

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.460 
I'm disused to having the position more
upright<00:05:48.880> or<00:05:49.000> forward<00:05:49.420> than<00:05:49.690> having<00:05:50.080> laid<00:05:50.260> back

upright or forward than having laid back

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.140 
upright or forward than having laid back
and<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:50.830> think<00:05:51.040> that's<00:05:51.190> why<00:05:51.340> I<00:05:51.370> like<00:05:51.550> the<00:05:51.970> bike

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.970 
and I think that's why I like the bike
there<00:05:52.390> right<00:05:52.630> now<00:05:52.810> because<00:05:53.350> I<00:05:53.650> feel<00:05:53.680> more

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
there right now because I feel more

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.510 
there right now because I feel more
comfortable<00:05:54.370> in<00:05:54.580> this<00:05:54.700> position<00:05:56.520> actually

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 
comfortable in this position actually

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.820 
comfortable in this position actually
what<00:05:57.880> you're<00:05:57.970> seeing<00:05:58.210> right<00:05:58.300> now<00:05:58.450> it's<00:05:59.200> the

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
what you're seeing right now it's the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:02.160 
what you're seeing right now it's the
road<00:06:00.040> is<00:06:00.160> called<00:06:00.510> mysterious<00:06:01.510> Road<00:06:01.870> or

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.170 
road is called mysterious Road or

road is called mysterious Road or
mystery<00:06:02.500> Road<00:06:02.710> and<00:06:03.010> what's<00:06:03.610> actually

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
mystery Road and what's actually

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.969 
mystery Road and what's actually
interesting<00:06:04.210> is<00:06:04.690> only<00:06:04.810> like<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> few<00:06:05.290> places<00:06:05.560> in

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
interesting is only like a few places in

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.800 
interesting is only like a few places in
the<00:06:06.070> world<00:06:06.250> that<00:06:06.610> has<00:06:06.790> this<00:06:07.030> but<00:06:07.270> you're<00:06:07.390> going

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
the world that has this but you're going

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.620 
the world that has this but you're going
uphill<00:06:08.020> but<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> gravity<00:06:09.160> is<00:06:09.280> pushing<00:06:09.640> you

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
uphill but the gravity is pushing you

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.420 
uphill but the gravity is pushing you
so<00:06:10.750> realistically<00:06:11.440> if<00:06:11.560> your<00:06:11.770> car<00:06:12.250> is<00:06:12.400> in

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
so realistically if your car is in

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:13.740 
so realistically if your car is in
neutral<00:06:12.849> like<00:06:13.030> with<00:06:13.150> the<00:06:13.210> cars<00:06:13.419> that<00:06:13.599> they're

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
neutral like with the cars that they're

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.249 
neutral like with the cars that they're
doing<00:06:13.960> or<00:06:14.229> my<00:06:14.349> bikes<00:06:14.620> neutral<00:06:15.099> you're<00:06:16.259> rolling

doing or my bikes neutral you're rolling

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.499 
doing or my bikes neutral you're rolling
uphill<00:06:17.530> without<00:06:18.430> any<00:06:18.610> pressure<00:06:18.880> it<00:06:19.330> was

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
uphill without any pressure it was

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.779 
uphill without any pressure it was
really<00:06:20.020> really<00:06:20.169> cool<00:06:20.380> actually<00:06:20.800> I<00:06:21.039> would
