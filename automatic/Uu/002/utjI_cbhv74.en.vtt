00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.300
 For children who lost school bags due to the earthquake 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.040
 The bag manufacturing company sends school bags at the evacuation site 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.259
 is 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:10.929
 Besides offering new items to new students 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:14.510
 It was pointed out from the children of the whole country to the upper grade children 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.159
 School bags are delivered 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:19.160
 By damage of earthquake and tsunami 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.250
 I have lost or disabled my school bag 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.220
 For the fallen children 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.509
 If midfield production company strengthens 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.849
 3,000 new school bags 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.899
 Sent to new first graders and second graders 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.999
 What is needed more than that is the children of the upper grades 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:37.790
 It is a school bag 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.380
 So I called for a stop preferred by this company 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.490
 Around 10,000 used school bags from all over Japan 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.860
 About the number of registrants who prepared in case of shortage 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 30,000 school bags have become available 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.050
 In the third grade, repair and clean 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.050
 Will be sent to the children 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.220
 Some of these school bags are children's activities and stationery 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.630
 It means that there are many things that contain 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.130
 If you still have a son talk to the sport with your son 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.920
 is 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.729
 It is said that we do not want to be known as the victims in a brand new parcel 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.390
 There is a voice of children, but a second-hand product is needed 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.860
 There are also the thoughts of the children who provided the school bags there 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 It is done 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.900
 The children also wanted to do something 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.010
 Yuan it 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.980
 I could do something too 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.640
 So somehow I want them to deliver this and support them 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 By 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.410
 It was because there was no such recognition 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.280
 Heart connection between children 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.920
 I wanted to take care of this 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.490
 Transmissions that have requests from several places including Fukushima Prefecture 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.000
 It means that 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.010
 This company continues 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.690
 People who need medical care in disaster areas and shelters 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.920
