00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
back run the ball on one side the

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.550 
back run the ball on one side the
quarterback<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.700> coming<00:03:49.510> on<00:03:49.600> other<00:03:49.750> side<00:03:50.049> all

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
quarterback is coming on other side all

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.170 
quarterback is coming on other side all
right<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:50.890> I'm<00:03:51.190> gonna<00:03:51.310> go<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.790> side<00:03:51.970> where

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
right so I'm gonna go to the side where

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.640 
right so I'm gonna go to the side where
the<00:03:52.239> quarterback<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.690> most<00:03:53.019> likely<00:03:53.260> going<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
the quarterback is most likely going to

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.920 
the quarterback is most likely going to
take<00:03:53.890> off<00:03:54.130> too<00:03:54.370> all<00:03:54.609> right<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.150> what<00:03:55.540> I'll<00:03:55.690> do

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
take off too all right and what I'll do

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.440 
take off too all right and what I'll do
is<00:03:56.109> I'll<00:03:56.260> play<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.709> in<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.250> I'll<00:03:58.180> come

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
is I'll play that in and I'll come

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.630 
is I'll play that in and I'll come
across<00:03:58.810> myself<00:03:59.410> and<00:03:59.650> play<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.220> quarterback

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
across myself and play the quarterback

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.020 
across myself and play the quarterback
so<00:04:01.299> it's<00:04:01.540> not<00:04:01.600> really<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.079> hard<00:04:02.440> way<00:04:02.739> to<00:04:02.769> do<00:04:03.730> is

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
so it's not really a hard way to do is

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.569 
so it's not really a hard way to do is
not<00:04:04.209> really<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:04.510> hard<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:05.049> defend<00:04:05.440> it<00:04:05.650> but<00:04:06.519> a

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
not really that hard to defend it but a

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.830 
not really that hard to defend it but a
lot<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.820> guys<00:04:07.060> don't<00:04:07.299> like<00:04:07.480> the<00:04:07.600> fact<00:04:07.750> that
