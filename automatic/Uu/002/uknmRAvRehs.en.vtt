00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
calculate weight base we're supposed to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.880 
calculate weight base we're supposed to
utilize<00:03:16.730> zero<00:03:17.180> point<00:03:17.480> whatever<00:03:17.900> it<00:03:18.110> is<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.560> we

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
utilize zero point whatever it is and we

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.530 
utilize zero point whatever it is and we
really<00:03:19.220> get<00:03:19.340> kind<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.670> hung<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.030> on<00:03:20.180> that

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
really get kind of hung up on that

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.600 
really get kind of hung up on that
so<00:03:20.780> instead<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.590> have<00:03:21.770> all<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.100> listed<00:03:22.490> out

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
so instead we have all that listed out

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.220 
so instead we have all that listed out
for<00:03:22.880> us<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.060> this<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:23.660> really<00:03:23.840> a<00:03:23.990> great

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
for us and this is really a great

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.020 
for us and this is really a great
benefit<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.830> deliver<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.310> appropriate<00:03:25.400> dose

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
benefit to deliver the appropriate dose

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.180 
benefit to deliver the appropriate dose
and<00:03:26.300> to<00:03:26.720> reduce<00:03:27.050> those<00:03:27.230> common<00:03:27.650> medication

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
and to reduce those common medication

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.560 
and to reduce those common medication
errors<00:03:28.460> when<00:03:28.760> it<00:03:28.850> comes<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.150> dealing<00:03:29.450> with<00:03:29.480> our

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
errors when it comes to dealing with our

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.870 
errors when it comes to dealing with our
pediatric<00:03:29.930> patients<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:31.460> know<00:03:31.550> one<00:03:31.700> of<00:03:31.730> the

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
pediatric patients you know one of the

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.580 
pediatric patients you know one of the
components<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.480> dealing<00:03:32.780> with<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.930> pediatric

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
components of dealing with a pediatric

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.930 
components of dealing with a pediatric
patient<00:03:33.620> is<00:03:34.040> that<00:03:34.220> we<00:03:34.310> have<00:03:34.460> to<00:03:34.580> give<00:03:34.700> weight

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
patient is that we have to give weight

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.790 
patient is that we have to give weight
based<00:03:35.180> medications<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.080> there's<00:03:36.590> really

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
based medications and there's really

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.560 
based medications and there's really
eight<00:03:37.130> common<00:03:37.610> medications<00:03:38.210> that<00:03:38.300> we're

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
eight common medications that we're

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.820 
eight common medications that we're
going<00:03:38.690> to<00:03:38.750> give<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.900> patients<00:03:39.470> whether<00:03:39.590> it's

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
going to give to patients whether it's

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.770 
going to give to patients whether it's
pediatric<00:03:40.400> arrest<00:03:40.700> or<00:03:41.060> whether<00:03:41.210> it's<00:03:41.420> medical

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
pediatric arrest or whether it's medical

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.750 
pediatric arrest or whether it's medical
emergencies<00:03:42.350> and<00:03:42.620> we<00:03:42.920> need<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.220> be<00:03:43.340> able<00:03:43.490> to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
emergencies and we need to be able to

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.330 
emergencies and we need to be able to
figure<00:03:43.940> out<00:03:44.270> what<00:03:44.720> those<00:03:44.900> doses<00:03:45.380> are<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.190> let

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340

starting with your thumb what you want
to<00:04:17.989> do<00:04:18.109> is<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> patient's<00:04:18.799> age<00:04:18.950> 1<00:04:19.549> 3<00:04:20.060> 5<00:04:20.450> 7<00:04:20.510> &amp;<00:04:21.200> 9

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
to do is the patient's age 1 3 5 7 &amp; 9

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.230 
to do is the patient's age 1 3 5 7 &amp; 9
the<00:04:21.680> next<00:04:22.430> thing<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.640> want<00:04:22.670> to<00:04:22.880> do<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.150> you

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
the next thing you want to do is you

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.030 
the next thing you want to do is you
want<00:04:23.419> to<00:04:23.450> be<00:04:23.570> able<00:04:23.660> to<00:04:23.780> calculate<00:04:24.050> the<00:04:24.860> weight

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
want to be able to calculate the weight

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.870 
want to be able to calculate the weight
so<00:04:25.700> you<00:04:25.760> start<00:04:26.060> off<00:04:26.120> with<00:04:26.360> 10<00:04:26.630> 15<00:04:27.080> 20<00:04:27.800> 25<00:04:27.980> and<00:04:28.640> 30

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
so you start off with 10 15 20 25 and 30

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.540 
so you start off with 10 15 20 25 and 30
kilos<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:30.020> knowing<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:31.130> can<00:04:31.340> calculate

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
kilos so knowing that you can calculate

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.730 
kilos so knowing that you can calculate
the<00:04:31.910> 8<00:04:32.180> most<00:04:32.480> common<00:04:32.990> drugs<00:04:33.230> used<00:04:33.590> in

the 8 most common drugs used in

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.370 
the 8 most common drugs used in
pediatric<00:04:34.610> arrest<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.180> well<00:04:35.690> as<00:04:35.900> pediatric

and<00:04:36.860> medical<00:04:37.190> situations<00:04:37.820> well<00:04:38.540> let's<00:04:38.690> look

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
and medical situations well let's look

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.840 
and medical situations well let's look
it<00:04:38.960> up<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.169> nephron<00:04:39.440> 1<00:04:39.650> to<00:04:39.770> 1,000<00:04:40.370> solution

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
it up a nephron 1 to 1,000 solution

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.400 
it up a nephron 1 to 1,000 solution
let's<00:04:41.330> say<00:04:41.480> we<00:04:41.630> have<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.900> give<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.200> to<00:04:42.260> a

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
let's say we have to give this to a

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.840 
let's say we have to give this to a
five-year-old<00:04:43.010> who's<00:04:43.280> now<00:04:43.430> having<00:04:43.760> an

five-year-old who's now having an
allergic<00:04:44.060> reaction<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.720> a<00:04:44.810> bee<00:04:44.900> sting<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:45.830> if

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
allergic reaction to a bee sting so if

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.010 
allergic reaction to a bee sting so if
we<00:04:46.010> go<00:04:46.160> back<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.400> our<00:04:46.640> hand<00:04:46.880> heavy<00:04:47.120> system<00:04:47.630> we

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
we go back to our hand heavy system we

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.830 
we go back to our hand heavy system we
have<00:04:48.169> 1<00:04:48.500> 3<00:04:48.890> 5<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:49.910> we<00:04:50.030> know<00:04:50.150> that<00:04:50.180> our<00:04:50.419> patient

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
have 1 3 5 so we know that our patient

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.659 
have 1 3 5 so we know that our patient
is<00:04:50.930> 5<00:04:51.140> years<00:04:51.350> old<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.830> if<00:04:52.160> we<00:04:52.280> go<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
is 5 years old and if we go to the

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.510 
is 5 years old and if we go to the
weight<00:04:52.850> base<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:53.300> have<00:04:53.419> 10<00:04:53.720> 15<00:04:54.050> 20<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:55.250> we<00:04:55.370> know

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
weight base we have 10 15 20 so we know

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.460 
weight base we have 10 15 20 so we know
that<00:04:55.669> our<00:04:55.790> patient<00:04:56.150> is<00:04:56.240> 20<00:04:56.540> kilos<00:04:56.960> so

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
that our patient is 20 kilos so

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.070 
that our patient is 20 kilos so
basically<00:04:57.950> the<00:04:58.490> ease<00:04:58.669> of<00:04:58.700> this<00:04:59.120> system<00:04:59.600> is<00:04:59.780> if

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
basically the ease of this system is if

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.930 
basically the ease of this system is if
I<00:05:00.380> go<00:05:00.530> ahead<00:05:00.680> and<00:05:00.860> take<00:05:01.100> the<00:05:01.220> decimal<00:05:01.669> place

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
I go ahead and take the decimal place

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.900 
I go ahead and take the decimal place
and<00:05:02.210> move<00:05:02.390> it<00:05:02.600> to<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:02.990> left<00:05:03.320> two<00:05:04.070> places<00:05:04.280> I'm

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
and move it to the left two places I'm

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.030 
and move it to the left two places I'm
going<00:05:05.090> to<00:05:05.300> give<00:05:05.419> point<00:05:05.810> two<00:05:06.110> milliliters<00:05:06.560> of

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
going to give point two milliliters of

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.250 
going to give point two milliliters of
epinephrine<00:05:07.850> to<00:05:07.970> this<00:05:08.090> patient<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.720> that's

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
epinephrine to this patient and that's

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.260 
epinephrine to this patient and that's
how<00:05:09.440> easy<00:05:09.470> that<00:05:09.980> this<00:05:10.220> system<00:05:10.400> is<00:05:10.730> and<00:05:10.940> it's

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
how easy that this system is and it's

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.540 
how easy that this system is and it's
really<00:05:11.600> revolutionary<00:05:12.380> to<00:05:12.530> use<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:12.980> I'm<00:05:13.280> so

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
really revolutionary to use and I'm so

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:14.530 
really revolutionary to use and I'm so
excited<00:05:13.730> about<00:05:14.150> it

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
excited about it

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.060 
excited about it
why<00:05:14.780> didn't<00:05:15.050> they<00:05:15.140> teach<00:05:15.200> us<00:05:15.500> this<00:05:15.650> in<00:05:15.710> school

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
why didn't they teach us this in school

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.670 
why didn't they teach us this in school
but<00:05:16.430> again<00:05:16.729> it<00:05:17.030> took<00:05:17.270> dr.<00:05:17.479> Entebbe<00:05:18.080> 12<00:05:18.440> years

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
but again it took dr. Entebbe 12 years

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.230 
but again it took dr. Entebbe 12 years
to<00:05:18.830> figure<00:05:19.100> this<00:05:19.190> out<00:05:19.400> and<00:05:19.669> we're<00:05:19.940> excited

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
to figure this out and we're excited

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.520 
to figure this out and we're excited
that<00:05:20.450> he<00:05:20.630> did

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
that he did

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.010 
that he did
the<00:05:22.310> hands<00:05:22.550> heavy<00:05:22.880> pediatric<00:05:23.510> box<00:05:23.750> and

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
the hands heavy pediatric box and

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.140 
the hands heavy pediatric box and
learning<00:05:24.320> method<00:05:24.620> is<00:05:24.770> really<00:05:25.130> revolutionary

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
learning method is really revolutionary

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.700 
learning method is really revolutionary
it's<00:05:26.480> going<00:05:26.750> to<00:05:26.810> change<00:05:27.080> the<00:05:27.320> way<00:05:27.470> that<00:05:27.620> we

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
it's going to change the way that we

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.710 
it's going to change the way that we
deal<00:05:27.890> with<00:05:27.920> pediatric<00:05:28.340> arrests<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:29.480> when<00:05:29.600> you

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
deal with pediatric arrests so when you

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.820 
deal with pediatric arrests so when you
think<00:05:29.870> about<00:05:29.990> it<00:05:30.350> you've<00:05:30.650> got<00:05:30.800> a
