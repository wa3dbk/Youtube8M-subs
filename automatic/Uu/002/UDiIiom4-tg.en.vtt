and go like t-handle there so that's a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.950 
and go like t-handle there so that's a
little<00:01:59.250> up

little up

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.710 
little up
let's<00:02:00.960> move<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.200> one<00:02:01.350> down<00:02:01.850> see<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:02.969> happens

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
let's move it one down see what happens

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.330 
let's move it one down see what happens
and<00:02:05.500> I<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:05.770> that's<00:02:06.070> too<00:02:06.310> low<00:02:07.590> yeah<00:02:08.590> it's<00:02:09.190> too

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
and I think that's too low yeah it's too

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.060 
and I think that's too low yeah it's too
low<00:02:09.490> let's<00:02:10.150> go<00:02:10.270> back<00:02:10.450> up<00:02:12.510> right<00:02:13.510> there<00:02:13.780> and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.470 

push<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.250> flush<00:02:18.580> with<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:19.030> end<00:02:19.180> of<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.420> shift

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
push it flush with the end of the shift

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:32.720 
push it flush with the end of the shift
shaft<00:02:20.820> like<00:02:21.820> so
