it's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> lot<00:01:59.310> more<00:01:59.610> easy<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.969> do<00:02:00.060> on<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> midi

of course the sync button now whether
you<00:02:04.979> love<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> scene<00:02:05.640> button<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.030> whether<00:02:06.210> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
or not now the sync button i think is a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.400 
or not now the sync button i think is a
good<00:02:12.030> point<00:02:12.300> because<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.840> allows<00:02:13.050> it<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.230> them

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
good point because it allows it to them

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.790 
good point because it allows it to them
much<00:02:13.560> more

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
much more

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.040 
much more
of<00:02:13.830> your<00:02:13.980> time<00:02:14.220> doing<00:02:14.880> other<00:02:15.120> things<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.780> song

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
of your time doing other things the song

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.080 
of your time doing other things the song
messing<00:02:16.470> around<00:02:16.560> adding<00:02:17.160> more<00:02:17.250> decks<00:02:17.580> rather

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
messing around adding more decks rather

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.040 
messing around adding more decks rather
than<00:02:18.180> spending<00:02:18.450> your<00:02:18.570> time<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.870> pitch

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
than spending your time of the pitch

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.230 
than spending your time of the pitch
fader<00:02:19.320> matching<00:02:19.980> up<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.100> beat<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.850> now<00:02:21.060> on<00:02:21.180> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
fader matching up the beat and now on to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.640 
fader matching up the beat and now on to
the<00:02:21.270> bad<00:02:21.510> point<00:02:21.780> still<00:02:22.050> talking<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.350> sync

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the bad point still talking about sync

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.320 
the bad point still talking about sync
buttons<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.130> even<00:02:23.940> though<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> sync<00:02:24.300> button

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
buttons here even though the sync button

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
buttons here even though the sync button
is<00:02:24.660> good<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> allows<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.440> spend<00:02:25.680> more<00:02:25.770> time

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
is good it allows you spend more time

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.010 
is good it allows you spend more time
doing<00:02:26.130> other<00:02:26.280> things<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:27.090> bad<00:02:27.420> if<00:02:27.720> you're<00:02:27.990> a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
doing other things it's bad if you're a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.990 
doing other things it's bad if you're a
beginner<00:02:28.230> DJ<00:02:28.740> because<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.190> think<00:02:29.580> personally

beginner DJ because I think personally
and<00:02:30.210> I'm<00:02:30.270> sure<00:02:30.420> many<00:02:30.450> people<00:02:30.840> agree<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:31.380> if

and I'm sure many people agree here if

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.380 
and I'm sure many people agree here if
you're<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> beginner<00:02:32.100> DJ<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.640> need<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.210> learn

you're a beginner DJ you need to learn

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.150 
you're a beginner DJ you need to learn
how<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.660> mix<00:02:33.990> using<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.500> pitch<00:02:34.680> bed<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.100> not

just<00:02:35.310> pressing<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.730> sync<00:02:35.970> button<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.690> an

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
just pressing the sync button it's an

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.210 
just pressing the sync button it's an
art<00:02:37.080> form<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.590> able<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.800> use<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> pitch

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
art form to be able to use the pitch

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.800 
art form to be able to use the pitch
fader<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.580> just<00:02:38.790> mix<00:02:39.120> two<00:02:39.360> songs<00:02:39.600> together

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
fader and just mix two songs together

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.780 
fader and just mix two songs together
really<00:02:40.500> quickly<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.100> be<00:02:41.220> able<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.460> match<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
really quickly and be able to match the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.670 
really quickly and be able to match the
BPM<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.690> think<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.960> sync<00:02:43.200> button<00:02:43.260> is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
BPM and I think the sync button is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.590 
BPM and I think the sync button is
destroying<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.370> art<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.850> making<00:02:45.210> it<00:02:45.330> much

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
destroying that art and making it much

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600 
destroying that art and making it much
more<00:02:45.660> easy<00:02:46.050> for<00:02:46.590> anyone<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> go<00:02:47.220> out<00:02:47.310> there<00:02:47.490> and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
more easy for anyone to go out there and

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
idea how to mix properly because you'll

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.550 
idea how to mix properly because you'll

have no idea how to use the pitch faders

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.350 
have no idea how to use the pitch faders
so<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:25.920> think<00:03:26.040> that's<00:03:26.340> why<00:03:26.610> it's<00:03:26.820> really<00:03:27.060> really

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
so I think that's why it's really really

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.090 
so I think that's why it's really really
important<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.840> able<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.080> just<00:03:28.140> go<00:03:28.739> onto<00:03:28.860> any

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
important to be able to just go onto any

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.040 
important to be able to just go onto any
deck<00:03:29.459> universally<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.540> be<00:03:30.630> able<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.840> mix

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050

songs<00:03:31.230> now<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:31.980> say<00:03:32.220> it's<00:03:32.520> a<00:03:32.580> lot<00:03:32.730> cheaper<00:03:32.760> as<00:03:33.300> a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
songs now I say it's a lot cheaper as a

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
songs now I say it's a lot cheaper as a
good<00:03:33.600> point<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.020> it<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.230> also<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.470> bad<00:03:34.709> point

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
good point but it is also a bad point

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.140 
good point but it is also a bad point
because<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.220> means<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.430> anyone<00:03:35.760> up<00:03:36.120> there

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
because it means that anyone up there

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.479 
because it means that anyone up there
can<00:03:36.480> just<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:36.870> spend<00:03:37.050> 200<00:03:37.590> quid<00:03:37.830> buying<00:03:38.400> a
