00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 versatile make all this girl 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.690
 impressive but what if we show 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.429
 to everyone we show to all the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.970
 world what do lizeth of reeds 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.970
 short 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:33.920
 I like it 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920
 two 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.450
 not all life has lived here in the 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.450
 municipality 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.210
 extra the white house no car no 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.630
 we go barÃ§a with the dance started from 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.330
 I was in 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.920
 in transitions because my mom always 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.500
 he liked dancing has always 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.140
 wanted me to dance then wanted how 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.120
 start with preschool kids and 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.800
 it started as they were dancing dances 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:11.980
 something very simple the group takes strength and 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.180
 loses strength because the young people here 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.800
 well they grow up and they do not like anymore and 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.340
 then it comes out of the only ones that 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.869
 we have endured are the 4 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.869
 and tita tell me why 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.469
 today you are chained 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.180
 a shadow vega 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.590
 as at 9 years of age in first communion 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.899
 my grandmother said that she already wanted me 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.189
 Then I'll sing well they put me 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:57.240
 sing out of tune but that's how it started 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.750
 the one of the 13 years I came for a mass 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.560
 here to the church and was guillermo 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.560
 then he told me 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.989
 let's sing a mass together and I said to 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.369
 did I like it then I started and 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.369
 they saw that he had a good voice 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.409
 and there they were telling me for the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.200
 the Christmas choirs and then it was already 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.849
 Then I get to know people and 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.900
 they were that they were taking me to the 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.659
 orchestra to sing to hospitals to parties 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.329
 at 12 to the cemetery they also take me to 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.879
 they sing serenades the dead 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.700
 the mothers who pay me for doing it 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.280
 because also that addiction otecas 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.290
 Encourage people to spend time 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.180
 nice and I also have it 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.030
 he sang in the church first of all 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.280
 I like I love it because this is a 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.019
 gift that I say goodbye because it gave me 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.060
 the good pain between them is what 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.849
 I always always appreciate then my 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.669
 songs are for him I love to sing in 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.639
 the temple and the parents and the 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:08.299
 people have had a good response in 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.299
 how many friends 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.950
 because they have all the girls 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.319
 they have always wanted to be queen because 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.319
 I did not like the principle because the doubts 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:35.350
 of the girls are I do not know how to speak I'm sorry 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.140
 speak what people say obviously 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.660
 the criticisms of people are going to come out 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.670
 right or wrong I like to dance and I like it 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.310
 all that story of the reign I do not know until 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.310
 what part would arrive on arrival and if 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.980
 would be to win or lose but there it is done 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.290
 what what I can and how I like it 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.320
 then with a lot of enthusiasm and I do it 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.850
 it's complicated because as we know that 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.989
 are queens then you have to take that 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.860
 the elegance that looks flirtatious 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.860
 little girl tell me you 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.530
 on my shoulder 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.360
 here crying I'm like a singer 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.060
 empirical if we are also 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.100
 the empirical dancers who have not 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.440
 taught nothing with what little we should 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.100
 we supported each other we give ourselves what state we 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.650
 we scratch but we learn and we like 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.630
 true and we find something very nice a 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.550
 very cute art the dancing that that more than 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.090
 We are doing something good and not things 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.400
 bad 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.220
 productive albert for the people and what 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.190
 we make it look good 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.860
 and he took the body out, that is, not to sing 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.080
 but I try because I have no one I 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.870
 teach I do not have to tell me what you do wrong 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.990
 that is my parents with them you had the 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.310
 I support my whole life then later 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.410
 and like me they are also supporting me 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.180
 go to university 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.590
 if I had not passed that put me 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.420
 like other courses in Medellin 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.390
 we found lots of things and that 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.610
 face new things then if 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.910
 I'm going to go there to study to see what I 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.910
 give life 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.800
 and we're back with
