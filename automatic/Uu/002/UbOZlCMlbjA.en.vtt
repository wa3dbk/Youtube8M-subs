00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.540 
very sturdy very nice and here are the
handles<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:39.470> basically<00:02:40.220> what<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.459> do

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
handles and so basically what you do

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.630 
handles and so basically what you do
with<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.730> handle<00:02:41.090> if<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.540> can<00:02:41.660> see<00:02:41.810> me<00:02:41.989> um<00:02:42.890> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
with the handle if you can see me um you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.240 
with the handle if you can see me um you
push<00:02:43.880> this<00:02:44.030> down<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.630> opens<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.019> up<00:02:45.250> you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
push this down and that opens it up you

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.830 
push this down and that opens it up you
you<00:02:46.519> get<00:02:46.880> out<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.120> get<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.269> good<00:02:47.420> look<00:02:47.540> at<00:02:47.690> that

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
you get out you get a good look at that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.990 
you get out you get a good look at that
there<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:48.709> that<00:02:48.769> locks<00:02:49.370> right<00:02:49.640> down<00:02:49.820> on<00:02:49.940> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
there and that locks right down on the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.979 
there and that locks right down on the
pan<00:02:50.180> so<00:02:50.450> cooking<00:02:51.130> basically<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.989> put

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
pan so cooking basically can just put

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.080 
pan so cooking basically can just put
that<00:02:54.110> in<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.380> top<00:02:54.739> push<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.190> down<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.700> boom

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
that in the top push it down and boom

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.910 
that in the top push it down and boom
you've<00:02:56.390> got<00:02:56.420> it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
you've got it

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.070 
you've got it
so<00:02:57.920> also<00:02:58.700> works<00:02:59.060> really<00:02:59.150> well<00:02:59.420> and<00:02:59.630> when<00:02:59.989> you

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
so also works really well and when you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.170 
so also works really well and when you
have<00:03:00.230> these<00:03:00.380> things<00:03:00.500> all<00:03:00.650> stop<00:03:00.920> together<00:03:01.180> so

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
have these things all stop together so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.530 
have these things all stop together so
you're<00:03:02.299> cooking<00:03:02.630> things<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.530> burner<00:03:04.540> nice

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
you're cooking things on the burner nice

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.330 
you're cooking things on the burner nice
that<00:03:05.720> you<00:03:05.780> actually<00:03:05.930> have<00:03:06.200> these<00:03:06.739> things<00:03:07.010> that

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
that you actually have these things that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.960 
that you actually have these things that
you<00:03:07.459> can<00:03:07.640> take<00:03:08.090> them<00:03:08.209> off<00:03:08.390> because<00:03:09.640> on<00:03:10.640> like

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
you can take them off because on like

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.759 
you can take them off because on like
this<00:03:11.180> a<00:03:12.370> little<00:03:13.370> weird<00:03:13.670> right<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:15.590> turn

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
this a little weird right so you turn

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.759 
this a little weird right so you turn
like<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:15.980> or<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.700> say<00:03:16.880> I<00:03:17.060> don't<00:03:17.299> put<00:03:17.420> that

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
like that or just say I don't put that

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:23.110 
like that or just say I don't put that
handle<00:03:18.769> on<00:03:18.860> there<00:03:20.230> cook<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:22.400> these<00:03:22.790> things<00:03:22.970> are
