flexsim<00:00:15.240> brain<00:00:15.420> hopefully<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:15.839> can<00:00:16.230> do<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.680> so

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
flexsim brain hopefully I can do it so

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
flexsim brain hopefully I can do it so
taking<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.699> look<00:00:17.730> there<00:00:18.359> are<00:00:18.390> two<00:00:18.779> new

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
taking a look there are two new

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810

multiplayer<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.830> ko-tah<00:00:20.160> students<00:00:20.580> there's<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
multiplayer of ko-tah students there's a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.450 
multiplayer of ko-tah students there's a
replicant<00:00:21.410> oracle<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:22.619> then<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.100> believe

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
replicant oracle and then I believe

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.150 
replicant oracle and then I believe
there's<00:00:23.699> one<00:00:23.760> words<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.480> The<00:00:24.720> Tempest<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.039> you

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
there's one words on The Tempest so you

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.320 
there's one words on The Tempest so you
guys<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.400> go<00:00:26.550> ahead<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.789> take<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.060> look<00:00:27.210> at

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
guys can go ahead and take a look at

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.179 
guys can go ahead and take a look at
this<00:00:27.420> powerful<00:00:28.349> capital<00:00:28.859> ship<00:00:29.039> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this powerful capital ship that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
this powerful capital ship that
dominates<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> skies<00:00:30.150> with<00:00:30.359> an<00:00:30.480> A<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.869> be

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
dominates the skies with an A will be

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
dominates the skies with an A will be
attacked<00:00:31.289> similar<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.099> Corsair<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.579> would

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
attacked similar to the Corsair I would

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540 
attacked similar to the Corsair I would
believe<00:00:33.300> meanwhile<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.500> replicant<00:00:35.040> takes

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
believe meanwhile the replicant takes

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.869 
believe meanwhile the replicant takes
any<00:00:35.969> notice<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.989> copy<00:00:37.290> dispatch<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.100> becomes

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
any notice and copy dispatch and becomes

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.850 
any notice and copy dispatch and becomes
that<00:00:39.180> unit<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.719> believe<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.050> as<00:00:40.440> long<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that unit I believe that as long as it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.069 
that unit I believe that as long as it's
not<00:00:40.950> massive<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.120> Oracle<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> flying

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
not massive the Oracle is a flying

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.869 
not massive the Oracle is a flying
support<00:00:43.469> unit<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> shoot<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.430> disrupt

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
support unit at you shoot and disrupt

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.299 
support unit at you shoot and disrupt
enemy<00:00:45.120> economy<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.980> can<00:00:47.129> reveal

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
enemy economy and it can reveal

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.970 
enemy economy and it can reveal
structures<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.600> they<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.840> also<00:00:49.079> making<00:00:49.590> as

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
structures but they are also making as

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.340 
structures but they are also making as
well<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.670> all<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.840> nice<00:00:52.050> way<00:00:52.289> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
well so it's all so it's a nice way to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.619 
well so it's all so it's a nice way to
see<00:00:52.620> what<00:00:52.890> buildings<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.030> what<00:00:54.210> units<00:00:54.510> are

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
see what buildings and what units are

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.939 
see what buildings and what units are
currently<00:00:55.020> being<00:00:55.230> produced<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:55.829> can

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
currently being produced so you can

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.500 
currently being produced so you can
actually<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.520> ahead<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.879> try<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> keep<00:00:57.270> track

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
actually go ahead and try to keep track

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.049 
actually go ahead and try to keep track
of<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.870> well<00:00:58.620> now<00:00:58.920> let's<00:00:59.460> go<00:00:59.609> ahead<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> take

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
of that well now let's go ahead and take

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.319 
of that well now let's go ahead and take
a<00:01:00.300> look<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.500> third<00:01:01.770> side<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.180> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
a look at the third side if you have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.329 
a look at the third side if you have
their<00:01:03.510> vibrators<00:01:04.049> lining<00:01:04.619> unit<00:01:04.830> did<00:01:05.159> I'm<00:01:05.309> sure

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
their vibrators lining unit did I'm sure

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
their vibrators lining unit did I'm sure
you<00:01:05.549> guys<00:01:05.640> can<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:06.030> picture<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.570> much

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
you guys can be this picture of much

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.760 
you guys can be this picture of much
much<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.340> much<00:01:08.340> much<00:01:08.750> better<00:01:09.750> than<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
deadly I was playing against a computer

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.069 
deadly I was playing against a computer
and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> was<00:01:38.759> able<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> deal<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.329> lot<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.900> damage
