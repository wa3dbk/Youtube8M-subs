course there's the the battery cover to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.949 
course there's the the battery cover to
set<00:02:20.430> sector<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.239> I'll<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.390> set<00:02:21.690> him<00:02:21.840> aside

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
set sector so I'll just set him aside

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.920 
set sector so I'll just set him aside
and<00:02:22.820> finally<00:02:23.820> we<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.120> sector<00:02:24.570> itself

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
and finally we have the sector itself

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.300 
and finally we have the sector itself
now<00:02:25.380> I'm<00:02:25.590> going<00:02:25.739> to<00:02:25.830> try<00:02:26.489> and<00:02:27.860> keep<00:02:28.860> this<00:02:29.070> guy

battery covers off because batteries go

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:20.780 
battery covers off because batteries go

switch<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.700> up<00:03:23.850> here<00:03:24.230> this<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.860> trigger

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
switch is up here this is the trigger

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.920 
switch is up here this is the trigger
which<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.579> the<00:03:26.760> required<00:03:27.360> for<00:03:27.540> most<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.810> these

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
which is the required for most of these

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.009 
which is the required for most of these
functions<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.070> these<00:03:29.519> two<00:03:29.850> things<00:03:30.420> are<00:03:30.840> what

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019

hold the Scorpion in place so let's go
ahead<00:03:33.360> switch<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.750> on

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:55.160 

just<00:03:43.020> keep<00:03:43.170> it<00:03:43.350> on<00:03:43.500> that<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:54.540> course<00:03:54.810> there<00:03:55.050> is

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
just keep it on that of course there is

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.520 
just keep it on that of course there is
right<00:03:55.320> here<00:03:55.440> this<00:03:55.590> part<00:03:55.980> lights<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:59.120> and<00:04:00.530> fact

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
right here this part lights up and fact

right here this part lights up and fact
family<00:04:01.800> so<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.980> gimmicks<00:04:02.250> requires<00:04:02.580> a

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.230 
Drake would be my second run
recommendation<00:06:13.300> after<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:14.050> the<00:06:14.440> bees<00:06:14.650> actor

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
recommendation after the the bees actor

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.460 
recommendation after the the bees actor
because<00:06:16.240> it's<00:06:16.539> kind<00:06:16.659> of<00:06:16.750> easy<00:06:16.960> but<00:06:17.259> at<00:06:17.349> same

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
because it's kind of easy but at same

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.200 
because it's kind of easy but at same
time<00:06:17.650> I'm<00:06:17.889> sure<00:06:18.099> how<00:06:18.250> you<00:06:18.310> would<00:06:18.909> handle

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
time I'm sure how you would handle

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.360 
time I'm sure how you would handle
running<00:06:20.050> around<00:06:20.319> a<00:06:20.349> gun<00:06:20.590> at<00:06:20.860> a<00:06:20.919> convention<00:06:21.129> or

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
running around a gun at a convention or

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.770 
running around a gun at a convention or
something<00:06:21.430> that<00:06:21.729> looks<00:06:21.849> like<00:06:21.909> a<00:06:21.970> gun<00:06:22.210> I<00:06:22.419> don't

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
something that looks like a gun I don't

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.850 
something that looks like a gun I don't
know<00:06:24.120> this<00:06:25.120> is<00:06:25.389> fairly<00:06:25.810> nice<00:06:26.139> it<00:06:26.469> is<00:06:26.590> fairly

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:26.860 
know this is fairly nice it is fairly

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.939 
know this is fairly nice it is fairly
long<00:06:27.360> it's<00:06:28.360> almost<00:06:28.900> roughly<00:06:29.409> the<00:06:29.469> size<00:06:29.620> of<00:06:29.860> the

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
long it's almost roughly the size of the

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.249 
long it's almost roughly the size of the
perfect<00:06:30.280> sector<00:06:30.520> I<00:06:30.580> think<00:06:30.849> or<00:06:31.780> close<00:06:32.050> to<00:06:32.229> it

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
perfect sector I think or close to it

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:36.270 
perfect sector I think or close to it
which<00:06:32.770> also<00:06:32.949> have<00:06:33.449> but<00:06:34.449> yeah<00:06:34.810> that's<00:06:35.139> a<00:06:35.620> the

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
which also have but yeah that's a the

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.730 
which also have but yeah that's a the
swords<00:06:36.819> sector<00:06:37.199> now<00:06:38.199> I'm<00:06:38.259> just<00:06:38.349> going<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.560> pop

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
swords sector now I'm just going to pop

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.279 
swords sector now I'm just going to pop
these<00:06:38.949> batteries<00:06:39.340> out<00:06:39.520> and<00:06:40.020> put<00:06:41.020> this<00:06:41.139> guy

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
these batteries out and put this guy

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:42.360 
these batteries out and put this guy
back<00:06:41.319> together<00:06:41.710> and<00:06:41.830> put<00:06:41.919> it<00:06:42.009> back<00:06:42.099> in<00:06:42.250> its<00:06:42.280> box

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:42.370 
back together and put it back in its box

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.570 
back together and put it back in its box
so<00:06:42.819> it<00:06:42.940> tries<00:06:43.389> to<00:06:43.710> stay<00:06:44.710> best<00:06:45.069> shape<00:06:45.250> as<00:06:45.400> I<00:06:45.490> can

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
so it tries to stay best shape as I can

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.980 
so it tries to stay best shape as I can
keep<00:06:45.699> it<00:06:45.819> in<00:06:45.940> and<00:06:46.440> I<00:06:47.440> will<00:06:47.919> talk<00:06:48.129> to<00:06:48.159> all<00:06:48.520> of<00:06:48.550> you

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
keep it in and I will talk to all of you

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.990 
keep it in and I will talk to all of you
later
