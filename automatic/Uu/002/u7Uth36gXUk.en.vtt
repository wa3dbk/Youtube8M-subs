00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
know it's my hair headband and then the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.969 
know it's my hair headband and then the
wig<00:01:05.869> and<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:08.130> roots<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.760> actually<00:01:09.119> did<00:01:09.510> myself

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
wig and the roots I actually did myself

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
wig and the roots I actually did myself
um<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.159> took<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.610> fabric<00:01:12.299> marker<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.869> black<00:01:13.170> fabric

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
um I took a fabric marker a black fabric

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.560 
um I took a fabric marker a black fabric
marker<00:01:13.920> although<00:01:14.310> black<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.240> be<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> little

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
marker although black can be a little

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
marker although black can be a little
bit<00:01:15.659> too<00:01:15.810> harsh<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.560> dark<00:01:16.920> brown<00:01:17.159> would

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
bit too harsh so a dark brown would

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.969 
bit too harsh so a dark brown would
probably<00:01:18.030> work<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.360> bit<00:01:18.540> better<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
probably work a little bit better but to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.010 
probably work a little bit better but to
the<00:01:20.070> black<00:01:20.280> fabric<00:01:20.580> marker<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.720> went<00:01:21.930> ahead

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the black fabric marker and I went ahead

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
the black fabric marker and I went ahead
and<00:01:22.170> colored<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.700> give<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.880> some<00:01:24.000> roots<00:01:25.670> to

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and colored it to give it some roots to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
and colored it to give it some roots to
give<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> some<00:01:27.090> roots<00:01:27.299> um<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
give it some roots um so that it can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.960 
give it some roots um so that it can
match<00:01:28.799> my<00:01:29.009> hair<00:01:29.220> because<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.549> hair<00:01:29.670> obviously

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
match my hair because my hair obviously

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.190 
match my hair because my hair obviously
is<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.659> very<00:01:30.990> very<00:01:31.110> very<00:01:31.350> dark<00:01:31.590> brown<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:33.000> uh

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
is a very very very dark brown so it uh

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
is a very very very dark brown so it uh
it's<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.380> believable<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:38.630> um

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
it's more believable that way um

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.109 
it's more believable that way um
shedding<00:01:41.250> yes<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.939> does<00:01:42.119> shave<00:01:43.909> yeah<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
shedding yes it does shave yeah you

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.870 
shedding yes it does shave yeah you
can't<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.960> does<00:01:46.470> every<00:01:47.460> once<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.820> while

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
can't it does every once in a while

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.389 
can't it does every once in a while
you<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.200> get<00:01:49.320> clumps<00:01:49.890> because

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you don't you don't get clumps because

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
you don't you don't get clumps because
it's<00:01:50.729> curly<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.560> strands<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.100> hair
