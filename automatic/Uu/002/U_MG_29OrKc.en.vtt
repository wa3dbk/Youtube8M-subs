00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.890 

let's<00:00:09.059> talk<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> little<00:00:09.360> bit<00:00:09.570> more<00:00:09.750> about

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
let's talk a little bit more about

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.560 
let's talk a little bit more about
time-lapse<00:00:10.469> flicker<00:00:10.800> now<00:00:11.400> flickr<00:00:11.790> occurs

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
time-lapse flicker now flickr occurs

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.440 
time-lapse flicker now flickr occurs
when<00:00:12.809> one<00:00:13.080> or<00:00:13.410> many<00:00:14.009> shots<00:00:14.670> in<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.969> time-lapse

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
when one or many shots in a time-lapse

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.450 
when one or many shots in a time-lapse
sequence<00:00:15.900> are<00:00:16.289> either<00:00:16.470> underexposed<00:00:17.190> or

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
sequence are either underexposed or

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.359 
sequence are either underexposed or
overexposed<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.510> what<00:00:18.930> happens<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:19.500> you<00:00:20.220> get

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
overexposed and what happens is you get

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.790 
overexposed and what happens is you get
a<00:00:20.430> bright<00:00:21.150> frame<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.930> dark<00:00:22.230> frame<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.769> a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
a bright frame or a dark frame or a

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.650 
a bright frame or a dark frame or a
series<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.160> bright<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.490> dark<00:00:23.670> frames<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
series of bright and dark frames and it

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140 
series of bright and dark frames and it
really<00:00:24.980> disrupts<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.760> time-lapse

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
really disrupts the the time-lapse

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.250 
really disrupts the the time-lapse
sequence<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.779> there's<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:27.990> couple<00:00:28.170> different

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
sequence so there's a couple different

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.859 
sequence so there's a couple different
reasons<00:00:28.769> why<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.250> occurs<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> few

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
reasons why this occurs and as a few

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
reasons why this occurs and as a few
different<00:00:30.960> ways<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.650> can<00:00:31.830> combat<00:00:32.430> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
different ways that we can combat it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.569 
different ways that we can combat it
when<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:33.600> are<00:00:34.070> recording<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> time-lapse

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
when we are recording a time-lapse

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.950 
when we are recording a time-lapse
sequence<00:00:35.969> now<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> most<00:00:36.300> common<00:00:36.600> source<00:00:36.840> of

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
sequence now the most common source of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720 
sequence now the most common source of
flicker<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.440> be<00:00:37.500> traced<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.010> automatic

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
flicker can be traced to automatic

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
flicker can be traced to automatic
setting<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.899> exposing<00:00:40.590> your

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
setting is when you are exposing your

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.700 
setting is when you are exposing your
time-lapse<00:00:41.460> images<00:00:41.879> since<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.260> camera<00:00:43.649> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
time-lapse images since the camera is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.319 
time-lapse images since the camera is
making<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.070> independent<00:00:44.309> decision<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.210> each

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
making an independent decision for each

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.299 
making an independent decision for each
and<00:00:45.539> every<00:00:45.750> time<00:00:45.960> lapse<00:00:46.200> shot<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.739> will

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and every time lapse shot it will

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.279 
and every time lapse shot it will
invariably<00:00:47.879> make<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> different<00:00:48.690> decision<00:00:48.930> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
invariably make a different decision and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.619 
invariably make a different decision and
thus<00:00:49.860> expose<00:00:50.250> one<00:00:50.489> frame<00:00:50.820> or<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.239> several

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
thus expose one frame or or several

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.260 
thus expose one frame or or several
frames<00:00:51.899> differently<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.489> easiest<00:00:53.760> way<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
frames differently the easiest way to

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.600 
frames differently the easiest way to
fix<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.020> shoot<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.649> full<00:00:55.980> manual<00:00:56.160> mode

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
fix that is to shoot in full manual mode

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
fix that is to shoot in full manual mode
and<00:00:56.820> also<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> select<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.050> manual<00:00:58.410> ISO

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
and also to select the manual ISO

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.799 
and also to select the manual ISO
setting<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.210> manual<00:01:00.570> white<00:01:00.780> balance

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
setting and a manual white balance

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.110 
setting and a manual white balance
setting

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.910 

now<00:01:11.120> going<00:01:11.300> one<00:01:11.540> step<00:01:11.570> beyond<00:01:12.170> manual<00:01:12.710> mode

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
now going one step beyond manual mode

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.460 
now going one step beyond manual mode
the<00:01:13.250> second<00:01:13.580> way<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.670> combat<00:01:14.150> flicker<00:01:14.660> is<00:01:14.960> to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
the second way to combat flicker is to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.500 
the second way to combat flicker is to
actually<00:01:15.740> make<00:01:15.980> your<00:01:16.130> camera<00:01:16.640> think<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.390> you

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
actually make your camera think that you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.720 
actually make your camera think that you
have<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:17.780> manual<00:01:18.380> lens<00:01:18.680> here's<00:01:19.490> why<00:01:19.700> that

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
have a manual lens here's why that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.790 
have a manual lens here's why that
matters<00:01:20.060> now<00:01:20.720> even<00:01:21.050> in<00:01:21.170> full<00:01:21.380> manual<00:01:21.710> mode

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
matters now even in full manual mode

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.220 
matters now even in full manual mode
with<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.220> set<00:01:22.550> aperture<00:01:23.120> every<00:01:23.720> time<00:01:23.900> your

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:24.230 
with a set aperture every time your

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:27.130 
with a set aperture every time your
camera<00:01:24.620> takes<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.980> photograph<00:01:25.240> it<00:01:26.240> moves<00:01:26.930> the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
camera takes a photograph it moves the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.680 
camera takes a photograph it moves the
aperture<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.590> wide<00:01:28.040> open<00:01:28.460> before<00:01:29.120> dialing<00:01:29.420> it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
aperture to wide open before dialing it

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.920 
aperture to wide open before dialing it
back<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:30.170> your<00:01:30.670> desired<00:01:31.670> setting<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:32.720> each

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
back to your desired setting so each

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.660 
back to your desired setting so each
time<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.410> happens<00:01:33.860> there's<00:01:34.070> a<00:01:34.130> chance<00:01:34.400> for

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
time that happens there's a chance for

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.630 
time that happens there's a chance for
small<00:01:34.970> mechanical<00:01:35.690> inconsistencies<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:37.490> make

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
small mechanical inconsistencies to make

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.730 
small mechanical inconsistencies to make
a<00:01:37.670> change<00:01:38.030> between<00:01:38.540> one<00:01:38.870> exposure<00:01:39.290> and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
a change between one exposure and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.530 
a change between one exposure and
another<00:01:39.980> now<00:01:40.700> there's<00:01:40.880> couple<00:01:41.060> ways<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.330> you

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
another now there's couple ways that you

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.160 
another now there's couple ways that you
can<00:01:41.870> minimize<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:43.340> from<00:01:44.020> taking<00:01:45.020> place

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
can minimize this from taking place

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.170 
can minimize this from taking place
first<00:01:46.010> thing<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.190> can<00:01:46.280> do<00:01:46.370> is<00:01:46.490> shoot<00:01:46.700> at<00:01:46.940> the

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
first thing you can do is shoot at the

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.290 
first thing you can do is shoot at the
lowest<00:01:47.540> f-stop<00:01:48.200> possible<00:01:48.860> wider<00:01:49.700> apertures

lowest f-stop possible wider apertures

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.990 
lowest f-stop possible wider apertures
result<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.200> less<00:01:51.650> exposure<00:01:52.280> variation

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
result in less exposure variation

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.060 
result in less exposure variation
because<00:01:53.240> there's<00:01:53.390> less<00:01:53.600> movement<00:01:54.470> that<00:01:54.830> needs

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
because there's less movement that needs

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.190 
because there's less movement that needs

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
introduced a lot of flicker so what I

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.490 
introduced a lot of flicker so what I
did<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:37.879> ran<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.359> compilation<00:03:38.750> through<00:03:39.319> D

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.830 
did is I ran the compilation through D
flickering<00:03:40.010> software<00:03:40.549> as<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.359> can<00:03:41.420> see<00:03:41.690> it's

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
flickering software as you can see it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.780 
flickering software as you can see it's
a<00:03:42.049> lot<00:03:42.319> less<00:03:42.530> noticeable<00:03:43.099> there's<00:03:43.459> a<00:03:43.489> little

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
a lot less noticeable there's a little

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.270 
a lot less noticeable there's a little
bit<00:03:44.200> fluctuations<00:03:45.200> in<00:03:45.349> there<00:03:45.530> but<00:03:46.099> certainly

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
bit fluctuations in there but certainly

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:55.420 
bit fluctuations in there but certainly
not<00:03:46.670> nearly<00:03:47.150> as<00:03:47.359> severe<00:03:47.930> as<00:03:48.140> it<00:03:48.500> was

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.369 

so<00:03:56.430> we<00:03:56.549> can<00:03:56.730> utilize<00:03:56.909> priority<00:03:57.780> mode<00:03:57.930> shooting

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
so we can utilize priority mode shooting

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:59.809 
so we can utilize priority mode shooting
for<00:03:58.560> those<00:03:58.680> scenes<00:03:58.980> where<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.370> light<00:03:59.549> does

for those scenes where the light does

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.429 
for those scenes where the light does
change<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.659> just<00:04:00.840> have<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.049> be<00:04:01.140> aware<00:04:01.379> that

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
we're going to experience more flicker

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.990 
we're going to experience more flicker
in<00:04:03.480> our<00:04:03.659> compilations<00:04:04.400> now<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.670> is<00:04:05.819> mainly

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
in our compilations now this is mainly

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.940 
in our compilations now this is mainly
because<00:04:06.269> cameras<00:04:07.170> just<00:04:07.349> really<00:04:07.739> aren't

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
because cameras just really aren't

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.089 
because cameras just really aren't
