00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.869
 and this is the video that you have most of us 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.540
 asked by facebook the animals playing 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.180
 how to interact with our rabbits and 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.640
 with our pets both within 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.609
 house like away from home and is that there is very 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.680
 few toys in the specific market 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.900
 for rabbits but we're going to give you 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.540
 solutions because you can interact 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.790
 in many different ways especially 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.200
 with other pets especially together 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.239
 animals with animals races and species 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:49.020
 yes they are compatible 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.910
 it is true antonio many toys 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.860
 prepared and special for rabbits 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.129
 example because there is not what can be 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.469
 to do is improvise yes and we also have 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.020
 using the toys as we have done 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.330
 in this case of other pets that yes 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.680
 that our rabbits can play and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.380
 we can also do a lot of 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.600
 homemade things we always 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.310
 beware of the material that these have 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.560
 toys because we say that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.240
 can use toys prepared for 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.400
 other animals but they must be rodents 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.010
 good you have to keep in mind that 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.630
 they are always going to nibble and go to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.790
 try to eat the toys that we 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.410
 we put it for that reason always because the 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.840
 raw material of toys as you see 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.670
 here then cardboard wood and things 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.350
 natural things that they can eat 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 without any problem as 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.460
 example these hay tunnels that they 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440
 they love when when they are more 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.540
 little ones get here and also 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.880
 they use it as food and other 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.800
 important thing rabbits get bored 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.630
 a lot all day in the cage there 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.820
 that get them out of their cages have to 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.369
 interact and leave if you have other 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.170
 pets as you see here the coconut or demi 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.850
 what a great time he is going to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.570
 have a great time playing with others 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.220
 animals 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.850
 that's called environmental enrichment 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.350
 is that animals have toys and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.540
 other living beings with whom 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.400
 interact and as we have all done 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.480
 when we are little, fight not to play 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.090
 laugh 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.190
 chase all this toy for 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.520
 example we have created it in with 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.710
 ipic that they make many, many, many 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.740
 Thanks to the bunnies, look what is 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.470
 here below why do you have these 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.990
 threads that tickle you in the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 mustaches and they play for hours 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.960
 besides that they can hide out 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.270
 through different holes here you have 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.390
 different types of wicker huts 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:39.340
 wood for example is here where 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680
 little bunnies stay pearls 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.020
 they can enter and they are going 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.270
 to last a little longer than the booths that 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.400
 they are simply hay hellenous they are going 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.960
 to eat very fast and the wood is gone 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.710
 to eat also but they will last a 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.710
 little bit more time 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.800
 obviously not all of you have a garden 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.230
 house but any balcony or terrace is 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.430
 can prepare for game environment 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.770
 for our little ones you can also 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.380
 go out to parks and gardens 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:36.160
 the city with a little more strap 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.840
 long so the animals do not escape 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.550
 and another way to interact is like 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.530
 I'm doing with this animal of 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.620
 long hair that is an angora rabbit 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.840
 English as you know you have to clean it and 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.400
 brush every week these 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.260
 animals that have such long hair 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.120
 because they need more care and it's a 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.580
 way to always interact also 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.320
 awarding them and reminding you that it is very 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.480
 interesting if you have several animals 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.970
 together so they can live together and 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.860
 can play with each other even though 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.230
 not yours, you can put them together 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.610
 of your friends because there are species 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.890
 among them that they have such a good time 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:13.090
 such as cats and rabbits 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.090
 you have seen in this case
