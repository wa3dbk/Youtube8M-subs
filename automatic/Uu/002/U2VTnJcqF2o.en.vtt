what<00:04:20.329> interested<00:04:20.959> me<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.170> the<00:04:21.380> stories<00:04:21.860> that

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
what interested me in the stories that

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.220 
what interested me in the stories that
of<00:04:22.250> course<00:04:22.580> not<00:04:22.940> everyone<00:04:23.330> has<00:04:23.600> a<00:04:23.630> link<00:04:23.990> with

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.230 
of course not everyone has a link with

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.170 
of course not everyone has a link with
an<00:04:24.320> invisible<00:04:24.560> entity<00:04:24.950> but<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.430> all<00:04:25.670> have

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
an invisible entity but we all have

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.410 
an invisible entity but we all have
something<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:27.460> we<00:04:28.460> need<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.700> accept<00:04:29.090> but

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
something that we need to accept but

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.600 
something that we need to accept but
ourselves<00:04:30.020> that<00:04:30.320> we<00:04:30.530> cannot<00:04:30.860> change<00:04:30.980> and<00:04:31.550> we

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
ourselves that we cannot change and we

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.430 
ourselves that we cannot change and we
need<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.850> leave<00:04:32.060> with<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.480> and<00:04:32.750> this<00:04:33.290> is

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
need to leave with that and this is

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.100 
need to leave with that and this is
definitely<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.980> story<00:04:34.220> of<00:04:34.580> Julian<00:04:35.480> and<00:04:35.690> I'd

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
definitely the story of Julian and I'd

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.830 
definitely the story of Julian and I'd
understand<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.950> entity<00:04:37.310> I<00:04:37.460> think<00:04:38.030> it's<00:04:38.210> it's

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
understand this entity I think it's it's

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.660 
understand this entity I think it's it's
not<00:04:38.990> about<00:04:39.170> paranormal<00:04:39.620> so<00:04:40.070> much<00:04:40.280> it's<00:04:40.580> about

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
not about paranormal so much it's about

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:49.960 
not about paranormal so much it's about
accepting<00:04:41.300> we<00:04:41.630> are<00:04:42.610> just<00:04:48.310> like<00:04:49.310> everyone<00:04:49.820> else

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
accepting we are just like everyone else

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.640 
accepting we are just like everyone else
cause<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.750> know

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.660 

it's<00:04:55.650> weird<00:04:55.800> because<00:04:55.950> I<00:04:56.070> didn't<00:04:56.250> think<00:04:56.340> anyone

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
it's weird because I didn't think anyone

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.130 
it's weird because I didn't think anyone
can<00:04:57.000> relate<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.480> that<00:04:57.510> anyone<00:04:58.350> can<00:04:58.560> relate<00:04:58.740> to

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:00.140 
can relate to that anyone can relate to

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.990 
can relate to that anyone can relate to
getting<00:05:01.140> rid<00:05:01.440> of<00:05:01.470> our<00:05:01.620> own<00:05:01.800> kind<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.490> personal

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000
