00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
through the mud and it was quite a dry

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.709 
through the mud and it was quite a dry
day<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.000> she<00:01:57.149> has<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.540> got

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
day so as you can see she has not got

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.359 
day so as you can see she has not got
Gators<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.439> she's<00:01:58.649> probably<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.070> walking

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
Gators on so she's probably not walking

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.940 
Gators on so she's probably not walking
the<00:01:59.460> Pennine<00:01:59.759> way<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.149> seriously<00:02:00.950> Pennine

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the Pennine way but seriously Pennine

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.620 
the Pennine way but seriously Pennine
way<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.399> walk<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.759> converted<00:02:03.360> me<00:02:03.479> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
way was the walk that converted me to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
way was the walk that converted me to
Gators<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.170> first<00:02:04.409> place

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
Gators in the first place

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.749 
Gators in the first place
you<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.299> end<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.810> really<00:02:07.320> muddy<00:02:07.799> even<00:02:08.550> with

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you will end up really muddy even with

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.930 
you will end up really muddy even with
these<00:02:09.679> paving<00:02:10.679> stones<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.819> it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
these paving stones that they have on it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.280 
these paving stones that they have on it
now

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290

it all in one go or in stages either way
is<00:02:51.680> absolutely<00:02:52.129> fine<00:02:52.400> but<00:02:53.389> there<00:02:54.079> are<00:02:54.319> long

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
is absolutely fine but there are long

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.680 
is absolutely fine but there are long
sections<00:02:55.609> of<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.849> Pennine<00:02:56.180> way<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.569> are

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
sections of the Pennine way that are

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.479 
sections of the Pennine way that are
kind<00:02:57.019> of<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.889> picture<00:02:58.750> where<00:02:59.750> is

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
kind of like this picture where is

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.940 
kind of like this picture where is
there's<00:03:01.489> almost<00:03:01.700> like<00:03:02.030> featureless<00:03:02.959> moment

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
there's almost like featureless moment

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.280 
there's almost like featureless moment
which<00:03:04.549> sounds<00:03:04.879> horrible<00:03:05.359> but<00:03:05.599> there<00:03:06.139> is

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
which sounds horrible but there is

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.710 
which sounds horrible but there is
something<00:03:06.650> really<00:03:06.889> appealing<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.909> wonderful

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
something really appealing and wonderful

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.349 
something really appealing and wonderful
about<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:10.159> walk<00:03:10.430> on<00:03:10.670> for<00:03:10.909> miles<00:03:11.090> and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
about it you you walk on for miles and

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.009 
about it you you walk on for miles and
miles<00:03:11.569> through<00:03:11.840> this<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.829> may<00:03:13.040> not<00:03:13.250> have

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:14.019 
miles through this and you may not have

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.869 
miles through this and you may not have
particularly<00:03:15.069> spectacular<00:03:16.069> views<00:03:16.370> all<00:03:16.669> the

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
particularly spectacular views all the

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.720 
particularly spectacular views all the
time<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:18.260> it<00:03:18.410> puts<00:03:18.620> you<00:03:18.739> in<00:03:18.769> a<00:03:18.889> really<00:03:19.129> kind<00:03:19.579> of

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
time but it puts you in a really kind of

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.449 
time but it puts you in a really kind of
meditative<00:03:20.389> state<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.139> you<00:03:21.949> just<00:03:22.220> keep<00:03:22.400> going

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
meditative state and you just keep going

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.150 
meditative state and you just keep going
and<00:03:23.060> it's<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.810> pennyways<00:03:24.319> more<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.769> mental

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
and it's the pennyways more of a mental

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.259 
and it's the pennyways more of a mental
challenge<00:03:25.430> as<00:03:25.819> well<00:03:25.970> as<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.150> physical

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
challenge as well as a physical

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.689 
challenge as well as a physical
challenge<00:03:27.129> perhaps<00:03:28.129> more<00:03:28.310> than<00:03:28.430> any<00:03:28.609> other

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:28.699 
challenge perhaps more than any other

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:34.869 
challenge perhaps more than any other
work<00:03:29.230> because<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.470> lot<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.889> it<00:03:31.069> is<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.980> how<00:03:34.370> do

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.360 
the Pennine way it is a real challenge
but<00:03:55.909> that<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:57.349> know<00:03:57.500> all<00:03:57.799> the<00:03:58.069> better<00:03:58.250> for

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
but that is you know all the better for

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.809 
but that is you know all the better for
it<00:03:58.609> it's<00:03:59.060> great<00:03:59.409> and<00:04:00.409> my<00:04:01.129> third<00:04:01.370> tip<00:04:01.549> is<00:04:01.760> to

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
it it's great and my third tip is to

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.550 
it it's great and my third tip is to
when<00:04:02.389> you're<00:04:02.510> considering<00:04:02.840> accommodation

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
when you're considering accommodation

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.619 
when you're considering accommodation
the<00:04:03.829> Pennine<00:04:04.129> way<00:04:04.159> is<00:04:04.459> more<00:04:05.000> than<00:04:05.120> any<00:04:05.419> other

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
the Pennine way is more than any other

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.439 
the Pennine way is more than any other
trail<00:04:05.930> that<00:04:06.079> I<00:04:06.169> know<00:04:06.230> of<00:04:06.560> it's<00:04:07.190> really<00:04:08.180> good

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
trail that I know of it's really good

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.619 
trail that I know of it's really good
for<00:04:08.810> hostels<00:04:10.060> probably<00:04:11.060> because<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.359> was<00:04:11.479> one

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:11.629 
for hostels probably because it was one

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.920 
for hostels probably because it was one
of<00:04:11.659> the<00:04:11.840> first<00:04:12.049> trails<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:13.489> was<00:04:13.669> created<00:04:14.629> and

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
of the first trails that was created and

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.009 
of the first trails that was created and
a<00:04:15.530> load<00:04:15.739> of<00:04:15.889> hostels<00:04:16.340> sprang<00:04:17.060> up<00:04:17.269> around<00:04:17.419> it<00:04:17.810> so

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
a load of hostels sprang up around it so

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.099 
a load of hostels sprang up around it so
you<00:04:18.049> can<00:04:18.699> base<00:04:19.699> an<00:04:19.909> itinerary<00:04:20.389> pretty<00:04:20.810> much

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
you can base an itinerary pretty much

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.120 
you can base an itinerary pretty much
around<00:04:21.560> youth<00:04:22.099> hostels<00:04:22.550> which<00:04:23.389> is<00:04:23.750> great<00:04:24.380> it

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130
