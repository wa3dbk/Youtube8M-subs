00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
right behind the flag straight up to a

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.380 
right behind the flag straight up to a
and<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.710> gonna<00:00:41.949> land<00:00:42.220> right<00:00:42.489> on<00:00:42.670> top<00:00:43.030> of<00:00:43.059> C

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390

flag<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.079> this<00:00:44.620> side<00:00:44.890> takes<00:00:45.370> a<00:00:45.460> little<00:00:45.610> bit

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
flag so this side takes a little bit

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.369 
flag so this side takes a little bit
longer<00:00:45.879> to<00:00:46.089> get<00:00:46.210> to<00:00:46.270> than<00:00:46.539> the<00:00:46.629> other<00:00:46.809> side<00:00:47.079> so

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
longer to get to than the other side so

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.569 
longer to get to than the other side so
this<00:00:47.559> will<00:00:47.710> be<00:00:47.770> little<00:00:47.920> bit<00:00:48.010> more<00:00:48.100> difficult

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
this will be little bit more difficult

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.330 
this will be little bit more difficult
