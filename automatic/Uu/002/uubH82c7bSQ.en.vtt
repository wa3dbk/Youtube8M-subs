00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.550
 ok good game 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.530
 pascal at any time without bed 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.370
 and 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:28.830
 near angers today I want 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:31.350
 introduce my laces game the know if 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.020
 the extension reminder these quads and I know 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.380
 not the bled and I think because I 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 do not know but I do not know the idea 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.080
 one of the six presented accounts to 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.670
 killed someone 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:50.160
 or it's really just to destroy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 scores it can be a little test 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 in split screen 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.580
 to find out w so a week 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.350
 with armored blades seemed like dishes 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.120
 all of the six nations 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 because I'm always in quincy 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.500
 national the test in this room on 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.450
 also when I'm sure if I have to 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.220
 increase as soon as the device changed 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.510
 the exceptions are 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.490
 important and I took a shot in 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.810
 take to Paris so here are gone on 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.979
 night owls 25 so I start with the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.939
 know I think of an armored bullet 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.909
 have the muffler so she liked that at 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.650
 to leave but to start before five 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.570
 tables and benches are still getting lost 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.380
 to see if it needs a difference 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.560
 with the water from near distance so I 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.150
 do it thoroughly in close combat 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.190
 I hired a lot of the player and I 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.760
 will watch years as a ball that one 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.330
 broadband 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.410
 three bars so with the armored balls on 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.750
 will kill between at the ball 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.750
 not without Lebanese you look on 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.740
 three more balls so you have 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.390
 unshielded or not it would change so the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.480
 room after six bullets to kill the guy 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.640
 i killed gdg shoot this wave but that 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.230
 took me six to kill him so we see 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:27.730
 by far what is stopped ball is 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:30.370
 now no there I just made a name 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:39.760
 when they are well worth sis have 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:43.600
 watched and so this ball still ok so 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.210
 the ages but when are you tick if 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.560
 you have ball bled that 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.050
 you no matter what my 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.760
 accessory but disposes otherwise it's for 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.550
 anything you will kill the case in 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.470
 March 3 and his relatives now from 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.670
 long distances 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.800
 so I would not do it you are what 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.380
 you could see if you have ballet 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.300
 moments on 7 6 balls and if you 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.990
 have that my science has received in six bullets 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.420
 so that could not be a moment 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:12.280
 that Belgrade will not rise and illegal 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.550
 so it's for me not being very 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.780
 helpful because I actually cut down 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.770
 strict scores faster with my 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.420
 agent do not care a bit 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.980
 I would like to play will be more damage to 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.380
 my love it looks like it's not 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.110
 the effect that its likely that it causes 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.050
 so up to a lawsuit against unless 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.510
 that in the comments you from our 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.640
 way directly yes that's it really 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
 the damage it depends on the weapons I 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.660
 do not know me anyway about payroll 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.360
 w i the products against andy roddick 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.110
 bablin des changes in no way the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.930
 tear damage 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 it's only going to have damaged more 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.380
 quickly the dry score 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.810
 so sorry that's the video was at 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:52.000
 to paint I will not speak loudly because 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.360
 that everyone was sleeping but good good 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.360
 day
