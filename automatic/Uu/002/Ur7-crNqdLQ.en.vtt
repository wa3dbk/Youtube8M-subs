00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
an equal amount effort your program is

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.170 
an equal amount effort your program is
not<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.550> difficult<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:34.260> results

not that difficult the results

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.350 
not that difficult the results
your<00:01:36.780> program<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.500> easy<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.860> learn<00:01:38.010> and<00:01:38.700> easy

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
your program was easy to learn and easy

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
your program was easy to learn and easy
to<00:01:39.570> implement<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.590> does<00:01:41.010> it<00:01:41.130> give<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to implement so does it give the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910 
to implement so does it give the
customer<00:01:41.940> what<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.150> really<00:01:42.420> want<00:01:42.920> the
