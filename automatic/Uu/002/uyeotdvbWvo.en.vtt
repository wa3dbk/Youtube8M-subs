measurements<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.610> these<00:00:47.789> boards<00:00:48.320> but<00:00:49.320> this

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
measurements for these boards but this

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.470 
measurements for these boards but this
is<00:00:49.649> just<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.960> 3/4<00:00:51.960> inch<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.230> pine<00:00:56.480> some

is just a 3/4 inch it's like a pine some
really<00:00:58.170> nice<00:00:58.350> wood<00:00:59.329> using<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.719> ruler<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
really nice wood using the ruler just

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920 
really nice wood using the ruler just
I'm<00:01:03.270> going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> hit<00:01:03.660> mid<00:01:03.930> line<00:01:04.519> there<00:01:05.519> every<00:01:06.000> 14

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
I'm going to hit mid line there every 14

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.539 
I'm going to hit mid line there every 14
millimeters<00:01:07.770> apart<00:01:09.320> and<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:11.220> bottom

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
millimeters apart and when I the bottom

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.060 
millimeters apart and when I the bottom
this<00:01:11.729> way<00:01:12.060> left<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> right<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.890> at<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
this way left to right and then at the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.770 
this way left to right and then at the
top<00:01:14.250> left<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> right<00:01:16.880> puts<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.060> ended<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
top left to right puts it ended the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
top left to right puts it ended the
other<00:01:18.930> side<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.460> just<00:01:21.890> take<00:01:22.890> this

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
other side and now I just take this

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
other side and now I just take this
ruler<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.850> line<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:26.960> draw<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> line<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.180> you

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
ruler and line up draw a line and you

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
ruler and line up draw a line and you
want<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> make<00:01:30.780> sure<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.170> use<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> pencil<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
want to make sure you use a pencil that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.249 
want to make sure you use a pencil that
way<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:33.590> erase<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.049> need

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
way you can erase it and you don't need

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.310 
way you can erase it and you don't need
to<00:01:37.350> go<00:01:37.470> all<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.750> end<00:01:39.750> here

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to go all the way to the end here

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
to go all the way to the end here
because<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.490> gap<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:43.009> if<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.159> do

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
because you want to a gap but if you do

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.899 
because you want to a gap but if you do
it's<00:01:44.610> okay<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:46.740> also<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.340> erase<00:01:47.579> these

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
it's okay this also we can erase these

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.539 
it's okay this also we can erase these
edges<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> we'll<00:01:49.530> sand<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.220> down<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.399> little

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
edges and we'll sand it down a little

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.740 
edges and we'll sand it down a little
bit<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.090> get<00:01:51.450> rid<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.860> any<00:01:52.860> blurs<00:01:53.490> left<00:01:54.180> I'll<00:01:54.630> go

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
bit to get rid of any blurs left I'll go

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.469 
bit to get rid of any blurs left I'll go
ahead<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> after<00:01:56.430> erasing<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
ahead and do that so after erasing the

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
ahead and do that so after erasing the
extra<00:01:57.780> lines<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.259> handed<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> down<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.009> little

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
extra lines I handed it down a little

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.459 
extra lines I handed it down a little
bit<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.469> next<00:02:01.799> step<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.090> take<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.509> fine

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
bit and the next step is to take a fine

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.730 
bit and the next step is to take a fine
point<00:02:05.009> sharpie<00:02:05.840> though<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:07.110> an<00:02:07.259> ultra<00:02:07.680> fine

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
point sharpie though not an ultra fine

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.660 
point sharpie though not an ultra fine
and

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
and

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.630 
and
slowly<00:02:10.930> okay<00:02:11.930> something<00:02:12.260> online<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.860> you'll

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
slowly okay something online and you'll

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.660 
slowly okay something online and you'll
do<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.940> whole<00:02:14.060> board<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:15.680> around<00:02:16.040> these

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
do the whole board just around these

00:02:16.670 --> 00:04:08.550 
do the whole board just around these
edges<00:02:18.670> all<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.730> way<00:02:19.879> around

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.220 

now<00:04:09.560> don't<00:04:09.800> forget<00:04:10.010> your<00:04:10.340> star<00:04:10.970> point<00:04:12.550> which

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
now don't forget your star point which

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.710 
now don't forget your star point which
just<00:04:15.230> make<00:04:15.380> a<00:04:15.410> little<00:04:15.620> circle<00:04:15.830> there<00:04:16.720> they're

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
just make a little circle there they're

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.430 
just make a little circle there they're
four<00:04:18.350> by<00:04:18.470> four<00:04:18.850> for<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.940> corners<00:04:20.269> and<00:04:20.510> four<00:04:21.260> by

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
four by four for the corners and four by

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.370 
four by four for the corners and four by
10<00:04:22.010> here<00:04:22.400> in<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.610> middle<00:04:22.940> which<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:26.380> right

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
10 here in the middle which is right

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.690 
10 here in the middle which is right
here

backside first so that I can flip it

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.280 
backside first so that I can flip it
over<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.740> just<00:05:11.220> let<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.760> top<00:05:11.940> air<00:05:12.120> dry<00:05:12.420> I'm

over and just let the top air dry I'm
not<00:05:13.680> worried<00:05:14.070> about<00:05:14.160> how<00:05:14.460> the<00:05:14.520> top<00:05:14.880> looks<00:05:15.210> if

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
not worried about how the top looks if

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.890 
not worried about how the top looks if
any<00:05:15.690> dust<00:05:16.070> gets<00:05:17.070> tough<00:05:17.370> on<00:05:17.580> it<00:05:17.760> which<00:05:18.540> I<00:05:18.750> am

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
going to let it dry first obviously but

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.790 
going to let it dry first obviously but
it's<00:05:23.790> not<00:05:23.910> a<00:05:23.940> big<00:05:24.480> concern<00:05:24.870> of<00:05:24.900> mine<00:05:25.170> if

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800

whereas the front is going to be an

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.400 
whereas the front is going to be an
issue<00:05:30.840> and<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:33.180> want<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.420> go<00:05:33.540> with<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.900> the
