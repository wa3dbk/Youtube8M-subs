00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi it's up to two canes for more 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.520
 late crocodile 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.849
 today we will be interested in the game 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.719
 age also informs patients with 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.179
 a strategy 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.210
 seventh to win a skirmish enough 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 so quickly for these strategies 1 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.859
 the museum to be minimum level this part 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.590
 to the controls equipment to survive 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.960
 you will understand why 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.359
 I will try at level 3 creating 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.450
 a new estate 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.440
 it did not work for the Nazis here I am 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.210
 you concede to have a minimum 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.290
 equipment 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.989
 that allows the team is enough 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.640
 so here we go soon 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.640
 right now 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.640
 celtix 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:56.640
 I sing to the brain 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:05.129
 there I am 1016 16 10 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.740
 not sure it's important so the idea 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.290
 in fact it is not a reader to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.960
 the opponent to do anything 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.090
 you have to be fast enough and it will be 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 only former 40 left is rather 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.330
 hold me in my case you will see 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.270
 some 37 advisers 40,37 that does not 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.920
 change nothing so what's good is 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 a thanks to the quests can win a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.640
 advise quickly enough everything 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.899
 so I take it I put it in scene when 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.640
 I recall easier tray 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.770
 not so much know a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.310
 standard victory card no matter 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.009
 which 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.479
 except that there must be no 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 of bodies of water that we can not 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.380
 to cross at best 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:59.720
 so that's 2510 but then when the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.720
 levels it's 16 so these parties 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.289
 search 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.770
 so with the three basic villagers 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.930
 you can live a barracks then 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:22.320
 launched two three villages just here 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 so everything is there so you have to know 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.230
 that the miss always weighs the opposite of 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.580
 mud skirmish one against a 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.970
 so no need to go sports and 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.970
 his village 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.920
 so that's it so I've already seen the joy of 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.820
 the food 3 that makes the barracks 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.820
 which is soon over 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.340
 according to you put them directly the 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.310
 food and could launch from the first 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.170
 launch so on if you have 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:01.070
 makes five or six villagers to 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:03.890
 do one or two and so the idea was 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.810
 launched a maximum of throwing until 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.580
 that you have reached 1.2 population 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:12.280
 it just can work with me 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.180
 but it's just a question of 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.180
 make sure of the victory 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.790
 it's a strategy that's a bit 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:32.750
 similar that proposed by ed gein 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.260
 forever in unstoppable Deves not except 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:39.650
 that here in this case we reverse a 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.440
 standard or even bed wants above but 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.080
 you have to adapt the number of shots 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.630
 compared to the villagers came on 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.100
 choose it is valid 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.200
 also if you choose another 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.519
 civilization than the one you will see 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 that sometimes you have to do less 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.459
 villagers at most villagers and the 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.440
 final differentiating by name 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:11.299
 if your opponent celebrates bow bows 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:15.620
 wave a diagram you if I you 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:19.190
 will explain this to tokyo there is two 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.780
 minutes the party started wales is 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.890
 a little longer than the strategy became 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.320
 studies for woerth 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.320
 only what we are all alone 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.560
 we see that we are close to 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:36.860
 events soon to be able to pass 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.860
 to the attacked 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.190
 two little launches he 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.570
 we are waiting to write him a group to 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.900
 the scout to the scout is worth relaunch 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:04.940
 important and which should occupy both 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.460
 arpente who are going to be if they are going to be 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.870
 to the door of the enemy so that's 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.490
 geneva a dense population and treks 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.990
 I just take that the latter 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.990
 form the last 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:28.770
 we could go like this a 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:36.660
 pressure for campuses left just 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:41.210
 a course mode to shit I not disabled 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:44.729
 asking him from healthy assets 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.310
 sorry but their game by martigues was 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.880
 placed in camera it's a little weird 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.880
 shaded part 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.910
 so as I said the opposite to 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.910
 opposite 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.120
 and 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:12.080
 who will have a lot of losses but 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:15.460
 the important final 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.460
 victory lacarne 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.350
 So here we attack directly his 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.830
 forum one selects the lighting will be 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.780
 go over for the infantry Harcourt 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:36.110
 so the difference he makes supports 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.280
 the combine as a head hunter 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:40.830
 others it is necessary to attack it with 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.780
 all the drugs we throw 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.120
 apply because the riders like 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:48.180
 tetouan want to follow a plumb and 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.460
 so your balance there with the fangs 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:53.160
 occupy them but if it's riders 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.540
 that will not solve the need for them 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.710
 dress up kill the franchises 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.590
 take care of the body says no there you see 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:03.540
 so that the news is already 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:05.160
 of the mountain here we see that the 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.800
 forum is coming back but it's our boss 

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:09.600
 is it possible 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.090
 but that is so after four 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.770
 minutes at age 28 she was the cousin 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.570
 can make more quickly surprised more 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.810
 of veiled face are chosen for example 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.810
 the bins 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:26.630
 here and I think I have said everything so 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.800
 find an equipment a point that's 

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.510
 why in this phase enough of 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.460
 damage for probation break 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:37.180
 I believe that your surviving actor 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:39.440
 moment to fool at the trefoils and three 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:48.530
 victories and a month and a half without much 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:50.300
 efforts I'm told here I drive and 

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.430
 that allows especially when we have three 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:57.520
 bronze genies for example 1 to 16 hours 

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:57.520
 stack is new the winning points 

00:07:57.550 --> 00:08:04.129
 this is for hi 

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:04.129
 1
