00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.760
 the agreement makes sense it's a motion logging method initiated by 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.099
 is it denis polls to doubt it 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.289
 these depositions of ancient 10:55 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.890
 during the crisis the feet 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.009
 so here I put my feet 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:21.529
 on the ground 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.449
 and then then finally write not to miss my feet and I even 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.449
 theme announced on Saturday a judge but germany who are 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.100
 it's a little bit of a personage character 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.220
 this is my little man is like that I do not know we can aim five 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.819
 people 

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:42.809
 she committed herself as the Korean lotte friis% to 6 5 very little girl 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.809
 his sons 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.270
 but I never really managed complete score at this period g 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 he can divert rehearsals 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510
 and then and then it's this desire to see I do not know which cryptology 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.400
 note that all the choreography of the pillars 592 very packed 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.930
 in fact it is very important to be at the time of creations 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.020
 because we have all the information per cent when that will give the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.960
 dancers to make a movement so if it is really high the heart of 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.170
 movement took place the basis of the movement 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.480
 and percent and so that I note as each day I note the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.450
 change 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.590
 after the installer changes things completely and we note that 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.590
 the partition the group whose partition evolves every day 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.280
 and then there is a period of copies 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620
 which takes a lot of time 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.330
 to clean up all this information effect distribution of 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.560
 reference 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.710
 unlike others the notation of the Raelian movement indicated to 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.179
 other 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.770
 she is very simple% an idea or pink% and if achievement there are some 

00:01:51.769 --> 00:01:54.100
 choice is an interesting action 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 so choose framing I mean head shot of two parts 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.820
 % and so we do not necessarily see the feet we can not necessarily a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.240
 important return to the afp 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.429
 percent an exit and secondly his opinion hold a sit-in country capture 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.429
 what has not been done in FinistÃ¨re and covers 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.539
 for 100 th 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.109
 keep and interpretation 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:24.879
 thanks from you is an atheist 24 hours the same way 6 you want 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.849
 and more time to correct 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.920
 the video here 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.920
 the memory a whole show the day 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.440
 our partisan 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.389
 franck ribery if the two years of work 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:39.459
 per minute 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.149
 other images 

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.249
 in the end ie once we should finish 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.479
 you have to start again you have to save all but all of them 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.229
 with music signed to music 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:54.609
 then percent and so is you have to be 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.050
 everything organized and you have to write healthy plants 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.600
 to write or read in this report between the dancers so and if it was 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.669
 to redo 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:07.399
 in more simple as much information as possible
