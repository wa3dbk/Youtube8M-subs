00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:26.170 
tablet better you can see it got a calm

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.150 
tablet better you can see it got a calm
down<00:00:26.380> the<00:00:26.470> bottom<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:28.710> 123<00:00:29.710> must<00:00:29.890> be<00:00:30.009> about

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
down the bottom and 123 must be about

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.549 
down the bottom and 123 must be about
four<00:00:30.849> maybe<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:31.660> eight<00:00:31.779> rows<00:00:32.020> i'm<00:00:32.259> not<00:00:32.410> sure

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
four maybe it's eight rows i'm not sure

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.670

but<00:00:32.770> this<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.579> tablet<00:00:33.910> better<00:00:34.090> anyway<00:00:34.680> what

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
but this is a tablet better anyway what

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.270 
but this is a tablet better anyway what
i<00:00:35.739> thought<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:35.980> do<00:00:36.100> is<00:00:36.520> open<00:00:37.030> up<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.390> browser

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
i thought of do is open up the browser

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.819 
i thought of do is open up the browser
actually<00:00:39.280> better<00:00:39.579> turn<00:00:39.760> on<00:00:39.879> Wi-Fi<00:00:40.059> first<00:00:40.829> exit

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
actually better turn on Wi-Fi first exit

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.049 
actually better turn on Wi-Fi first exit
out<00:00:41.980> of<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:44.160> well<00:00:45.160> that's<00:00:45.370> connecting<00:00:45.910> I

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
out of that well that's connecting I

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.310 
out of that well that's connecting I
might<00:00:46.270> show<00:00:46.510> you<00:00:46.539> what<00:00:46.750> the<00:00:46.840> video<00:00:47.050> playback

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
might show you what the video playback

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.779 
might show you what the video playback
is<00:00:47.680> like<00:00:47.890> I'm<00:00:48.460> using<00:00:49.350> rock<00:00:50.350> player<00:00:50.620> as<00:00:50.860> my

00:00:51.779 --> 00:00:51.789 
is like I'm using rock player as my

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.900 
is like I'm using rock player as my
movie<00:00:52.090> player<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:54.190> first<00:00:54.399> one<00:00:54.550> we'll<00:00:54.670> try

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
movie player the first one we'll try

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.819 
movie player the first one we'll try
this<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.539> XP<00:00:56.530> ID<00:00:56.739> with<00:00:57.579> a<00:00:57.609> c3<00:00:58.149> audio<00:00:58.469> now<00:00:59.469> I've

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
this is a XP ID with a c3 audio now I've

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.049 
this is a XP ID with a c3 audio now I've
already<00:00:59.980> tried<00:01:00.219> this<00:01:00.370> on<00:01:00.489> hardware<00:01:00.910> decoding

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
already tried this on hardware decoding

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.520 
already tried this on hardware decoding
it<00:01:01.420> didn't<00:01:01.719> work<00:01:01.870> so<00:01:02.109> i'm<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:02.350> show<00:01:02.500> you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
it didn't work so i'm going to show you

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.280 
it didn't work so i'm going to show you
the<00:01:02.620> software<00:01:03.010> decoding<00:01:04.980> and<00:01:06.960> you'll<00:01:07.960> see<00:01:08.200> it

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
the software decoding and you'll see it

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.490 
the software decoding and you'll see it
works<00:01:08.500> absolutely<00:01:09.460> fine<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.410> would

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
works absolutely fine as you would

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.230 
works absolutely fine as you would
expect<00:01:11.560> though<00:01:12.160> there's<00:01:12.610> no<00:01:12.760> reason<00:01:13.090> why<00:01:13.210> I

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
expect though there's no reason why I

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
expect though there's no reason why I
shouldn't<00:01:13.540> play<00:01:13.840> something<00:01:14.740> like<00:01:14.830> this<00:01:16.260> it's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
shouldn't play something like this it's

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.460 
shouldn't play something like this it's
one<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.470> 24<00:01:17.800> x<00:01:17.950> 600<00:01:18.460> screen<00:01:18.820> now<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.900> residence

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
one of 24 x 600 screen now the residence

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.370 
one of 24 x 600 screen now the residence
is<00:01:20.770> probably<00:01:21.310> favorite<00:01:21.640> lower<00:01:21.850> but<00:01:22.630> it<00:01:22.990> still

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
is probably favorite lower but it still

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.630 
is probably favorite lower but it still
looks<00:01:23.940> very<00:01:24.940> good<00:01:25.350> certainly<00:01:26.350> watchable<00:01:26.710> 16

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
looks very good certainly watchable 16

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.770 
looks very good certainly watchable 16
by<00:01:27.760> 9<00:01:27.970> aspect<00:01:28.750> ratio<00:01:29.320> definitely<00:01:29.740> helps<00:01:29.980> here

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
by 9 aspect ratio definitely helps here

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.570 
by 9 aspect ratio definitely helps here
now<00:01:31.780> that's<00:01:32.200> done<00:01:32.740> let's<00:01:33.010> have<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.280> look<00:01:33.400> at<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
now that's done let's have a look at the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.710 
now that's done let's have a look at the
browser<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.460> see<00:01:36.700> all<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.450> probably

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
browser you can see all you probably

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.590 
browser you can see all you probably
will<00:01:37.870> know<00:01:38.020> but<00:01:38.530> I'm<00:01:38.710> admin<00:01:39.460> Vega<00:01:39.640> is<00:01:40.240> very
