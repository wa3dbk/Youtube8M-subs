00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.560
 hello today I will advise you how to cool 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.840
 a wine a little more quickly 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.189
 imagine that you have guests and you 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.730
 you forgot to put the white wine 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.250
 or the rosÃ© wine or a champagne in the fridge 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.610
 or in the freezer you do not have time 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.840
 it's going to cool down we can do 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.579
 we take the ice bucket 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.670
 ice 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.220
 water and salt as they are like a recipe for 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.900
 kitchen 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.900
 we could ice the ice bucket 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.050
 the more and the better 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 we will add the water 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.180
 so that it covers the bottle as much as possible 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.450
 we will put the bottle 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.399
 and we will add the salt 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.079
 what salt does is melt before 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.149
 ice in this way the water cools 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.600
 faster that will use us faster 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.600
