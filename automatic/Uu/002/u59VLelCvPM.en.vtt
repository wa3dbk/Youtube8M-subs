00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.320
 Good today. I'll tell you how. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 What happens to that fighter's ear? 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 everybody says I want he indicated 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.930
 flower because they who the ear of that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.670
 Good way is the following ear to it's 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.009
 formed is eternally cartilage in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.520
 has a very thin layer of skin 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.520
 between this skin and cartilage has 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.040
 connective tissue called peri kong and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.450
 he is responsible for nutrition in the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.820
 cartilage 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.789
 so what happens to the frictions the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.640
 crushing neco against the ground other 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.920
 mainly in jiu jitsu what 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.699
 happens it goes forming a hematoma 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 between the box and the skin. 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.870
 bruise it ends up becoming a 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.510
 inflammation and lack of supply 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.970
 blood of the cartilage 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.250
 she goes necrosis and goes 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.549
 causing severe fibrosis and from there 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.290
 this new cartilage arises right from here 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.960
 forming one on top of the other and all 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.439
 leonardo is forming more and more 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 more and everyone then how do you do 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.080
 not to have your fighter surname 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.970
 the guy does not have this ear he should 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.310
 every time he finished the fight 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 finish the training he should already do 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.189
 a drain not to stay solemn 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.430
 would have to remove everything and if that blood 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:41.729
 ear like no one does this and even 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.670
 because the cauliflower ear is almost 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.070
 that a status has people until you search 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.070
 on the internet how to let ear 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.579
 cauliflower put a faith in this and there are people 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.189
 which ends up using pliers to leave 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.369
 ear that way and accelerate the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.360
 information process 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:06.000
 So whoever already has the fighter's ear is 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.300
 with plastic surgery anyway 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.619
 it will never be the same and if you 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 want to do 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.140
 already wants to make jiu jitsu and should be 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.239
 asking, but I do not want 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.470
 my ear stays that way a lot 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.470
 ugly 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.810
 that there are years of practice the guy has 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.690
 that being very professional doing several 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.239
 Sometimes then neither will you say that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.180
 every person who goes to the gym is 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.110
 Giant is strong, it's not quite like us. 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.060
 so no stereotypes, not the ear of 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.450
 fighter is really professional guy 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.549
 man who trains a lot of time is good 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.549
 it then until next week here there
