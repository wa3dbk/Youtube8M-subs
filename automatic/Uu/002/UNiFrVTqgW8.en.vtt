 to the channel is a tutorial on how to launch 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.219
 The C4 is so far 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 first is to have that 4 have hands 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 agile 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 to my taste more than anything because if it takes 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:28.369
 well and that he had the aim and so 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.369
 what it has to do 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.449
 what you have to do is if you litigate 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.449
 cr2 make time for home 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.840
 it takes more time to network or I recommend you 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.770
 what do you do about the square square 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.750
 double square because it 's better 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.750
 and the car was transported good 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.530
 savior 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 I can not change 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 22 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.670
 today 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.939
 I can show you now uncle 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.899
 or maybe that's what he applied to look at him 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.899
 You dedicated yourself when you have this 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.690
 and well that what I do is out 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.030
 all right 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.030
 good is one thing that is in 4 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 together 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 and good that is that more than anything what 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.560
 Now I explain it to you better but it makes 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.670
 6,000 put it against all 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.670
 it's the bad 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.390
 because I'm liking has made that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.600
 uses four pulling ago and knew what 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.200
 learned watching videos 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.200
 and if you're not going to see how we're going to shut up 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.440
 to see them 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.840
 it has 64 you have to do is 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.030
 this movement and drop it I do not know if it's worth 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.630
 and it's worth 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.630
 eleven 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.030
 reid and bread 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.719

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:22.040
 there 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.600
 and we look at pillar for these variables 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.340

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.050
