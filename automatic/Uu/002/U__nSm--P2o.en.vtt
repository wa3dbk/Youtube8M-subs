 period will teach you how to hide a 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.970
 application on s7 runs on it 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.309
 good people to start you have to have 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.040
 a complete application page ok 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.080
 one of which is a folder you go 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.449
 have a folder using two applications 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.289

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 Do you want to hide? 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.269
 You have to put in the dock in case 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.519

 two clicks on the button as we go there 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.590
 So it will only happen when you 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.180
