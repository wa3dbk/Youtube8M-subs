next<00:00:00.450> we'll<00:00:00.570> cover<00:00:00.690> balance<00:00:01.140> charging

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
next we'll cover balance charging

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.130 
next we'll cover balance charging
balance<00:00:02.340> charging<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.850> basically<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
balance charging is basically the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.380 
balance charging is basically the
ability<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.560> tap<00:00:04.890> into<00:00:05.130> each<00:00:05.370> individual<00:00:06.060> cell

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
ability to tap into each individual cell

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.589 
ability to tap into each individual cell
within<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.020> lipo<00:00:07.319> pack<00:00:07.639> in<00:00:08.639> order<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.090> bring

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
within a lipo pack in order to bring

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810 
within a lipo pack in order to bring
them<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.929> to<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.320> equal<00:00:10.710> level<00:00:11.040> charge<00:00:11.460> so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
them up to the equal level charge so

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.640 
them up to the equal level charge so
that<00:00:11.969> they're<00:00:12.179> not<00:00:12.300> out<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> balance

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
that they're not out of balance

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.700 
that they're not out of balance
the<00:00:14.490> basic<00:00:14.940> theory<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.529> want

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
the basic theory there is that you want

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.769 
the basic theory there is that you want
your<00:00:16.770> battery<00:00:16.980> pack<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.580> push<00:00:17.789> evenly<00:00:18.480> through

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
your battery pack to push evenly through

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.099 
your battery pack to push evenly through
all<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.619> cells<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.460> if<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.730> 2<00:00:20.970> 3<00:00:21.390> 5<00:00:21.810> 10

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
all the cells so if you have 2 3 5 10

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.170 
all the cells so if you have 2 3 5 10
cells<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.949> want<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.519> be<00:00:23.699> matched<00:00:23.970> in

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
cells you want them all to be matched in

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.640 
cells you want them all to be matched in
terms<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.539> voltage<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.109> they<00:00:25.289> all<00:00:25.410> pull

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
terms of voltage so that they all pull

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.730 
terms of voltage so that they all pull
evenly<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> flipside<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.590> you

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
evenly and the flipside to that is you

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
evenly and the flipside to that is you
want<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.189> discharge<00:00:29.760> evenly<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:30.359> they

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
want them to discharge evenly if they

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.229 
want them to discharge evenly if they
discharge<00:00:31.189> erratically<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.000> goes

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
discharge erratically one if one goes

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.780 
discharge erratically one if one goes
too<00:00:33.570> far<00:00:33.809> below<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.320> rest<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.130> actually<00:00:35.579> will

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
too far below the rest it actually will

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.299 
too far below the rest it actually will
stress<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.120> cell<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> as<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> result<00:00:38.190> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
stress that cell and as a result you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.340 
stress that cell and as a result you
could<00:00:38.520> cause<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> failure<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.899> your<00:00:40.020> battery

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
could cause a failure of your battery

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.500 
could cause a failure of your battery
pack<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.340> really<00:00:41.489> important<00:00:41.969> after<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
pack so it's really important after so

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
pack so it's really important after so
many<00:00:42.600> cycles<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.530> check<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.879> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
many cycles to check on that on the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
many cycles to check on that on the
condition<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.660> battery<00:00:46.530> pack<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> make

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
condition of your battery pack and make

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.049 
condition of your battery pack and make
sure<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:48.210> your<00:00:49.129> individual<00:00:50.129> cell<00:00:50.399> voltages

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
sure that your individual cell voltages

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.060 
sure that your individual cell voltages
are<00:00:51.329> within<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.930> few<00:00:52.079> tenths<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.649> volt<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
are within a few tenths of a volt of

later one common misconception between

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.800 
later one common misconception between
lipo<00:01:14.040> charging<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.790> balanced<00:01:15.180> charging<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
lipo charging and balanced charging is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.499 
lipo charging and balanced charging is
that<00:01:16.369> lipo<00:01:17.369> charging<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.330> basic

lipo balance press the button the next

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.700 
lipo balance press the button the next
the<00:02:33.090> next<00:02:33.360> option<00:02:33.810> there<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.050> how<00:02:34.350> put<00:02:34.560> your

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
the next option there is how put your

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.590 
the next option there is how put your
amperage<00:02:35.550> your<00:02:35.760> charge<00:02:36.000> rate<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.300> going<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.480> be

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
amperage your charge rate is going to be

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.380 
amperage your charge rate is going to be
so<00:02:37.500> you're<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.910> change<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.000> value<00:02:39.360> to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
so you're going to change the value to

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.470 
so you're going to change the value to
match<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.410> battery<00:02:40.710> pack<00:02:41.240> again<00:02:42.240> we're<00:02:42.390> going

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
match the battery pack again we're going

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
match the battery pack again we're going
to<00:02:42.540> follow<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.020> 1c<00:02:43.440> charge<00:02:43.740> rule<00:02:44.010> like<00:02:44.220> we've

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
to follow the 1c charge rule like we've

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.890 
to follow the 1c charge rule like we've
expressed<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.880> next<00:02:48.120> choice<00:02:48.360> is<00:02:48.390> how<00:02:48.720> many

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
expressed the next choice is how many

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.340 
expressed the next choice is how many
cells<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.800> you're<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.190> to<00:02:50.220> look<00:02:50.430> at<00:02:50.990> 1s<00:02:51.990> 2s

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
cells so you're going to look at 1s 2s

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.420 
cells so you're going to look at 1s 2s
3s<00:02:52.530> now<00:02:53.420> 1s<00:02:54.420> 2s<00:02:54.600> 3s<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:55.410> basically<00:02:55.830> tells<00:02:56.190> us

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
3s now 1s 2s 3s this basically tells us

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.870 
3s now 1s 2s 3s this basically tells us

to say yes and now the battery packs
being<00:03:22.860> balanced<00:03:23.370> charge<00:03:23.670> now<00:03:23.970> if<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:25.110> want<00:03:25.290> to

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
being balanced charge now if you want to

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.280 
being balanced charge now if you want to
view<00:03:25.590> your<00:03:25.770> individual<00:03:26.340> cell<00:03:27.110> voltages<00:03:28.110> you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
view your individual cell voltages you

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.590 
view your individual cell voltages you
can<00:03:28.440> press<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.830> increase<00:03:29.220> button<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.790> that

can press the increase button and that

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.120 
can press the increase button and that
gives<00:03:30.840> you<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:30.989> new<00:03:31.230> screen<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.620> shows<00:03:31.980> you

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
gives you a new screen that shows you

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.100 
gives you a new screen that shows you
the<00:03:32.250> individual<00:03:32.700> cell<00:03:33.060> values<00:03:33.540> and<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:33.900> can

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
the individual cell values and this can

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.820 
the individual cell values and this can
do<00:03:34.610> six<00:03:35.610> cells<00:03:36.080> but<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:37.320> case<00:03:37.530> we're<00:03:37.709> only

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
do six cells but in this case we're only

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.440 
do six cells but in this case we're only
looking<00:03:37.980> at<00:03:38.190> two<00:03:38.370> so<00:03:38.640> in<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.910> case<00:03:39.209> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
looking at two so in this case the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.510 
looking at two so in this case the
battery<00:03:39.780> pack<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.200> at<00:03:40.350> three<00:03:40.890> point<00:03:41.130> nine<00:03:41.190> five

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
battery pack is at three point nine five

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.890 
battery pack is at three point nine five
on<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.820> first<00:03:42.060> cell<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.450> three<00:03:42.630> point<00:03:42.840> nine

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
on the first cell and three point nine

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.509 
on the first cell and three point nine
five<00:03:43.230> on<00:03:43.440> the<00:03:43.530> second<00:03:43.890> cell<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
five on the second cell so this is

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.750 
five on the second cell so this is
considered<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:45.030> balanced<00:03:45.480> pack
