in this game in my opinion one of the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.630 
in this game in my opinion one of the
biggest<00:04:01.780> negatives<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:03.100> game<00:04:03.280> can<00:04:03.519> get

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
biggest negatives is the game can get

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.420 
biggest negatives is the game can get
extremely<00:04:03.940> repetitive<00:04:04.660> extremely<00:04:05.650> fast<00:04:05.950> you

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
do the same thing over and over and over

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.220 
do the same thing over and over and over
again<00:04:09.239> but<00:04:10.239> sometimes<00:04:10.780> I<00:04:10.900> throw<00:04:11.080> in<00:04:11.200> a

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
again but sometimes I throw in a

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.440 
again but sometimes I throw in a
helicopter<00:04:11.410> chase<00:04:12.010> in<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.760> the
