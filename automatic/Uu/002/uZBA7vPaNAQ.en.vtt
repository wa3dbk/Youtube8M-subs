00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
have a production variation of this for

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
have a production variation of this for
development<00:00:57.059> that's<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.809> blender<00:00:58.320> format

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
development that's in blender format

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189 
development that's in blender format
that<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> download<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.079> make

that you can download and you can make
accessories<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.629> will<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.989> soon

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
accessories for I will have that soon

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469 
accessories for I will have that soon
for<00:01:04.799> him<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.460> have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> reorganize<00:01:06.030> my

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
for him I just have to reorganize my

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.520 
for him I just have to reorganize my
stuff<00:01:07.369> now<00:01:08.510> what<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> did<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> after<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.380> went

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
stuff now what I did is after I went

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.719 
stuff now what I did is after I went
from<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> female<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:12.390> went<00:01:12.900> back<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:14.430> one

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
from the female I went back to this one

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.120 
from the female I went back to this one
and<00:01:15.350> behind<00:01:16.350> your<00:01:16.470> back

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
and behind your back

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.300 
and behind your back
I<00:01:17.159> added<00:01:17.939> new<00:01:18.299> joints<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.900> put<00:01:19.710> an<00:01:19.860> update<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I added new joints I put an update in

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.330 
I added new joints I put an update in
there<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> said<00:01:20.759> hey<00:01:21.240> I<00:01:21.270> updated<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there I said hey I updated this but the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
there I said hey I updated this but the
new<00:01:23.490> joints<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.119> ball<00:01:24.659> joints<00:01:25.140> instead<00:01:25.530> of

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
new joints are ball joints instead of

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.670 
new joints are ball joints instead of
ball<00:01:25.950> collet<00:01:26.939> joints<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.530> no

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
ball collet joints so there's no

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.069 
ball collet joints so there's no
internal<00:01:29.369> collet<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.299> anymore<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
internal collet in here anymore the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.399 
internal collet in here anymore the
friction<00:01:31.530> collet<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.670> found<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.960> useless

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
friction collet I found it to be useless

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.640 
friction collet I found it to be useless
so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.970> rid<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.140> it's<00:01:37.320> just<00:01:37.439> a

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
so I got rid of it and now it's just a

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
so I got rid of it and now it's just a
simple<00:01:38.040> ball<00:01:38.220> joint<00:01:38.549> same<00:01:39.420> with<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.960> waist

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
simple ball joint same with the waist

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.460 
simple ball joint same with the waist
but<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.159> thought<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.970> know<00:01:42.090> 18<00:01:42.899> inches<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
but I thought you know 18 inches is

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.130 
but I thought you know 18 inches is
pretty<00:01:43.979> big<00:01:44.780> right<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.439> what<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:48.110> he<00:01:49.110> was

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
pretty big right so what if he was

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.429 
pretty big right so what if he was
scalable<00:01:50.060> what<00:01:51.060> if<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> way

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
scalable what if you can go all the way

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.850 
scalable what if you can go all the way
down<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:54.470> 9<00:01:55.470> inches

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
down to 9 inches

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.800 
down to 9 inches
so<00:01:57.860> here<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.310> a<00:01:58.340> nine-inch<00:01:58.880> Dexter<00:01:59.390> he's

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so here is a nine-inch Dexter he's

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.000 
so here is a nine-inch Dexter he's
actually<00:02:00.020> really<00:02:00.440> sturdy

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
actually really sturdy

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.170 
actually really sturdy
it's<00:02:01.190> almost<00:02:01.310> sturdier<00:02:01.790> than<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.030> other

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
it's almost sturdier than the other

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.810 
it's almost sturdier than the other
month<00:02:02.530> he's<00:02:03.530> really<00:02:03.950> shiny<00:02:04.220> because<00:02:04.550> he's

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
month he's really shiny because he's

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.419 
month he's really shiny because he's
been<00:02:05.410> dipped<00:02:08.080> but<00:02:09.080> this<00:02:09.500> variation<00:02:10.070> doesn't

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
been dipped but this variation doesn't

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.500 
been dipped but this variation doesn't
have<00:02:10.670> any<00:02:11.030> need<00:02:12.020> for<00:02:12.050> any<00:02:12.530> kind<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.920> like

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
have any need for any kind of like

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.790 
have any need for any kind of like
friction<00:02:14.510> glue<00:02:14.959> or<00:02:15.350> anything<00:02:15.560> like<00:02:15.740> that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
friction glue or anything like that

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.340 
friction glue or anything like that
that's<00:02:16.340> why<00:02:16.459> my<00:02:16.640> hands<00:02:16.970> are<00:02:17.000> black<00:02:17.690> because<00:02:17.959> I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
that's why my hands are black because I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.640 
that's why my hands are black because I

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
all you would do is have to download

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.479

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
the g-code out you just print them at

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.960 
the g-code out you just print them at
50%<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.640> that's<00:02:44.000> what<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.480> now<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:45.970> worked

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
50% and that's what you get now I worked

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.550 
50% and that's what you get now I worked
on<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.150> couple<00:02:47.209> of<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.660> joints<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.200> make<00:02:48.350> them<00:02:48.500> a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
on a couple of the joints to make them a

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.470 
on a couple of the joints to make them a
little<00:02:48.680> stronger<00:02:49.130> when<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.880> comes<00:02:50.090> down<00:02:50.269> to

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
little stronger when it comes down to

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.990 
little stronger when it comes down to
being<00:02:50.660> smaller<00:02:54.220> and<00:02:55.220> again<00:02:55.550> those<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:55.790> all

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
being smaller and again those are all

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.220 
being smaller and again those are all
updated<00:02:56.480> too<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.760> took<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.600> ones<00:02:59.870> from

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
updated too so I took the ones from

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.680 
updated too so I took the ones from
Thingiverse<00:03:00.739> downloaded<00:03:01.400> them<00:03:01.549> printed<00:03:02.480> all

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
Thingiverse downloaded them printed all

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.350
