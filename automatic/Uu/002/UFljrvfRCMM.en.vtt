00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
this is not too difficult mission this

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.770 
this is not too difficult mission this
is<00:02:16.130> at<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.489> my<00:02:16.700> opinion<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.269> second<00:02:17.630> hardest

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
is at in my opinion the second hardest

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.180 
is at in my opinion the second hardest
to<00:02:18.350> do<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:20.540> get<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.870> achievement<00:02:20.959> on<00:02:21.470> simply

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
to do to get the achievement on simply

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.750 
to do to get the achievement on simply
because<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:24.130> there's<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.250> good<00:02:25.370> chance<00:02:25.580> you're

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
because you there's a good chance you're

not<00:02:25.850> gonna<00:02:25.940> have<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> good<00:02:26.269> multiplier<00:02:26.840> at<00:02:26.959> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
not gonna have a good multiplier at the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.570 
not gonna have a good multiplier at the

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
actually sink and his body will drop

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.790 
actually sink and his body will drop
down<00:03:34.250> through<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:35.030> platform<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.350> that's

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800

some fun with that um yeah video is
almost<00:05:50.840> over<00:05:51.259> and<00:05:51.849> because<00:05:52.849> the<00:05:53.000> 1.5<00:05:53.449> times

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
almost over and because the 1.5 times

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.800 
almost over and because the 1.5 times
multiplier<00:05:54.199> I<00:05:54.319> have<00:05:54.620> another<00:05:55.370> points<00:05:55.879> I<00:05:56.029> think

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
multiplier I have another points I think

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.600 
multiplier I have another points I think
the<00:05:56.960> 1.5<00:05:57.520> ends<00:05:58.520> at<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.779> 15-minute<00:05:59.779> mark<00:06:00.610> but

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
the 1.5 ends at the 15-minute mark but

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.379 
the 1.5 ends at the 15-minute mark but
don't<00:06:01.819> quote<00:06:02.000> me<00:06:02.210> on<00:06:02.240> that<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:04.430> might<00:06:05.090> end<00:06:05.120> at

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:05.389 
don't quote me on that it might end at

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:07.029 
don't quote me on that it might end at
the<00:06:05.509> hour<00:06:05.689> mark<00:06:05.870> because<00:06:06.469> this<00:06:06.740> is<00:06:06.860> a<00:06:06.889> long

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 
the hour mark because this is a long

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:09.429 
the hour mark because this is a long
mission<00:06:07.279> so<00:06:08.029> you<00:06:08.449> can<00:06:08.599> watch<00:06:08.779> a<00:06:08.990> little<00:06:09.229> tiny
