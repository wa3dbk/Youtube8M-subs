00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 pc for android 4.0 comes with hdmi to the 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.379
 TV connected 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.779
 the front of it here is the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.609
 power supply of volker angel for the 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.310
 logitech a400 keyboard 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.550
 this practical way your son mao 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.009
 went so see this an easy 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.000
 nice big keys so like the hard ones 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.590
 Conditions of the mini pc for android 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.989
 has already started and I wanted to 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 The clock is the better control 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 I was just standing by logitech 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.539
 Let's get out how to use it then 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 here can the kathrein directly 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.960
 use or here about the 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.199
 properties on the tg completely too 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.079
 the current television program wants the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.040
 the receiver is programmed 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.380
 the recording planned without a plan main 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.689
 the preview is included 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.659
 come later and also that recordings 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:19.250
 from the side is not so good at the beginning 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 it is now running times 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.540
 For example , Galileo program 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.170
 seven double-click comes a little 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.150
 Information can be recorded directly 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 or watch 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 there was on approach to linked in 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 vlc player starts immediately the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.360
 Cameras have permanently hit one has 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.299
 Immediately the picture and my on the 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.420
 keyboard or completely sound off it works too 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.220
 very handy for on the k 400 or 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:54.350
 number to quieter 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:02:01.550
 lauda it 's very fast very much 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:04.910
 practically the current live stream of 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.250
 bonus when you hammer new program 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:12.620
 Just go back up twice 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:18.170
 we're fucked the vox program which 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.690
 runs watch here and will be direct 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.150
 Istria will start again soon 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:31.700
 So switching time actually okay for 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:35.090
 which belongs to the people of kathrein 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.100
 We have everything from recording to planning 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.050
 already seen that it's going to preview 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.760
 you can look right here before 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.870
 good cards look bad or 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:52.480
 record just record so then it is 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.480
 train in the recording planning now 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.690
 recordings of a heard so displayed 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.790
 would actually have to take your pictures 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.340
 are still likely to euro 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.560
 you also know the beta now wants 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 I slate the recording here 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 displayed is displayed but 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.870
 The disadvantage is if you now times 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.060
 curse of the caribbean and is at the lake 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:44.700
 you can not fast forward to the model 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:48.299
 layer hal fast forward but not it 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.290
 There are other players and also from 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:04:05.129
 another entry is called pnp 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:12.620
 player was already active and watching 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:16.739
 what now comes direct flight of the kari 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.229
 back but here you can see the content 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.740
 also in passage two follows then becomes 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.349
 one the complete kathrein 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:29.430
 you have to record here on the hdw 0 record 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:31.950
 go on that the release of the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.720
 cards on record and then comes in 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.650
 He also recorded for the recordings 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.539
 the hard disk or on the memory 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:45.560
 Request application know on your book of 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:50.120
 Caribbean State were two-part 0-start 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:53.260
 and take the mx player with this gray one 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.800
 very nice 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.900
 fast forward 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.720
 the entry here you can see the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:07.639
 In the meantime we jump this place 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:16.500
 also goes pretty fast is immediately set 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:22.729
 so come here pretty fast 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:27.900
 So how does that blow you back? 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:33.020
 So it's all right, that's what I mean 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:38.190
 apps which one I need for the kathrein 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:42.300
 now completely back as the entry 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.969
 is not going to end here now 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.560
 directly , all are allowed to share like 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:48.449
 you have four here in the network 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.469
 Piece of the cyclist with the IP address 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:59.690
 and then as I said on hdw 0 with me 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:59.690
 good to say yet 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.350
 that's what I do best divisor ok everything 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.350
 clear
