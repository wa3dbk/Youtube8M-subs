00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
off-screen left let's say and I'm going

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.629 
off-screen left let's say and I'm going
to<00:01:42.689> apply<00:01:42.899> that<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.649> less-than<00:01:44.609> and

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
to apply that that less-than and

to apply that that less-than and
greater-than<00:01:44.789> symbol<00:01:45.539> to<00:01:46.319> the<00:01:46.349> face<00:01:46.770> I'll

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
greater-than symbol to the face I'll

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:48.679 
greater-than symbol to the face I'll
show<00:01:47.249> you<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.489> it<00:01:47.789> can<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:47.969> your<00:01:48.419> expression

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
show you how it can make your expression

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.779

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
I want to open that expression up screen

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.760 
I want to open that expression up screen
right<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:42.130> look<00:04:42.430> at<00:04:42.580> all<00:04:42.729> the<00:04:43.150> lines<00:04:43.450> all<00:04:44.260> my

00:06:18.269 --> 00:06:18.279 
and greater than symbols for math class

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:20.640 
and greater than symbols for math class
so<00:06:18.759> many<00:06:19.029> years<00:06:19.240> ago<00:06:19.419> in<00:06:19.659> school<00:06:19.960> being

so many years ago in school being

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.110 
so many years ago in school being
applied<00:06:20.979> to<00:06:21.039> your<00:06:21.340> art<00:06:21.550> but<00:06:21.819> you<00:06:21.940> never

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
thought that would have happened so go

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.679 
thought that would have happened so go
out<00:06:23.949> and<00:06:23.979> give<00:06:24.279> it<00:06:24.310> a<00:06:24.460> shot<00:06:24.669> see<00:06:24.969> if<00:06:25.000> it<00:06:25.479> makes

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:25.689 
out and give it a shot see if it makes

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:27.240 
out and give it a shot see if it makes
your<00:06:25.840> drawings<00:06:26.020> clear<00:06:26.439> make<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.919> makes<00:06:27.129> your
