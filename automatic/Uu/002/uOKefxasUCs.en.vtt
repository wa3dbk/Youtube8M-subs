00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:15.120
 Good, I'm here to make a video 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.520
 on the hpv is if youtube friends 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.189
 I also blog people where I go 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.710
 post this is my first video 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.839
 making 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.490
 I saw some videos of the motorcycle guys. 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.460
 doing it, I think it's very cool 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.160
 and I'll talk a little bit, it's just going to stay 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.450
 good to come back from são paulo do a são 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 paulo campinas is the following I have to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.379
 talk about the car 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.470
 This is my second hb 2011 I had one 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.480
 first was hatch model 1.6 that 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.730
 comfort plus 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.960
 when I bought it, it was one of the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.010
 first to leave 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.400
 he did not have the sound and I had to put the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.330
 sound apart, it 's a little work but it was 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.570
 cool and it put a sound without bullet 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.229
 Only then there is a post from my 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.229
 here on benq's blog stole on the steppe 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.290
 and steal the steppe steal the sound of the bar a 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.700
 box with noise and I ended up singing 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.780
 car I got the one that is a hp 21.6 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.570
 this is automatic 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.110
 and this is the santana I had a non hatch 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.990
 have the sedan charge the hatch 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.650
 I walked with him 20 thousand and 24 thousand 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.009
 very good car miles only made 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.300
 that the scheduled revisions were 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.460
 placed nothing 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.540
 the first one was a hundred and thirty-something 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:45.909
 real the second 171 car thing not 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.970
 had nothing much to mind 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:54.820
 no comments and now everything is here 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:58.360
 That I loved the car is very good, he is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.340
 an equal internal space in hb 27 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 Only one that has a larger trunk should be 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.490
 the same platform should be all the same 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.490
 130 engine only 128 hp with high 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.740
 Did not let me down and nothing makes me so 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.660
 I 'm a person who drove 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 quietly I do not let myself be in the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.340
 nothing and 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.050
 Let's say that it's not me at all. 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.370
 annoying taboo and get the engine that sometimes 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.390
 130 hp cool talk the bike that was 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.390
 right as well as well 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 attack 60 the total will give certain shit of the 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.620
 mom 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.190
 the motorcycle released the arrow dangerous to enter 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.720
 in fashion 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.140
 finally now the time to warn but finally 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:52.540
 There the car is the cool car 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.090
 he is the hb 20 so he will not let me in 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.060
 hand and nothing by itself automatic that the search 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.840
 automatic has a bias there né 1.6 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.400
 automatic is not normal has a beautiful 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.410
 started for example now behind 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.450
 of that car on a spot on the left 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.890
 Mermaid my colleague can not 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.680
 leave nothing 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.840
 only this way it's automatic you have to 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.370
 to have to walk with him has to be 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.860
 everything is no use 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:27.050
 there he understands you want to walk 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:29.300
 the good that matters to some is consumption 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.110
 I like to calculate it from the album 7 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.350
 I mean, my circuit is well seen in 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.060
 city 8 highway gasoline will not 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.610
 make about 10 11 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.670
 I do not get very average I do not know 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.380
 which is the following I'll get to station 40 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.430
 liters of alcohol here in Campinas I 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:53.120
 paid 70 reais more or less and runs 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.630
 350 pilots doing the against 59 40 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.940
 liters of ethanol gasoline Sea basin that 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.530
 I do not even know how much you like what you do. 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:04.760
 finally the car has 1,700 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:08.360
 kilometers is now included in the right 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.340
 there is a noise and bumpy street where 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.320
 back there makes a noise in that lid 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.050
 even her including the review goes to 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.810
 Braga to take a look at this but nothing 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.720
 What is the animal you're walking here is very 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.270
 noise 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.260
 and I stop the motorcycle for the launch of 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.240
 book 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 Someone must have said I did not go 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.940
 champion has managed to achieve and he 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.580
 Nothing else so noise here 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.810
 car steering is 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.270
 Wonderful 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.940
 the issue of control on the steering wheel to the 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.970
 cell phone is very good 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.520
 the question of his original audio 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.370
 very good, very cool, I do not have to 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.830
 talking is a cool little thing including me 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.930
 I was thinking of the beginning of what to do 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.200
 different thing there but do not need 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.100
 Not only is it cool as hell, it does not 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.620
 wish not 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:02.170
 it connects to the iphone without problem 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.880
 no take the songs if you vote 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.850
 here and now you 're filming the most 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.550
 voted here and put a bluetooth gps and 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.720
 in audio reduces the sound volume to 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.080
 speak of dbs such a very cool volume of 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.900
 audio is good is more chic warrior 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.690
 interesting is the command on the phone that 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.240
 so for you to do such connection does not 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.070
 For you to research, that's it. 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.390
 normal scheme no one's enough more paste 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.210
 even it 's not that thing that you 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.800
 explores dragging but does not have 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.540
 and also does not give for you to type 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.580
 choose from the most recent calls that 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.990
 number you called you put 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.020
 To call him to call me the last. 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.780
 The number you called and that's it, man. 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.970
 automatic gearbox is a wonder 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.100
 the star's face has crossed right 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:49.710
 died the automatic gearbox is a 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.780
 wonder is it expensive to tell you that there is here 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.720
 it is not very close until the backrest is that 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.770
 we were not seeing there but I also like 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.050
 here you do not like that you put the hand of 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.870
 my beauty, a position is 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.210
 Wonderful one who also has a lighthouse 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.510
 autopilot leaving autopilot 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.490
 expose this cast rearview light 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.950
 electric that's cool my other contained 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.590
 But look at each other, Carlos. 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.750
 wonderful the hatch walks more 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.840
 he is a much more aggressive car in 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.030
 ling was manual and the new more in 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:27.900
 soccer 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.890
 his internal is at least 120 now 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.020
 motor 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:39.090
 it stands at 3 thousand rpm 120 2 903 thousand rpm 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:41.100
 very quiet and economical is very good and 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:45.660
 is it guys any agent there 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.330
 I can more video and send the comments 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.700
 here you think the experience 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.750
 of you with the car and in this one I 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:57.720
 I even created a latch there in the steppe 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.550
 I put a steel cable a lock there 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.020
 But the guy got into the 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.760
 your car 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.490
 He is a good nun too. 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:07.710
 damn did life now seen a 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:12.050
 car is very good in front of ubs airbag 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:14.610
 brake is exceptional very good indeed 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.280
 coming back I was talking about stealing the 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.310
 another steppe and I put in this one 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.580
 it locks a lock and in cable aso but 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:25.140
 What if the guy got in your car is something 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.050
 the easier it will open a padlock is 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:30.030
 true but I think the guy is not 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:33.660
 if it comes empty handed it will not even go 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:35.610
 then take at least a steppe of that 

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.940
 car comes with wheels and the spare wheel 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.470
 light alloy rim 15 then comes with the tire 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:42.230
 normal well they do not fini tire 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.170
 including trying to cut and 

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:46.910
 the time on television is that the tires of 

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:50.270
 mini cooper cars the finer did not come 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:52.940
 with the same wheel 15 is normal so 

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:55.670
 good it is an expensive steppe that robs then 

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:58.160
 so you need to record, but here's a 

00:07:55.670 --> 00:08:00.560
 wonderful, very good curve face 

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.440
 very good acceleration and was 

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.800
 when they have now emerged and highly 

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:10.600
 recommended this is it , thanks 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.600
 the next video there is more theatrical
