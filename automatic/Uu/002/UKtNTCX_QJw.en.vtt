 but no wonder the whole come 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:56.070
 position what is what and it is just 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.150
 a total of 40 batteries in total 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:05.760
 2000 72 shot that will hopefully be very 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.570
 loud and very gray will see what 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.600

 term red blue 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.019

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.390
 positions become everything individually 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.220
 or so two three things the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.040
 maybe interconnected and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.720
 otherwise everything will be damaged individually 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.800
 paid because I still think so 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.880
