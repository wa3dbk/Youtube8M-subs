app review for y'all and now today we're
going<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.849> review<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.330> Starbucks<00:00:09.840> app<00:00:10.050> and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
going to review this Starbucks app and

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.120 
going to review this Starbucks app and
this<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.309> new<00:00:11.460> fresh<00:00:11.700> out<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.059> App<00:00:12.179> Store

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.160 

and<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.250> wait<00:00:20.430> till<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.699> loads<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:24.170> and

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
and this wait till it loads up here and

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.240 
and this wait till it loads up here and
the<00:00:25.260> reason<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.590> taking<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:25.949> while<00:00:26.189> to

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the reason is taking a little while to

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.859 
the reason is taking a little while to
load<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.910> looks<00:00:27.090> like<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.420> last

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
load because it looks like the last

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.859 
load because it looks like the last
thing<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.380> played<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.400> was<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.599> maps

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
thing that I played with was the maps

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.590 
thing that I played with was the maps
and<00:00:31.740> fighting<00:00:32.369> locations<00:00:32.850> around<00:00:33.120> me<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.450> it's

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and fighting locations around me so it's

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.880 
and fighting locations around me so it's
already<00:00:33.870> doing<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:36.410> but<00:00:37.410> let<00:00:37.559> me<00:00:37.680> start

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

this<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.830> where<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.369> be<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:13.369> and<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.119> cool

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
this is where it will be at and the cool

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
this is where it will be at and the cool
thing<00:01:15.840> about<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.170> locations<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.950> see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
thing about the locations here you see

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
thing about the locations here you see
at<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.280> top<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.299> talk<00:01:18.600> between<00:01:18.869> map<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
at the top you can talk between map and

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
at the top you can talk between map and
lists<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:22.520> guess<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.729> neat<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.060> it's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lists and I guess it's neat to see it's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.020 
lists and I guess it's neat to see it's
what's<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> integrates

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what's around you because it integrates

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.380 
what's around you because it integrates
to<00:01:27.180> Google<00:01:27.479> Maps<00:01:28.579> but<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.700> only<00:01:29.820> bad<00:01:30.030> thing<00:01:30.060> is

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to Google Maps but the only bad thing is

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.929 
to Google Maps but the only bad thing is
remember<00:01:30.619> Starbucks<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.740> everywhere<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.820> it

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
remember Starbucks is everywhere so it

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.460 
remember Starbucks is everywhere so it
could<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.090> inside<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.570> bigger<00:01:33.810> building<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
could be inside a bigger building and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.319 
could be inside a bigger building and
that's<00:01:35.340> why<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.850> come<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> list

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
that's why I like to come to the list

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.450 
that's why I like to come to the list
and<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> when<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.030> come<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.329> list

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
and not only that when you come to list

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.859 
and not only that when you come to list
it<00:01:41.460> also<00:01:41.640> tells<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.090> whether<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.540> location

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
it also tells you whether that location

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.590 
it also tells you whether that location
is<00:01:43.140> open<00:01:43.470> or<00:01:43.619> closed<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.240> Wi-Fi

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.980 
is open or closed if it is Wi-Fi
accessible<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.369> if<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> drive-through

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
accessible and if it has a drive-through

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.819 
accessible and if it has a drive-through
or<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.759> with<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> little<00:01:51.090> car<00:01:51.270> icon<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.960> you

or not with a little car icon and you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.959 
or not with a little car icon and you
can<00:01:52.860> actually<00:01:53.310> filter<00:01:53.610> by<00:01:54.299> amenities<00:01:55.079> so
