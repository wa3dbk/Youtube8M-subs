00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
big it would be I mean we were more

rally and getting the notes right and
being<00:01:17.070> faster<00:01:17.640> than<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> other<00:01:18.119> drivers

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780

which<00:01:19.530> rally<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.190> were<00:01:20.340> doing<00:01:20.670> didn't<00:01:20.970> really

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
which rally we were doing didn't really

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.950 
which rally we were doing didn't really
matter<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.630> much<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.039> presume

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
matter that much and I presume

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.450 
matter that much and I presume
commercially<00:01:24.960> Stuart<00:01:25.649> Turner<00:01:25.890> must<00:01:26.280> have

commercially Stuart Turner must have

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
commercially Stuart Turner must have
realized<00:01:26.910> too<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.509> rally<00:01:27.810> would<00:01:28.049> have

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
realized too when that rally would have

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.170 
realized too when that rally would have
been<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> whole<00:01:29.460> world<00:01:29.490> was

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
been good because the whole world was

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.210 
been good because the whole world was
watching<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.350> like<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.619> LeMond

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
watching it was a bit like the LeMond
