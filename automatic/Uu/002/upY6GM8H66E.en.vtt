00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
making a clanking noise every time I

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
making a clanking noise every time I
cranked<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:22.540> up<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.840> I'll<00:02:22.900> just<00:02:23.050> pull<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.320> off

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440

very<00:03:49.810> first<00:03:50.109> plate<00:03:50.440> is<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.739> little<00:03:51.130> bit<00:03:51.250> thicker

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
very first plate is a little bit thicker

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.849 
very first plate is a little bit thicker
and<00:03:52.060> it<00:03:52.150> only<00:03:52.299> fits<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:52.989> groove<00:03:53.350> on<00:03:53.680> these

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
and it only fits in this groove on these

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.390 
and it only fits in this groove on these
grooves<00:03:54.130> right<00:03:54.400> here<00:03:55.799> all<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:57.070> other<00:03:57.160> ones

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
grooves right here all the other ones

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.289 
grooves right here all the other ones
fit<00:03:57.639> in<00:03:57.760> this<00:03:57.880> groove<00:03:58.199> are<00:03:59.199> the<00:03:59.320> other<00:03:59.440> grief

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
fit in this groove are the other grief

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.610 
fit in this groove are the other grief
so<00:04:01.299> it's<00:04:01.540> kind<00:04:01.750> of<00:04:01.780> hard<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.019> mess<00:04:02.169> it<00:04:02.350> up<00:04:02.410> if

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
so it's kind of hard to mess it up if

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.629 
so it's kind of hard to mess it up if
you<00:04:02.650> did

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
you did

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.569 
you did
slide<00:04:04.269> them<00:04:04.359> all<00:04:04.540> back<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:05.260> the<00:04:06.250> hardest

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
slide them all back in and the hardest

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:09.150 
slide them all back in and the hardest
part<00:04:06.790> about<00:04:06.850> this<00:04:07.470> replacing<00:04:08.470> this<00:04:08.590> clutch<00:04:08.829> is

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
part about this replacing this clutch is

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.939 
part about this replacing this clutch is
putting<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> case<00:04:10.540> cover<00:04:10.900> back<00:04:11.169> on<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:11.650> it

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
putting the case cover back on and it

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.259 
putting the case cover back on and it
took<00:04:12.190> me<00:04:12.370> an<00:04:12.459> hour<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.669> a<00:04:12.760> half<00:04:12.910> the<00:04:13.060> first

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
took me an hour and a half the first

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.930 
took me an hour and a half the first
time<00:04:13.510> took<00:04:13.660> me<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.070> 45<00:04:15.070> minutes<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.430> second<00:04:15.790> time

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
time took me to 45 minutes a second time

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.360 
time took me to 45 minutes a second time

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
replacing clutches on these yet but I do

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.550 
replacing clutches on these yet but I do
a<00:04:38.229> lot<00:04:38.320> of<00:04:38.470> clutch<00:04:39.430> ups<00:04:39.780> so<00:04:40.780> my<00:04:41.050> clutch<00:04:41.290> plates

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
a lot of clutch ups so my clutch plates

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.420 
a lot of clutch ups so my clutch plates
were<00:04:41.680> slipping<00:04:42.010> a<00:04:42.040> little<00:04:42.100> bit

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
were slipping a little bit

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.450 
were slipping a little bit
now<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.669> moved<00:04:42.960> past<00:04:43.960> synthetic<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.860> have

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
now I moved past synthetic I have

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.010 
now I moved past synthetic I have
regular<00:04:45.639> they<00:04:46.000> come<00:04:46.210> bone<00:04:46.479> stock<00:04:46.780> which<00:04:46.990> is

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
regular they come bone stock which is

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.480 
regular they come bone stock which is
very<00:04:47.320> little<00:04:47.550> motor<00:04:48.550> oil<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.060> on<00:04:49.600> a<00:04:49.660> motor<00:04:50.110> oil

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
very little motor oil and on a motor oil

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.879 
very little motor oil and on a motor oil
I<00:04:51.490> recommend<00:04:52.449> just<00:04:52.479> run<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:52.870> Honda<00:04:53.260> motor<00:04:53.620> oil

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
I recommend just run the Honda motor oil

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:56.070 
I recommend just run the Honda motor oil
because<00:04:54.250> little<00:04:54.760> cheaper<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.449> works<00:04:55.660> just

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
because little cheaper and it works just

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.780 
because little cheaper and it works just
got<00:04:56.290> the<00:04:56.380> same<00:04:56.620> but<00:04:56.919> if<00:04:57.040> your<00:04:57.160> clutch<00:04:57.340> is<00:04:57.550> start

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
got the same but if your clutch is start

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.700 
got the same but if your clutch is start
slipping<00:04:58.120> you<00:04:58.210> might<00:04:58.360> need<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.840> put<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.560> little

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
slipping you might need a put a little

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.960 
slipping you might need a put a little
bit<00:04:59.830> of<00:04:59.919> synthetic<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.550> there's<00:05:00.669> just<00:05:00.850> a

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
bit of synthetic and there's just a

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.950 
bit of synthetic and there's just a
little<00:05:01.150> more<00:05:01.270> expensive

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
little more expensive

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.950 
little more expensive

and there's a spring at the bottom of
that<00:06:20.300> shaft<00:06:20.600> and<00:06:20.960> if<00:06:21.110> this<00:06:21.289> slides<00:06:21.560> up<00:06:21.770> that

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
that shaft and if this slides up that

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.129 
that shaft and if this slides up that
spring<00:06:22.220> falls<00:06:22.550> out<00:06:22.820> most<00:06:23.479> likely<00:06:23.660> gonna<00:06:23.930> fall

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
spring falls out most likely gonna fall

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.360 
spring falls out most likely gonna fall

to me twice how to fish it out with a

to me twice how to fish it out with a
magnet<00:06:27.590> but<00:06:27.860> that's<00:06:28.490> how<00:06:28.669> you<00:06:28.699> do<00:06:28.970> it<00:06:29.199> hope
