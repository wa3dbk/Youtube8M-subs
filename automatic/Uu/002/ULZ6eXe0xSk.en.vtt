so<00:02:42.910> let's<00:02:43.120> deck<00:02:43.300> profile<00:02:43.660> guys<00:02:43.840> as<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.560> can

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
so let's deck profile guys as you can

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.199 
so let's deck profile guys as you can
see<00:02:44.860> this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.130> not<00:02:45.160> your<00:02:45.430> average<00:02:45.490> build<00:02:46.120> that

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
see this is not your average build that

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.660 
see this is not your average build that

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
interesting build them I might actually

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.880 
interesting build them I might actually
test<00:03:04.630> this<00:03:04.780> out<00:03:04.930> myself<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:05.650> how<00:03:05.739> it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
test this out myself and see how it

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.000 
test this out myself and see how it
works<00:03:07.290> but<00:03:08.290> then<00:03:08.410> again<00:03:08.440> it<00:03:08.709> might<00:03:08.800> not<00:03:08.950> work

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
works but then again it might not work

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.620 
works but then again it might not work
for<00:03:09.310> me<00:03:09.459> because<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.730> did<00:03:10.030> work<00:03:10.150> for<00:03:10.360> him<00:03:10.510> it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
for me because it did work for him it

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.729 
for me because it did work for him it
doesn't<00:03:10.720> necessarily<00:03:10.930> mean<00:03:11.380> it<00:03:11.500> will<00:03:11.560> work

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
doesn't necessarily mean it will work

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.350 
doesn't necessarily mean it will work
for<00:03:11.920> me<00:03:11.950> although<00:03:12.520> I<00:03:12.550> am<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.760> little<00:03:12.910> surprised

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
for me although I am a little surprised

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.390 
for me although I am a little surprised
seeing<00:03:13.660> card<00:03:13.959> cards<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.380> a<00:03:14.440> hero<00:03:14.650> deck<00:03:14.830> never

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
seeing card cards in a hero deck never

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.940 
seeing card cards in a hero deck never
seen<00:03:15.610> anything<00:03:15.850> like<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.060> before<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.560> yep

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
seen anything like that before so yep

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.140 
seen anything like that before so yep
this<00:03:18.070> is<00:03:18.130> pretty<00:03:18.400> much<00:03:18.489> not<00:03:18.820> your<00:03:19.000> average

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
this is pretty much not your average

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.479 
this is pretty much not your average
hero<00:03:19.720> deck<00:03:19.900> that<00:03:20.230> came<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.890> first<00:03:21.340> place

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
hero deck that came in first place

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.850 
hero deck that came in first place
technically<00:03:22.150> second<00:03:22.630> but<00:03:22.780> he<00:03:23.290> sold<00:03:23.530> off<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
technically second but he sold off the

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.289 
technically second but he sold off the
wind<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:24.340> he<00:03:24.760> actually<00:03:24.970> got<00:03:25.299> first<00:03:25.600> place<00:03:26.010> so

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
wind but he actually got first place so

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.670 
wind but he actually got first place so
