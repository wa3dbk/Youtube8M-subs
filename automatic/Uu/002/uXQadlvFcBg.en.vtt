00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.220
 Hello and welcome to the latest photos Pretoria 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.640
 in short Edig an e-mail from a YouTube user 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.419
 namely has asked 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:11.839
 to make a video chat Ã¶bb 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:13.409
 all around 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:14.949
 that was from Dekra 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:16.730
 and he also remained open 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.280
 special questions that I will answer in the next meetings 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.519
 and you would 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.480
 some end today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.949
 a lot about 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.730
 one of the riots 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 such as the measures around 2000 continued 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.820
 and then I had the page you are visited and then had first 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.510
 the whole formation beyond measure 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.540
 found out 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 Here you can see that this year Sony uses side of the DVD case 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.880
 each only 30 millimeters 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.680
 June in focus 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.950
 from the DVD chamber are 14 millimeters wide 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.260
 and the total height 684 millimeters 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.550
 because you have to 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.150
 the whole still the trim edges 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.060
 account 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.840
 they are three millimeters on each side 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.090
 they are 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.790
 just as important 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.740
 because after the man printed his document so in this case the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.659
 the current height there 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.180
 Scala 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.150
 you just had to cut the document this year and percent 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.360
 could do it 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.540
 could then 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.680
 something is lost 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 Buhler Exten 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 Safety is created by the average in it 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.800
 Sound around 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 At the beginning, this is a radical creation 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.060
 that you still prepare a Kistler 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.650
 and that's what we do 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.890
 and put too 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.310
 indirectly a new one 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460
 this means 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
 Trichet 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.260
 to pick on 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.259
 part 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.259
 December 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:17.139
 click to run the parts 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.769
 just 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.549
 that has his name 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.949
 the VBK vary 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:26.969
 Concretely, the units of measure change millimeters 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.779
 as the standard in the pressure test 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:32.509
 and around 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:34.269
 how about a wide font 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.279
 the document is now a 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.259
 single document 

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:39.329
 establish 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.089
 previously kept our pdf file 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:43.059
 that raises 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.940
 width of the front and the back are 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.359
 1526 minimized land 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.269
 + the 14 mm of the middle 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.479
 District Administrator 74 millimeters 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:58.189
 and then the 2 cut edges right and left of three millimeters 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.189
 Finanzwart 80 millimeters in total 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.759
 as the wall is higher 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.999
 it is 104 80 millimeters of guts with the 2 0 

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:09.950
 Schmidt race 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.950
 for the home team a hundred 90-minutes 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.649
 but already the masses 

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:19.649
 the resolution is 300 Detlef Roth should 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.779
 Standard is impressed 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:25.969
 and also for standards are Seer Mary Kay color mode 

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:29.889
 Bayer printer mostly with Pierre I have one 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:35.009
 yes and then you confirm with okay 

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:44.499
 you could pretty much lose track of everything here now 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.589
 front and back to the Beatles 

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:50.809
 and how far may from the front doors 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:53.869
 We have to do that in Photoshop 

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:55.919
 guides 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.869
 none right in the Rhine Valley 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:04:02.339
 but with help lines Commander Hilzingen produce that we do now 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.169
 the first 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.369
 who love it here 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.759
 So the first one was found 

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.169
 so to speak 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:12.269
 scha percent of the left-trimming rank Photoshop he catches 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.160
 left to right 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.359
 however, it is 0 and right is 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.680
 though 80 millimeters has this example 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.979
 Enter Lloyd's 3 mm 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.360
 According to Hermeling, our first left our first vertical 11 7 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:28.800
 Now we will continue 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.500
 the very rights he would be at 280 millimeters 200 as a fan and 7 70 stage 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.379
 to start with 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.889
 yes and then come the next 90 percent kidneys 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:40.910
 and Santala 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.910
 he also hates it at 3 millimeters 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.699
 there stops 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.020
 rational 90-minute high is 200 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.439
 she makes 6 millimeters 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.729
 is now okay again 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:58.729
 splendidly still the orientation 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.319
 now only needs deep calls middle 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.319
 before that should set the middle and the back 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.710
 yes as I said photo protective effect 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:11.550
 around 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.710
 left 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.219
 17 01 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.110
 So let's start with the back 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.830
 Users of the Zune 30 millimeters 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.819
 therefore just just 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:24.129
 or 30 millimeters 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.339
 Zeltner narrow IV back 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.189
 with suitcases Hochtief means 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.740
 4 14 mm wide 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.620
 these 14 millimeters 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.870
 if you give him the idea with one 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.439
 Percentage of Uri 30 from back 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:40.050
 can you then on the 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.969
 144 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.409
 Be a Christian 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.889
 next aid yes and so you can see 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.879
 You must all recognize one more structure 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:51.719
 where claims now where is behind 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:54.349
 how far you can not go out 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.089
 Aalen 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:59.089
 one is still allowed to Hintzen 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.199
 if we now run one of the and left behind and then should make 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.580
 You definitely go over that cut edge 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.789
 Text so if you are now the Indextrackern you should not Hinwil 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.810
 Percent approximate one recognizes series or just as Dubai go that one should 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.330
 definitely not 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.979
 for inter- and pictures 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:21.949
 because around 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.139
 you never know 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.499
 For example, by mail 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:26.569
 No 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:27.680
 background 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.810
 right on the edge 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.129
 children 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:32.740
 So it's just here, so to speak 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.839
 just a rumor 

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:37.469
 in any case, does not exceed all the countries 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:39.990
 then it could happen that if you are stupid 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.699
 ck was right cuts or cuts more of the printing 11 together 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.879
 rising animal friends is set to the three millimeters 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.080
 it could happen 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.169
 but that is still such a small white to look at therefore you will 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:52.529
 just because 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:53.629
 for safety's sake 

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:57.009
 if you have a nice and picture five handed over completely 

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.180
 as if he were already 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.949
 the first question I become so percent 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.369
 answer 

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.379
 Nixon videos I could then to the next questions 

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:13.550
 I hope I could Lea Reinke 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.749
 some Steinacher can get rid of information and 

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:17.889
 helpful 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.169
 Ask reviews and suggestions 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.020
 is the comment box to lead
