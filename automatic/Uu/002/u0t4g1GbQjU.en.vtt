00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
a sudden as soon as you take one shot

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.510 
a sudden as soon as you take one shot
you're<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.409> shooting<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> stars<00:02:02.040> just

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
you're just shooting for the stars just

you're just shooting for the stars just
don't<00:02:03.299> eat<00:02:03.420> not<00:02:03.659> even<00:02:03.899> near<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.079> enemy<00:02:04.439> so

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
don't eat not even near the enemy so

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.039

that is just terrible shit right there

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.990 
that is just terrible shit right there
so<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> throw<00:02:08.310> toughness<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.819> there

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
so if you throw toughness on there

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.609 
so if you throw toughness on there
that'll<00:02:09.300> take<00:02:09.509> care<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.959> for<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.500> to

wrap that all up and then scan

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.530 
wrap that all up and then scan
you<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.550> obviously<00:02:14.700> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.180> replenish
