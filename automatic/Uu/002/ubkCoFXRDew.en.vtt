00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
very gated leaf if you've ever wondered

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.459 
very gated leaf if you've ever wondered
then<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.470> course<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.180> silver<00:00:33.809> leaf

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and but we're going to use gold leaf

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.420 
and but we're going to use gold leaf
since<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.649> under<00:00:41.190> painted<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:44.960> the<00:00:45.960> red

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
now you want this to be almost dry

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.990 
now you want this to be almost dry
interestingly<00:00:50.730> enough<00:00:51.500> it<00:00:52.500> has<00:00:52.739> if<00:00:53.160> if<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
interestingly enough it has if if you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.209 
interestingly enough it has if if you
try<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.239> attack<00:00:54.629> it<00:00:54.809> too<00:00:54.989> early<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.559> really<00:00:56.129> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
try to attack it too early it really is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.369 
try to attack it too early it really is
not<00:00:56.399> as<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.719> successful<00:01:00.050> now<00:01:01.050> with<00:01:01.260> this

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
not as is as successful now with this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
leaf what what I like to do is take it

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.770

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
hang on to this ruching paper because

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
hang on to this ruching paper because
the<00:01:49.290> ruching<00:01:49.649> paper<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.399> chemically<00:01:50.820> treated

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the ruching paper is chemically treated

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.450 
the ruching paper is chemically treated
to<00:01:51.509> not<00:01:51.689> stick<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> your<00:01:52.259> hands<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:53.189> stick

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to the glue and not stick to the leaf so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.289 
to the glue and not stick to the leaf so
there's<00:02:00.210> one<00:02:00.509> piece<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:02.850> just<00:02:03.060> taking

there's one piece and I'm just taking
this<00:02:03.390> ruching<00:02:03.689> paper<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.560> I'm<00:02:05.009> pressing<00:02:05.460> it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
and you'll know when your glue is ready

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.870 
and you'll know when your glue is ready
when<00:02:12.230> sometimes<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.950> goes<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.190> kind<00:02:13.400> of<00:02:13.490> milky

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.360 
when sometimes it goes on kind of milky
and<00:02:14.060> when<00:02:14.870> it's<00:02:15.020> clear<00:02:15.440> then<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:16.160> know<00:02:16.340> that

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and when it's clear then you know that

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:29.760 
and when it's clear then you know that
it's<00:02:16.700> ready<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:22.610> pushing<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.150> down<00:02:23.330> in

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.310 

here's<00:02:30.770> another<00:02:31.010> piece<00:02:31.310> that's<00:02:32.170> that's<00:02:33.170> a

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
here's another piece that's that's a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.700 
here's another piece that's that's a
pretty<00:02:33.530> good<00:02:34.060> size<00:02:35.060> but<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:36.260> thing<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.530> do

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
pretty good size but first thing you do

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.950 
pretty good size but first thing you do
is<00:02:36.740> you<00:02:37.010> just<00:02:37.040> take<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.670> crush<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.840> then

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
is you just take it you crush it so then

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
is you just take it you crush it so then
you<00:02:39.050> don't<00:02:39.200> have<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.440> worry<00:02:39.590> about<00:02:39.710> it<00:02:39.890> getting

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
you don't have to worry about it getting

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.830 
you don't have to worry about it getting
wrinkled<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.450> other<00:02:41.480> thing<00:02:41.660> that's

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
wrinkled and then the other thing that's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.560 
wrinkled and then the other thing that's
kind<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.230> nice<00:02:42.380> about<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.130> gives<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.430> a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
kind of nice about that is it gives it a

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:51.550 
kind of nice about that is it gives it a
much<00:02:44.570> softer<00:02:44.960> appearance<00:02:45.470> too<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:50.470> think<00:02:51.470> this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
much softer appearance too I think this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.830 
much softer appearance too I think this
rouging<00:02:52.070> paper<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:52.580> actually<00:02:53.209> just<00:02:53.390> your<00:02:53.630> best

showing but let's say that you don't
want<00:03:14.450> that<00:03:14.720> you<00:03:15.709> can<00:03:15.890> put<00:03:16.069> leaf<00:03:16.310> on<00:03:16.550> top<00:03:16.930> if<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
want that you can put leaf on top if the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.199 
want that you can put leaf on top if the
leaf<00:03:18.380> won't<00:03:18.620> stick<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.640> put<00:03:20.000> in<00:03:20.120> a

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
leaf won't stick you can just put in a

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.530 
leaf won't stick you can just put in a
little<00:03:20.390> bit<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.750> glue<00:03:20.990> also<00:03:21.650> but<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:22.510> kind<00:03:23.510> of

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
little bit of glue also but I kind of

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.420 
little bit of glue also but I kind of
like<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.750> showing<00:03:24.320> through<00:03:24.650> visit<00:03:25.070> more<00:03:25.250> of<00:03:25.340> an

on a piece of ruffle and remember that
the<00:04:56.090> leaf<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.540> going<00:04:56.840> to<00:04:56.930> just<00:04:57.050> absolutely

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
the leaf is going to just absolutely
