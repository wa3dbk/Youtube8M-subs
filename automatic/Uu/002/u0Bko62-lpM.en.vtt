 what awaits us for marvel with secret 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.130
 world and how this channel is from comics in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.570
 general and if you do not fall behind and we 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.570
 he also prepares one of his great 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.390
 events for this year which will be 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.439
 full of surprises new stories and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 because it does not restart it 's why that world 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.650
 comics presents you convergence but that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.170
 is this event as many already must 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.590
 know even if you have prepared for this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.809
 year 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.059
 converge in this we will see as the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.670
 seemingly villain with the help of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.620
 breña manages to access the flow of 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.020
 multiverses to lock up several 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.510
 parallel worlds in domes and force 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.690
 its main warriors to fight between 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.700
 yes converging is an event that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.879
 will include a main series of 8 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.770
 numbers plus 40 publications 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.620
 complementary where each one is 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.410
 will show some combat between characters 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.470
 of different realities the surprise was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.450
 even greater when he says he announced one such 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 Carlos Payan 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.850
 cartoonist for this incredibly weird 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.969
 for some fans since he was wondering 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.729
 a stranger in front of the event that 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:21.179
 pretend to turn the universe upside down 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.729
 it says good sounds a bit exaggerated but 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:25.649
 honestly nobody could expect that from 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.929
 a stranger who had made a few 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.630
 few side jobs for marvel and 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.789
 give host a comic will be removed from the sleeve 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.270
 of such resounding and spectacular action 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.849
 but hey, Carlos does not come alone because 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.959
 is accompanied with him inker Jason peace 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:45.509
 and the colorist peter steger galt but 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:47.939
 after the fans look at the work 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.689
 de carlos gave several statements 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.670
 which can be summarized yet never 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.369
 the characters of the earth two had 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.649
 been better and rarely a comic with 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.720
 so few scenarios and situations like 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 this one had given that impression of 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.939
 forcefulness now returning a bit to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.000
 the story behind the prologue converge 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.519
 number zero between superman and the god 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.260
 machina braña that explained the days that 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.019
 Cullen was absent 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.780
 the end of superman dume and his return to 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:21.840
 action comics the thing started from 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.730
 true for jeff that next to scott lock 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.659
 and he introduced us to the six 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.209
 earth survivors 2 who are 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:32.849
 I could say they survived the feast that 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.640
 he gave himself little lips with his planet and 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:39.420
 thanks to tim drake doing batman 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.569

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.000
 they were victims of the omega been the 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.519
 darkside but instead of leaving they ended up in 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.889
 the planet of telos all these events 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.290
 they will take him to fight to death between 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:01.139
 them to see what reality universe 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.769
 deserves to be restored within the 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.810
 multiverse of the new 52 something that to 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.389
 our protagonists will not like it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.849
 but at least they will have the opportunity to 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:14.069
 fight there will be many casualties during 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.290
 the story and it's not even insured 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.210
 survival for all of our 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.190
 protagonists but many will ask 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.680
 move on to drive after this 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.080
 macroevento return to publications 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.790
 before restarting with respect to this 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.610
 subject the directives have pronounced 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.520
 to announce that this is not among your 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.300
 plans from June the comics 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.880
 they will leave the title of news 52 but this 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.370
 does not mean it will be a restart 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.190
