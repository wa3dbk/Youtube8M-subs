power supply and because of this if you
use<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.430> unit<00:03:46.760> at<00:03:46.970> the<00:03:47.060> same<00:03:47.300> time<00:03:47.570> as

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
use in the unit at the same time as

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.040 
use in the unit at the same time as
you're<00:03:48.710> charging<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.820> 3m<00:03:50.210> supply<00:03:50.660> so

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
you're charging is it's a 3m supply so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.260 
you're charging is it's a 3m supply so
you<00:03:51.080> can<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:52.100> can<00:03:52.250> supply<00:03:52.580> the<00:03:52.640> current<00:03:53.060> but

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
you can you can supply the current but

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.620 
you can you can supply the current but
the<00:03:54.080> charge<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.590> isn't<00:03:54.860> as<00:03:55.010> fast<00:03:55.220> if<00:03:55.610> you<00:03:55.880> you

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
the charge in isn't as fast if you you

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.290 
the charge in isn't as fast if you you
can<00:03:56.810> use<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.140> supply<00:03:57.500> em<00:03:57.970> you're<00:03:58.970> using<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.300 
can use the supply em you're using the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.940 
can use the supply em you're using the
table<00:03:59.630> at<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.810> same<00:03:59.959> time<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.380> it's<00:04:00.500> better<00:04:00.680> to

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
table at the same time so it's better to

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.380 
table at the same time so it's better to
switch<00:04:01.490> off<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.790> unit<00:04:02.090> while<00:04:02.240> you're
