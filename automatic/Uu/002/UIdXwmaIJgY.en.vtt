more<00:01:47.970> likely<00:01:48.240> rather<00:01:48.689> than<00:01:48.930> our<00:01:49.140> sport<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
more likely rather than our sport is so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.889 
more likely rather than our sport is so
simple<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.520> specific<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.390> do<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.509> do<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.810> do

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
simple and specific what do we do we do

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.580 
simple and specific what do we do we do
three<00:01:52.200> things

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
three things

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.480 
three things
no<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.520> okay<00:01:53.850> okay<00:01:55.189> in<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.430> case

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
no and we do them okay okay in that case

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.459 
no and we do them okay okay in that case
I<00:01:56.729> think<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.149> kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.899> side<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.140> what

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
I think I'm kind of on the side of what

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.289 
I think I'm kind of on the side of what
Mike<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.860> saying<00:01:59.100> it's<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.759> depends<00:02:00.180> on

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
Mike is saying it's like it depends on

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.240 
Mike is saying it's like it depends on
what<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.750> for<00:02:00.930> instance<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.350> think<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.219> a

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
what like for instance I think we see a

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.840 
what like for instance I think we see a
lot<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.240> like

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
lot of it right now is like

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.640 
lot of it right now is like
a<00:02:03.880> powerbuilder<00:02:04.600> yeah<00:02:05.110> I'd<00:02:05.200> be<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.350> good<00:02:05.500> you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
a powerbuilder yeah I'd be a good you

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.020 
a powerbuilder yeah I'd be a good you
could<00:02:05.740> be<00:02:05.860> a<00:02:05.890> great<00:02:06.070> power<00:02:06.250> looking<00:02:06.550> to<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.820> any

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
could be a great power looking to be any

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.180 
could be a great power looking to be any
good<00:02:07.210> vaudeville<00:02:07.990> like<00:02:08.350> Stanford<00:02:08.770> that's

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
good vaudeville like Stanford that's

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.800 
good vaudeville like Stanford that's
maybe<00:02:09.610> possible<00:02:10.030> my<00:02:10.149> turn

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
maybe possible my turn

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.630 
maybe possible my turn
it's<00:02:11.440> kind<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.800> myths<00:02:12.010> appear<00:02:12.310> pro

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
it's kind of a myths appear pro

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.700 
it's kind of a myths appear pro
bodybuilders<00:02:13.210> squat<00:02:13.450> 750<00:02:14.140> yeah

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
bodybuilders squat 750 yeah

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.440 
bodybuilders squat 750 yeah
so<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.040> think<00:02:15.100> yeah<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.240> is<00:02:16.360> very

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so I think yeah I think it is very

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.140 
so I think yeah I think it is very
possible<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.200> think<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:17.470> just<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.670> order<00:02:18.880> to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
possible I think it's just in order to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.850 
possible I think it's just in order to
achieve<00:02:19.690> that<00:02:19.960> greatness<00:02:20.200> URM<00:02:20.740> you're

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
achieve that greatness URM you're

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.080 
achieve that greatness URM you're
working<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> little<00:02:21.190> bit<00:02:21.340> harder<00:02:21.400> because<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
working a little bit harder because you

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.490 
working a little bit harder because you
got<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.360> do<00:02:22.450> certain<00:02:22.660> things<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:23.200> little<00:02:23.320> bit

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
got to do certain things a little bit

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.290 
got to do certain things a little bit
you're<00:02:23.920> gonna<00:02:24.040> be<00:02:24.190> working<00:02:24.400> more<00:02:24.640> volume<00:02:25.090> once

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
you're gonna be working more volume once

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.900 
you're gonna be working more volume once
but<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:25.990> think<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.410> is<00:02:26.770> very<00:02:26.920> achievable<00:02:27.250> just

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
but I think it is very achievable just

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.070 
but I think it is very achievable just
you're<00:02:28.300> gonna<00:02:28.390> have<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.630> be<00:02:28.690> working<00:02:28.870> with

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
you're gonna have to be working with

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.840 
you're gonna have to be working with
some<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.620> best-looking<00:02:29.860> ladies<00:02:30.370> are<00:02:30.610> now

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.520 
parallel you know there's no they are
very<00:03:36.820> similar<00:03:37.090> but<00:03:37.360> like<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.720> powerlifter<00:03:38.140> to

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
very similar but like a powerlifter to

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.590 
very similar but like a powerlifter to

whatever Lance Armstrong was taking just

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.330 
whatever Lance Armstrong was taking just
helps<00:04:39.570> endurance<00:04:40.020> like<00:04:40.199> crazy<00:04:40.470> yeah<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.130> maybe

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
helps endurance like crazy yeah so maybe

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.400
