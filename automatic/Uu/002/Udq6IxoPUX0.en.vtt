okay<00:00:04.229> we're<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.740> go<00:00:04.920> over<00:00:04.950> TDS<00:00:05.850> meter

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
okay we're going to go over TDS meter

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.570 
okay we're going to go over TDS meter

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.970 
readings and membrane rejection checked
a<00:00:08.790> little<00:00:09.059> more<00:00:09.180> thoroughly<00:00:09.389> now<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.650> is

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
a little more thoroughly now this is

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.279 
a little more thoroughly now this is
product<00:00:11.549> water<00:00:11.789> coming<00:00:12.240> out<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.779> reverse

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:13.289 
product water coming out of the reverse

product water coming out of the reverse
osmosis<00:00:13.500> membrane<00:00:14.369> we<00:00:15.359> will<00:00:15.570> take<00:00:15.719> our<00:00:15.869> TDS

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
osmosis membrane we will take our TDS

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.579 
osmosis membrane we will take our TDS
meter<00:00:16.880> reading<00:00:17.880> zero<00:00:18.080> we'll<00:00:19.080> put<00:00:19.289> that<00:00:19.320> into

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:19.589 
meter reading zero we'll put that into

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.790 
meter reading zero we'll put that into
the<00:00:19.740> product<00:00:20.039> water<00:00:20.900> and<00:00:21.900> we'll<00:00:22.109> let<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.289> sit

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the product water and we'll let that sit

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.230 
the product water and we'll let that sit
for<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.070> second<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:24.269> reads<00:00:25.160> 7<00:00:27.199> that<00:00:28.199> reads<00:00:28.499> 7

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
for a second that reads 7 that reads 7

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.999 
for a second that reads 7 that reads 7
what<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.390> will<00:00:30.509> do<00:00:30.720> will<00:00:31.259> mark<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.589> down

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
what we will do will mark that down

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.520 
what we will do will mark that down
we'll<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.970> our<00:00:33.180> instruction<00:00:33.780> sheet<00:00:34.050> here

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
we'll go to our instruction sheet here

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.790 
we'll go to our instruction sheet here
it<00:00:35.430> shows<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.150> math<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:37.140> order<00:00:37.470> to<00:00:37.560> find

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it shows you the math in order to find

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.400 
it shows you the math in order to find
out<00:00:38.010> what<00:00:38.310> the<00:00:38.460> rejection<00:00:39.120> is<00:00:39.450> without

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
out what the rejection is without

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.060 
out what the rejection is without
focusing<00:00:40.740> in<00:00:41.280> here<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> product<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:43.560> 7

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
focusing in here so the product was 7

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
focusing in here so the product was 7
coming<00:00:44.580> out<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.880> RO<00:00:45.210> membrane<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.620> now

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
coming out of the RO membrane we now

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.530 
coming out of the RO membrane we now
have<00:00:47.100> water<00:00:47.520> coming<00:00:47.790> out<00:00:48.240> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> tap<00:00:49.400> our

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
have water coming out of the tap our

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.990 
have water coming out of the tap our
meter<00:00:51.540> reads<00:00:51.870> zero<00:00:52.880> or<00:00:53.880> put<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.270> back<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
meter reads zero or put that back in and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.729 
meter reads zero or put that back in and
this<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.300> reading<00:00:58.880> 104<00:01:00.080> so<00:01:01.850> 104<00:01:03.170> okay<00:01:04.170> so<00:01:04.229> going

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
this is reading 104 so 104 okay so going

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.380 
this is reading 104 so 104 okay so going
by<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:05.009> instructions<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:05.999> going<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
by our instructions we are going to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.539 
by our instructions we are going to
divide<00:01:09.979> 7<00:01:10.979> x<00:01:11.659> 104<00:01:12.659> with<00:01:13.350> our<00:01:13.530> fancy<00:01:13.799> calculator

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
divide 7 x 104 with our fancy calculator

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.630 
divide 7 x 104 with our fancy calculator
7<00:01:14.999> /<00:01:15.390> 104<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.609> point<00:01:17.609> zero<00:01:17.789> six<00:01:18.509> seven<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> we'll

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
7 / 104 is point zero six seven so we'll

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.700 
7 / 104 is point zero six seven so we'll
write<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.090> down<00:01:21.329> here<00:01:21.569> point<00:01:21.840> zero<00:01:22.229> six

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
write that down here point zero six

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
write that down here point zero six
seven<00:01:23.310> we'll<00:01:24.090> multiply<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.840> by<00:01:25.079> 100<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:26.960> we

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
seven we'll multiply that by 100 and we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
seven we'll multiply that by 100 and we
will<00:01:28.170> get<00:01:28.819> six<00:01:29.869> point<00:01:30.869> seven<00:01:31.609> when<00:01:32.609> we

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
will get six point seven when we

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.940 
will get six point seven when we
multiply<00:01:33.179> that<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:36.319> what<00:01:37.319> will<00:01:37.560> then<00:01:37.740> do<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
multiply that out what will then do is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.330 
multiply that out what will then do is
subtract<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.789> from<00:01:39.049> 100<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.219> get<00:01:41.219> our

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
subtract that from 100 to get our

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.730 
subtract that from 100 to get our
percentage<00:01:41.939> minus<00:01:42.359> six<00:01:42.630> point<00:01:42.990> seven<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
percentage minus six point seven and

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.190 
percentage minus six point seven and
that's<00:01:44.459> going<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> yield<00:01:45.060> us

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.510 

okay<00:01:51.070> roughly<00:01:51.789> ninety<00:01:52.509> three<00:01:52.780> percent

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
okay roughly ninety three percent

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.980 
okay roughly ninety three percent
rejection<00:01:54.520> so<00:01:55.509> that's<00:01:55.750> great<00:01:55.990> 93%<00:01:57.360> again<00:01:58.360> when

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
rejection so that's great 93% again when

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.230 
rejection so that's great 93% again when
the<00:01:59.140> membranes<00:01:59.560> reach<00:02:00.039> anywhere<00:02:00.429> from<00:02:00.610> 75<00:02:01.060> to

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
the membranes reach anywhere from 75 to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.709 
the membranes reach anywhere from 75 to
80<00:02:01.630> percent<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:03.610> can<00:02:03.789> can<00:02:03.969> contemplate

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
80 percent you can can contemplate

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.230 
80 percent you can can contemplate

am<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.709> getting<00:02:41.920> more<00:02:42.220> coming<00:02:42.579> out<00:02:42.700> than<00:02:42.940> is

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
am I getting more coming out than is

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.330 
am I getting more coming out than is
going<00:02:43.329> in<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:44.170> again<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> preservative

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
going in that again is a preservative

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.759 
going in that again is a preservative
that<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.670> membranes<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.269> made<00:02:46.329> with<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.500> once

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
that the membranes are made with so once

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.410 
that the membranes are made with so once
that<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.130> flushed<00:02:48.430> you'll<00:02:48.700> get<00:02:48.880> down<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.269> these

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
that is flushed you'll get down to these

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.539 
that is flushed you'll get down to these
kinds<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.810> rejection<00:02:50.170> rates<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:51.010> membrane<00:02:51.400> is

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
kinds of rejection rates the membrane is

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.079 
kinds of rejection rates the membrane is
then<00:02:51.700> ready<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:52.120> be<00:02:52.239> brought<00:02:52.540> into<00:02:52.780> service
