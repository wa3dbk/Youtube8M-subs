00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
series of short tutorials that are all

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.930 
series of short tutorials that are all
about<00:00:12.650> functions<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> tools<00:00:14.099> in<00:00:14.309> Maya<00:00:14.519> that

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
about functions and tools in Maya that

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.000 
about functions and tools in Maya that
are<00:00:15.059> not<00:00:15.210> commonly<00:00:15.690> used<00:00:16.109> just<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.859> illustrate

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
are not commonly used just to illustrate

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.160 
are not commonly used just to illustrate
what<00:00:17.760> they're<00:00:17.910> for<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.750> use<00:00:18.810> them

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
what they're for how you can use them

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.070 
what they're for how you can use them
and<00:00:19.380> just<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> better

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and just you know to get a better

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900 
and just you know to get a better
general<00:00:22.470> understanding<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.279> what's<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.609> on

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
general understanding of what's going on

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.109 
general understanding of what's going on
at<00:00:24.060> Maya<00:00:24.240> okay<00:00:24.949> so<00:00:25.949> today<00:00:26.519> what<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:26.910> do

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
at Maya okay so today what I'm gonna do

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.700 
at Maya okay so today what I'm gonna do
is<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.480> going<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.689> demonstrate<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.320> make

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
is I'm going to demonstrate the make

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.930 
is I'm going to demonstrate the make
live<00:00:29.189> function<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.330> Maya<00:00:31.109> okay<00:00:31.880> so<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
live function in Maya okay so to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.120 
live function in Maya okay so to
illustrate<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.719> I'm<00:00:34.200> gonna<00:00:34.500> do<00:00:34.829> a<00:00:34.860> quick

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
illustrate that I'm gonna do a quick

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.020 
illustrate that I'm gonna do a quick
scene<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:36.030> I'm<00:00:36.329> gonna<00:00:36.450> create<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> ground<00:00:37.260> plane

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
scene so I'm gonna create a ground plane

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.880 
scene so I'm gonna create a ground plane
pull<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.149> out

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
pull that out

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.240 
pull that out
create<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> cube<00:00:41.340> pull<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.420> out<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.219> create<00:00:44.219> a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
create a cube pull that out and create a

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.220 
create a cube pull that out and create a
sphere<00:00:45.590> hit<00:00:46.590> W<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.550> pull<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.300> hit

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
sphere hit W and pull it up just hit

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.920 
sphere hit W and pull it up just hit
five<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.710> shaded<00:00:50.010> mode<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.969> pull<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.870> up

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
five for shaded mode and pull that up

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.729 
five for shaded mode and pull that up
okay<00:00:52.590> now<00:00:53.899> if<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.110> have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> scene<00:00:55.530> like<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
okay now if I have a scene like this

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.459 
okay now if I have a scene like this
right<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.210> whatever<00:00:57.360> reason<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
right and for whatever reason I want to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.610 
right and for whatever reason I want to
create<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.829> CV<00:00:59.219> curve<00:00:59.640> tool<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.809> following

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
create a CV curve tool that is following

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.240 
create a CV curve tool that is following
these<00:01:02.460> objects<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.930> have<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> look<00:01:05.010> at<00:01:05.159> it

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
these objects right I have to look at it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
these objects right I have to look at it
from<00:01:05.430> different<00:01:05.489> angles<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.689> forth<00:01:06.930> okay

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
from different angles and so forth okay

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.460 
from different angles and so forth okay
so<00:01:08.159> first<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.850> gonna<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.479> without<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so first I'm gonna do this without the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
so first I'm gonna do this without the
make<00:01:10.650> life<00:01:10.860> tool<00:01:11.130> okay<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.479> gonna<00:01:12.689> go<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
make life tool okay so I'm gonna go to

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.980 
make life tool okay so I'm gonna go to
my<00:01:12.990> top<00:01:13.260> view<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.740> again<00:01:14.580> I'll<00:01:14.909> hit<00:01:15.090> five<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
my top view and again I'll hit five just

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.890 
my top view and again I'll hit five just
for<00:01:16.409> shaded<00:01:16.710> mode<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.250> cubes<00:01:17.549> over<00:01:17.759> here<00:01:18.030> I'm

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
for shaded mode my cubes over here I'm

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.240 
for shaded mode my cubes over here I'm
gonna<00:01:19.080> go<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> create<00:01:20.189> CV<00:01:20.970> curve<00:01:21.210> tool<00:01:21.509> and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
gonna go to create CV curve tool and

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.620 
gonna go to create CV curve tool and
just<00:01:23.250> gonna<00:01:23.490> click<00:01:24.890> over<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.070> cube<00:01:26.670> there's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
just gonna click over that cube there's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.240 
just gonna click over that cube there's
my<00:01:27.869> square<00:01:28.290> down<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:33.770> just<00:01:34.770> something<00:01:35.159> like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
my square down here just something like

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.410 
my square down here just something like
that<00:01:35.520> okay<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.409> I<00:01:37.409> hit<00:01:37.590> enter<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.390> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that okay and I hit enter now if I go to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.530 
that okay and I hit enter now if I go to
my<00:01:39.540> perspective<00:01:40.140> view<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.590> can<00:01:41.180> pull<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
my perspective view I can pull up the

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.109 
my perspective view I can pull up the
curve<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
curve and you can see that it's a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.420 
curve and you can see that it's a
completely<00:01:45.720> flat<00:01:45.869> surface<00:01:46.259> it's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.920> flat<00:01:47.159> line

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
completely flat surface it's a flat line

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.510 
completely flat surface it's a flat line
totally<00:01:48.149> okay<00:01:48.710> so<00:01:49.710> what<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:49.920> gonna<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.250> is

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
totally okay so what we're gonna do is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.219 
totally okay so what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:50.759> gonna<00:01:50.820> do<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.180> again<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.020> we're

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
we're gonna do that again but then we're

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.810 
we're gonna do that again but then we're
gonna<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.680> make<00:01:52.829> life<00:01:53.040> tool<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.729> I'm

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
gonna use the make life tool so I'm

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.660 
gonna use the make life tool so I'm
gonna<00:01:53.970> select<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.450> get<00:01:55.020> rid<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
gonna select this get rid of it

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.920 
gonna select this get rid of it
now<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.939> one<00:01:56.969> restriction<00:01:57.479> if<00:01:57.810> you're

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
now there is one restriction if you're

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.350 
now there is one restriction if you're
using<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.290> tool<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.070> only<00:01:59.369> use<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
using this tool you can only use the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560 
using this tool you can only use the
make<00:02:00.540> live<00:02:00.750> tool<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:02.070> object<00:02:02.430> now<00:02:03.240> these

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
make live tool on one object now these

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.859 
make live tool on one object now these
are<00:02:03.780> obviously<00:02:04.079> three<00:02:04.890> different<00:02:05.430> objects<00:02:05.880> so

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
are obviously three different objects so

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.469 
are obviously three different objects so
to<00:02:06.930> illustrate<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.340> click<00:02:09.239> all

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to illustrate this I have to click all

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.669 
to illustrate this I have to click all
three

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
three

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.759 
three
go<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.430> mesh<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.060> combine<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.379> can<00:02:13.530> I'll<00:02:13.650> do

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
go to mesh and combine and I can I'll do

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.649 
go to mesh and combine and I can I'll do
that<00:02:13.950> later<00:02:14.189> but<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.000> now<00:02:15.120> it's<00:02:15.420> one

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
that later but just for now it's one

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.750 
that later but just for now it's one
clickable<00:02:16.110> object<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.540> I'm<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.689> go<00:02:18.959> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
clickable object like so I'm gonna go to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.160 
clickable object like so I'm gonna go to
modify<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.420> make<00:02:21.569> sure<00:02:21.720> you<00:02:21.810> got<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.959> selected

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
modify so make sure you got it selected

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.509 
modify so make sure you got it selected
and<00:02:22.650> hit<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.489> make<00:02:23.700> live<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:25.140> right<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:26.340> now

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
and hit and make live all right so now

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.759 
and hit and make live all right so now
from<00:02:27.090> my<00:02:27.180> top<00:02:27.420> view<00:02:27.450> I'm<00:02:28.079> gonna<00:02:28.319> go<00:02:28.530> to<00:02:28.670> create

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
from my top view I'm gonna go to create

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.819 
from my top view I'm gonna go to create
CV<00:02:31.769> curve<00:02:32.010> tool<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.720> we're<00:02:34.319> gonna<00:02:34.439> try<00:02:34.709> that

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
CV curve tool and we're gonna try that

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.780 
CV curve tool and we're gonna try that
again<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.909> when<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.390> click<00:02:36.780> over<00:02:37.109> this<00:02:37.890> sphere

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
again so when I click over this sphere

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:47.240 
again so when I click over this sphere
here<00:02:40.730> and<00:02:41.730> my<00:02:42.599> cubes<00:02:42.959> down<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:47.069> I'll

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
here and my cubes down here and I'll

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.559 
here and my cubes down here and I'll
just<00:02:47.370> go<00:02:48.090> over<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.389> a<00:02:48.540> couple<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:48.900> times

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
just go over that a couple of times

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.520 
just go over that a couple of times
something<00:02:51.569> like<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.620> Hendra<00:02:53.370> okay<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
something like that and Hendra okay so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.660 
something like that and Hendra okay so
now<00:02:55.709> if<00:02:56.370> i<00:02:56.939> zoom<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.780> my<00:02:58.200> curve<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:59.609> can

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
now if i zoom in on my curve you can

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.789 
now if i zoom in on my curve you can
already<00:02:59.909> see<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.720> lines<00:03:00.930> going<00:03:01.200> up<00:03:01.470> so

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
already see that the lines going up so

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.050 
already see that the lines going up so
if<00:03:02.010> I<00:03:02.129> select<00:03:02.519> it<00:03:02.849> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.150> pull<00:03:03.329> that<00:03:03.359> up

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
if I select it and I pull that up

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.099 
if I select it and I pull that up
suddenly<00:03:06.060> there's<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.510> lot<00:03:06.659> of<00:03:06.750> dimension

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
suddenly there's a lot of dimension

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.339 
suddenly there's a lot of dimension
going<00:03:07.620> on<00:03:07.799> here<00:03:08.129> okay<00:03:09.090> which<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.870> pretty<00:03:10.139> neat

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
going on here okay which is pretty neat

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.629 
going on here okay which is pretty neat
so<00:03:11.310> if<00:03:11.639> you<00:03:11.790> want<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.329> let's<00:03:13.260> say<00:03:13.560> create<00:03:14.400> a

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
so if you want to let's say create a

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.849 
so if you want to let's say create a
curve<00:03:15.180> rope<00:03:15.660> something<00:03:16.199> like<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.739> can

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
curve rope something like that you can

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.729 
curve rope something like that you can
use<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.970> at<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.239> same<00:03:18.419> time<00:03:18.480> if<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.260> pull

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
use this now at the same time if I pull

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.750 
use this now at the same time if I pull
this<00:03:19.859> back<00:03:20.099> down<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:21.569> can<00:03:21.720> see<00:03:22.079> that<00:03:22.470> it's<00:03:22.799> not

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
this back down you can see that it's not

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.300 
this back down you can see that it's not
going<00:03:24.209> straight<00:03:24.930> up<00:03:25.139> over<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.859> cube<00:03:26.129> and

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
going straight up over the cube and

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.699 
going straight up over the cube and
straight<00:03:26.609> down<00:03:26.690> because<00:03:27.690> when<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:28.319> create<00:03:28.500> a

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
straight down because when you create a

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.580 
straight down because when you create a
CV<00:03:28.919> curve<00:03:29.250> tool<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.879> I<00:03:30.629> make<00:03:30.840> one<00:03:31.049> point<00:03:31.319> there

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
CV curve tool and I make one point there

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.289 
CV curve tool and I make one point there
I<00:03:31.620> want<00:03:31.919> to<00:03:31.949> point<00:03:32.099> there<00:03:32.400> it's<00:03:32.699> gonna<00:03:32.849> curve

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
I want to point there it's gonna curve

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.780 
I want to point there it's gonna curve
between<00:03:33.659> these<00:03:34.019> two<00:03:34.319> that's<00:03:35.129> the<00:03:35.370> reason<00:03:35.639> for

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
between these two that's the reason for

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.530 
between these two that's the reason for
that<00:03:35.849> okay

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
that okay

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.539 
that okay
but<00:03:37.109> nevertheless<00:03:37.379> it's<00:03:37.919> still<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.190> pretty

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
but nevertheless it's still a pretty

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.089 
but nevertheless it's still a pretty
neat<00:03:38.730> trick<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.859> hopefully<00:03:40.859> it's<00:03:41.040> helpful

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
neat trick and hopefully it's helpful

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.879 
neat trick and hopefully it's helpful
for<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.579> guys<00:03:41.639> so<00:03:42.540> thanks<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:43.229> watching<00:03:43.290> see
