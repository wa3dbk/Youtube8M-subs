00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.579 

this<00:00:00.870> next<00:00:01.170> technique<00:00:01.469> is<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.070> copier<00:00:02.790> transfer

00:00:03.579 --> 00:00:03.589 
this next technique is a copier transfer

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.710 
this next technique is a copier transfer
what<00:00:04.589> I've<00:00:04.740> done<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.279> I've<00:00:05.520> taken<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:06.210> wood

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
what I've done is I've taken a wood

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.640 
what I've done is I've taken a wood
panel<00:00:07.140> I've<00:00:07.820> primed<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:09.059> with<00:00:09.480> medium<00:00:10.349> and

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
panel I've primed it with medium and

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.799 
panel I've primed it with medium and
then<00:00:10.800> fused<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.580> then<00:00:12.150> I've<00:00:12.360> applied<00:00:12.660> a

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
then fused it and then I've applied a

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.250 
then fused it and then I've applied a
couple<00:00:13.230> colors<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:14.299> yellow<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:16.049> very

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
couple colors a yellow and a very

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.120 
couple colors a yellow and a very
transparent<00:00:17.180> orange<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.420> top<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.800> fused

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
transparent orange on top and have fused

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.840 
transparent orange on top and have fused
them<00:00:20.430> well<00:00:20.960> I've<00:00:21.960> let<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> board<00:00:22.830> cool<00:00:23.310> to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
them well I've let the board cool to

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.609 
them well I've let the board cool to
being<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.260> warm<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:27.080> we're<00:00:28.080> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> apply

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
being just warm and we're going to apply

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.659 
being just warm and we're going to apply
a<00:00:29.070> transfer<00:00:30.050> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> design<00:00:32.279> from<00:00:32.550> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
a transfer this is a design from a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.979 
a transfer this is a design from a
samurai<00:00:33.059> design<00:00:33.780> book<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:35.010> called<00:00:35.690> moon<00:00:36.690> and

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
samurai design book it's called moon and

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.240 
samurai design book it's called moon and
Japanese<00:00:37.410> pampas<00:00:38.010> grasses<00:00:38.600> I've<00:00:40.219> made<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
Japanese pampas grasses I've made a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.869 
Japanese pampas grasses I've made a
copier<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> toner-based<00:00:43.879> copy

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
copier this this is a toner-based copy

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.150 
copier this this is a toner-based copy
and<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.750> important<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> has<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.800> toner

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and that's important it has to be toner

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.450 
and that's important it has to be toner
cut<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.730> size<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.890> I'm<00:00:49.890> now<00:00:50.100> going<00:00:50.160> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
cut it to size and I'm now going to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.540 
cut it to size and I'm now going to
apply<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.129> slightly<00:00:53.129> warm<00:00:53.640> wax<00:00:55.430> lay<00:00:56.430> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
apply it to the slightly warm wax lay it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.380 
apply it to the slightly warm wax lay it
over<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.090> burnish<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.469> well<00:00:59.359> you<00:01:00.359> can

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
over and burnish it really well you can

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
over and burnish it really well you can
use<00:01:00.809> anything<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.590> burnish<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.870> spoon<00:01:04.369> it's

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
use anything to burnish a spoon it's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
use anything to burnish a spoon it's
just<00:01:05.610> as<00:01:05.729> convenient<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.540> maybe<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.840> little

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just as convenient and maybe a little

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.250 
just as convenient and maybe a little
more<00:01:07.170> comfortable<00:01:07.970> than<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.390> other<00:01:09.570> tools<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
more comfortable than some other tools I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
more comfortable than some other tools I
also<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.460> a<00:01:12.650> here<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.680> fold<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> bone<00:01:14.549> folder

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
also have a here a fold or a bone folder

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.219 
also have a here a fold or a bone folder
but<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.900> think<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> spoon<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.280> be

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
but I think the spoon is going to be

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.300 
but I think the spoon is going to be
just<00:01:19.229> fine<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.710> use<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:21.799> it<00:01:22.799> helps<00:01:23.159> if

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
just fine to use for this it helps if

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.370 
just fine to use for this it helps if
the<00:01:23.490> surface<00:01:24.000> you're<00:01:24.150> applying<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.810> on<00:01:25.049> is

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the surface you're applying it on is

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.940 
the surface you're applying it on is
smooth<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.720> my<00:01:27.930> surface<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.590> pretty

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
smooth and I think my surface was pretty

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.840 
smooth and I think my surface was pretty
smooth<00:01:29.310> after<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:29.880> transferred<00:01:31.400> so<00:01:32.400> we<00:01:32.579> start

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
smooth after I transferred so we start

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.370 
smooth after I transferred so we start
by<00:01:32.970> laying<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> down<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.600> burnishing<00:01:33.960> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
by laying it down in burnishing like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.929 
by laying it down in burnishing like
this<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.640> contact<00:01:36.240> as<00:01:36.479> possible

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
this get as good a contact as possible

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.359 
this get as good a contact as possible
between<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.299> toner<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:41.220> can

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
between the toner and you can be you can

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
between the toner and you can be you can
be<00:01:41.400> pretty<00:01:41.670> heavy-handed<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.630> wax<00:01:42.869> is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
be pretty heavy-handed the wax is

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.719 
be pretty heavy-handed the wax is
durable<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:46.770> don't<00:01:46.920> want<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> wax<00:01:47.280> hot

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
durable you don't want the wax hot

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.700 
durable you don't want the wax hot
because<00:01:48.210> it'll<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.450> squish<00:01:49.020> out<00:01:49.259> from

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
because it'll just squish out from

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.609 
because it'll just squish out from
underneath<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:51.149> warm<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> accepts<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
underneath but warm so it accepts the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:05.430 
underneath but warm so it accepts the
toner<00:01:55.939> so<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.090> start<00:01:57.420> with<00:01:57.570> that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.350 

then<00:02:06.440> we<00:02:06.590> pour<00:02:06.890> a<00:02:06.920> little<00:02:07.310> bit<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.580> water<00:02:10.360> onto

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
then we pour a little bit of water onto

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.160 
then we pour a little bit of water onto
the<00:02:11.450> back<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:16.180> let<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.210> soak<00:02:17.630> into<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.080> paper

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the back and let it soak into the paper

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.590 
the back and let it soak into the paper
and<00:02:18.710> that's<00:02:19.580> how<00:02:19.790> we're<00:02:19.940> going<00:02:20.060> to<00:02:20.120> remove<00:02:20.390> the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
and that's how we're going to remove the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.520 
and that's how we're going to remove the
paper<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.830> image<00:02:26.140> so<00:02:27.140> when<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:27.350> use

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
paper from the image so when you use

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.800 
paper from the image so when you use
this<00:02:27.740> technique<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.550> can<00:02:28.790> be<00:02:29.000> on<00:02:29.240> the<00:02:29.570> top

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
this technique this can be on the top

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.120 
this technique this can be on the top
layer<00:02:30.080> if<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.710> want<00:02:31.960> you<00:02:32.960> can<00:02:33.820> put<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:34.970> on<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
layer if you want you can put it on a

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.710 
layer if you want you can put it on a
wax<00:02:37.670> layer<00:02:38.060> and<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:38.690> wax<00:02:39.020> over<00:02:39.560> it<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:41.060> more

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
wax layer and then wax over it with more

00:02:41.720 --> 00:03:17.850 
wax layer and then wax over it with more
layers<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.320> give<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.100> a<00:02:44.170> more<00:02:45.170> opaque<00:02:45.770> look

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.710 

like<00:03:18.860> now<00:03:19.070> just<00:03:19.460> gonna<00:03:19.640> use<00:03:19.910> my<00:03:20.150> fingers<00:03:20.690> to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
like now just gonna use my fingers to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.280 
like now just gonna use my fingers to
pull<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.680> paper<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.360> roll<00:03:23.720> it<00:03:23.900> up<00:03:26.290> and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
pull the paper so just roll it up and

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.060
