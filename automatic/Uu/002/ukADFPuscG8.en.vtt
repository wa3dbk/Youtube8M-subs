00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Pre-production problem 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.073
 Hello again! Starting this week 

00:00:12.073 --> 00:00:15.120
 Allison will officially cut to recover. I think you know what that means. 

00:00:17.006 --> 00:00:20.099
 Yeah. Marathon guest artists. Over the next few weeks. 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.278
 Maybe months? I do not know, we'll bring a group of guest artists to help us. 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.059
 I think this will bring more fun. On this note, they welcomed Molly Maloney. 

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:31.575
 She is a concept artist currently working on finishing the Master of Fine Arts in San Francisco. 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:35.085
 They are here to help us talk about pre-production (preparation for production). 

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:38.159
 How sane we have not talked about this before? I think we usually ask 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.958
 Possible solutions to problems rather than simply talking about them. 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.573
 But I think this is one of the problems for which we have not found a suitable solution. 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.014
 They are, unfortunately, a very big problem. 

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:50.553
 So we hope to talk about it will give at least some point of view within the field. 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.053
 Most bad video games are the result of poor production methodology. 

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:56.332
 Or to convey: poor planning. I know that seems very clear. 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.812
 But there is an incredibly common case in this area, 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:02.880
 They are responsible for a large number of bad games. 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:06.032
 Total lack of planning prior to production. Planning before production is the right time to try to figure out everything 

00:01:06.032 --> 00:01:08.121
 Before starting the actual construction process. 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.079
 Effectively: the planning phase. Not having enough time means that things like: 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.130
 Story, characters 

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:17.015
 The style of art and even the kefiyat will be pushed to the phrase "we will find a solution for this later" 

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:20.099
 Now, I'm sure most of you already know this: Planning is everything, especially for huge productions. 

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.092
 Not having enough time to think about things before jumping to try to start them out 

00:01:25.038 --> 00:01:28.132
 Ensures a lot of problems. That is obvious to you. As is evident to me. 

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:32.063
 It is clear to all who work in this field today. So the question becomes: 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.045
 Why do not studios put pre-production time? Because it is known that the pre-production period 

00:01:36.045 --> 00:01:38.052
 The cheapest period in the game development cycle. 

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:41.064
 You will not need as much staff as you need in actual production, 

00:01:41.064 --> 00:01:43.070
 Investing in the time of preparation for the production will eventually save the studio money. 

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:47.077
 Unfortunately there is one unique thorny video game that prevents it. 

00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:50.095
 And here's the question: What should you do with all these programmers? 

00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:53.574
 During full production you will need a lot of programmers to put together 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.039
 The technique needed to produce the game. 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.188
 But in preparation for production there is not much they can do. You have to get a few 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.007
 From the programmed programmers to know what technology to use, 

00:02:02.007 --> 00:02:04.014
 So you can make unique features for your new game. But 

00:02:04.077 --> 00:02:07.111
 When you already have a drive to work from a previous project or you've got a license 

00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:09.016
 For a drive like Unreal Drive, 

00:02:09.016 --> 00:02:11.107
 The presence of software engineers will not be of any use 

00:02:12.007 --> 00:02:13.095
 Take the key decisions of the game they will build. 

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:16.148
 Sure, a few engine engineers can adjust the engine to improve its performance slightly, 

00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:19.087
 Also, shady employees can come out with new shades, 

00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:20.816
 Which can be an integral part of creating an art style. 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.083
 But what about the staff style of play? Network staff? They are stuck in pretending to be busy. 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.076
 Or coming for a two-day period. The programmers pay very high. When you are stuck in the provision of salaries, 

00:02:29.076 --> 00:02:32.082
 Insurance and payment of rent for the workspace as well as payment for licenses, 

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.064
 And the technology they will use, 

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:37.083
 The average programmer's salary in Seattle is about $ 100 and $ 10,000 a year. 

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:41.095
 Or eight thousand two hundred and fifty dollars a month. Let's say your own standard 

00:02:41.095 --> 00:02:42.554
 For the medium-sized development department 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.073
 Thirty AAA programmers are present in a project. Let's say that ten of them probably do 

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:48.119
 Work of value during the pre-production period. 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.042
 That means you're wasting $ 165,000 a month 

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:53.087
 In the pre-production stage. 

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:56.736
 Or in other words more than a year and a half of the time it could have been exploited. 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.065
 Those wasted hours could actually be used to build the game. 

00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:03.081
 It is impossible to justify this in many hierarchical companies that have been created. 

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.884
 Justifying this is more difficult for investors. When you add this 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.094
 Social pressure within the studio to find work for the staff to do, 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.805
 You can see the stage of planning the production stops after a short period normally. 

00:03:13.072 --> 00:03:15.651
 The problem of finding enough time for pre-production, 0: 03: 13.129,1193: 02: 47.295 In short, 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.326
 Is a problem that affects our field and has caused many projects to be destroyed, which are worth millions of dollars. 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.054
 Now many of you might think like me, 

00:03:22.054 --> 00:03:25.083
 That planning is better possible if we make the production preparation team 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.006
 In the current project works a few months earlier. 

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.103
 The nicest answer to that is that with the best layout you can 

00:03:30.003 --> 00:03:30.792
 We plan better. 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.023
 Putting the joke aside, I think that is the solution to this problem. 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.004
 There are a few reasons why gaming studios can not use this method. 

00:03:38.004 --> 00:03:41.263
 First, it requires them to move high-level employees away from the product before it is released. 

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:45.078
 Unfortunately, the way this domain is managed is different. The production of games depends on the fact that all labor is on it 

00:03:45.078 --> 00:03:46.086
 Is in the final stage. 

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:49.245
 Even when they are not, the production of games has another strange obsession: 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.461
 The more games you play, the more you learn that you can build them the better. James never participated in a project 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.054
 Produce a game so that it can get all the features that it plans to have. 

00:03:56.054 --> 00:03:59.313
 I do not know anyone who could. This means that even projects 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.022
 Which is built in an excellent way, 

00:04:01.022 --> 00:04:03.118
 People tend to want to know if they can add a few 

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:06.064
 Other fantastic features on the design file were that they thought they were going to delete some of its contents. 

00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:08.161
 Or see if they can bring back some things 

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:11.720
 They did not know it was wrong until they tried the game themselves. 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.325
 Which ultimately leads to the unwillingness of anyone to enter the pre-production stage in the next project. 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.091
 This is in addition to the strange feeling of guilt by the makers of this field for their preoccupation 

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.169
 In the stage of preparation for production, while the competing studios continue to boast of their success in the game production of the last games. 

00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:25.046
 For some reason people tend to think of the stage of preparation for production as "not a real business". 

00:04:25.082 --> 00:04:28.181
 And ironically. The stage of preparation for production can also lead to productivity problems 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.071
 Especially if your team is in front of a long crisis by setting an hourly deadline! 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.099
 The preparation stage of production can generate the feeling that you have "all the time in the world". 

00:04:36.055 --> 00:04:39.081
 Things start to show the opposite. When people start to assimilate. 

00:04:39.081 --> 00:04:42.105
 Well if, we have a number of problems to solve here. But the games are not only high-tech 

00:04:43.005 --> 00:04:44.994
 And the many different forms of art found here. 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.039
 How can other areas of the same character succeed? Maybe we can learn from them. 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.046
 Let's start by looking at the film industry, 

00:04:49.046 --> 00:04:51.815
 When the film is finished, the cast and all the crew go on their own. 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.076
 People who participated in the preparation for production are already beginning to join new projects. 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.035
 The main production staff are joining other projects that have just emerged from 

00:04:58.035 --> 00:04:59.046
 Pre-production. 

00:04:59.046 --> 00:05:02.052
 It works in the field of films. But I'm not really sure that this model fits the field of the gaming industry 

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:03.125
 In its current form. 

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:07.006
 Preserving a development team tends to be more important in games than it is in movies. 

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:09.885
 Or at least this is the wisdom of the traditional industry I'm not sure how true it is. 

00:05:11.013 --> 00:05:13.702
 Even if they are not, there is also the fact that there are no agents in our field. 

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:17.155
 Employment and job search is a nightmare in the field of games. This caused no one to want to try 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:19.061
 Hire new employees in each project that starts to develop a game. 

00:05:19.061 --> 00:05:21.135
 Besides, people who work in the gaming industry do not tend to have that kind of risk. 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.000
 Many developers want to be sure they get a job after launching their game. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.789
 It's a tragedy how that usually does not happen anyway. 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.096
 So the field of filmmaking may not be an ideal example. But I think I know 

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.365
 Another model might be. 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.072
 animation. Perhaps because the field of the animation industry is my domain 

00:05:35.072 --> 00:05:37.171
 Or maybe because Pixar like most gaming studios you keep 

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.680
 Staff from one project to another. 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:43.388
 But I think this model might work. Pixaromauma is signed for at least two years 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.031
 In the construction of the story and the pre-production stage of each film. 

00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.450
 At this time, the majority of the crew are engaged in other projects. 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.041
 You have the greatest major power to work from artists 

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.044
 All model makers, movers and lighters, shaded sculptors, impact artists, etc. Most may work 

00:05:54.044 --> 00:05:57.059
 Under one manager on the current main project in an attempt to finish the film in time 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.978
 To launch in galleries. 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.062
 But there is often another way out with a small team 

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:02.261
 On the next film. 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.016
 From refinement to story and R &amp; D technology to be used. 

00:06:06.016 --> 00:06:09.016
 At the same time, there is a third manager working with a bunch of guys from 

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:09.069
 Story Section 

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.094
 To compile early storyboards for the next film. 

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:15.096
 All these directors have preconceived ideas for the next film they want to produce. 

00:06:15.096 --> 00:06:18.100
 So in no time, which is the power of your main business working hard on a project, 

00:06:19.036 --> 00:06:22.069
 By the time they finish their project there will always be another project ready for them to move to. 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.086
 I'm not an expert on this thing but I think this system has some advantages. 

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:29.115
 Even if things remain limited to only two projects: one under production, 

00:06:30.015 --> 00:06:31.714
 The other is planned by a small driving team. 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.044
 So you'll always have a project to work on while there's another one ready to go. 

00:06:35.044 --> 00:06:38.055
 All the benefits of planning for the future will be yours with no downtime. 

00:06:38.055 --> 00:06:40.127
 Now, regardless of everything and despite my return so it is always worth remembering: 

00:06:41.027 --> 00:06:44.065
 New developers: It is very easy to hang in 

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:45.162
 Pre-production when you do not have any deadlines. 

00:06:46.062 --> 00:06:49.078
 James saw a lot of enthusiastic young players trapped in the trap 

00:06:49.078 --> 00:06:50.527
 Permanently revise the design file, 

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:53.326
 Draw multiple models for their world and talk about their game, 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.065
 But they never built any game. 

00:06:55.065 --> 00:06:58.066
 It is important to know when to stop planning and start building. 

00:06:58.066 --> 00:07:00.725
 You should not be afraid to put an early prototype of your thoughts. 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.326
 But the value of spending this time thinking before we start building can never go down the drain. 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.410
 There were many games over there 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:09.044
 To extend its pre-production. 

00:07:09.044 --> 00:07:13.483
 Bioshock, fallout 3, portal I think the results speak for themselves. 

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:16.081
 It is one of the few things most developers agree on, 

00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:18.530
 But failing to get this time is endemic to the way we build games. 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.052
 I will say this: any developer can solve the pre-production problem, 

00:07:22.052 --> 00:07:25.108
 Is halfway to be the future as Valve, Bioware, Blizzard 

00:07:26.008 --> 00:07:29.024
 If any of you work in the games, and have some ideas or suggestions on this issue,

 Contact us, because we love to hear from you. 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:32.834
 Thank you Molly for these beautiful pictures. Thanks for following up and see you next week.
