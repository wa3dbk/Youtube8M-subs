00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.230
 hats 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.809
 I'm sure you can recognize 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.740
 a character because his chariot with regard to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.359
 charlots johnston is that one that you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.199
 remember nothing you'll understand 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.699
 today we are at 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.699
 chazelles-sur-lyon at the hat museum 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.800
 the hat museum workshop presents 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.290
 as its name says it's both 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.810
 a workshop is amused so it's a museum 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.360
 in the sense that you have the whole 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.310
 presentation of the manufacture of the 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.690
 hat from the rabbit hair this 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.820
 machine for example that reproduces the 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.130
 manufacturing process with a little 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.350
 of exaggeration of course from rabbit to 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.730

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.520
 to the crusaders who had put wool 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.680
 in their shoes for more 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.420
 comfort and long walks but with 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.160
 sweaty feet therefore created 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.850

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.850

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.280
 factories a hundred years ago 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.790

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.730
 man or woman in the last century 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.930
 well it was enough to look at 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.670
 inside that of the man was 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.840
 a lot more elegant it was not a 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.710
 question of privilege 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.070
 it was because the man was 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.070
 discovered and then know a sudden 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
