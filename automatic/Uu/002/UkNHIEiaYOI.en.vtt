I think Union ECC Koenig and using the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
I think Union ECC Koenig and using the
Matt<00:01:19.710> Cruz<00:01:19.860> receiver<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.490> bridge<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.909> he

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
Matt Cruz receiver there bridge so he

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.030 
Matt Cruz receiver there bridge so he
can<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.869> ability<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> mix<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.770> card
