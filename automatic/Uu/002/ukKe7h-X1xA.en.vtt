copycat<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.820> your<00:00:47.940> hand<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:49.110> trying

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
copycat in your hand and really trying

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.810 
copycat in your hand and really trying

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to figure out what cards you can play

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.029 
to figure out what cards you can play
versus<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.899> much<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.559> use<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.800> draw

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
versus how much you can use your draw

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.189 
versus how much you can use your draw
engine<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> where<00:00:54.570> that's<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.050> leave

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
engine and where that's going to leave

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
engine and where that's going to leave
you<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.379> your<00:00:55.680> hand<00:00:55.890> size<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> end<00:00:56.579> I

Pokemon ty rogue is great for getting
the<00:01:41.670> dunk<00:01:41.880> on<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.210> opponent<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.780> well<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:43.439> for

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the dunk on your opponent as well as for

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.190 
the dunk on your opponent as well as for
stalling<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.159> they<00:01:44.310> point<00:01:44.549> during<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.909> game

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
stalling and they point during the game

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.450 
stalling and they point during the game
however<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.290> find<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.220> extra

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
however I find that if you need extra

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
however I find that if you need extra

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.979 
more room for trainers and supporters if
you<00:03:20.250> decide<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.670> drop<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.030> kingdra<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.810> can

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
you decide to drop the kingdra you can

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.770 
you decide to drop the kingdra you can
easily<00:03:22.230> drop<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.709> rainbow<00:03:23.069> energy<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:24.480> do

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
easily drop the rainbow energy if you do

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.449 
easily drop the rainbow energy if you do
this<00:03:24.989> i<00:03:25.170> would<00:03:25.380> suggest<00:03:25.560> increasing<00:03:26.370> your

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
this i would suggest increasing your

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.690 
this i would suggest increasing your
lightning<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:27.150> around<00:03:27.420> 10<00:03:27.720> or<00:03:27.750> 11<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.700> the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
lightning to around 10 or 11 and the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.430 
lightning to around 10 or 11 and the
rescue<00:03:30.060> energy<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.480> think<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.870> can<00:03:31.019> bring<00:03:31.200> down

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
rescue energy I think you can bring down

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.099 
rescue energy I think you can bring down
to<00:03:31.709> one<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.069> two<00:03:32.630> especially<00:03:33.630> with<00:03:33.930> Pachirisu

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
to one to two especially with Pachirisu

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.349 
to one to two especially with Pachirisu
I<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.920> to<00:03:35.040> see<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.459> lightning<00:03:35.910> energy<00:03:36.239> in

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
I like to see more lightning energy in

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.940 
I like to see more lightning energy in
this<00:03:36.510> deck<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.170> the<00:03:37.290> chance<00:03:37.530> of<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.709> being

this deck so the chance of you being

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.920 
this deck so the chance of you being
able<00:03:38.280> to<00:03:38.459> use<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> use<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.540> lightning

able to use it and use to lightning

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.660 
able to use it and use to lightning
rather<00:03:40.200> than<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.680> being<00:03:40.920> forced<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:41.459> stick

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670

with<00:03:41.819> one<00:03:42.060> or<00:03:42.299> more<00:03:42.359> likely<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.590> run<00:03:43.769> for
