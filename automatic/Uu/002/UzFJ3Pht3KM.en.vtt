00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
feel like it but the big distinction is

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.670 
feel like it but the big distinction is
that<00:02:44.150> I<00:02:44.780> have<00:02:45.260> finally<00:02:45.590> let<00:02:46.070> go<00:02:46.100> of<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.910> guilt

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
a 10-10 one hundred percent and this has

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.830 
a 10-10 one hundred percent and this has
been<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:55.269> huge<00:02:56.269> deal<00:02:56.570> for<00:02:56.630> me<00:02:56.900> because<00:02:58.840> people

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
been a huge deal for me because people

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.470 
been a huge deal for me because people
who<00:02:59.989> are<00:03:00.170> striving<00:03:00.860> who<00:03:01.519> even<00:03:01.940> are<00:03:02.030> attracted

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
who are striving who even are attracted

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.290 
who are striving who even are attracted
to<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.690> 80<00:03:02.840> 10<00:03:03.050> 10<00:03:03.080> lifestyle<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:04.090> feel<00:03:05.090> like

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
to the 80 10 10 lifestyle I feel like

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.449 
to the 80 10 10 lifestyle I feel like
they're<00:03:06.080> already<00:03:07.330> overachievers<00:03:08.330> there<00:03:08.720> are

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
they're already overachievers there are

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.710 
they're already overachievers there are
what<00:03:10.459> the<00:03:10.580> people<00:03:10.760> would<00:03:10.940> call<00:03:11.090> overachievers

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
what the people would call overachievers

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.900 
what the people would call overachievers
I<00:03:11.900> guess<00:03:12.470> because<00:03:13.070> we're<00:03:13.280> willing<00:03:13.549> to<00:03:13.640> take<00:03:13.760> on

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
I guess because we're willing to take on

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.550 
I guess because we're willing to take on
that<00:03:14.120> challenge<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:15.049> the<00:03:15.170> best<00:03:15.350> for

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
that challenge and we want the best for

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.479 
that challenge and we want the best for
ourselves<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:17.650> so<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.829> makes<00:03:19.010> us<00:03:19.190> really

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
ourselves and so that makes us really

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.250 
ourselves and so that makes us really
the<00:03:20.209> type<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.390> people<00:03:20.660> that<00:03:20.720> will<00:03:20.900> work<00:03:21.019> hard

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
the type of people that will work hard

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.110 
the type of people that will work hard
to<00:03:21.320> get<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.709> but<00:03:22.370> it<00:03:22.459> also<00:03:22.640> makes<00:03:22.940> us<00:03:23.090> the

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
to get that but it also makes us the

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.150 
to get that but it also makes us the
type<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.390> people<00:03:23.720> that<00:03:23.750> are<00:03:24.160> incredibly

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
type of people that are incredibly

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
type of people that are incredibly
judgmental<00:03:25.970> of<00:03:26.120> ourselves<00:03:26.269> and<00:03:26.930> sometimes

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
judgmental of ourselves and sometimes

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.289 
judgmental of ourselves and sometimes
even<00:03:27.620> of<00:03:27.860> others<00:03:28.160> if<00:03:28.750> they<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:30.260> we<00:03:30.470> don't

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
even of others if they if we don't

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.120 
even of others if they if we don't
uphold<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.750> one<00:03:32.870> hundred<00:03:33.140> percent<00:03:33.170> if<00:03:33.980> we

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
uphold the one hundred percent if we

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.199 
uphold the one hundred percent if we
don't<00:03:34.220> meet<00:03:34.489> our<00:03:34.700> goals<00:03:35.000> and<00:03:37.180> so<00:03:38.180> I

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
don't meet our goals and so I

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.240 
don't meet our goals and so I
experienced<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.930> lot<00:03:39.049> of<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.350> after<00:03:40.220> I

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
experienced a lot of that after I

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.900 
experienced a lot of that after I
stopped<00:03:40.730> eating<00:03:41.090> what<00:03:41.570> 100<00:03:42.140> sent<00:03:42.290> 80<00:03:42.410> 10<00:03:42.650> 10<00:03:42.910> I

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
stopped eating what 100 sent 80 10 10 I

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.020 
stopped eating what 100 sent 80 10 10 I
was<00:03:44.810> always<00:03:45.320> trying<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.519> be<00:03:46.760> a<00:03:46.790> hundred

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
was always trying to be a hundred

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.670 
was always trying to be a hundred
percent<00:03:47.180> but<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.750> was<00:03:47.930> always<00:03:48.140> falling<00:03:48.500> short

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
percent but I was always falling short

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.220 
percent but I was always falling short
and<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:49.640> I<00:03:49.880> would<00:03:50.120> go<00:03:50.239> up<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.660> down<00:03:50.780> and<00:03:50.840> up<00:03:51.110> and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
and we I would go up and down and up and

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.740 
and we I would go up and down and up and
down<00:03:51.320> a<00:03:51.590> whole<00:03:51.920> lot<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:53.299> didn't<00:03:53.630> matter

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
down a whole lot and it didn't matter

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.229 
down a whole lot and it didn't matter
when<00:03:54.590> I<00:03:54.620> was<00:03:54.799> on<00:03:54.829> 80<00:03:55.160> 10<00:03:55.400> 10<00:03:55.430> I<00:03:55.610> wasn't<00:03:56.000> happy

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
when I was on 80 10 10 I wasn't happy

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.420 
when I was on 80 10 10 I wasn't happy
because<00:03:56.570> I<00:03:56.900> wanted<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.380> eating<00:03:57.650> food<00:03:58.100> and

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
because I wanted to be eating food and

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.080 
because I wanted to be eating food and
when<00:03:59.090> I<00:03:59.120> um<00:03:59.890> was<00:04:00.890> off<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.370> beej<00:04:01.489> antenna<00:04:01.820> ian

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
when I um was off a beej antenna ian

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.340 
when I um was off a beej antenna ian
cook<00:04:02.269> food<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.540> wasn't<00:04:02.810> happy<00:04:02.930> because<00:04:03.290> I

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
cook food I wasn't happy because I

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.949 
cook food I wasn't happy because I
wanted<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.709> be<00:04:03.829> on<00:04:04.070> 80<00:04:04.609> 10<00:04:04.880> 10<00:04:04.910> and<00:04:05.359> so<00:04:05.810> it<00:04:05.930> was

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
wanted to be on 80 10 10 and so it was

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.690 
wanted to be on 80 10 10 and so it was
like<00:04:06.140> I<00:04:06.260> was<00:04:06.290> in<00:04:06.590> this<00:04:06.859> battle<00:04:07.340> where<00:04:07.489> I<00:04:07.519> was

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
like I was in this battle where I was

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.650 
like I was in this battle where I was
never<00:04:08.030> happy<00:04:08.989> never<00:04:09.200> happy<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.180> it<00:04:11.180> took<00:04:11.600> a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
never happy never happy and it took a

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.690 
never happy never happy and it took a
long<00:04:11.989> time<00:04:12.049> for<00:04:12.440> me<00:04:12.650> to<00:04:12.859> realize<00:04:13.040> that<00:04:13.430> even

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
long time for me to realize that even

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.850 
long time for me to realize that even
when<00:04:13.820> I<00:04:13.850> wasn't<00:04:14.090> eating

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
when I wasn't eating

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.650 
when I wasn't eating
ten<00:04:15.040> one<00:04:15.190> hundred<00:04:15.220> percent<00:04:15.490> I<00:04:15.940> was<00:04:16.450> still

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
ten one hundred percent I was still

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.569 
ten one hundred percent I was still
eating<00:04:16.930> very<00:04:17.260> healthy<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.920> I<00:04:18.250> was<00:04:18.400> still

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
eating very healthy and I was still

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.120 
eating very healthy and I was still
feeling<00:04:18.609> very<00:04:19.570> good<00:04:19.840> if<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.680> would<00:04:20.829> let<00:04:20.950> my

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
feeling very good if I would let my
