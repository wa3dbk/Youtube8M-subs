00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.770
 I am standing here between the elinchrom d-lite 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.810
 rx 4 to go set and it is a complete one 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.799
 flashes of the renowned Swiss 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.080
 Brand 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.210
 it consists of 2 2 flash heads both 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.770
 400 watt seconds and it's far enough 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.720
 for portraits 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.490
 for example product photography 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.560
 it is delivered two softboxes and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.939
 with an umbrella reflector for when you get there 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.289
 would like to place an umbrella but 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.269
 it is not included 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.919
 if we are going to look at the headlines here I 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.390
 will just pick me up so you better 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.460
 can see 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.589
 then we have the control panel on 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.640
 so we see the backside 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.250
 flash power that you can of course 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.870
 pluses and minuses with these buttons and 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 Turn on the setting light 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.890
 so live sit down this is slave light 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 so if another flash fires 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.870
 is triggered with this eye and the 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.360
 beep on or off 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 and with this you can continue testing 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.750
 is also included 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.640
 a very nice channel to use the flash units 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.080
 and we see it here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.510
 we sit and ante on the net 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.950
 antennetje is a bit fragile i would 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 just let it sit like you do 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.160
 have enough range then it is better 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.990
 protected 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640
 Here you can set various groups 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.939
 the channel of course but you can even 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.920
 also adjust the flash power through 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.299
 this plus minus button will be pressed here 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.310
 next to hold then you see that as me on 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.920
 plus press that the power of the flash 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.079
 also goes up and of course you can too 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.579
 press test again to check if 

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.990
 that it does yes or no 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.999
 the set comes with these two 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
 bags and that is also a gift to the 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.079
 set is that it is pretty mobile 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.909
 that you can lose whole set in these two 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:32.069
 here we have a sturdy case for you 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.619
 flash heads and your smaller accessories 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.630
 or cables in your trigger and in this bag 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.149
 you can lose tripods this also means two 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.310
 tripods and for example you too 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.100
 softboxes the softboxes that come with it 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.829
 those goals that work are pretty good 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.079
 but yes they are a bit limp and 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.749
 we also see that on the inside 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.189
 there is no inside diffuser so it 

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:55.200
 is advisable to keep up with the times 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.479
 invest in better light formers 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.090
 but they do well and work well and you can 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.950
 of course just the same as the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.270
 get started then again more information 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.880
