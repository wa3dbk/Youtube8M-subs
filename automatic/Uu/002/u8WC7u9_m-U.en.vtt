you on a wild-goose chase so instead
here's<00:02:22.620> what<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> propose<00:02:23.570> assuming<00:02:24.570> for<00:02:24.600> a

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
here's what I propose assuming for a

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.450 
here's what I propose assuming for a
second<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.680> three<00:02:25.950> characters

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
second that you have three characters

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.310 
second that you have three characters
you<00:02:26.910> then<00:02:27.060> have<00:02:27.090> six<00:02:27.510> chances<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.140> week

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
you then have six chances in a week

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.450 
you then have six chances in a week
three<00:02:29.130> on<00:02:29.370> level<00:02:29.640> 34<00:02:30.000> 3<00:02:30.720> on<00:02:30.930> level<00:02:31.170> 35<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
three on level 34 3 on level 35 but to

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.830 
three on level 34 3 on level 35 but to
avoid<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.850> simply<00:02:33.150> having<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.480> complete<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
avoid you simply having to complete the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.810 
avoid you simply having to complete the
prison<00:02:34.110> six<00:02:34.260> times<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.100> instead<00:02:35.400> speed

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
prison six times you can instead speed

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.090 
prison six times you can instead speed
up<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.000> process<00:02:36.290> see<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.500> second<00:02:37.800> you<00:02:37.860> defeat

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
up the process see the second you defeat

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.010 
up the process see the second you defeat
the<00:02:38.130> boss<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.120> when<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.480> elder<00:02:39.750> cipher

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
the boss this is when the elder cipher

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.350 
the boss this is when the elder cipher
drops<00:02:40.260> so<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> do<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.460> get<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:42.180> know

instantly and it's at this point you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
that they are unable to because the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.840 
that they are unable to because the
activity<00:03:10.080> is<00:03:10.200> nearly<00:03:10.440> over<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.430> simply<00:03:11.730> have

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
activity is nearly over so simply have

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.430 
activity is nearly over so simply have
the<00:03:11.880> person<00:03:12.270> in<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> prison<00:03:12.810> kill<00:03:13.080> themselves

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
the person in the prison kill themselves

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.620 
the person in the prison kill themselves
then<00:03:13.860> during<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.280> three<00:03:14.670> two<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.150> respawn

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
then during the three two one respawn

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.360 
then during the three two one respawn
countdown<00:03:15.990> timer<00:03:16.200> your<00:03:16.740> teammates<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.250> then

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
countdown timer your teammates can then

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.550 
countdown timer your teammates can then
hit<00:03:17.550> join<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.570> is<00:03:18.840> how<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.020> get<00:03:19.200> back<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
hit join and that is how you get back in

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.740 
hit join and that is how you get back in
it's<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.340> small<00:03:20.550> window<00:03:20.640> but<00:03:21.270> it's<00:03:21.390> how<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.540> get

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
it's a small window but it's how you get

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.930 
it's a small window but it's how you get
around<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.170> once<00:03:23.100> they're<00:03:23.250> back<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.520> if<00:03:23.730> you

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
around it once they're back in if you

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.280 
around it once they're back in if you
want<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.570> person<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:24.840> was<00:03:24.990> holding<00:03:25.110> the

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
want to the person that was holding the

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.900 
want to the person that was holding the
spot<00:03:25.440> can<00:03:25.740> also<00:03:25.920> swap<00:03:26.160> their<00:03:26.340> characters<00:03:26.700> and

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
spot can also swap their characters and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.150 
spot can also swap their characters and
you<00:03:27.300> can<00:03:27.450> then<00:03:27.570> repeat<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.900> process<00:03:28.040> kill<00:03:29.040> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
you can then repeat the process kill the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.640 
you can then repeat the process kill the
boss<00:03:29.310> did<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.000> get<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.180> cipher<00:03:30.540> no<00:03:30.990> then<00:03:31.410> wipe

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
boss did you get the cipher no then wipe

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.070 
boss did you get the cipher no then wipe
and<00:03:31.830> start<00:03:32.280> again<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.730> if<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.750> this<00:03:33.870> three

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
and start again and if you do this three

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.360 
and start again and if you do this three
times<00:03:34.110> across<00:03:34.680> all<00:03:34.980> three<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.220> your

times across all three of your

times across all three of your
characters<00:03:35.730> then<00:03:36.240> assuming<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.720> cipher<00:03:36.990> also

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
characters then assuming the cipher also

characters then assuming the cipher also
abides<00:03:37.620> by<00:03:37.740> the<00:03:37.860> weekly<00:03:38.190> lockout<00:03:38.460> rule<00:03:38.670> then

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
abides by the weekly lockout rule then

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.820 
abides by the weekly lockout rule then
you've<00:03:39.300> just<00:03:39.540> had<00:03:39.660> your<00:03:39.690> three<00:03:40.020> attempts<00:03:40.440> all

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
you've just had your three attempts all

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.530 
you've just had your three attempts all
while<00:03:41.160> only<00:03:41.400> completing<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.000> prison<00:03:42.300> once

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
while only completing the prison once

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.020 
while only completing the prison once
and<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.320> bit<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:44.250> then<00:03:44.400> move<00:03:44.550> over<00:03:44.640> the<00:03:44.820> next

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
and a bit you then move over the next

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.340 
and a bit you then move over the next
difficulty<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.660> your<00:03:45.840> repeat<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.170> process

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
difficulty and your repeat the process

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.010 
difficulty and your repeat the process
and<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.770> my<00:03:47.700> friends<00:03:48.030> is<00:03:48.150> how<00:03:48.240> you<00:03:48.480> form<00:03:48.780> the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
and that my friends is how you form the

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.380 
and that my friends is how you form the
elder<00:03:49.290> cipher<00:03:49.650> now<00:03:50.490> if<00:03:50.610> any<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.880> you<00:03:51.030> have<00:03:51.209> got

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
elder cipher now if any of you have got

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.940 
elder cipher now if any of you have got
this<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.630> your<00:03:51.750> second<00:03:52.080> or<00:03:52.230> third<00:03:52.410> attempts<00:03:52.800> on

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
this on your second or third attempts on

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.920 
this on your second or third attempts on
these<00:03:53.370> same<00:03:53.610> character<00:03:54.090> then<00:03:54.450> do<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.780> course

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
these same character then do of course

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.240 
these same character then do of course
let<00:03:55.170> me<00:03:55.260> know<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.590> comments<00:03:56.010> down<00:03:56.040> below

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
let me know in the comments down below

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.820 
let me know in the comments down below
because<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.330> genuinely<00:03:57.690> is<00:03:57.750> formable<00:03:58.380> then

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
because if it genuinely is formable then

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.620 
because if it genuinely is formable then
you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.070> simply<00:03:59.220> use<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.580> method<00:03:59.880> above<00:04:00.090> but

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
you can simply use the method above but

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.480 
you can simply use the method above but
continue<00:04:00.959> farming<00:04:01.140> over<00:04:01.680> and<00:04:01.860> over<00:04:02.190> again

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
continue farming over and over again

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.020 
continue farming over and over again
kill<00:04:03.450> die<00:04:03.840> repeat<00:04:04.230> now<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.610> before<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:05.880> wrap

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
kill die repeat now just before I wrap

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.670 
kill die repeat now just before I wrap
this<00:04:06.120> up<00:04:06.270> I<00:04:06.480> want<00:04:06.750> to<00:04:06.810> reiterate<00:04:06.959> that<00:04:07.380> this

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
this up I want to reiterate that this

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.260 
this up I want to reiterate that this
drops<00:04:07.950> from<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.280> final<00:04:08.640> boss<00:04:08.730> on<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.090> level

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
drops from the final boss on the level

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.780 
drops from the final boss on the level
34<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.990> 35<00:04:10.620> versions<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.459> prison<00:04:11.760> of

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
34 and 35 versions of the prison of

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.850 
34 and 35 versions of the prison of
elders<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.480> drops<00:04:12.690> as<00:04:12.840> an<00:04:13.080> exotic<00:04:13.500> bounty

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
elders and it drops as an exotic bounty

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.460 
elders and it drops as an exotic bounty
so<00:04:14.490> you<00:04:14.550> do<00:04:14.730> not<00:04:14.970> need<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.630> treasure<00:04:15.870> key<00:04:16.080> to<00:04:16.260> get

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
so you do not need a treasure key to get

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.140 
so you do not need a treasure key to get
the<00:04:16.500> Elder<00:04:16.739> cipher<00:04:17.130> although<00:04:17.730> you<00:04:17.790> will<00:04:18.000> need

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
the Elder cipher although you will need

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.910 
the Elder cipher although you will need
it<00:04:18.180> later<00:04:18.270> on<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.350> should<00:04:19.500> also<00:04:19.709> make

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
it later on and you should also make

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.380 
it later on and you should also make
sure<00:04:19.980> that<00:04:20.310> you<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.520> a<00:04:20.549> free<00:04:20.850> bounty<00:04:21.180> slot

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
sure that you have a free bounty slot

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.570 
sure that you have a free bounty slot
before<00:04:21.570> going<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:23.160> with<00:04:23.250> all<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.460> said

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
you guys have got the other cipher and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.080 
you guys have got the other cipher and
if<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.860> what<00:04:29.129> weapon<00:04:29.400> did<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.520> choose<00:04:29.819> and
