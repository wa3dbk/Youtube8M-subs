00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.040
 that is, and g3 and therefore to you the unboxing of 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.040
 this smart 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.810
 a greeting to all friends of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.939
 androidworld.it unboxing dlgs or the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.830
 mini the compact call them as you like 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.240
 although I know that many turn up their noses 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.140
 for improper use some of these 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.610
 terms of lg that this is the packaging 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.149
 the yellow label indicates that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.920
 we took it on eprice it came to a 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.079
 price slightly lower than that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.420
 launch that we will see some later 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.399
 information first of all to the laser 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
 autofocus or the feature that 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.780
 made it particularly interesting for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.199
 many the magistrate 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:55.230
 then there is a 5 inch HD ips screen 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.819
 then 1280 x 720 pixel quad processor 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.359
 1.2 gb core 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:02.839
 I add that a snapdragon 400 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.540
 8 megapixel camera battery from 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.970
 2500 40 million per hour to connectivity 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 We have said the camera 8 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.969
 megapixels and beyond that is already 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 updated to the 4.4 version of hip cup 

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:22.950
 I didn't say he has a gigabyte of ram 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.020
 I say it now ok then we have it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.759
 smartphone that also supports no cod 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.630
 like all now smartphone lg we go 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.020
 forward 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.210
 here is the battery from 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.780
 and this is what Milan is doing now 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.689
 and the stereo headphone power supply with cable 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.500
 with answer button and usb cable 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.350
 micro usb 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.560
 so let's put everything aside for a moment 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.799
 we pull out the smartphone here it is 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.539
 so with the same fake design 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.479
 metallic even if slightly material 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.209
 different here seems more plastic than 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.579
 certainly to the one of g3 the usual ones 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.250
 touch keys on the back the flash LEDs in 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.380
 laser autofocus no button on the stamps 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.660
 because they are all behind the door 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.989
 infrared the second microphone then 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.239
 very similar to the older brother brings 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:17.239
 micro usb audio jack first microphone 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:25.489
 we are going to already that we insert the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:30.230
 battery then open the cover here 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:32.150
 we also have the slot for the sim and lo 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.930
 slot for the micro sd bill and the vision 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.569
 one over the other here we go to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.970
 close we go to turn it on but there 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.840
 review will come only after having it 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:49.760
 tested properly go to our forum 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:52.069
 androidworld.it slash forum in the 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.840
 section dedicated to the g 3 s pass 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.730
 questions on this little smartphone e 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.730
 We will respond in the final review 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.410
 for this reason, unboxing is all not 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.750
 that's all because I didn't say the price 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.430
 launch price 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.819
 349 euros selling price on and bryce 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.109
 point 325 euros for this unboxing now 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.760
 it really is everything 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:13.930
 a greeting from the hand leccisotti for 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.930
