00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 salama of a comrade I am juan curtain and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.060
 this is karma guitar and I'm very 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 happy because we are going to learn a 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.150
 great thing that I love about the great manu 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 We are going to learn at your request 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 the song mister baby you already know that 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.990
 is made in honor of the great bob marley 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.180
 let's learn it quickly because it's 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.920
 very easy let's start is a plan 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.750
 easy the chords are the minor 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.320
 re minor 'and sun 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.810
 okay then let's put it on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.700
 now a rhythm of reggae that is going to be 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:45.530
 it's going to be thumping 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:47.690
 and easy stop really worth so let's go 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 put it now with the chords and we're going to 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.970
 start singing the the least 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.170
 ah 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.170
 poisons only the least 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:10.250
 D minor is only decanting soul 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.250
 sensation ball with a little 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.340
 sales a bill condon 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.510
 they are tense bird to huelva to the goal 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.150
 they are the only sambil 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.600
 and we continued like this with the chorus and with 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.369
 everything now that we are going to do we could 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.159
 play more and all the time now what you 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.750
 I encourage those who already do well 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.659
 cheeks that we get our eyebrows 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.729
 You can play it like that all the time 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.990
 they already control the matches we are going to 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.990
 do it the least 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.619
 re minor ' although I like to take away the 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 little finger so that it is lower seventh 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.939
 and then sol agree then we're going to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.210
 use these chords in the stanzas and in 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:10.440
 the chorus we will use the others 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:16.820
 let's play the next stanza 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.820
 and here I do a rally 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 it will be 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:30.970
 montemayor is willing willie al hiti 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.349
 if I myself 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.659
 now we go to the open chords 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.120
 but let's change the pace we're going to 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.760
 open it a little bit we are going to tonic 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.370
 marked down up stop and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.519
 montcada of agreement are a little more 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.379
 of the roll of the Jamaican reggae to see 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.120
 then it would be the oil tonic in the 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.640
 minor in the fifth in D minor is the 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.020
 fourth and the sun is the sixth according 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.550
 so 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:12.610
 1 2 3 and the king 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:17.400
 without leaving my disk or crisis 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.400
 and miami 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:27.340
 m 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:33.220
 no swing filme war disc pressure 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.620
 and if you have seen it quite easy 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.379
 if we put it between the chords with 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.000
 capo in the stanzas making the 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.000
 more dry rhythm of african reggae 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.099
 and then put is in the chorus the 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.640
 open chords with reggae rhythms 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:50.640
 Jamaican 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.580
 agree now for those who 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.080
 you want to advance even more we could 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.080
 do it with arpeggios 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.850
 on this side with fifth keeps third 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:22.600
 minor fifth third second third 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.120
 first second second third 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:28.480
 fifth third in a third first 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.250
 second third second would change let's 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.630
 to the minor and it would be the same minus the 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.720
 first note that instead of the fifth 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.970
 it would be the fourth fourth fourth second 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.900
 third first second second third 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.560
 third and sun of sixth third second 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.140
 third first second second third 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.350
 agree again what we can do 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.320
 do it with triads it's worth it if we do the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.960
 position of the minor that would be 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.460
 worth the index on the eighth fret with 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.440
 the position as if it were a minor 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.890
 then we will use only the third 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.890
 second and first 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:13.370
 this is 3 21 23 21 12 32 12 according 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.850
 we would do the minor minor 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.850
 on your site 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.849
 and now the sun will make it like the triad 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.500
 of the sun is like a king but with 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.500
 the index on the fifth fret 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.020
 Okay then 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:34.749
 forgiveness in the fifth not in the seventh 

00:05:32.239 --> 00:05:34.749
 would be 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.250
 what you know my window live 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:07.200
 what's my window live with new rain no 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.840
 we can do it by some stanza and now 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.450
