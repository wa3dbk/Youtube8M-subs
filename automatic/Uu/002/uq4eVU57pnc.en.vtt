default data store you need to ensure

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.930 
default data store you need to ensure
that<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.500> update<00:02:43.799> the<00:02:44.280> automation

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
that you update the automation

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.800 
that you update the automation

location<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.620> have<00:02:49.829> configured<00:02:50.670> now<00:02:50.900> this<00:02:51.900> is

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
location you have configured now this is

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.349 
location you have configured now this is
an<00:02:52.230> advanced<00:02:52.769> configuration<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:54.150> not

an advanced configuration and is not

00:02:59.989 --> 00:02:59.999 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.270 

now<00:03:00.999> what<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.329> need<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.719> do<00:03:01.930> is<00:03:02.170> to<00:03:02.439> go<00:03:02.739> back<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
now what I need to do is to go back and

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.690 
now what I need to do is to go back and
change<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.909> location<00:03:04.719> of<00:03:05.019> where<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.829> image

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
change the location of where the image

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.080 
change the location of where the image
is<00:03:06.819> going<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> be<00:03:07.389> stored<00:03:07.659> and<00:03:08.849> what<00:03:09.849> I'll<00:03:09.969> be

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
is going to be stored and what I'll be

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.420 
is going to be stored and what I'll be
doing<00:03:10.239> is<00:03:10.450> selecting<00:03:10.689> the<00:03:11.170> default<00:03:11.799> data

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
doing is selecting the default data

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.030 
doing is selecting the default data
store<00:03:14.849> this<00:03:15.849> is<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.180> fact<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:16.810> program<00:03:17.799> for

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
store this is in fact the program for
