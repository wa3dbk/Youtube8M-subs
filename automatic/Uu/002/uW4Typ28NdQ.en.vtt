00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.680
 hello friends in today's video I 'm going to 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.449
 give some tips so they can 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.910
 beat a computer in difficulty 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.919
 difficult before I start I love you 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.320
 say that we all have different forms 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:28.240
 to play the tips that I am going to give you 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.400
 they relate a lot to my style of 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.829
 game and maybe at times some do not 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.230
 share my ideas for it some 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.149
 tips can be very useful to you as 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.850
 on other occasions that maybe they do not 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.130
 please my way of playing you take 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.080
 the advice they want then 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.660
 let's start with the configuration of the 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.670
 starting here I recommend you place 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.220
 all options the most favorable 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.860
 possible so they can win the first 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.140
 of the options is the size of the map if 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.000
 you put a map too big 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.680
 will have to conquer a greater 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
 territory to be able to beat the 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.180
 computer and the game would be very 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.310
 extensive and difficult on the contrary if 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.320
 place a smaller map size 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.990
 it would cost less since the territory 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.330
 to conquer would be less in this 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.860
 occasion that are only two players I think 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.500
 that a medium map would be 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.410
 enough the second option is the type 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.420
 of map if I will play in continental a 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.010
 Once I have my city well organized 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.590
 I would devote myself to producing large 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.500
 quantities of ships if possible in 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.660
 its mostly battleships once I have 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.550
 several boats produced two 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.400
 groups that will attack one on each side 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.050
 destroying all possible springs and 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.180
 at the same time that attacked I'm going 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.520
 producing more boats to join 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.830
 to battle if you manage to get the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.690
 total domain of the water territory what 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.210
 only thing that remains is to place all the 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.009
 ships around the continent achieving 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.470
 that the computer can not build 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.320
 no more moya and destroying all 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.509
 buildings within reach of the boats if 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.430
 does this practically the game is 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.470
 earned the only thing left is to give a 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.960
 last blow with an army that ends 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.850
 to destroy the computer city if 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.399
 they want to play on islands maybe they 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.440
 it's easier to win the only thing 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.510
 they have to achieve is to defend their island and 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.760
 if they do they must conquer the rest 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.709
 of the islands one at a time one of the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.660
 ways to ensure the mastery of 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.790
 islands is placing towers all their 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.340
 around preventing the order 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.409
 can enter if they get all the 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.659
 islands finally have to attack the 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:30.010
 computer island which is located 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.920
 disadvantaged and in a territory 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.510
 limited I recommend that you place 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.659
 small islands so that it costs less 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.840
 defend them then follow the mediterranean 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.879
 in this they have two options or conquer 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.980
 all the water territory and then 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.680
 they attack in the same way they did 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.019
 on the continental map or they can also 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.170
 set aside the water does not produce boats 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.090
 and only attack with land units 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.609
 I think the most effective method would be 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.159
 first but you can choose the 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.840
 strategy that they like the most 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.389
 there is the meadow and the area 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.459
 mountainous in either case 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.349
 what I recommend is that they achieve 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.599
 organize your city in a space 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.909
 reduced the larger is the 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.609
 hardest city is made to control it 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.769
 when they are well organized they should 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.079
 attack with the greatest possible army 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:22.200
 leaving a minimum army to defend 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.220
 your city and producing new units 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.470
 constantly to join the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.600
 battle to have a numerous army 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.120
 try to have a quantity 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.850
 possible of citizens and make sure 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.190
 have large amounts of resources 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.290
 then the resources are found 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.860
 first is the low tournament that gives you 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.890
 at the beginning 200 of food 175 of wood and 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.480
 210 stone while the tournament to 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.690
 the defensive unlike the previous 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.470
 gives you 500 stone the standard low 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.500
 gives you 400 food 400 wood and 630 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.340
 of stone the high standard gives you 800 of 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.440
 food 750 wooden 800 stone and 100 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.450
 of gold and iron is finally the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.210
 Death match that gives you 15,000 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.760
 food 15,000 wooden 5000 stone and 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.920
 10,000 gold and iron this is the one 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.020
 I always use, since you do not have 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.690
 to wait so long collecting 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.520
 resources when you start with this amount 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.950
 you have to know how to organize the city 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.900
 quickly if it costs them to do it maybe 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.540
 should try a smaller amount 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.310
 although in reality the amount of 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.100
 resources that you start with is not a 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.260
 determining factor then they follow the age 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.930
 Initial and age limit of development 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.620
 these are very important because they should 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.350
 to choose 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.750
 based on how you play for example 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.880
 one of the best ages is copper 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.040
 since the rider is the best unit that 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.199
 there and his army should only be 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.930
 conformed by this unit and none 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.060
 another more later I'll tell you 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.729
 how to know more information about all 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.310
 the units for now let's continue with 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.229
 the limit of the units if you 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.270
 they place a very high population limit 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.430
 big will cost them to control 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.350
 so many units at the same time while 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.229
 that the computer can produce more 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.850
 units that we and control the 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.430
 simultaneously I consider that 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.680
 300 units per player is enough 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.110
 they should also take into account the time 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:20.050
 where they are if they are of age 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.150
 atomic on maybe 350 by 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.070
 player is better since this age 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.710
 includes more units like airplanes 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.110
 with respect to the variant of the game 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.020
 I leave it to your criteria will depend on 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.000
 Which of the options do you like the most? 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.039
 place as difficult difficulty and as 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.500
 speed I recommend that you place the 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:40.960
 standard because if they set a speed 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.639
 greater it becomes more difficult to control the 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.249
 city and we have less 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.990
 to think and perform actions with 

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:49.120
 regarding the option of the number of 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.789
 wonders I think it's going to be more 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.800
 easy to have it off then they have 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.529
 other options that are more personal 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.020
 What I consider very important is the 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:00.939
 to be able to choose a civilization I 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.919
 I previously uploaded a video that speaks 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:05.409
 especially about the builder of 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.449
 civilizations that can be useful in 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.550
 that video includes a job in excel 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:11.289
 so they can download that contains 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.240
 on the left side all the information 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.979
 of the units without modifying the tree 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.689
 of science while from the side 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.129
 right has more information 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:20.740
 units in case you want 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.689
 modify the science tree if you 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.029
 would like to see it I leave the link in the 

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:26.710
 description and if you want to activate the 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.020
 option to show map so that 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.599
 help a little activate it and if not the 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.490
 they want to deactivate they also have the 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.289
 option to block equipment and that of 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.270
 block the speed in case 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.639
 want to modify it or not during the 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.099
 heading the only thing they try is not 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.020
 use the tricks as a last 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:45.939
 help can be placed a greater 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.580
 number of citizens to start 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.240
 when they have finished the configuration 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.759
 it's time 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.250
 starting the game here is where 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:57.009
 I can help them the rest will depend on 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.050
 you as a last advice that you 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:07:01.240
 I can give is that they do not give up 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.550
 Sometimes the computer can 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.430
 attack us and take great casualties 

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:08.560
 but if they persist they can achieve it I hope 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.930
 that this video has helped them 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.419
 and if they need any more advice they can 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.160
 let me know in the comments 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:16.930
 the question I have to ask is 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.360
 what is the type of map that most 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.580
 like to play to me in general gives me what 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.460
 same but I tend to play in continental 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.680
 small islands and meadows one last 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.659
 clarification that I have to tell you is 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.460
 that the tips shown apply 

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:33.970
 especially for those who have the 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.830
 version 1.0 0 point 2020 if you 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.139
 they have another version they may have 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.150
 more map types other distribution of 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:42.729
 resources a greater limit of the 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.889
 population among other changes but in 

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:47.020
 general, the tips can be applied 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:51.120
 same way I hope you liked it 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.120
 and thank you for having seen it
