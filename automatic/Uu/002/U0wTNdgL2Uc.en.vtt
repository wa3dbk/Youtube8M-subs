I've<00:03:03.710> plugged<00:03:04.220> in<00:03:04.400> my<00:03:04.550> battery<00:03:04.910> charger<00:03:05.860> I've

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
I've plugged in my battery charger I've

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.570 
I've plugged in my battery charger I've
got<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.160> set<00:03:07.430> at<00:03:07.460> 12<00:03:08.210> volts<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:10.040> six<00:03:10.310> amp

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
got it set at 12 volts and a six amp

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.070 
got it set at 12 volts and a six amp
large<00:03:11.060> battery<00:03:11.540> and<00:03:12.670> I've<00:03:13.670> edged<00:03:14.390> with<00:03:14.810> all

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
large battery and I've edged with all

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.900 
large battery and I've edged with all
the<00:03:15.290> different<00:03:15.890> settings<00:03:16.100> on<00:03:16.340> here<00:03:16.400> many

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
the different settings on here many

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.220 
the different settings on here many
different<00:03:17.270> combinations<00:03:17.450> they<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.050> work

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
different combinations they all work

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
different combinations they all work
about<00:03:18.470> the<00:03:18.620> same<00:03:18.830> but<00:03:19.640> on<00:03:19.760> 12<00:03:20.090> volts<00:03:20.420> it<00:03:20.540> seems

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
about the same but on 12 volts it seems

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170 
about the same but on 12 volts it seems
to<00:03:20.930> work<00:03:21.080> a<00:03:21.170> little<00:03:21.260> faster<00:03:21.380> so<00:03:22.100> that's<00:03:22.970> what

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
to work a little faster so that's what

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.480 
to work a little faster so that's what
I'm<00:03:23.270> going<00:03:23.390> to<00:03:23.420> be<00:03:23.510> doing<00:03:24.160> so<00:03:25.160> take<00:03:25.370> your

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 
to hold it down and it takes a while for

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.520 
to hold it down and it takes a while for
the<00:04:37.320> battery<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.710> charger<00:04:38.370> to<00:04:38.460> kick<00:04:38.669> on<00:04:39.530> but

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
the battery to charger to kick on but

you<00:04:41.039> will<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.900> bubbles<00:04:42.900> start<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.440> form<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:44.580> I

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
you will see bubbles start to form and I

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:45.980 
you will see bubbles start to form and I
was<00:04:44.850> kind<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.120> shorting<00:04:45.449> it<00:04:45.539> out<00:04:45.630> there<00:04:45.870> you

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
was kind of shorting it out there you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.870 
was kind of shorting it out there you
saw<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.199> couple<00:04:46.440> sparks<00:04:46.949> be<00:04:47.130> careful<00:04:47.490> not<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.639> do

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
saw a couple sparks be careful not to do

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.189 
saw a couple sparks be careful not to do
that<00:04:48.110> and<00:04:49.430> just<00:04:50.430> go<00:04:50.850> slowly<00:04:51.300> across<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:52.080> your

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
that and just go slowly across to your

00:04:52.199 --> 00:05:07.500 
that and just go slowly across to your
little<00:04:52.520> stencil<00:04:53.520> here<00:04:53.970> and<00:04:54.090> keep<00:04:54.270> holding<00:04:54.510> it

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.600 

and<00:05:08.020> it<00:05:08.140> will<00:05:08.260> turn<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.650> metal<00:05:08.890> black<00:05:09.160> as<00:05:09.460> it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and it will turn the metal black as it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.790 
and it will turn the metal black as it
does<00:05:09.820> this<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:13.630> longer<00:05:14.020> you<00:05:14.170> hold<00:05:14.350> this<00:05:14.560> on

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
does this the longer you hold this on

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.180 
does this the longer you hold this on
here

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190

the deeper the etch will be you want to

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.330 
the deeper the etch will be you want to
do<00:05:18.940> each<00:05:19.120> one<00:05:19.360> evenly<00:05:21.270> so<00:05:22.270> that<00:05:22.300> it's<00:05:23.340> that

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
do each one evenly so that it's that

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.640 
do each one evenly so that it's that
edges<00:05:25.300> even<00:05:26.670> across<00:05:27.670> your<00:05:27.880> whole<00:05:28.650> initials

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
edges even across your whole initials

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.810 
edges even across your whole initials
here

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820
