00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello girls how are you today 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.840
 I bring a video that I had been asked to 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.580
 I will recommend some brushes so the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.240
 today I come to bring you some 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.369
 brushes that I like a lot and that I 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.460
 I have already bought many times many 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.950
 I have bought these brushes and 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.960
 Well I 'm delighted with them 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.820
 because they have served me a lot and I 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.189
 I like it a lot because it comes what it comes 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.719
 essential comes what what what what in 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.510
 reality is going strong you will serve a lot 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.250
 for your makeup so I wanted 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.170
 share this video I do not want it to be 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.579
 so long hopefully because i walk talk 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.160
 skillful and skillful and after months of 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.440
 eternity video but I wanted to share 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.850
 with you this brochita because I 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.260
 I expected that I would arrive first for 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.300
 I can only talk about them because 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.999
 the others are already fatal already so 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.789
 I needed a new set to be able to 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.409
 share with you so it does not cost 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.019
 nothing expensive does not cost thirty dollars 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.289
 neither forty nor anything costs 15 dollars 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.630
 more or less this this case of brushes 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.880
 and it's great as you can see because there 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.780
 one that is smaller but this is the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.900
 big 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.170
 and the brushes are very good for 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.210
 that two brushes come to blur and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.250
 that's the important thing because it is divided into 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.190
 two brooches to blur one that is 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.420
 small and one that is bigger ok 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.899
 and it comes to you 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 brush for powder for the base for 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:34.190
 the lips to tune the eyebrows for 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.710
 delineate and comes this from active cabins 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.590
 this expert to apply more 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.899
 Gently and I like them because they are a 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.700
 brushes that are in our hair 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.679
 They are very good brushes that have 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.420
 served a lot in my I liked and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.820
 I think they are the only brushes that I 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.759
 I bought it and I bought it because they are the ones that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.200
 They have served a lot and I think that 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.330
 time that time had already recommended 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 these clasps but as always I have 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.509
 to update more or less to the Canary Islands and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.920
 girls who receive them or are sometimes 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.250
 new in the channel then I have to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.860
 try to update a little bit so 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.810
 maybe I wanted to do this for example 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.650
 comes without the brand because the other said 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.710
 mine if I'm not wrong here says it mine 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.630
 it's the same 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.680
 it's the same 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.960
 or that she's the same girl but she 's 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.170
 it has one little man but the other does not 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.480
 it is identical simply that it does not 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.430
 is this time it comes without a mark I was 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.590
 killing me get it because I 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.780
 I found more the little one this is the 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:42.319
 great and I like it a lot because they come 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.930
 all very well come in your little bag 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.999
 and they come very good so they are good 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.950
 they are not some brushes that when you have 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:51.200
 gone through the dust like that t inc 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.159
 skin technique for nothing this is very 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.530
 soft very soft are the skewers are 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.200
 nice soft dating and I really like these 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.090
 brushes and good for that I'm going to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.310
 leave the link below the box 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.530
 information so that they will look for there 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.879
 in various colors there is green in brown 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.659
 in red in pink green I think that I already 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.459
 I said I do not know in black and money and good 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.409
 I just like that this time 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.510
 I wanted to buy some blacks but I have 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.269
 and to all the colors I think it has 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.340
 improved I think if I'm not wrong but I 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.709
 is going to serve these brushes very well 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.319
 here comes one as well as for him as for 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.120
 he can use it for contour or 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.299
 for what is blush you can also 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.949
 use and good and so nothing else girls 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.139
 quickie quickie because I'm 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:41.150
 finishing the battery and I do not want to be 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.400
 viable so the battery had cure 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.810
 here is a brush how to blur 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.000
 but it's smaller for your 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.270
 precision or to do as in 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.310
 depth to use 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.260
 and at the same time you can combine a 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.510
 little bit will also serve you for that 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.550
 is another brush is also for 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.980
 blur just like it's a little 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.440
 more to the longest but at the time that the 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.280
 you are going to go using this computation is going to go 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.680
 like a gray this one is going to be but you're 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.110
 are the brushes that I could find 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.790
 so good this one if this one is a little bit 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.310
 so angular serves many things 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.870
 they serve me I like these 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.280
 types of brushes that come planet 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.080
 angular because fire uses to 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.870
 many things for the eyebrow to delineate 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.540
 to apply shade to a tiny side 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.460
 the little thing you can use for thousands 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.020
 of thousands of things you are also here 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.000
 you know when I want to use the 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.900
 shadow instead of the place bean cobain 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.080
 tiny little boy used those 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.990
 also has for the lips 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.939
 and all these girls I hope that they 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.150
 serve these brushes I know I recommend them 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:46.129
 a lot so I do not say goodbye anymore because 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.539
 I do not want to keep talking so good 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.639
 girls I hope you like it actually 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.319
 these brushes I do not say the video but 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.719
 less than at least to adapt them to 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.210
 Be informed of this video and that 

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.620
 serve them the information because these 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.659
 brushes and they are very good I think already 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.400
 some have already used it 

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.289
 I want to recommend to the girls that 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.610
 always less say to me that 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:07.009
 button recommends them to be 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.960
 I recommend these economic good I 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.400
 down leaves the link and there it is and there 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.949
 of various colors even so that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.719

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.050
 with telling them that I purple female a 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.909
