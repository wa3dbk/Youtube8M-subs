 The little screen on the side is really cool if I 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.460
 I can do is how to deal with work 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.370
 then to join them is very 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.320
 Easy is just you and there in the instagram that 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
 I will let down here is that stealing 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.909
 blog apps is green that will get the flyer 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.380
 tell you what the instructions are 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.570
 but you will basically have to me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.119
 follow in full and enjoy the photo only 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.689
 So I hope you like it and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.689
 let's learn 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.119
 the first thing you have to do is 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:28.250
 is to mark the shirt with some pen 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.350
 mark text is something that gave to see 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.780
 then when it's time to chop I choose 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.750
 make with that pen that permanent 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.360
 Because it's easier then you 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.979
 they are going to measure is which is 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.569
 you also want the race if you 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.819
 want a thinner regatta and you leave 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:45.890
 closer to the neck if you want 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.679
 a girl so you leave half 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.479
 I prefer a report from that house. 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.020
 so what I did I caught month of 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.270
 four fingers and I marked here is the same 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.459
 thing I did the other side of me 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:04.729
 fingers and ticked here also made a 

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:07.610
 dot and now you are going to do is do 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.250
 the same thing underneath so below here 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.069
 I'll do the same thing over there. 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 be the size of the race cut in case 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.130
 I do not want it to stay that way too much. 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.099
 executed then I'll make a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.930
 marking right here where my 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:26.720
 My chest, I'll pick it up and I'll score it here. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:32.120
 another blip again it 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.829
 The user you do the same thing now is 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.959
 just start cutting the shirt off 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.959
 important is to make it well stretched and 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.850
 start cutting from bottom to top 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.850
 doing this tour is super easy 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.850
 Now do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.370
 another bank 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.260
 if you want you can cut the ball 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.220
 this shirt and not because I cut 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.140
 I think it looks cool so girls I 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.000
 I decided to cut the bottom part because I think 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.770
 which is cooler there is just follow the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:26.900
 line but if you do not want to 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:29.240
 need not come not only as it is easy to 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.430
 do if you want to put the hashtag 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.430
 to flag certain that I have
