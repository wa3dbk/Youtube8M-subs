00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.580
 today we present three more exercises for 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.260
 the legs and for the buttocks that are based 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.750
 on the processing technique a 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 myofascial myofascial treatment 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 it allows to detach the sheath 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.830
 connective tissue that covers the muscle from the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.480
 muscle itself improving it 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.590
 muscle flow and elasticity 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.989
 the first exercise is for the quadriceps 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.500
 you lie down putting the von on the roller 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.510
 roll under your thighs and make yourself a little 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.300
 scrolling back and forth 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 yes an area of ​​pain is identified there 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 stop on that area you insist with 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.629
 small shifts of some 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.989
 centimeter as long as the pain tends 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.629
 to decrease the second year of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.969
 myofascial treatment concerns the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.609
 hip gluteus muscles e 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.030
 then of the piriformis we sit on the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.159
 roller cross your legs and then you do 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.930
 a little twist in the direction 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.780
 of the hip to be treated of the buttock from 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.729
 treat and then insist with the same 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 sight technique before going 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 slightly back and forth 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 meanwhile to identify a point 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.869
 particularly sensitive then there it is 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 dwell on this point by insisting on 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.810
 self-massage the third year of 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.680
 myofascial treatment concerns i 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.850
 calves 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 also in this case the area is curled up 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.570
 interested 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.030
 when a sensitive area is divided there is 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.710
 dwells on it as long as the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.500
 pain and discomfort tend to decrease 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.130
 to increase exercise intensity 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.409
 you can carry one leg over the other e 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.619
 usually the area where you have to insist 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.630
 that of the lower third of the leg e 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.299
 we can associate the rolled forward e 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.290
 back with small twists 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.690
 on the non-axis 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.850
 end of the leg so as to go to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.850
 involve the various fibers of the portaccio
