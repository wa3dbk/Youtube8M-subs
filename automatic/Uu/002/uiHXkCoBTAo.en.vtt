those beaches in snow go over hills and
through<00:00:29.039> forests<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:30.240> I<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.869> fully

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
through forests as I like to be fully

through forests as I like to be fully
independent<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.009> decided<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.910> come<00:00:33.090> up<00:00:33.239> with<00:00:33.390> a

independent I decided to come up with a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:40.220 
independent I decided to come up with a
solution<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.989> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.350 

I<00:00:50.980> teamed<00:00:51.980> up<00:00:52.160> with<00:00:52.340> an<00:00:52.490> engineer<00:00:53.000> that<00:00:53.210> is

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
I teamed up with an engineer that is

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.630 
I teamed up with an engineer that is
very<00:00:53.690> open-minded<00:00:54.080> and<00:00:54.620> was<00:00:54.980> willing<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.400> help

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
very open-minded and was willing to help

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.880 
very open-minded and was willing to help
me<00:00:55.850> out<00:00:55.880> we<00:00:56.870> tried<00:00:57.140> making<00:00:57.380> various

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
me out we tried making various

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.550 
me out we tried making various
constructions<00:00:58.580> but<00:00:59.240> in<00:00:59.390> the<00:00:59.570> end<00:00:59.750> decided<00:01:00.290> to

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:00.560 
constructions but in the end decided to

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.130 
constructions but in the end decided to
adapt<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.070> Segway<00:01:01.430> as<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.330> already<00:01:02.540> can<00:01:02.930> move

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
adapt the Segway as it already can move

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.440 
adapt the Segway as it already can move
around<00:01:03.290> easily<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:04.190> all<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.640> places<00:01:04.880> but

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
around easily in all the places but

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.790 
around easily in all the places but
off-limits<00:01:06.290> for<00:01:06.440> me<00:01:07.660> it<00:01:08.660> took<00:01:08.870> us<00:01:09.020> over<00:01:09.230> a<00:01:09.410> year

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
off-limits for me it took us over a year

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.430 
off-limits for me it took us over a year
to<00:01:10.100> write<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.520> final<00:01:10.820> product<00:01:11.390> finally<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.320> can

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
to write the final product finally I can

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.860

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
because you need the Segway can be very

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.660 
because you need the Segway can be very
stable<00:02:03.490> when<00:02:04.149> you<00:02:04.270> transfer<00:02:04.719> yourself<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.380> it
