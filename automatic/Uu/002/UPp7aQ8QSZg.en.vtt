00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
having that and since things seem to be

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.209 
having that and since things seem to be
going<00:00:50.280> over<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.730> over<00:00:51.120> what<00:00:51.360> overall<00:00:52.219> quite

basically<00:00:55.920> I've<00:00:56.070> lost<00:00:56.390> 0.6<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> kilogram

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
basically I've lost 0.6 of a kilogram

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.540 
basically I've lost 0.6 of a kilogram
which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.710> point<00:00:58.890> three<00:00:59.010> pounds<00:00:59.520> of

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
which is about one point three pounds of

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.010 
which is about one point three pounds of
my<00:00:59.730> first<00:01:00.059> day<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.570> pretty<00:01:00.780> pleased

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
my first day so I was pretty pleased

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.680 
my first day so I was pretty pleased
with<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.370> thing<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
with that the thing is that from the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
with that the thing is that from the
reading<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.199> done<00:01:04.409> with<00:01:05.129> keto<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
reading that I've done with keto is the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.520 
reading that I've done with keto is the
weight<00:01:06.150> loss<00:01:06.330> isn't<00:01:06.600> perhaps<00:01:06.869> quite<00:01:07.380> as

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
weight loss isn't perhaps quite as

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130 
weight loss isn't perhaps quite as
dramatic<00:01:07.939> as<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> juice<00:01:09.450> fast<00:01:09.659> because<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
dramatic as a juice fast because of

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
dramatic as a juice fast because of
course<00:01:10.320> you're<00:01:10.500> still<00:01:10.710> eating<00:01:11.000> real<00:01:12.000> food

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
course you're still eating real food

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.280 
course you're still eating real food
you're<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.320> having<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> juice<00:01:13.920> only<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
you're not just having the juice only so

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.330 
you're not just having the juice only so
with<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.409> said<00:01:16.680> there's<00:01:16.920> something<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> good

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
with that said there's something a good

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.560 
with that said there's something a good
weight<00:01:17.610> loss<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> first<00:01:18.150> day<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.450> I'm

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
weight loss for the first day and I'm

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.179 
weight loss for the first day and I'm
certainly<00:01:19.049> hoping<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.650> that's<00:01:19.979> going<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
certainly hoping that that's going to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.679 
certainly hoping that that's going to
continue<00:01:20.340> as<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.970> keep<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.299> through<00:01:21.450> this

juice<00:01:40.170> fast<00:01:40.350> because<00:01:40.829> honestly<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.759> feel<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
juice fast because honestly I feel that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990 
juice fast because honestly I feel that
this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.659> better<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.320> transition<00:01:44.000> to

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
this is a better way to transition to

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.090 
this is a better way to transition to
the<00:01:45.119> longer<00:01:45.420> term<00:01:45.600> because<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:46.710> isn't<00:01:46.950> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the longer term because this isn't a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.319 
the longer term because this isn't a
short-term<00:01:47.520> thing<00:01:47.579> where<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> juice

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
short-term thing where it's the juice

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.630 
short-term thing where it's the juice
fast<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.869> me<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.290> don't<00:01:49.979> think<00:01:50.159> there's<00:01:50.340> very

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
fast to me I don't think there's very

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.069 
fast to me I don't think there's very
many<00:01:50.820> people<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> world<00:01:51.540> who<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:51.899> say

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
many people in the world who would say

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.480 
many people in the world who would say
that<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.350> juice<00:01:52.530> fast<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> something<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.340> do

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
that a juice fast is something you do

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.389 
that a juice fast is something you do
forever<00:01:54.229> as<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.290> replacement<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.130> meals

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
forever as a replacement for all meals

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
forever as a replacement for all meals
yes<00:01:56.759> perhaps<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.329> or<00:01:57.420> two<00:01:57.570> meals<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.899> day<00:01:57.930> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
yes perhaps one or two meals a day you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
yes perhaps one or two meals a day you
can<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.530> from<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.070> long<00:01:59.250> term<00:01:59.430> for<00:01:59.700> me

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
can do it from in the long term for me

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
can do it from in the long term for me
the<00:02:00.479> juice<00:02:00.659> fast<00:02:00.899> when<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.259> did<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.770> a

short period of time to lose a certain
amount<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.990> weight<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.860> then<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.130> go<00:02:05.280> back<00:02:05.549> to

anyway<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.330> idea<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.780> keto<00:02:37.200> diet<00:02:37.470> is<00:02:37.980> that

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
anyway the idea of the keto diet is that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.010 
anyway the idea of the keto diet is that
this<00:02:38.400> is<00:02:38.550> a<00:02:38.580> long-term<00:02:38.940> eating<00:02:39.570> plan<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.870> is

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
this is a long-term eating plan this is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.510 
this is a long-term eating plan this is
not<00:02:40.140> something<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> week<00:02:41.280> or

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
not something that you do for a week or

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.670 
not something that you do for a week or
two<00:02:41.700> weeks<00:02:41.940> or<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.720> my<00:02:43.020> case<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.500> juice

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680

fast<00:02:43.860> for<00:02:44.040> 56<00:02:44.580> days<00:02:44.670> it's<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.660> long-term<00:02:45.900> plan

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
fast for 56 days it's a long-term plan

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.090 
fast for 56 days it's a long-term plan
that<00:02:47.250> you<00:02:47.400> stick<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.800> just<00:02:49.830> keep

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that you stick to and you just keep

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.290 
that you stick to and you just keep
eating<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.400> way<00:02:50.550> you<00:02:50.610> keep<00:02:50.850> eating<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.150> way

that cheating was was something that I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.240 
that cheating was was something that I
needed<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.410> worried<00:03:16.680> about<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:17.160> a

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
needed to be worried about it's a

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.890 
needed to be worried about it's a
slippery<00:03:17.489> slope<00:03:17.610> once<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> start<00:03:18.690> cheating

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
slippery slope once you start cheating

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.350 
slippery slope once you start cheating
now<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.709> completely<00:03:20.400> agree<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.090> wasn't

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
now I completely agree that but I wasn't

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.750 
now I completely agree that but I wasn't
sure<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.590> point<00:03:22.860> was<00:03:23.070> what<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.670> were

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
sure but the point was what you were

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.130 
sure but the point was what you were
trying<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.030> say<00:03:24.209> was<00:03:24.420> because<00:03:24.870> I<00:03:24.900> certainly

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
trying to say was because I certainly

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
trying to say was because I certainly
don't<00:03:25.350> want<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.590> cheat<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:26.010> seek<00:03:26.880> eight<00:03:27.120> hours

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
way of eating for the long-term which

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.410 
way of eating for the long-term which
doesn't<00:03:31.500> include<00:03:31.680> all<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.760> best<00:03:32.970> stuff<00:03:33.239> all

to the fact that I'm actually having to

to the fact that I'm actually having to
look<00:04:37.560> for<00:04:37.860> fat<00:04:38.100> to<00:04:38.400> make<00:04:38.550> sure<00:04:38.669> there's<00:04:38.940> enough

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
fat in my diet but obviously it's only

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:43.040 
fat in my diet but obviously it's only
day<00:04:41.400> one<00:04:41.430> but<00:04:41.910> I've<00:04:42.030> already<00:04:42.150> lost<00:04:42.419> point<00:04:42.720> six
