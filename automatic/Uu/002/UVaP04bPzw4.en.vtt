00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.889
 a classic tutorial I did like 4 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.019
 years only that this time is 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.700
 renewed and different the video in 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.919
 reality does not do it justice then in 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.170
 alive and full color is much more beautiful 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.210
 and incredible if you want to know how it 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.160
 do not miss this tutorial and 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.160
 tell me what you think is good vibes 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.860
 the main materials are a mica 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.110
 thick protective sheet one sheet 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.320
 acetate letter size gel for hair 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.390
 alcohol-free permanent markers 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.059
 diamond sequins with figurines and 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.129
 a hair iron or clothes to start 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.559
 draw or write on the acetate what 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:01:05.680
 you want me to say 'hey of your letter with 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:01:07.750
 permanent markers when you go 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.150
 drawing be careful of at least 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.740
 a few seconds do not touch the ink so that 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.740
 do not run until it dries 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:53.200
 already with your card and it's ready we put it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:57.600
 inside the mica look like even like this 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.600
 no gel looks cute is not another option 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.990
 well in a container you will place some 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.729
 4 tablespoons of gel to which you 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.890
 we will add a little diamond and 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.470
 if you want some shaped sequins 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.069
 of heart but that they are little and well 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.069
 little girls 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.130
 we revolve everything very well and now yes 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.470
 let's put the mixture in half 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.470
 behind the acetate well 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.120
 with all the gel inside we go down 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.200
 clean and well top 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.200
 finally to seal the mica 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.350
 finally to close the mica place a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.350
 piece of tape like this 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.909
 but so that it is well sealed 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.400
 you will need to do it with heat for this 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.230
 hug the mica with a paper and with the 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.629
 iron see giving little touches 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:04:06.879
 to melt the plastic and that's how 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:04:09.040
 close very well you will realize that 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:16.299
 it is well sealed because when you press the 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:18.639
 gel does not come out and finally you can 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.650
 Take the gel to the edges so that 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.270
 form as a margin or leave it 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.699
 scattered you decide 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.039
