00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
never respond but the sandstone block is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.860 
never respond but the sandstone block is
below<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.440> they<00:00:46.890> will<00:00:47.039> spawn<00:00:47.629> beyond<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
below it so they will spawn beyond that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
we place a glass block here wait yeah

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.020 
we place a glass block here wait yeah
there<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.500> that's<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.770> okay<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.729> I've

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
included the ability to lock myself in

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.800 
included the ability to lock myself in
here<00:01:38.490> because<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.790> really<00:01:39.119> don't<00:01:39.299> want<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> deal

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
here because I really don't want to deal

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.179 
here because I really don't want to deal
with<00:01:39.960> all<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> other<00:01:40.380> batteries<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.070> of

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
with all the other batteries and of

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.469 
with all the other batteries and of
course<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.520> makes<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.790> dark<00:01:42.060> enough<00:01:42.270> here

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
course that makes it dark enough here

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.929 
course that makes it dark enough here
even<00:01:42.810> during<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> day<00:01:43.490> let's<00:01:44.490> go<00:01:44.670> ahead<00:01:44.820> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
even during the day let's go ahead and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.330 
even during the day let's go ahead and
turn<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.240> I'll<00:01:45.450> show<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> how<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> works<00:01:46.340> so

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
turn it on I'll show you how it works so

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
turn it on I'll show you how it works so
it's<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.520> as<00:01:47.759> fast<00:01:48.000> but<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.770> thankfully

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
it's not as fast but think thankfully

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.910 
it's not as fast but think thankfully

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
here there we go the lava now flows down

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
jump up again and it doesn't affect

their drops see

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.460 
their drops see
aha<00:02:13.680> why<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:14.820> stop<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.270> before<00:02:15.990> it

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
aha why because we stop it before it

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.910 
aha why because we stop it before it

hits their second midsection so they are
not<00:02:20.160> actually<00:02:20.790> burning<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.300> drops<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.870> inner

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
not actually burning the drops the inner

not actually burning the drops the inner
pearls<00:02:22.350> are<00:02:22.530> dropping<00:02:22.800> now<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.220> does<00:02:23.370> make

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
pearls are dropping now this does make

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.370 
pearls are dropping now this does make
it<00:02:23.730> significantly<00:02:23.910> more<00:02:24.600> difficult<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:25.110> get

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
it significantly more difficult to get

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.140 
it significantly more difficult to get
to<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.590> ender<00:02:25.800> pearls<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.430> they're<00:02:26.970> on

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to the ender pearls because they're on

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.120 
to the ender pearls because they're on
top<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.540> pressure<00:02:27.780> plate<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.590> I'm<00:02:28.830> over

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
top of the pressure plate and I'm over

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.190 
top of the pressure plate and I'm over
here<00:02:29.520> where<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.210> dangerous<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.990> on<00:02:31.110> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
here where it's dangerous to be on that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.390 
here where it's dangerous to be on that
pressure<00:02:31.500> plate<00:02:31.800> but<00:02:32.600> luckily<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.130> do<00:02:35.310> it

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
pressure plate but luckily you can do it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.430 
pressure plate but luckily you can do it
pretty<00:02:35.520> quickly<00:02:35.790> lava<00:02:36.630> doesn't<00:02:36.750> flow<00:02:37.020> that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
pretty quickly lava doesn't flow that

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.210 
pretty quickly lava doesn't flow that
fast<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.850> yeah<00:02:39.590> probably<00:02:40.590> wouldn't<00:02:41.070> want<00:02:41.190> to

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
fast so yeah probably wouldn't want to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.470 
fast so yeah probably wouldn't want to
put<00:02:41.370> glass<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.120> you're<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.420> to

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
put glass here if you're going to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880 
put glass here if you're going to
constantly<00:02:42.900> be<00:02:42.990> breaking<00:02:43.410> whatever<00:02:43.680> block

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
constantly be breaking whatever block

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
constantly be breaking whatever block
that<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.130> but<00:02:45.060> definitely<00:02:45.810> need<00:02:46.020> that<00:02:46.230> sign

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that is but definitely need that sign

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.920 
that is but definitely need that sign
there<00:02:46.800> otherwise<00:02:47.100> if<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.150> have<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.450> here

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
there otherwise if you have it here

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.500 
there otherwise if you have it here
it'll<00:02:49.770> come<00:02:49.950> down<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.550> second<00:02:51.000> block<00:02:51.209> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
it'll come down to the second block and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.220 
it'll come down to the second block and
it<00:02:51.959> will<00:02:52.290> actually<00:02:52.730> burn<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> Endermen<00:02:54.480> each

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
it will actually burn the Endermen each

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
it will actually burn the Endermen each
and<00:02:55.530> every<00:02:55.770> time<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.459> it'll<00:02:56.760> burn<00:02:57.030> up<00:02:57.209> there

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
and every time and it'll burn up there

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.720 
and every time and it'll burn up there
ender<00:02:57.570> pearls<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.020> well<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.220> is<00:02:59.340> my<00:02:59.459> tramp

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
ender pearls as well so this is my tramp

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.030 
ender pearls as well so this is my tramp
