if<00:00:02.190> you<00:00:02.280> look<00:00:02.429> at<00:00:02.520> our<00:00:02.610> closest<00:00:03.060> genetic

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
if you look at our closest genetic

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.630 
if you look at our closest genetic
relative<00:00:03.870> to<00:00:04.680> human<00:00:04.980> beings<00:00:05.220> and<00:00:05.339> be<00:00:05.490> the

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
relative to human beings and be the

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.140 
relative to human beings and be the
chimpanzee<00:00:06.410> where<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:07.589> share<00:00:07.859> like<00:00:08.160> 98<00:00:08.639> plus

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
chimpanzee where we share like 98 plus

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.589 
chimpanzee where we share like 98 plus
percent<00:00:09.750> identical<00:00:10.440> DNA<00:00:11.000> we<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.150> smarter

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
percent identical DNA we are smarter

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.560 
percent identical DNA we are smarter
than<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.780> chimpanzee

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
than a chimpanzee

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
than a chimpanzee
so<00:00:15.570> let's<00:00:15.780> invent<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.260> measure<00:00:16.470> of

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
so let's invent a measure of

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.080 
so let's invent a measure of
intelligence<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.250> make<00:00:17.520> humans<00:00:17.910> unique

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
intelligence that make humans unique

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.420 
intelligence that make humans unique
let's<00:00:18.510> say<00:00:18.690> intelligence<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:20.039> ability

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
let's say intelligence is your ability

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.200 
let's say intelligence is your ability
to<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.900> compose<00:00:21.900> poetry<00:00:22.699> symphonies<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:24.000> our

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
to like compose poetry symphonies do our

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.170 
to like compose poetry symphonies do our
math<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.779> science<00:00:25.289> let's<00:00:25.680> say<00:00:25.800> okay<00:00:26.180> listen

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
math and science let's say okay listen

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
math and science let's say okay listen
make<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.289> arbitrary<00:00:28.769> definition<00:00:29.250> of

make that as the arbitrary definition of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.669 
make that as the arbitrary definition of
intelligence<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> moment<00:00:30.449> chips<00:00:31.410> can't

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
intelligence for the moment chips can't

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.600 
intelligence for the moment chips can't
do<00:00:31.830> any<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.989> yet<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.170> share<00:00:34.410> 98<00:00:35.160> 99

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
do any of that yet we share 98 99

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.889 
do any of that yet we share 98 99
percent<00:00:36.210> identical<00:00:36.690> DNA<00:00:37.640> okay

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
percent identical DNA okay

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.950 
percent identical DNA okay
the<00:00:39.899> most<00:00:40.079> brilliant<00:00:40.649> chimp<00:00:40.950> there<00:00:41.190> ever<00:00:41.370> was

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
the most brilliant chimp there ever was

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.420 
the most brilliant chimp there ever was
maybe<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.860> bit<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> sign

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
maybe can do a little bit of sign

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.319 
maybe can do a little bit of sign
language<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:45.600> our<00:00:45.719> toddlers<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.500> that

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:47.329 
language well our toddlers can do that

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:53.510 
language well our toddlers can do that
toddlers<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:51.710> here's<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.890> concerns<00:00:53.039> me

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
toddlers so here's what concerns me

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.360 
toddlers so here's what concerns me
deeply<00:00:54.500> deeply<00:00:57.620> everything<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:59.100> are

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
deeply deeply everything that we are

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.050 
deeply deeply everything that we are
that<00:01:00.270> distinguishes<00:01:00.960> us<00:01:01.109> from<00:01:01.289> chimps

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.160 

emerges<00:01:06.060> from<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.360> 1%<00:01:06.900> difference<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> DNA

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
emerges from that 1% difference in DNA

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.880 
emerges from that 1% difference in DNA
that's<00:01:10.170> true<00:01:10.320> because<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that's true because that's the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.670 
that's true because that's the
difference<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:12.600> Hubble<00:01:12.869> telescope<00:01:13.049> these

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
difference the Hubble telescope these

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:23.630 
difference the Hubble telescope these
grand<00:01:14.299> that's<00:01:15.299> in<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.689> 1%<00:01:18.710> maybe<00:01:22.640> everything

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
grand that's in that 1% maybe everything

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.830 
grand that's in that 1% maybe everything
that<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.970> are<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> chimp<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:26.840> not

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that we are that is not the chimp is not

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
that we are that is not the chimp is not
as<00:01:28.140> smart<00:01:28.530> compared<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.430> chimp<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.880> we

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
as smart compared to the chimp as we

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.210 
as smart compared to the chimp as we
tell<00:01:30.570> ourselves<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:33.590> maybe<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
tell ourselves it is maybe the

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.249 
tell ourselves it is maybe the
difference<00:01:35.640> between<00:01:36.110> constructing<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
difference between constructing and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.830 
difference between constructing and
launching<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> Hubble<00:01:38.070> telescope<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
launching a Hubble telescope and it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.530 
launching a Hubble telescope and it
simpkin<00:01:40.409> beining<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.040> finger<00:01:41.909> motions<00:01:42.360> as

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
simpkin beining to finger motions as

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.020 
simpkin beining to finger motions as
sign<00:01:42.990> language<00:01:43.380> maybe<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.100> difference<00:01:44.790> is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
sign language maybe that difference is

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.550 
sign language maybe that difference is
not<00:01:45.960> all<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.290> great<00:01:47.720> we<00:01:48.720> tell<00:01:48.960> ourselves<00:01:49.049> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
not all that great we tell ourselves it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.780 
not all that great we tell ourselves it
is<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.729> same<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.180> label<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.600> books

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
is just the same way we label our books

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600 
is just the same way we label our books
optical<00:01:53.790> illusions<00:01:54.740> we<00:01:55.740> tell<00:01:55.979> ourselves<00:01:56.130> it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
optical illusions we tell ourselves it's

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.469 
optical illusions we tell ourselves it's
a<00:01:56.700> lot<00:01:56.880> maybe<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:58.049> almost<00:01:58.380> nothing<00:01:59.479> how

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a lot maybe it's almost nothing how

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.200 
a lot maybe it's almost nothing how
would<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.869> decide<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> imagine<00:02:02.610> another

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
would we decide that imagine another

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.080 
would we decide that imagine another
life-form<00:02:04.189> that's<00:02:05.189> 1%<00:02:05.820> different<00:02:06.810> from<00:02:07.530> us<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.020 

think<00:02:15.030> about<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.830> we<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:16.860> 1%<00:02:17.460> difference

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
think about that we have 1% difference

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.100 
think about that we have 1% difference
and<00:02:18.180> we're<00:02:18.300> building<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.690> Hubble<00:02:18.960> telescope

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
and we're building the Hubble telescope

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
and we're building the Hubble telescope
go<00:02:19.710> one<00:02:19.920> go<00:02:20.160> another<00:02:20.430> 1%<00:02:21.500> whoo<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.890> are<00:02:22.980> we

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
go one go another 1% whoo what are we

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.560 
go one go another 1% whoo what are we
today<00:02:25.100> we<00:02:26.100> would<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.280> drooling<00:02:26.760> blithering

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
today we would be drooling blithering

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.960 
today we would be drooling blithering
idiots<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.380> their<00:02:28.500> presence<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.550> what<00:02:29.790> we

idiots in their presence that's what we

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.250 
idiots in their presence that's what we

would be we would they would take

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.750 
would be we would they would take

their their primate researchers and say

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.210 
their their primate researchers and say
well<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:43.320> like<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.650> most<00:02:43.830> brilliant

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
well this one is like the most brilliant

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.160 
well this one is like the most brilliant
among<00:02:44.430> them<00:02:44.610> because<00:02:45.000> he<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.330> do<00:02:45.480> sort<00:02:46.050> of

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
among them because he can do sort of

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.260

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
refrigerator door here he is he did it

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.060 
refrigerator door here he is he did it
in<00:02:59.160> his<00:02:59.190> elementary<00:02:59.730> school<00:03:00.150> class<00:03:01.070> think

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
in his elementary school class think

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.170 
in his elementary school class think
about<00:03:02.370> how<00:03:02.520> smart<00:03:02.880> they<00:03:03.209> would<00:03:03.420> be<00:03:05.180> quantum

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
about how smart they would be quantum

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.120 
about how smart they would be quantum
mechanics<00:03:06.660> would<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.959> intuitive<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.980> their

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
mechanics would be intuitive to their

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.690 
mechanics would be intuitive to their
toddlers<00:03:09.230> whole<00:03:10.230> symphonies<00:03:10.980> would<00:03:11.550> be

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
toddlers whole symphonies would be

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.790 
toddlers whole symphonies would be
written<00:03:11.940> by<00:03:12.300> their<00:03:12.540> children<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> like<00:03:13.680> I

written by their children and like I

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.050 
written by their children and like I
said<00:03:14.040> just<00:03:14.070> put<00:03:14.459> up<00:03:14.580> on<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.910> refrigerator

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
said just put up on the refrigerator

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.440 
said just put up on the refrigerator
door<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.350> way<00:03:16.500> our<00:03:16.739> pasta<00:03:17.280> collages<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.209> on

door the way our pasta collages are on
our<00:03:18.690> refrigerator<00:03:19.470> doors<00:03:23.000> so<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.660> notion

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
our refrigerator doors so the notion

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.990 
our refrigerator doors so the notion
that<00:03:25.530> we're<00:03:26.190> going<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.430> find<00:03:26.730> some

conversation but I don't think you

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.890 
conversation but I don't think you
expected<00:03:46.300> an<00:03:46.420> answer<00:03:46.569> all<00:03:47.020> right<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.780> don't

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
expected an answer all right so we don't

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.270
