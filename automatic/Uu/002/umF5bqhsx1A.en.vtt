00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.740 
but people think that it is bad because
it<00:02:07.100> doesn't<00:02:07.370> look<00:02:07.460> very<00:02:07.580> appealing<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.600> looks

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
it doesn't look very appealing it looks

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.660 
it doesn't look very appealing it looks
like<00:02:08.869> maybe<00:02:09.080> an<00:02:09.590> animal<00:02:09.800> or<00:02:10.130> something<00:02:10.340> got<00:02:10.550> to

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.890 
like maybe an animal or something got to
it<00:02:10.760> but<00:02:10.880> really<00:02:10.910> it<00:02:11.180> was<00:02:11.270> just<00:02:11.300> pressed<00:02:11.720> up

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
it but really it was just pressed up

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.480 
it but really it was just pressed up
against<00:02:12.200> its<00:02:12.380> own<00:02:12.500> branch<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.950> was<00:02:13.070> going<00:02:13.370> on

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
against its own branch it was going on

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.000 
against its own branch it was going on
and<00:02:13.970> so<00:02:14.240> this<00:02:14.360> one<00:02:14.570> is<00:02:14.600> very<00:02:14.810> very<00:02:15.500> firm<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.890> can
