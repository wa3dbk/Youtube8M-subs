00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
powder form and this is actually natural

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.660 
powder form and this is actually natural
clay<00:01:48.870> do<00:01:49.470> have<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.830> be<00:01:49.980> careful<00:01:50.370> because<00:01:50.460> it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
clay do have to be careful because it

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.310 
clay do have to be careful because it
does<00:01:50.850> tend<00:01:51.150> to<00:01:51.240> get<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.450> little<00:01:51.630> messy<00:01:51.870> and<00:01:52.230> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
does tend to get a little messy and the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.780 
does tend to get a little messy and the
first<00:01:52.500> time<00:01:52.650> that<00:01:52.830> I<00:01:52.860> open<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> jar<00:01:53.580> it

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
first time that I open the jar it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.150 
first time that I open the jar it
spilled<00:01:54.270> all<00:01:54.480> over<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.900> place<00:01:55.110> okay<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.710> that

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
spilled all over the place okay so that

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.440 
spilled all over the place okay so that
is<00:01:56.190> what<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.610> looks<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.270> actually

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
is what it looks like and I actually

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.030 
is what it looks like and I actually
picked<00:01:57.840> mine<00:01:58.080> up<00:01:58.230> at<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> Vitamin<00:01:59.010> Shoppe

and you will feel it drawing the

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.580 
and you will feel it drawing the
impurities<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.510> skin<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:12.990> actually

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
and that is completely normal probably

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.699 
and that is completely normal probably
throughout<00:02:18.630> this<00:02:18.780> process<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.320> will<00:02:19.410> feel

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
it says you can either mix it with water

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.790 
it says you can either mix it with water
or<00:02:59.820> apple<00:03:00.150> cider<00:03:00.390> vinegar<00:03:00.690> I'm<00:03:01.380> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.680> use

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
or apple cider vinegar I'm going to use

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.470 
or apple cider vinegar I'm going to use
apple<00:03:02.130> cider<00:03:02.280> vinegar<00:03:02.459> just<00:03:02.910> because<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.269> feel

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
apple cider vinegar just because I feel

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.060 
apple cider vinegar just because I feel
like<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.690> mask<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> little<00:03:04.530> bit<00:03:04.680> stronger

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
like the mask is a little bit stronger

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.310 
like the mask is a little bit stronger
so<00:03:05.640> what<00:03:05.820> it<00:03:05.940> says<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.269> do<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.720> use<00:03:06.900> equal

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
so what it says to do is to use equal

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.320 
so what it says to do is to use equal
parts<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.340> going<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> make<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.090> mask

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
parts so I'm going to make a mask

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.930 
parts so I'm going to make a mask
probably<00:03:10.320> for<00:03:10.590> me<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.010> my<00:03:11.100> sister<00:03:11.489> we<00:03:11.640> tend<00:03:11.880> to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
probably for me and my sister we tend to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.190 
probably for me and my sister we tend to
do<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.209> both<00:03:12.330> at<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.570> same<00:03:12.750> time<00:03:12.780> she's

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
do it both at the same time she's

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.840 
do it both at the same time she's
actually<00:03:13.380> hiding<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.459> other<00:03:14.580> room<00:03:14.820> right

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
actually hiding in the other room right

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.210 
actually hiding in the other room right
now<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:16.080> I'm<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> put<00:03:16.680> enough<00:03:17.010> for

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
now but I'm going to put enough for

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.740 
now but I'm going to put enough for
about<00:03:17.400> two<00:03:17.640> people<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.150> I'm<00:03:18.239> going<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.510> start

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
about two people so I'm going to start

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.650 
about two people so I'm going to start
off<00:03:18.900> with<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.730> teaspoon<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:21.150> is<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.450> I

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
off with one teaspoon what is this I

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.180 
off with one teaspoon what is this I
actually<00:03:22.050> think<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.620> about<00:03:22.920> one

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
actually think this is about one

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.490 
actually think this is about one
tablespoon<00:03:23.489> of<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.180> powder<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.930> then

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
tablespoon of that powder and then

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.470 
tablespoon of that powder and then
vote<00:03:25.680> to<00:03:25.920> put<00:03:26.070> a<00:03:26.130> little<00:03:26.430> bit<00:03:26.700> less<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.270> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
vote to put a little bit less of the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.000 
vote to put a little bit less of the
apple<00:03:27.690> cider<00:03:27.810> vinegar<00:03:27.990> because<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.620> don't<00:03:28.860> want

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that since it does have calcium in it it

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.370 
that since it does have calcium in it it
could<00:03:59.670> react<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.750> just<00:04:00.900> want<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.110> stick
