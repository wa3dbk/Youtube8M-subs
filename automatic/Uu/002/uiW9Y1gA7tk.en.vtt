00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 and is the one who wants to kill 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:05.040
 look 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.300
 you know why they are here they are going to attack 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.150
 the survivor of this fight is not a 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.040
 liar the truth is that I do not know what 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.580
 kind of deal did you and nara q no 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.580
 embargo 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 wakes up bank bci wakes up I'll give you 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 again the gift of Christmas 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 from now on work up to me 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.039
 if you accept you will have the gift of life 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.039
 eternal with that fragment 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.740
 now resurrect your brothers 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.420
 to annihilate my enemies 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.910
 I can only assure you that it will give ass 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.950
 used as a simple shield to 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:13.110
 stay protected 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.890
 and that's what's wrong as you said 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.280
 and six brothers and I worked for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.620
 feudal lords but in the end 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.390
 we represent a threat to them like this 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.930
 that they set a trap for us and 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.930
 They left 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.920
 I admit that you never trust me I deal with 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.840
 orange but once resurrected everything 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.090
 it would be easier and I will kill the one 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.780
 it interferes with my plans I do not care 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.520
 if it's about the same nothing what madness 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.180
 I see that it does not happen to you, it prompted one of 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.100
 the most challenging beings silence 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.200
 then explain to me why you woke up 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.440
 after receiving that spell that does not get you 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 simple interest you did it by ambition 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.580
 and not already so you have no right to 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.130
 judge that saint and that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.530
 priestess felt great ambition in 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.350
 his heart that's why they did what 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.210
 impossible to hold on to life as 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 you can see we are not the only ones 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.780
 villains but you were dedicated to 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:17.410
 kill people yes and we also kill 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.410
 monsters 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.420
 I had forgotten the fragments of 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 his herd 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:46.980
 1991 1992 1996 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.500
 hey what are you doing 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.840
 go ahead 994 995 996 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:11.629
 997 998 999 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.260
 I do not need others who do 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.150
 or not 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.290
 go ahead if you think to escape this is your 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:01.560
 Portuguese that defeats you to avenge the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.239
 death of my brothers now you are 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.680
 telling you just because your side there is a 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.870
 color change to truth is that I 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.200
 I would have liked to strengthen it by cutting you 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.709
 in the head but I guess killing 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.569
 a hybrid would not be worth it to you 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.569
 you mean I mean this 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.539
 for more 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.880
 what kind of happiness says as if 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:32.669
 they are is to pay your keating from your hand 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.440
 when I first saw orange supe 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.720
 about the existence of the pearl itself 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.060
 with which he is able to grant 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.550
 powers the beasts but remember that 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.470
 I am a simple human born without 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.759
 powers neither interested me to look for us 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.759
 through the path of truth 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.050
 so I thought that if I wanted to be 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:58.290
 powerful I should strive until 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.970
 finally I found a method I mean 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.370
 to grant special powers to a 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.950
 object why I made an offer to 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.910
 my bank I promised 2000 victims with their 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:12.960
 cutting edge percent 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.960
 but with my promise 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.340
 made to me so that in addition to making 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.710
 that offer my neighborhood contains 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.560
 fragments of yes with 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.870
 cut thousand heads and also thousand 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.330
 monsters the resentment generated by their 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.310
 deaths made her more powerful 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.530
 turning it into a magical weapon like 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.530
 yours but my neighborhood is superior 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.300
 you only realize even if 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.100
 resurrected you never cease to be human 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.590
 You can control your malignant onset 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.700
 disaster of it is for your sake it leaves you 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.700
 stupid baby 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.910
 and you monsters do not 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.620
 will understand or perhaps being hybrid you 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.620
 it helps to understand humans a bit 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:05.379
 in this world you have to be strong or not 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.379
 you will have nothing 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:14.780
 it's the end 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:32.059
 with these poor people you should never zero 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:41.989
 you can use the marine energy of your 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:44.529
 bank and to create my rewind 

00:06:41.989 --> 00:06:44.529
 builder 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.200
 liu 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.540
 not 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.110
 or not 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.980
 ah 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.009
 with this
