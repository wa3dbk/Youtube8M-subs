00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.580 
phone and pretty big for a Windows Phone
device<00:02:44.710> whereas<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:46.020> Sony<00:02:47.020> Xperia<00:02:47.290> Z<00:02:47.560> ultra

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
device whereas the Sony Xperia Z ultra

so as you can see in terms of the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.040 
so as you can see in terms of the
thickness<00:02:56.920> both<00:02:57.370> are<00:02:57.490> almost<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.970> same<00:02:58.270> but

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
thickness both are almost the same but

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.740 
thickness both are almost the same but
the<00:02:59.470> 1520<00:03:00.130> feels<00:03:00.490> a<00:03:00.640> lot<00:03:00.790> more<00:03:01.060> easier<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.450> hold

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
the 1520 feels a lot more easier to hold

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:08.490 
the 1520 feels a lot more easier to hold
them<00:03:05.040> between<00:03:06.040> the<00:03:06.160> two<00:03:06.310> devices<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:08.290> only

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
them between the two devices the only

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.440 
them between the two devices the only
good<00:03:08.620> thing<00:03:08.800> about<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.070> Xperia<00:03:09.340> Z<00:03:09.459> ultra<00:03:09.490> is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
good thing about the Xperia Z ultra is

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.320 
good thing about the Xperia Z ultra is
that<00:03:10.690> it's<00:03:10.870> waterproof<00:03:11.290> so<00:03:11.800> if<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.700> can<00:03:12.880> if

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330
