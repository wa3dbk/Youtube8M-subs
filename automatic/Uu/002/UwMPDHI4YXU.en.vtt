haven't used this formation in
absolutely<00:00:11.309> ages<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.090> pretty<00:00:12.240> rare

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
absolutely ages and it's pretty rare

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.839

on<00:01:12.150> Phillip<00:01:12.570> blonde<00:01:12.780> because<00:01:13.080> he's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> little

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
on Phillip blonde because he's a little

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.590 
on Phillip blonde because he's a little
bit<00:01:14.220> short<00:01:14.490> he's<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.760> little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.030> slower<00:01:15.270> I

bit short he's a little bit slower I

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
bit short he's a little bit slower I
just<00:01:16.259> don't<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.740> he's<00:01:16.920> worth<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
just don't think he's worth like the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480 
just don't think he's worth like the
eighteen<00:01:18.210> thousand<00:01:18.780> coins<00:01:18.960> so<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.220> bit<00:01:20.369> if

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
eighteen thousand coins so it's a bit if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
eighteen thousand coins so it's a bit if
you're<00:01:20.670> not<00:01:20.850> one<00:01:21.060> David<00:01:21.450> Luiz<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.930> awesome

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
really really some attempted back he was

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
really really some attempted back he was
one<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.670> defenders<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.909> guess<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210

this team the problem I had with his

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
this team the problem I had with his
defense<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.450> had<00:01:30.689> kind<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.500> lack<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
defense was it had kind of a lack of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.140 
defense was it had kind of a lack of
height<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> left<00:01:32.640> back<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> right

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
height with the left back on the right

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.240 
height with the left back on the right
back<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.689> don't<00:01:34.259> particularly<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.979> that

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
back and I don't particularly like that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.490 
back and I don't particularly like that
because<00:01:35.400> it's<00:01:35.729> rare<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.720> if<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.350> into

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
because it's rare but if you get into

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.020 
because it's rare but if you get into
situation<00:01:38.130> where<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.340> only<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.700> left<00:01:38.880> back

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
situation where it's only your left back

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
situation where it's only your left back
and<00:01:39.270> you're<00:01:39.390> right<00:01:39.540> back<00:01:39.780> like<00:01:40.320> defending

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
and you're right back like defending

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.460 
and you're right back like defending
you're<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.240> get<00:01:42.420> caught<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.899> by<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.200> header

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
you're gonna get caught out by a header

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
you're gonna get caught out by a header
and<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.770> happened<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.520> many<00:01:44.790> times<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.390> if

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
and that happened so many times like if

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.960 
and that happened so many times like if
I<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.869> trying<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> cover<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I was trying to cover them and then I

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
I was trying to cover them and then I
was<00:01:48.270> caught<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.750> position<00:01:48.899> where<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.829> only

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
was caught in a position where is only

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
was caught in a position where is only
those<00:01:50.159> two<00:01:50.189> back<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.850> would<00:01:51.210> struggle<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.899> they

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
those two back I would struggle and they

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.899 
those two back I would struggle and they
will<00:01:52.500> get<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.740> just<00:01:52.890> cross<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.310> Ramirez<00:01:53.640> is

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
will get to just cross in Ramirez is

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.630 
will get to just cross in Ramirez is
really<00:01:54.600> solid<00:01:54.960> but<00:01:55.259> again<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.159> does<00:01:56.340> bring

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
really solid but again it does bring

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.090 
really solid but again it does bring
this<00:01:56.790> height<00:01:57.119> issue<00:01:57.360> it's<00:01:58.140> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> prevalent

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
this height issue it's kind of prevalent

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.350 
this height issue it's kind of prevalent
throughout<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.520> team<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.909> I'll<00:01:59.969> explain<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
throughout the team and I'll explain a

little bit more throughout as we go

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.459 
little bit more throughout as we go
along<00:02:02.460> you'll<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.969> kind<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> trend

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
along you'll see kind of like a trend

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.260

a<00:02:25.719> lot<00:02:25.989> more<00:02:26.019> sluggish<00:02:26.469> like<00:02:26.769> i<00:02:26.980> was<00:02:27.250> using

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
a lot more sluggish like i was using

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.479 
a lot more sluggish like i was using
Fabregas<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:29.349> don't<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> actually

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
Fabregas and I don't know I actually

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.789 
Fabregas and I don't know I actually
preferred<00:02:31.180> Fabregas<00:02:31.870> over<00:02:32.290> in<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.530> effort

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
preferred Fabregas over in the effort

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.250 
preferred Fabregas over in the effort
but<00:02:32.829> he's<00:02:33.099> very<00:02:33.340> very<00:02:33.430> expensive<00:02:33.760> Iniesta<00:02:34.420> or

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
but he's very very expensive Iniesta or

things really good but just didn't feel
like<00:02:38.650> an<00:02:39.219> expensive<00:02:39.549> play<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.209> was<00:02:40.329> weird

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
like an expensive play it was weird

like an expensive play it was weird
really<00:02:41.500> really<00:02:41.739> strange<00:02:42.129> I<00:02:42.310> think<00:02:42.519> I<00:02:42.579> actually

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
really really strange I think I actually

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.670 
really really strange I think I actually
preferred<00:02:43.060> shabby<00:02:43.510> as<00:02:43.599> well<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.200> Coderre

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
preferred shabby as well but Coderre

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.110 
preferred shabby as well but Coderre

let's talk a little bit about a team in
the<00:03:35.470> formation<00:03:35.829> and<00:03:36.189> how<00:03:36.699> I<00:03:36.729> actually<00:03:37.060> play

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 
the formation and how I actually play

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.740 
the formation and how I actually play
them<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.229> was<00:03:38.439> a<00:03:38.470> good<00:03:38.859> team<00:03:39.220> but<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.239> was<00:03:40.479> a

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
them it was a good team but it was a

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.990 
them it was a good team but it was a
lack<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.109> height<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.739> really<00:03:42.159> kind<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.639> ruined

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
lack of height the really kind of ruined

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.309 
lack of height the really kind of ruined
it<00:03:43.090> for<00:03:43.209> me<00:03:43.239> name<00:03:43.479> was<00:03:43.689> dribbling<00:03:44.139> in<00:03:44.290> the

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
it for me name was dribbling in the

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.159 
it for me name was dribbling in the
amount<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.519> times<00:03:46.479> they<00:03:46.689> can<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:46.959> change

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
amount of times they can just change

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:49.499 
amount of times they can just change
direction<00:03:47.620> so<00:03:47.949> quickly<00:03:48.400> it's<00:03:48.609> crazy<00:03:49.180> that<00:03:49.359> is

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:49.509 
direction so quickly it's crazy that is

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:51.479 
direction so quickly it's crazy that is
a<00:03:49.540> cool<00:03:49.810> girl<00:03:49.959> that<00:03:50.139> is<00:03:50.229> a<00:03:50.259> really<00:03:51.099> nice<00:03:51.280> top

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
finish but he can literally just dart in

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.830 
finish but he can literally just dart in
and<00:03:53.169> out<00:03:53.349> and<00:03:53.620> it's<00:03:54.370> uh<00:03:54.699> it's<00:03:54.939> quite<00:03:55.389> good<00:03:55.569> it

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
and out and it's uh it's quite good it

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.050 
and out and it's uh it's quite good it
is<00:03:56.019> pretty<00:03:56.409> good<00:03:56.680> but<00:03:56.919> I<00:03:57.159> don't<00:03:57.430> know<00:03:57.639> I<00:03:57.669> felt

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
is pretty good but I don't know I felt

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.149 
is pretty good but I don't know I felt
like<00:03:58.329> I<00:03:58.509> had<00:03:58.750> to<00:03:58.780> rely<00:03:59.199> on<00:03:59.229> over<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.739> top<00:03:59.919> three

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
like I had to rely on over the top three

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.559 
like I had to rely on over the top three
balls<00:04:00.340> and<00:04:00.459> I<00:04:00.519> don't<00:04:00.759> like<00:04:01.000> doing<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.359> cuz<00:04:01.509> it

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
balls and I don't like doing it cuz it

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.069 
balls and I don't like doing it cuz it
makes<00:04:01.629> for<00:04:01.959> really<00:04:02.609> boring<00:04:03.609> gold<00:04:03.939> but<00:04:04.239> they're

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
makes for really boring gold but they're

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.439 
makes for really boring gold but they're
the<00:04:05.229> only<00:04:05.379> ones<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.859> were<00:04:05.979> kind<00:04:06.729> of<00:04:06.879> reliable

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.449 
the only ones that were kind of reliable

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:09.749 
the only ones that were kind of reliable
in<00:04:07.569> this<00:04:07.689> team<00:04:07.900> I<00:04:08.049> found<00:04:08.259> that<00:04:08.409> dribbly<00:04:08.859> people

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:09.759 
in this team I found that dribbly people

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:11.460 
in this team I found that dribbly people
could<00:04:09.939> kind<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.359> just<00:04:10.569> shut<00:04:10.659> me<00:04:10.840> down<00:04:10.959> really

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
could kind of just shut me down really

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.800 
could kind of just shut me down really
quickly<00:04:11.829> example<00:04:12.489> being<00:04:12.639> there<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.180> do<00:04:13.359> manage

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
quickly example being there I do manage

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.229 
quickly example being there I do manage
to<00:04:13.840> turn<00:04:14.109> very<00:04:14.500> quickly<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:15.040> kind<00:04:15.699> of<00:04:15.819> outplay

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
to turn very quickly and kind of outplay

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.170 
to turn very quickly and kind of outplay
them<00:04:16.269> a<00:04:16.449> little<00:04:16.599> bit<00:04:16.840> but<00:04:17.019> it<00:04:17.530> found<00:04:18.009> it<00:04:18.430> really

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
them a little bit but it found it really

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.490 
them a little bit but it found it really
i<00:04:19.209> thought<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.599> really<00:04:19.720> difficult<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.259> just

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
i thought it really difficult to just

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.029 
i thought it really difficult to just
break<00:04:21.400> teams<00:04:21.909> down<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:23.320> ended<00:04:23.620> up<00:04:23.740> being

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
break teams down and it ended up being

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.379 
break teams down and it ended up being
over<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.490> top<00:04:24.580> three<00:04:24.880> balls<00:04:25.090> they're<00:04:25.270> just

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
over the top three balls they're just

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:26.790 
over the top three balls they're just
one<00:04:25.570> that's<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.050> boring

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
one that's so boring

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.680 
one that's so boring
sorry<00:04:27.129> but<00:04:27.789> they<00:04:27.909> were<00:04:27.970> just<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.270> ones<00:04:28.419> that

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
sorry but they were just the ones that

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.540 
sorry but they were just the ones that
were<00:04:29.169> reliable<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.830> if<00:04:29.949> I<00:04:30.039> wanted<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> win

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
were reliable and if I wanted to win

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.700 
were reliable and if I wanted to win
that's<00:04:31.300> kind<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.569> all<00:04:31.720> I<00:04:31.750> had<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:31.990> do<00:04:32.379> and<00:04:32.590> it

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
that's kind of all I had to do and it

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.219 
that's kind of all I had to do and it
was<00:04:32.919> very<00:04:33.250> very<00:04:34.090> boy<00:04:34.300> I<00:04:34.389> tried<00:04:34.659> so<00:04:34.960> hard<00:04:34.990> to

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
was very very boy I tried so hard to

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.290 
was very very boy I tried so hard to
dribble<00:04:35.500> when<00:04:35.650> it<00:04:35.770> was<00:04:35.889> getting<00:04:36.789> the<00:04:37.090> lock<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
dribble when it was getting the lock to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.200 
dribble when it was getting the lock to
the<00:04:37.509> last<00:04:37.750> man<00:04:37.990> every<00:04:38.710> single<00:04:39.039> throne<00:04:39.699> but<00:04:40.030> it

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
the last man every single throne but it

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.760 
the last man every single throne but it
was<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.330> good<00:04:40.419> team<00:04:40.810> I<00:04:41.050> think<00:04:41.379> it<00:04:41.500> could<00:04:41.650> have

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
was a good team I think it could have

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.770 
was a good team I think it could have
been<00:04:41.830> done<00:04:42.039> better<00:04:42.099> perhaps<00:04:42.639> with<00:04:43.150> some

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
been done better perhaps with some

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.680 
been done better perhaps with some
taller<00:04:44.110> players<00:04:44.470> I<00:04:44.710> did<00:04:45.039> have<00:04:45.280> a<00:04:45.610> lot<00:04:46.479> of

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
taller players I did have a lot of

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.570 
taller players I did have a lot of
players<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.259> were<00:04:47.470> under<00:04:47.770> fix<00:04:47.979> but<00:04:48.159> I<00:04:48.190> think

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
players that were under fix but I think

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.219 
players that were under fix but I think
it<00:04:48.759> really<00:04:48.849> really<00:04:49.449> hindered<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.900> team<00:04:50.110> but

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
it really really hindered a team but

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:51.980 
it really really hindered a team but
it's<00:04:50.349> a<00:04:50.379> good<00:04:50.500> team<00:04:50.680> pass<00:04:51.190> around<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.580> lot<00:04:51.699> and

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
it's a good team pass around a lot and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.480 
it's a good team pass around a lot and
try<00:04:52.990> your<00:04:53.020> best<00:04:53.379> to<00:04:53.560> dribble<00:04:53.830> with<00:04:53.949> Neymar<00:04:54.340> it

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490
