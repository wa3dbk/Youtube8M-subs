00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 welcome to cooking with the boy 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.509
 sevilla I bring you a fish ceviche 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.519
 Peruvian made here in the Usa delicious 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.500
 and super easy to do let's start 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.309
 make our number one garrison that 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.599
 is sweet potato cooked in a pot we put 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.050
 we cover the cans with water and 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.580
 add a teaspoon of sugar this 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 will help us get them out 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 much sweeter than normal we cover it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.039
 and let it cook, remember to fire 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.470
 medium-high for 20 and 25 minutes 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.480
 once soft we drained the water and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 we reserve now we make our 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 garnish number 2 canchita toast 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 I am using canchita chulpi dent eeuu 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.000
 We put in a pan over medium heat a 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.610
 little oil and I'm adding here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.399
 like a cup of canchita we add salt 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.559
 to taste and stir we move very well and 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.079
 we do not cover so that the canchita does not jump 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.020
 It takes approximately 5 minutes 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.690
 toast do not abandon it and we reserve it 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.090
 for this recipe we need to use media 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.490
 We cut into julienne onion as 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.760
 thin that can 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.500
 and something very important to do one step 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.450
 very important is to put our onion 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.340
 in water with salt here I have more or less 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.740
 like a cup of water and I put a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.200
 teaspoon of salt and we put it to 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.940
 soak more time be in the water with 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.740
 salt in fact better to reduce the 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:22.040
 bitterness and also going to come out more expensive 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.920
 sing and we reserve 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.770
 now we start chopping our rocoto 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.220
 You can use ají limo or ají amarillo here 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.980
 I have here and can use 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.810
 approximately one tablespoon or one 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.690
 teaspoon depending on the itching that is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.090
 want we will also avoid using a 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.700
 little bit of celery nothing more 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.990
 like a spoonful of celery will have a 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.960
 flavor is great guys and also 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.960
 We need a spoonful of coriander or 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.660
 parsley is fine it goes very well with the 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.310
 two here I have them we reserve now 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.530
 boy let's go work with another fish 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.750
 that I have the tilapia fish remember 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.729
 they can also use sole or ivory 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.530
 magical there are many others affected that 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.780
 can use for our rights in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.209
 united states come packed here yo 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.550
 I took out the plastic rinse 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.860
 well and we cut it in cover the 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.860
 small in about one centimeter 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.190
 for this recipe I'm using three 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:25.190
 tilapia fish fillets and we put it 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.390
 this in a bowl guys now we're going to 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.739
 add salt 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.780
 the salt is to taste but I am 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.599
 adding half teaspoon add 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.640
 half a teaspoon of garlic and a spoonful 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:37.940
 of chopped celery 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:41.300
 mix well and add pepper to 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.250
 taste and our teaspoon or spoonful 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.680
 of chili limo red pepper or asia yellow and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.480
 we add our onion drained and 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.970
 now guys something very important that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.570
 I want to clarify about 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.700
 in the USA there are two types of lemons 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.080
 green one big solo peking is very 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.180
 common is that you find them in the 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.420
 supermarket but pitifully and 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.380
 neither of them serves to make a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.510
 good Peruvian fish ceviche guys 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.660
 there is also a market that type of 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.740
 lemon packed and that would have caused me 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.920
 this lemon is the only one that in my 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.680
 experience making ceviche is the only 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.990
 which serves with the other lemons the 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.959
 Ceviche is going to come out too sour and without 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.090
 good taste I recommend them too 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.760
 guys we added our cilantro or 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.880
 parsley chopped soon a 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.690
 spoonful we mix very well and now what 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.370
 let's do 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.440
 it is very important that you leave it 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.200
 resting since it's simone what are 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.870
 Sounds do not pose very fast like in Peru 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.090
 If they are in Peru that ceviche is made 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.560
 five minutes super fast but here in 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.870
 the US is going to delay we are going to cover it 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.110
 10-15 minutes we mix it well 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.920
 we cover again for another 10 15 minutes 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.940
 and they're going to see that the one who chopped is 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.800
 and whitening that 3 that is already cooked 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.160
 add the two they took my 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.310
 tiger milk that comes out delicious here 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.440
 I'm accompanying with this garrison 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.720
 popular well known in our camotito 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.230
 cooked and our canchita but hopefully 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.760
 good guys I recommend this recipe 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.770
 just as I am doing it health 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.570
