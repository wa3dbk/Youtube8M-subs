00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:08.339
 far to the east beyond words and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.589
 rivers stands a solitary peak the 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:15.329
 dwarves are intent on reclaiming their 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:18.000
 lands I like to have visitors like 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.530
 any hobbit but I like 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.370
 know before he makes me 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.670
 visit 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.670

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.570
 of dwarves what are they doing here well merry 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.759
 assembled then it's the hobbit 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.499
 you asked me to find the 14th 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.899
 members of this company I chose 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:38.760
 sir his cam - no no no no 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.390
 hobbits can go unnoticed when 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.969
 they want it 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:48.629
 which gives us a clear advantage 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:52.710
 seize this chance to take back for 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:55.960
 an adventure of time telling why she 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.900
 put himself man why bilbon sacquet 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:02.739
 maybe it's because I'm scared and 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.739
 that he gives me courage 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.710
 so that's where your goal come in 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.590
 the mountain 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.870
 and then so I should that this is not 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.640
 not careful 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.780
 an evil power to find a 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:26.440
 way back in the world and if 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:37.290
 we played shock and it's great my 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:37.290
 precious the world was waiting 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.810
 I would not trade any of these four 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.810
 more powerful armies 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.049
 pony loyalty 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.049
 a supervisor I do not wonder anymore 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.880
 your village is behind you 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.880

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 at 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.330
