all right here's where we got after he
put<00:00:50.109> both<00:00:50.289> of<00:00:50.350> them<00:00:50.559> together<00:00:51.090> so<00:00:52.090> I'm<00:00:52.210> just

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
put both of them together so I'm just

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:54.470 
put both of them together so I'm just
going<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.539> wrap<00:00:52.780> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
going to wrap this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
going to wrap this
around<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:56.460> back<00:00:56.700> of<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.540> shield<00:00:58.250> connect

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
around the back of the shield connect

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.440 
around the back of the shield connect
them<00:00:59.400> connect<00:01:00.330> this<00:01:00.830> to<00:01:01.830> that<00:01:02.240> wherever<00:01:03.240> that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
them connect this to that wherever that

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.940 
them connect this to that wherever that
ends<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:05.930> see<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.050> I've<00:01:07.200> eliminated<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
ends and see if I've eliminated the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.550 
ends and see if I've eliminated the
noise<00:01:10.310> I'm<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.400> start<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.850> puppy<00:01:12.210> up

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
noise I'm gonna start this puppy up

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.020 
noise I'm gonna start this puppy up
that's<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> little<00:01:14.010> bit<00:01:14.100> loose<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.640> I'm

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that's it a little bit loose so I'm

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.420 
that's it a little bit loose so I'm
going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.479> tighten<00:01:15.690> it<00:01:15.840> up<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.729> so

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
going to have to tighten it up here so

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.160 
going to have to tighten it up here so
take<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.580> out<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.729> here<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.180> I'm<00:01:21.300> fly<00:01:21.630> forward

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
take it out of here so I'm fly forward

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.020 
take it out of here so I'm fly forward
on<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.350> jack<00:01:22.560> stands

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.910 

you<00:01:27.030> break<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.570> I'm<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.470> going<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> follow

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
you break is on I'm not going to follow

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.680 
you break is on I'm not going to follow
me<00:01:29.250> immediately<00:01:29.670> although<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.479> really

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
me immediately although I should really

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.969 
me immediately although I should really
put<00:01:31.160> blocks<00:01:32.160> behind<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.810> from<00:01:33.979> getting

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
put blocks behind this from getting

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.960 
put blocks behind this from getting
under<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.250> car<00:01:35.430> like<00:01:35.610> this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.580 

I<00:01:40.060> can't<00:01:40.780> even<00:01:40.930> hear<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.110> sound<00:01:41.380> now

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.510 

put<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.620> little<00:01:46.770> more<00:01:46.950> load<00:01:47.190> on<00:01:47.370> the<00:01:47.490> engine

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
put a little more load on the engine

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.510 
put a little more load on the engine
here

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.760 

and<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> looks<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.330> below

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.590 

so<00:02:03.979> here's<00:02:04.159> what<00:02:04.280> I<00:02:04.310> got<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:04.729> now<00:02:04.939> you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
so here's what I got on there now you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.940 
so here's what I got on there now you
can<00:02:05.780> see<00:02:06.070> it's<00:02:07.070> vibrating

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
can see it's vibrating

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.760 
can see it's vibrating
let's<00:02:09.310> see<00:02:09.490> if<00:02:09.550> I<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.729> get<00:02:09.819> a<00:02:09.850> still<00:02:10.179> shot<00:02:10.210> so

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
let's see if I can get a still shot so

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.420 
let's see if I can get a still shot so
you<00:02:11.770> can<00:02:11.950> see<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> vibrations

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
you can see the vibrations

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:23.380 
you can see the vibrations
that's<00:02:14.939> not<00:02:15.120> good

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.330 

that's<00:02:23.840> annoying<00:02:24.290> it's<00:02:24.470> already<00:02:24.710> fixed<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
that's annoying it's already fixed I

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.190 
that's annoying it's already fixed I
wanted<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.240> be<00:02:26.300> able<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> tighten<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.020> have

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
wanted to be able to tighten it and have

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.560 
wanted to be able to tighten it and have
it<00:02:27.350> get<00:02:27.500> quieter<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.000> seems<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.390> already

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570 
it get quieter but it seems to already

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.080 
it get quieter but it seems to already
have<00:02:29.860> just<00:02:30.860> loosely<00:02:31.160> putting<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:31.670> thing<00:02:31.880> on

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
have just loosely putting this thing on

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.850 
have just loosely putting this thing on
so<00:02:32.330> you're<00:02:32.480> still<00:02:32.630> done<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.960> I'm<00:02:33.620> going<00:02:33.800> to

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
so you're still done it I'm going to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.050 
so you're still done it I'm going to
tighten<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.130> off<00:02:34.250> anyways

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.800 

actually<00:02:42.660> when<00:02:42.959> I'm<00:02:43.050> done<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.500> might<00:02:43.830> cut<00:02:44.370> this

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
actually when I'm done I might cut this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
actually when I'm done I might cut this
so<00:02:45.810> this<00:02:45.989> doesn't<00:02:46.349> become<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.590> whole<00:02:46.800> new

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
so this doesn't become a whole new

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.830 
so this doesn't become a whole new
vibration<00:02:47.430> all<00:02:47.520> by<00:02:47.670> itself

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:03.830 

but<00:02:51.440> as<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:52.040> right<00:02:52.190> now

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.770 

but<00:03:04.410> I'm<00:03:04.739> not<00:03:04.920> hearing<00:03:05.160> anything<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:05.819> while<00:03:06.750> I

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
but I'm not hearing anything and while I

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.390 
but I'm not hearing anything and while I
was<00:03:07.050> playing<00:03:07.230> with<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.769> noticed<00:03:08.129> that<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
was playing with it I noticed that the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.880 
was playing with it I noticed that the
reason<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.900> was<00:03:10.080> making<00:03:10.379> noise<00:03:10.560> at<00:03:10.769> all

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
reason that this was making noise at all

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.160 
reason that this was making noise at all
is<00:03:11.340> because<00:03:11.760> if<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.599> in<00:03:12.750> this<00:03:12.900> little

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
is because if you see up in this little

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.960 
is because if you see up in this little
tab<00:03:13.349> up<00:03:13.590> here<00:03:15.290> yeah<00:03:16.290> right<00:03:16.730> there<00:03:17.730> that's

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
tab up here yeah right there that's
