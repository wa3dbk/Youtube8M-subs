to tell you that this is a little bit

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.440 
to tell you that this is a little bit
laggy<00:00:05.279> for<00:00:05.400> some<00:00:05.700> reason<00:00:06.029> I'm<00:00:06.150> playing<00:00:06.270> this

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
laggy for some reason I'm playing this

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.410 
laggy for some reason I'm playing this
on<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.629> xbox<00:00:06.779> 360<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.550> started<00:00:09.000> up<00:00:09.179> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
on the xbox 360 and it started up a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.360 
on the xbox 360 and it started up a
little<00:00:09.690> bit<00:00:09.870> laggy<00:00:10.110> but<00:00:10.349> now<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.710> pretty<00:00:11.070> fun

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
little bit laggy but now it's pretty fun

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.959 
little bit laggy but now it's pretty fun
I<00:00:11.400> think

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
I think

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.330 
I think
but<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> an<00:00:12.660> amnesiac<00:00:13.530> kind<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.920> map<00:00:14.130> it's

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
but this is an amnesiac kind of map it's

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.460 
but this is an amnesiac kind of map it's
a<00:00:14.370> pretty<00:00:14.820> scary<00:00:15.000> map<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> can<00:00:15.900> see<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
a pretty scary map you can see this the

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.650 
a pretty scary map you can see this the
castell<00:00:17.039> things<00:00:17.580> even<00:00:17.970> bigger<00:00:18.210> I'm<00:00:18.390> not<00:00:18.510> too

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
castell things even bigger I'm not too

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.779 
castell things even bigger I'm not too
sure<00:00:18.840> where<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.230> parts<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.609> is

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
sure where all parts are I think this is

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.640 
sure where all parts are I think this is
the<00:00:20.939> castell<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.539> here's<00:00:21.720> all<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.350> Redstone

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the castell and here's all the Redstone

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
the castell and here's all the Redstone
and<00:00:23.100> on<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.400> air<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.789> some<00:00:23.970> more<00:00:24.150> stuff

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
and on the air you have some more stuff

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.599 
and on the air you have some more stuff
for<00:00:24.600> example<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:25.140> part<00:00:25.590> there's<00:00:26.039> more<00:00:26.340> stuff

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
for example this part there's more stuff

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.599 
for example this part there's more stuff
but<00:00:27.180> from<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> outside<00:00:27.750> looks<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.260> ugly

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
but from the outside looks really ugly

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
basically but yeah it's really smart

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
basically but yeah it's really smart
with<00:01:05.040> wheels<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.760> otherwise<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.360> would

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
with wheels because otherwise you would

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.330 
with wheels because otherwise you would
just<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:07.350> break<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.770> map<00:01:08.010> or<00:01:08.159> something

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
just probably break the map or something

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219 
just probably break the map or something
like<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.060> these<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.750> rules

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
like that and these are also rules

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.960 
like that and these are also rules
there's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.979> rules<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.549> here<00:01:11.820> as<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970

it's<00:01:24.570> really<00:01:24.900> scary<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> have<00:01:25.740> played

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's really scary if you have played

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
it's really scary if you have played
amnesia<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.700> yourself<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.869> what

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
amnesia a yourself then you know what

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.590 
amnesia a yourself then you know what
this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.890> only<00:01:29.040> trailer<00:01:29.610> slash<00:01:30.150> for<00:01:30.390> work

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this is the only trailer slash for work

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.240 
this is the only trailer slash for work
on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.840> movie<00:01:31.110> which<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.590> do<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
on the movie which I do like is

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.660 
on the movie which I do like is
Paranormal<00:01:33.000> Activity<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:34.340> didn't<00:01:35.340> like<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
Paranormal Activity I didn't like the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.210 
Paranormal Activity I didn't like the
last<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.869> was<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.380> all<00:01:37.590> gained

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
last one because it was just all gained

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.210 
last one because it was just all gained
the<00:01:38.460> same<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.970> always<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.689> same<00:01:39.900> always

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
like they just start as a happy family

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
like they just start as a happy family
and<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.680> goes<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.130> blah<00:01:44.250> blah

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
blah blah blah it's just always the same

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's a little bit laggy because there's

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.679 
it's a little bit laggy because there's
so<00:01:49.770> much<00:01:50.040> best<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.460> here's<00:01:50.700> another<00:01:51.090> part<00:01:51.600> of

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
so much best on here's another part of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.999 
so much best on here's another part of
the<00:01:51.810> story<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> pay<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> much

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the story I don't want to pay that much

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.100 
the story I don't want to pay that much
of<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> map<00:01:53.909> because<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.689> want<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> guys<00:01:55.049> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
of the map because I want you guys to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
of the map because I want you guys to
check<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.439> out<00:01:55.560> yourself<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> really

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
check it out yourself but it's a really

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.819 
check it out yourself but it's a really
scary<00:01:56.909> map<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.570> already<00:01:57.899> tell<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
scary map I can already tell you and

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.020 
scary map I can already tell you and
let's<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.189> up<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.850> show<00:01:59.880> you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
let's get up here and I will show you

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
let's get up here and I will show you
just<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.479> few<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.930> rooms<00:02:01.140> I'm<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.950> your

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
just a few of the rooms I'm this your

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.649 
just a few of the rooms I'm this your
room<00:02:02.340> over<00:02:02.520> here<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.939> probably<00:02:03.270> have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.479> turn

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
room over here you probably have to turn

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.230 
room over here you probably have to turn
your<00:02:03.840> gamma<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.180> think

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
your gamma down I have it on I think

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.719 
your gamma down I have it on I think
100%<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.710> probably<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.429> turn<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
100% but you probably have to turn it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.490 
100% but you probably have to turn it
down<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:08.970> 50%<00:02:09.390> let's<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.140> if<00:02:10.289> that

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
down at 50% let's take a look if that

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.780 
down at 50% let's take a look if that
makes<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.890> big<00:02:11.069> difference

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
makes a big difference

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.700 
makes a big difference
turn<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.239> down

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
turn it down

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.630 
turn it down
for<00:02:12.890> example<00:02:14.560> 69<00:02:15.560> because<00:02:15.920> that's<00:02:16.100> an<00:02:16.190> awesome

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
for example 69 because that's an awesome

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.140 
for example 69 because that's an awesome
number

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
number

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.180 
number
it<00:02:17.420> looks<00:02:17.630> already<00:02:17.930> more<00:02:18.320> scary<00:02:18.710> but<00:02:19.010> there's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
it looks already more scary but there's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.040 
it looks already more scary but there's
a<00:02:19.280> lot<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.580> stuff<00:02:19.790> out<00:02:20.000> here<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.960> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
a lot of stuff out here this this is the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.600 
a lot of stuff out here this this is the
train<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.440> me<00:02:21.560> by<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.740> way<00:02:21.890> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.100> want<00:02:22.280> guys

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
train to me by the way if you want guys

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.070 
train to me by the way if you want guys
were<00:02:22.790> wondering<00:02:22.970> there's<00:02:23.300> no<00:02:23.390> poor<00:02:23.660> corner

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
were wondering there's no poor corner

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.500 
were wondering there's no poor corner
there's<00:02:24.380> no<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.670> think<00:02:26.000> it's<00:02:26.120> personal<00:02:26.330> in

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
there's no but I think it's personal in

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.330 
there's no but I think it's personal in
there<00:02:26.600> by<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.780> way<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.170> most<00:02:27.740> of<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:27.980> parts

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
there by the way but most of the parts

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.130 
there by the way but most of the parts
just<00:02:28.430> offense<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.300> have<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.600> solve<00:02:30.110> some

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
just offense you just have to solve some

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.810 
just offense you just have to solve some
puzzles<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.070> through<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.400> map<00:02:31.610> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
puzzles to get through the map and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.280 
puzzles to get through the map and
there's<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.300> lot<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.630> science<00:02:32.960> which<00:02:33.080> you<00:02:33.170> have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
there's a lot of science which you have

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.930 
there's a lot of science which you have
to<00:02:33.410> read<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.190> can<00:02:34.370> just<00:02:34.520> play<00:02:34.640> this<00:02:34.700> map

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
to read but you can just play this map

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.610 
to read but you can just play this map
alone<00:02:35.240> Aviv<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> couple<00:02:35.870> friends<00:02:36.050> I<00:02:36.290> think<00:02:36.500> it's

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
alone Aviv a couple friends I think it's

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.250 
alone Aviv a couple friends I think it's
the<00:02:36.680> best<00:02:36.890> played<00:02:37.130> alone<00:02:37.430> over<00:02:37.780> f1<00:02:38.780> friends

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
the best played alone over f1 friends

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.960 
the best played alone over f1 friends
because<00:02:39.590> otherwise<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:40.100> just<00:02:40.310> too<00:02:40.490> much<00:02:40.730> but

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
because otherwise is just too much but

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.390 
because otherwise is just too much but
yeah<00:02:41.120> I<00:02:41.330> won't<00:02:41.780> show<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:41.960> any<00:02:42.440> much<00:02:42.860> more<00:02:43.190> than

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
yeah I won't show you any much more than

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.680 
yeah I won't show you any much more than
map<00:02:43.550> because<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:43.940> want<00:02:44.150> you<00:02:44.240> guys<00:02:44.360> to<00:02:44.390> check<00:02:44.540> it

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
map because I want you guys to check it

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.150 
map because I want you guys to check it
out<00:02:44.840> yourself<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.350> that's<00:02:45.770> basically<00:02:46.040> it

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
out yourself so that's basically it

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.500 
out yourself so that's basically it
though<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:46.400> I<00:02:46.490> should<00:02:46.700> watching<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.120> video

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
though but I should watching this video
