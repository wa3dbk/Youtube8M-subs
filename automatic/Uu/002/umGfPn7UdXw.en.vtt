00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.740
 very good girls very good guys and I 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.050
 I imply and we are in and bolt the truth is 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.870
 that I am going to tell you the experience 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.580
 playable that I have had with this game 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.589
 you know that recently it was my 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.650
 birthday is a game that can not 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.690
 have it on the day of its release so 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.020
 Thanks to my birthday, I have 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.820
 could have so I 'll tell you what 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.950
 is what I think of what you are 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.040
 watching on screen not of the gameplay that 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.230
 played one of my first games and 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.690
 after playing a few more 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 I can tell you about all of what 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.249
 you will see on screen about the class 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.230
 that I'm using over the mode 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:45.050
 game that is you already know what it is 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.840
 the type of game is hunting four 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.250
 players a monster you have to if you're 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.050
 of those four players you have for 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.059
 hunt the monster and if you are the monster 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.489
 you have to defeat those who love you 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.790
 hunt barbarians basically a four 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:02.320
 for one or a 1 for 4 as you can see 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.290
 well, it's my turn to hank 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.090
 the support class basically and now you 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.090
 I will tell you everything that has to do and what 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.310
 it's the experience of hibble for me and what 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.350
 I think for good let's start 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.159
 let's focus, I think this 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.950
 game already input is designed to 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.590
 be completely cooperative and 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.290
 multiplayer although you also have to 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.140
 add there is one you can play alone no 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.850
 going up or levels not the same 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.300
 way you could do in the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.119
 multiplayer but for me honestly 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.750
 loses the essence for which the blow 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.289
 is created or is a game that is 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.190
 focused to play it multiplayer 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.180
 regarding the class that I'm using 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.259
 there you are seeing hank of support the 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.270
 truth is he has skills 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.050
 specials like this shield gun does not 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.539
 that can help and spy on all the damage 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.300
 that is suffering a person this 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:04.090
 Orbital digital bombing that the truth 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.330
 is that it is a pass is very explosive 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.560
 but that is difficult to aim and this ray 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.750
 cutting that is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.810
 principal to say it somehow and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.099
 the support concealment that is the best 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.060
 tool to make your mates 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.069
 practically invisible so they can 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.400
 flee the area produced from some 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.230
 way of combat and respect to the gameplay 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.519
 Regarding the gameplay, it must be said 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.670
 that the game is very fun is 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.410
 frantic is a game that the truth is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 which is very well implemented always 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.019
 to play cooperatively what is said 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.700
 I previously apologize for repeating 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.440
 but I want to say and I want good 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.680
 point out that the game is thought 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.090
 to play online or multiplayer and that 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:54.819
 if you do not have three more friends you can 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.459
 communicate then the experience of the game 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.739
 I say it goes down a lot because you can 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.599
 play with other people online but not 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.700
 be communicating you and talking to you 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.519
 they go here or do this 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.819
 it happens then the essence is lost not me 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:12.340
 I have not played with anyone yet but 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.040
 I tell you that this game 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.430
 It's worth playing with friends because 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:23.049
 the experience has to be 100 times 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:27.700
 superior to the uar if simply people 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.980
 online the truth is that graphically very 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.470
 well the game is very well done very 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.189
 well recreated the cryengine really 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.319
 Well, it shows that he is very active 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.060
 the graphic engine not that there is a 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.950
 evolution of the graphic engine and that 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.950
 really the game because it looks great 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.660
 the weapons to each other from the different 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.180
 classes are very differentiated each 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:57.040
 class has its function and everyone has 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.210
 one thing to do and play to win if 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.600
 you want to win if you want to get the 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.090
 victory you have to cooperate 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.360
 it seems the game modes so I've 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.610
 been watching they seem too much and 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.890
 I hope that that does not sin is not a part 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.960
 negative of the title although what was said 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.880
 also I tell you how to tell a thing 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.040
 and the truth is that it has cost me 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.070
 pretty find match and it's a 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.080
 pity I hope it's something punctual not 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.570
 that the community of players there 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.730
 I do not think he has abandoned this 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.710
 game unfortunately because it would be a 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.150
 pity because he barely has a few months 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.880
 already and the game because it really is very 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.320
 well then there has been another time that has 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.540
 found items without any type of 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.700
 problems so I do not know if it would be a 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.580
 case in point or really is that the 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.000
 people are already abandoning the game what 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.000
 that would be a shame because really and 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.710
 bolt is a game to cooperate for 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.470
 play with friends to spend an afternoon 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.080
 between tennis and more and that has been my 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.150
 experience of this first game in 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.850
 which in the end we achieved victory 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.560
 defeating the monster and I'm 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.330
 trying to fight and healing my 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.580
 fellow trying to do 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.159
 it has to be done with this class and the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.169
 out is what it is about so 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.510
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.610
 gameplay of what you have seen 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.280
 I hope that I really want to know 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.620
 your impressions especially if you 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.420
 it costs or it costs us to find a game and 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.520
 nothing you already know leave me the comments 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.200
 if you want to see more than in pistÃ© and paul and 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.920
 nothing else see you in the next up 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.040
 the next 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.040
 bye
