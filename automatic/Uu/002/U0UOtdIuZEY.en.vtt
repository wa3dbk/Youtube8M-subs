is<00:00:40.770> interesting<00:00:41.309> because<00:00:41.340> what<00:00:42.120> they<00:00:42.270> did

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
is interesting because what they did

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.510 
is interesting because what they did
here<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.079> take<00:00:43.530> apples<00:00:43.980> peel<00:00:44.280> them

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
here was to take apples peel them

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.450 
here was to take apples peel them
squeeze<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.210> peel<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.960> juice<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.500> see

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
squeeze the peel take the juice and see

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.459 
squeeze the peel take the juice and see
what<00:00:47.670> happens<00:00:48.120> when<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.480> take<00:00:48.660> cancer<00:00:49.079> cells

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
what happens when you take cancer cells

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.290 
what happens when you take cancer cells
in<00:00:49.680> Petri<00:00:49.860> dishes<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.579> expose<00:00:50.879> them<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.090> that

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
in Petri dishes and expose them to that

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
in Petri dishes and expose them to that
juice<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.350> multiply<00:00:52.559> less<00:00:53.070> quickly

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
juice and they multiply less quickly

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.760 
juice and they multiply less quickly
that's<00:00:53.940> pretty<00:00:54.180> interesting<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> human

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that's pretty interesting but the human

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.380 
that's pretty interesting but the human
body<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.219> not<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> petri<00:00:56.789> dish<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.210> not<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
body is not a petri dish it's not a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
body is not a petri dish it's not a
giant<00:00:57.600> test<00:00:57.899> tube<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.710> can't<00:00:59.039> really

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
giant test tube so we can't really

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
giant test tube so we can't really
predict<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.149> happen<00:01:00.210> based<00:01:00.930> on<00:01:01.109> that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
predict what will happen based on that

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.009 
predict what will happen based on that
experiment<00:01:01.730> except<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.850> overall<00:01:03.300> numerous

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
experiment except that overall numerous

studies<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.379> shown<00:01:04.799> benefits<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.909> apples

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
studies have shown benefits from apples

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.710 
studies have shown benefits from apples
on<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.200> other<00:01:07.320> hand<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:08.189> get<00:01:08.369> warnings<00:01:08.909> from

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
on the other hand we get warnings from

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.000 
on the other hand we get warnings from

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
pesticide residues on apples are a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
pesticide residues on apples are a
problem<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.900> should<00:01:19.049> only<00:01:19.200> consume

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
problem and that we should only consume

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.030 
problem and that we should only consume
organic<00:01:20.240> varieties<00:01:21.240> well<00:01:22.200> they<00:01:22.470> make<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> point

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
organic varieties well they make a point

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.499 
organic varieties well they make a point
of<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> fact<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.850> are<00:01:23.909> dozens<00:01:24.360> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
of the fact that there are dozens of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
of the fact that there are dozens of
pesticides<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.320> allowed<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.799> apples<00:01:26.189> which

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
pesticides are allowed on apples which

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
pesticides are allowed on apples which
is<00:01:26.759> true<00:01:27.060> doesn't<00:01:27.720> mean<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.259> are<00:01:28.380> used

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is true doesn't mean that there are used

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
is true doesn't mean that there are used
in<00:01:29.070> fact<00:01:29.310> few<00:01:29.729> are<00:01:29.939> used<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.509> they're<00:01:31.020> very

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
in fact few are used and they're very

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.520 
in fact few are used and they're very
very<00:01:31.500> carefully<00:01:32.189> regulated<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.170> question

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
very carefully regulated so the question

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
very carefully regulated so the question
of<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.680> day<00:01:34.829> is<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> peel<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> Apple<00:01:36.659> or

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
of the day is do you peel the Apple or

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
of the day is do you peel the Apple or
do<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.200> not<00:01:37.409> peel<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.009> Apple<00:01:38.430> studies<00:01:39.240> show

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
do we not peel the Apple studies show

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.660 
do we not peel the Apple studies show
that<00:01:39.509> many<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> nutrients<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.460> speak

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
that many of the nutrients that we speak

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.840 
that many of the nutrients that we speak
so<00:01:41.880> highly<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.210> are<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.110> peel<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.850> the

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so highly of are in the peel and the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.780 
so highly of are in the peel and the
industry<00:01:45.509> when<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:45.840> make<00:01:45.990> applesauce

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
industry when they make applesauce

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.280 
industry when they make applesauce
throws<00:01:47.790> away<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.270> peel<00:01:48.600> apple<00:01:48.930> juice<00:01:49.110> they

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
throws away the peel apple juice they

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840 
throws away the peel apple juice they
throw<00:01:49.500> away<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.799> peel<00:01:50.009> what<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.310> waste

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
throw away the peel what a waste

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.780 
throw away the peel what a waste
wonderful<00:01:51.780> chemicals<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
wonderful chemicals in there so the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.149 
wonderful chemicals in there so the
answer<00:01:54.119> really<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.720> take<00:01:54.930> your<00:01:55.140> Apple<00:01:55.500> wash

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
answer really is to take your Apple wash

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.399 
answer really is to take your Apple wash
it<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:56.670> under<00:01:57.090> running<00:01:57.270> water<00:01:57.420> mostly<00:01:58.259> to

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
it well under running water mostly to

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.410 
it well under running water mostly to
get<00:01:58.560> rid<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.799> bacteria<00:01:59.040> it<00:01:59.820> will<00:02:00.000> also<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.360> rid

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
get rid of bacteria it will also get rid

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.120 
get rid of bacteria it will also get rid
of<00:02:00.630> some<00:02:00.899> surface<00:02:01.259> pesticides<00:02:01.799> although<00:02:02.100> I
