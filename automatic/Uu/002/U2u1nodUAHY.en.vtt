 so on our New Year's table is very 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.739
 a salad called goat would be appropriate 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.860
 in the garden 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.850
 I want to show you my version 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.050
 cooking this dish to us 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.659
 need a couple of boiled potatoes 2 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.439

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:12.130
 finely chopped Chinese cabbage 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.049
 if you take the usual cabbage 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.299
 pre and salt and well 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.310
 mash your hands to knead it became 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.609
 then we still need one in the middle 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.259
 the magnitude of the crude morgue is small 

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.450
 so take two will look at 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.659

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:58.529
 peel potatoes dice it 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:10.160
 I clean the potatoes with the blunt side of the knife 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:12.660
 very uncomfortable so much does not remove 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.750
 somewhere and zinchik that's how here a little bit 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.750

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.350
 same every ingredient we 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:40.400
 lay out separate dishes then 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.400

 ready potato now take beets 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:09.000
 Grate grated need to watch to 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:12.460
 the ingredients were about the same 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.930
 proportions to keep the whole 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.930
 three grated carrots 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:38.770
 I think now enough weight loan 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.770
 straws

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.910
 with 1 com daughter we cut the peel 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.910
 we will need it for decoration 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.040
 whole side peel 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:22.140
 daughters of course would be good to take solid 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.140
 varieties 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.350
 there was a turn of cabbage take 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:50.390
 about as much as we need to think 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:56.910
 I think about my so much probably enough 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:05:02.070
 in finely finely washed cabbage 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.550
 Miller Shred What is this goat in 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.550
 garden 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.500
 from cabbage I took why should threats 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:14.820

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.070

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:25.320
 Goat's favorite dish is cabbage 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.200
 a little bit more so it is loose 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.710
 such in weight and even a little less 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:46.470
 It turns out now we take scientists sausages 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:50.600
 and chop it brittle all the ingredients 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.600
