and<00:01:24.830> now<00:01:25.010> we<00:01:25.070> have<00:01:25.310> air<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.700> little<00:01:25.910> bit<00:01:26.090> coming

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
and now we have air a little bit coming

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.020 
and now we have air a little bit coming
out<00:01:26.450> of<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.600> compressor<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.410> hose<00:01:28.030> if

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
out of the compressor and the hose if

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.360 
out of the compressor and the hose if
you<00:01:29.690> want<00:01:29.930> it<00:01:30.020> full<00:01:30.260> blast<00:01:30.470> just<00:01:31.070> simply

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
you want it full blast just simply

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.370 
you want it full blast just simply
tighten<00:01:31.760> up<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> compressor<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.840> now<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.080> have

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
tighten up the compressor and now I have

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.070 
tighten up the compressor and now I have
more<00:01:33.590> air<00:01:33.830> coming<00:01:34.160> out<00:01:34.370> this<00:01:34.610> end<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.270> less

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
more air coming out this end and less

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.960 
more air coming out this end and less
air<00:01:36.320> coming<00:01:36.560> out<00:01:36.770> or<00:01:37.010> little<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.670> no<00:01:37.790> air

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
air coming out or little to no air

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.570 
air coming out or little to no air
coming<00:01:38.210> out<00:01:38.420> here<00:01:38.690> in<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.620> hose<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.430> will

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
coming out here in the hose you will

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.420 
coming out here in the hose you will
find<00:01:40.850> a<00:01:41.120> hole<00:01:41.480> and<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.560> reason<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.920> has<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.100> hole

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
find a hole and the reason it has a hole

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.020 
find a hole and the reason it has a hole
is<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.060> allow<00:01:44.470> condensation<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:46.070> escape<00:01:46.430> so

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
is to allow condensation to escape so

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.110 
is to allow condensation to escape so
your<00:01:47.660> airbrush<00:01:48.050> is<00:01:48.290> adjustable<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.970> has

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
your airbrush is adjustable it has

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.670 
your airbrush is adjustable it has
rubber<00:01:50.420> feet<00:01:50.660> on<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.870> bottom<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.380> keep<00:01:51.500> it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
rubber feet on the bottom to keep it

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.160 
rubber feet on the bottom to keep it
from<00:01:51.890> bouncing<00:01:52.250> off<00:01:52.780> let's<00:01:53.780> talk<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.050> little

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
from bouncing off let's talk a little

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.740 
from bouncing off let's talk a little
bit<00:01:54.380> about<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.800> airbrush<00:01:55.240> I'm<00:01:56.240> gonna<00:01:56.450> take<00:01:56.660> it

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
bit about the airbrush I'm gonna take it

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.360 
bit about the airbrush I'm gonna take it
apart<00:01:59.500> but<00:02:00.500> what<00:02:00.620> I'm<00:02:00.710> gonna<00:02:00.800> do<00:02:01.010> is<00:02:01.130> I'm<00:02:01.280> going
