00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.759
 Now there is a lot of variety on the market 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.450
 devices for checking paintwork 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.740
 cover the price of their own starts a half 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.120
 thousand rubles 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.050
 Chinese device 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.620
 well and ends 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:22.540
 there is no limit to all except to 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.540
 more or less normal measured instrument 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.340
 3 4 thousand rubles 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.770
 will shows my 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.920
 work very much with such a principle he 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.989
 no other than the thickness of the paint coating 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.719
 that is, it turns out that metal 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.030
 opened eyes like blood amount 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.550
 show the thickness of this coating 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.980
 How do you understand at the factory paint 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.820
 work that is, they put on their 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.190
 certain layer 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.809
 such that the human hand never 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.590
 It might just have something that seems 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.130
 and the device shows very easily 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.200
 the thickness of it is like 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.720
 we again don't need to know which one should 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.420
 be all very amber thickness just 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.030
 the world of the world adjacent parts of different if u 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.990
 You are a great run at least there is a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.990
 50 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.509
 the thickness of the paintwork it means 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.880
 see that some detail is behind these 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.189
 beautiful but you know about looking 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.100
 what parts do you have the same thickness 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.799
 what details fall listened again 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.200
 if not fall in thickness it is not yet 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.179
 the fact that the details were painted because 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.159
 very many bagels on the Internet right now 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.759
 tell me that itâ€™s not here 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.770
 gets under the screen detail they're not 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.689
 tell nuances and details what 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240
 it is possible that the item is just one simple 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.310
 polished ICQ flowed because of this and already 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.959
 less paintwork 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 that is, no big deal about it 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:49.670
 absolutely not here I have this 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.429
 the device name will not speak and so 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.010
 everything is clear it works automatically then 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.660
 eat when 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.920
 pressing on contact with 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.630
 car surface 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.900
 turns on automatically immediately 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.950
 show extinguished colorful coating 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:08.080
 he works like 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.810
 Aluminum and iron as you understand, yes 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.510
 we have a car now to facilitate 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.129
 goats are usually made muzzle wings 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.569
 cable is aluminum made 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.849
 colorless 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.849
 and the rest of the signal part causes 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.810
 have iron as a hang 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 magnetic trades which 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.340
 the river is instruments that measure 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.250
 plastic is a lot of cars now 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.630
 right this already 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.490
 always so would you and so on very 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.430
 different cars 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.970
 live new 5 armor they are even more girls 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.970
 hall 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.600
 Crimea do not go plastic if it does not change 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.810
 it rarely happens to me more precisely in them 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.810
 price 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.280
 see initially we take that if 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.050
 look at the wing and the door and immediately 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:05.330
 you can immediately see that the wing falls out 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.780
 in color from the door and drops out in color from 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.180
 digging today to the field we are showing 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.659
 165 wing 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.359
 128 days to be even more accurate 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.799
 understand need to pass will expire at least in 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:24.269
 three points covered 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.269
 we already have 200 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:37.350
 already 218 built 127,137 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.320
 Well, in general, no more than 140 it says about 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.320
 that the door we have not painted that is 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.640
 factory mousse is just huge 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.780
 accumulated when tested by this device 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.000
 It is advisable to check such neistat to 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.950
 stiffening ribs very sip where we 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.660
 couples because there usually 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.660
 once I miss a bite 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.320
 that i will beat you for 480 4 microns bye 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.990
 This suggests that there is already a notebook 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.990
 lemon or just been here 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.600
 1600 Nikolay 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.600
 again it is not deadly 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.430
 murat 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.430
 here are from 3 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.639
 what loves 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.009
 the device shows that 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.619
 the same rink does not paint us 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.990
 There are still such nuances for example to 

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:49.439
 door paint 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.849
 It happens because they took changed put 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.550
 painted the door 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:57.270
 it happens that if some more 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.699
 seriously hte rie color will pass when and 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.860
 jammed extreme would the depths of the forest 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.589
 burned serious damage connection with 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.409
 and opening the edges we have seasoned succeed 

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:09.979
 offensively come on let me not stop 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.979
 less 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.969
 principle if you look at the doorway you 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:20.779
 whole and some mounted parts choice 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:26.419
 important fish under here yet what again is not 

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:30.240
 the robot will kill us anything of all psychology 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:33.480
 different though the car resold 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.820
 to make money there came 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.620
 secret reason to throw off 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.070
 money that is for the price there are white with 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.140
 seller but not more than that shade the night of 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.500
 unfolds scare is bad 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.500
 a machine
