and<00:03:16.440> therefore<00:03:16.890> we<00:03:17.880> see<00:03:18.090> ourselves<00:03:18.360> operate

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
and therefore we see ourselves operate

their life I am actively involved into

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.040 
their life I am actively involved into
the<00:03:30.010> international<00:03:30.460> flight<00:03:30.820> because<00:03:31.240> this<00:03:31.930> is

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
the international flight because this is

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.470 
the international flight because this is
very<00:03:32.200> important<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:33.520> world<00:03:33.760> scale<00:03:34.210> of

suppose on an African scale where there

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.800 
suppose on an African scale where there
are<00:03:36.970> several<00:03:37.240> issues<00:03:37.570> related<00:03:38.230> to

are several issues related to

are several issues related to

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
economy and I believe that this event is

economy and I believe that this event is
an<00:03:47.760> event<00:03:47.850> that<00:03:48.090> will<00:03:48.180> be<00:03:48.300> key<00:03:48.480> to<00:03:49.440> raise

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
an event that will be key to raise

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.520 
an event that will be key to raise
awareness<00:03:49.890> about<00:03:50.819> the<00:03:51.660> benefits<00:03:52.050> that<00:03:52.140> we<00:03:52.500> can

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
awareness about the benefits that we can

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.900 
awareness about the benefits that we can
have<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.190> can<00:03:53.430> get

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
have you can get

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:18.270 
have you can get
like<00:03:54.450> mysteries

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.260 

I<00:04:19.920> work<00:04:20.920> mainly<00:04:21.160> with<00:04:21.400> like<00:04:22.000> matter

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
I work mainly with like matter

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.720 
I work mainly with like matter
interaction<00:04:22.960> but<00:04:23.830> I'm<00:04:23.950> also<00:04:24.190> really<00:04:24.340> quite

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
interaction but I'm also really quite

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.840 
interaction but I'm also really quite
interested<00:04:25.300> in<00:04:25.389> how<00:04:26.010> scientists<00:04:27.010> use<00:04:27.190> their

different communities not just from
across<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.740> science<00:05:34.100> and<00:05:34.190> engineering<00:05:34.250> world

but also the arts and cultural
communities<00:05:39.800> that<00:05:40.039> we

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
communities that we

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.950 
communities that we
really<00:05:41.740> interact<00:05:42.280> with<00:05:42.520> enough<00:05:42.840> and<00:05:43.840> I'm

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
really interact with enough and I'm

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.990 
really interact with enough and I'm
absolutely<00:05:44.259> convinced<00:05:45.190> that<00:05:45.340> by<00:05:45.550> working

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
absolutely convinced that by working

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.469 
absolutely convinced that by working
together<00:05:46.560> we<00:05:47.560> can<00:05:47.919> get<00:05:48.340> our<00:05:48.580> messages<00:05:49.150> across

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
together we can get our messages across

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.740 
together we can get our messages across
much<00:05:50.199> more<00:05:50.530> isn't

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
much more isn't

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.680 
much more isn't
