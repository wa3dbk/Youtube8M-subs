diagonal playing on the guitar
so<00:00:19.520> today<00:00:19.790> we'll<00:00:20.000> look<00:00:20.180> at<00:00:20.560> how<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.619> connect

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.340 
so today we'll look at how to connect

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.930 
so today we'll look at how to connect

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
positions in fact everyone knows about

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.180 
positions in fact everyone knows about
how<00:00:25.940> to<00:00:26.000> play<00:00:26.270> in<00:00:26.330> positions<00:00:26.900> on<00:00:27.380> the<00:00:27.680> guitar

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:28.190 
how to play in positions on the guitar

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.720 
how to play in positions on the guitar
it's<00:00:28.390> not<00:00:29.390> rocket<00:00:29.630> science<00:00:30.099> that's<00:00:31.099> usually

position<00:00:40.120> two<00:00:41.120> octaves<00:00:46.690> this<00:00:47.690> is<00:00:47.840> very<00:00:48.080> common

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
position two octaves this is very common

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.950 
position two octaves this is very common
it's<00:00:48.980> not<00:00:49.280> always<00:00:49.940> very<00:00:50.120> practical<00:00:50.780> to

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
it's not always very practical to

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.230 
it's not always very practical to
improvise<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:52.070> if<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:52.310> we<00:00:52.640> look<00:00:52.790> at<00:00:52.970> jazz

those<00:01:03.350> guys<00:01:03.530> they<00:01:04.430> used<00:01:05.080> positions<00:01:06.080> in<00:01:06.290> fact

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
those guys they used positions in fact

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.570 
those guys they used positions in fact
and<00:01:06.770> they<00:01:06.979> connected<00:01:07.460> them<00:01:07.610> in<00:01:07.939> a<00:01:08.060> certain<00:01:08.390> way

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
and they connected them in a certain way

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140 
and they connected them in a certain way
if<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:12.049> use<00:01:12.310> fingers<00:01:13.310> on<00:01:13.610> the<00:01:13.729> first<00:01:13.970> three

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
if you use fingers on the first three

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.709 
if you use fingers on the first three
note<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.570> scale<00:01:14.659> like<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:16.570> would<00:01:17.570> be

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:17.719 
note of the scale like this would be

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.870 
note of the scale like this would be
very<00:01:17.960> logical<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.829> repeat<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.369> same<00:01:19.579> three

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
very logical to repeat the same three

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.800 
very logical to repeat the same three
notes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
notes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.859 
notes
add<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> other<00:01:22.740> octave<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.479> use<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> fingering

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
add the other octave so use a fingering

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.029 
add the other octave so use a fingering
such<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:30.180> four<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:34.039> what

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
such as this one two four and what

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.160 
such as this one two four and what
happens<00:01:35.399> when<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.030> reach<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.570> seventh<00:01:36.960> note

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
happens when you reach the seventh note

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.310 
happens when you reach the seventh note
of<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.740> scale<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:38.280> slide<00:01:38.729> your<00:01:38.970> index<00:01:39.570> one

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of the scale you slide your index one

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.639 
of the scale you slide your index one
fret<00:01:43.880> then<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.320> exact

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
fret then you do it again it's the exact

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
fret then you do it again it's the exact
same<00:01:46.679> fingering<00:01:49.399> and<00:01:50.399> again<00:01:53.030> here<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> have

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
same fingering and again here you have

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.080 
same fingering and again here you have
to<00:01:54.420> shift<00:01:55.049> but<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.069> always<00:01:56.220> organize

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
to shift but you can always organize

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.169 
to shift but you can always organize
your<00:01:57.659> scales<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.409> videos<00:01:59.039> and<00:01:59.369> your<00:01:59.880> playing

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
your scales your videos and your playing

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.520 
your scales your videos and your playing
in<00:02:00.899> such<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> way<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.750> shift

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
in such a way that you can have a shift

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.009 
in such a way that you can have a shift
by<00:02:04.799> half-step<00:02:05.340> somewhere<00:02:05.729> such<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:10.640> and

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
by half-step somewhere such as this and

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:25.550 
by half-step somewhere such as this and
even<00:02:13.019> here<00:02:14.569> pinky<00:02:15.569> slide

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:34.200 

you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.360 

it's<00:02:35.210> very<00:02:35.390> useful<00:02:36.020> because<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:37.040> can<00:02:37.220> be

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
it's very useful because you can be

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.180 
it's very useful because you can be
playing<00:02:37.610> scales<00:02:38.360> for<00:02:38.750> full<00:02:39.320> three<00:02:39.770> octaves

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
playing scales for full three octaves

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.300 
playing scales for full three octaves
without<00:02:41.150> having<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.720> deal<00:02:41.930> with<00:02:41.960> a<00:02:42.770> thousand

without having to deal with a thousand
positions<00:02:43.660> in<00:02:44.660> fact<00:02:44.960> you're<00:02:45.590> only<00:02:45.620> connecting

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
positions in fact you're only connecting

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.450 
positions in fact you're only connecting
positions<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.300> after<00:02:47.600> another<00:02:47.630> so<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:49.310> can

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
positions one after another so you can

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.710 
positions one after another so you can
