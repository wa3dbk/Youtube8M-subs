00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.690
 They are the best twelve girls 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.430
 basketball vintage 2000 she 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.239
 could the national coach of themselves 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.330
 to convince 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.070
 but no matter if nominated or not 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.380
 whole weekend not only has a lot 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 shown talent but just has fun 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:58.860
 made especially for the offspring 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.440
 basketball women was the level extremely 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.050
 high and there were really some 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.759
 promising talents doing this 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 Of course, it is now correct 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.580
 promote 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.450
 because to find a young hope 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.869
 that is one thing 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.130
 making her more of her another 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.899
 believes there is a lot that we do that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.399
 talent what we have and what we have 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.350
 since years actually with this 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.479
 show that we are 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 can take care of what we have together 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.560
 work and that we finally get together 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 successful associations and umbrella organization succeeds 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.580
 to get on and say 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.590
 we have a great list of entries here 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.880
 years 2000 and we all pack 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.220
 spend their time and the best 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 from then i think this one is with 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.260
 a great future if we have something 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.000
 create 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.840
 if we do not succeed and everyone is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 zeugs carried on 48 girls had themselves 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.110
 for the finale on the weekend 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.580
 qualified here had the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.590
 nationwide coach the best of the best 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.570
 look for them for the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.299
 perspective cadre to nominate 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.350
 who have made it the means it 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.350
 pure motivation 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.609
 to be angelus and 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.930
 All are well on the way 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.819
 participated in the finals 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.100
 because even if not nominated now 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.110
 of course, his career could still be 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.959
 doing so many a seasoned 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.540
 national player has only 15 or 16 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.980
 made his big jump but where 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.100
 because then lies the difference between the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.450
 girls and the guys very general 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.980
 Of course we are one year older here 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.690
 female area, therefore, I believe 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.510
 that playfully a little earlier 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.360
 more developed I think in total 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.970
 that is that the sport has a lot in common 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.330
 male and female but that 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.530
 playful the interaction that the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.360
 team tactics slightly larger 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.950
 had significant in the female section 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.220
 the individual and the athletics 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.230
 simply both are attractive 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.900
 and mine are just too great 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.390
 Sport also for the guys all out 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.760
 the year 2001 was about 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.220
 there was a lot here for every team 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.450
 which lives after the prequalification 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.989
 was rolled together 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.860
 three games on this weekend 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.780
 they were all nervous 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.220
 who does not come every day of the gentleman 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.220
 national coach during the game over 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.410
 So then if you fit a lot 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.210
 the different physical 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.100
 Development was with the boys again 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.990
 bigger and accordingly it is 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.980
 Of course even heavier the best 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.980
 to filter out twelve 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.470
 that's really interesting we are now 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.420
 some are even more cordial 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.220
 if now eight years at this 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.220
 sighting now to the 74 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.630
 and it will be interesting to pursue 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.930
 which of the players we are preparing for 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.560
 seven years face 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.689
 then with video games region and so on 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.840
 is very difficult but there are many 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.530
 Rating criteria as we know them 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.319
 we look 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.030
 but the top 3 45 when all out but 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.120
 then quickly again 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.799
 many of these 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.110
 important for the assessment as 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.080
 trainers and some talk 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.580
 years 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.299
 now only 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.069
 just the a little bit bigger 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.860
 expectant muscular not so soon 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.609
 as you can not so in me 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.959
 set the scene and take that into account 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.940
 of course, the young talents are still 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.750
 far from being used in 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.000
 the bundesliga 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.680
 but they bring the important ones 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.110
 conditions for a possible 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.030
 Career with and also the trainer on 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.100
 Of course, weekend is trying in the 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.570
 short time their basketball players still 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.889
 continue to train so the advantage 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.690
 The one at the place one has through 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.250
 two tournaments already the possibility 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.340
 had to see a few of the guys 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.770
 and to have the Schulaktion 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.789
 Of course it is different than if 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.870
 you as to particular associations or 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.840
 team coach a bit longer 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.550
 but you can already do it 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 a few strength the children 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.479
 find and see and have worked out 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.889
 also at the work and hold also the 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.750
 Find two little things where you can 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.780
 have to say the things yet 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:10.370
 continue to work and on the spot 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:11.930
 that is already at the end were the 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.720
 Just nominated happy and happy 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.830
 to be there and ever have one 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.930
 first step in the direction 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.300
 National team have made 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.760
 everyone else should look through the 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.160
 not nominate motivate even more 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.810
 work out 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.730
 All had talent on the weekend before 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.580
 the band trainers are allowed to play 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.820
 And everyone has fun as well 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.820
 made
