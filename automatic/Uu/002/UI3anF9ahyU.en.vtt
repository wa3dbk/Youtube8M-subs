right<00:00:11.370> here<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.030> transmitter<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:13.580> this

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
right here is the transmitter and this

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.080 
right here is the transmitter and this
is<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:15.929> receivers<00:00:16.230> on<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.190> Canon<00:00:17.609> 430

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
is one of the receivers on a Canon 430

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
is one of the receivers on a Canon 430
ex2<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:20.779> this<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.170> another<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.680> the

ex2 and this is another one of the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.839 
ex2 and this is another one of the
receivers<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:23.910> Canon<00:00:24.510> of<00:00:24.630> 580<00:00:25.170> ex2<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.490> just

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
receivers on a Canon of 580 ex2 now just

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.150 
receivers on a Canon of 580 ex2 now just
to<00:00:26.939> clarify<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.960> are<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.170> same<00:00:28.439> receivers

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
to clarify there are the same receivers

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.790 
to clarify there are the same receivers
but<00:00:29.970> they're<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.630> different<00:00:30.810> excuse<00:00:31.650> me

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
but they're just on different excuse me

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.610 
but they're just on different excuse me
different<00:00:32.730> flashes<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> show<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.350> guys

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
different flashes just to show you guys

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.670 
different flashes just to show you guys
a<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.989> how<00:00:36.989> versatile<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.649> are

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
a little bit of how versatile they are

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.479 
a little bit of how versatile they are
so<00:00:38.550> let's<00:00:38.700> take<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.910> closer<00:00:39.239> look<00:00:39.390> at<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
so let's take a closer look at the

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.490 
so let's take a closer look at the
transmitter<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:42.780> transmitter<00:00:43.230> for<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
transmitter the transmitter for the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.720 
transmitter the transmitter for the
camera<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.010> actually<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:45.230> it's<00:00:46.230> built<00:00:46.730> okay

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
camera is actually very it's built okay

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.540 
camera is actually very it's built okay
I<00:00:47.760> mean<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> squeeze<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.980> feels<00:00:50.250> like

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I mean when you squeeze it it feels like

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
I mean when you squeeze it it feels like
there's<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.059> little<00:00:51.360> bit<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> air<00:00:52.110> inside<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
there's a little bit of air inside but

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.639 
there's a little bit of air inside but
it's<00:00:53.340> okay<00:00:53.579> for<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.820> most<00:00:54.000> part<00:00:54.300> here's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> USB

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
it's okay for the most part here's a USB

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.680 
it's okay for the most part here's a USB
interface<00:00:55.920> cable<00:00:56.610> where<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.239> update<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
interface cable where you can update the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.650 
interface cable where you can update the
firmware<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.789> it<00:00:59.789> screws<00:01:00.090> onto<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.449> camera

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
firmware and it screws onto your camera

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.990 
firmware and it screws onto your camera
like<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.829> walk<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.340> way<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.609> want

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
like this you walk that way you want

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.830 
like this you walk that way you want
walk<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:03.390> way

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
walk that way

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.770 
walk that way
and<00:01:04.909> here's<00:01:05.909> where<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.479> batteries

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
and here's where you put the batteries

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.530 
and here's where you put the batteries
in

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
in

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.140 
in
now<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> whole<00:01:11.790> bunch<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.060> different

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
now you have a whole bunch of different

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.000 
now you have a whole bunch of different
buttons<00:01:12.479> here<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.560> how<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.710> turn

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
buttons here but this is how you turn

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640 
buttons here but this is how you turn
the<00:01:14.220> little<00:01:14.820> unit<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:16.140> hold<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.470> down

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the little unit on you hold this down

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.960 
the little unit on you hold this down
for<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.890> bit<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> then<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.270> comes<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.430> now<00:01:20.430> I

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for a bit and then it comes on and now I

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.380 
for a bit and then it comes on and now I
want<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.799> let's<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:22.979> everything<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.060> on<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
want to let's say everything is on the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.940 
want to let's say everything is on the
channel<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.950> flashes<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
channel a with my flashes and I want to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.609 
channel a with my flashes and I want to
probably<00:01:28.950> boost<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> TTL<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.290> so

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
probably boost the TTL a little bit so

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.719 
probably boost the TTL a little bit so
I'm<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.350> say<00:01:34.350> select<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.430> going<00:01:35.700> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
I'm going to say select and I'm going to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
I'm going to say select and I'm going to
go<00:01:36.560> plus<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> three<00:01:38.729> stops<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:40.049> turn

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
go plus up to three stops or I can turn

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.520 
go plus up to three stops or I can turn
it<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.670> all<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> three<00:01:42.540> negative

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
it down all the way to three negative

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.010 
it down all the way to three negative
three<00:01:43.560> stops<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.420> hold<00:01:45.600> the
