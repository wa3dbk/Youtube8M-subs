00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.750
 if there is any question on household appliances we go with a piece of paper in 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 the nearest store and we are trying to get the answers we need so once I 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.929
 ask the sales assistant what the difference is hdmi from divas without thinking twice 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 answers simply 9 is obsolete today few people use such cables 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.760
 But hdmi is already a new generation, it is clear that 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.380
 nothing is clear, I perfectly saw that the diva is still completing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.360
 a large number of computers but hdmi is increasingly common in fact 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 the difference of 2 interfaces is obvious if you decrypt the abbreviation everything rises to 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.379
 In short, hdmi transmits the video signal and the sound of the dress transmits 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 only the video as for the quality of the picture is really no difference 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 here the screen already plays an important role, which displays the image dimensions 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.539
 hdmi where more compact this interface does not need a special mount that's why 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.800
 It is also used in mobile electronics, but here is where the dimension is not and without 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.479
 mount here has not done there is still a bandwidth difference 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.040
 hdmi is 3 times higher than surprise a standard hdmi cable can easily 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.869
 reach a length of 15 meters as for 9 here you can use the cable length 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.310
 only up to 10 meters there are two versions of hdmi cables 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.430
 13 and 14 so to speak old and new hdmi 1 and 4 it is already later 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.710
 say evolutionary version supports ultra-high resolution video 2k and 4k a 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.460
 here hdmi 1 and 3 only support full hd resolution 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.189
 And version 14 can work with a 3d image format. There is a nuance for 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.640
 Ensure greater device compatibility through cable 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.890
 hdmi for example if you are going to watch 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.060
 movies with blu-ray discs in 3d doubled resolution also play in 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 double-resolution games to watch side-by-side TV 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.659
 1080p or top and bottom mode 725, then even more 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.180
 upgraded hdmi cable marked 14th 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.590
 digging deeper it turns out that there are several types of hdmi connectors that 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.540
 differ in size when using a portable device whether 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.070
 then a smartphone tablet and even a photo-video camera, then the hdmi connector is used 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.440
 reduced format with a mini or micro prefix is ​​actually a topic of difference 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.240
 hdmi separating is not at all difficult enough for the minimal knowledge invested in our 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.080
 video to understand the nuances and then the purchase will really 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.530
 successful
