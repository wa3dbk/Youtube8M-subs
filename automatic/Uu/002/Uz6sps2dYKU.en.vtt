00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
horizontal with the floor so I'm not

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.009 
horizontal with the floor so I'm not
going<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.879> drop<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.300> here<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.840> going<00:01:03.960> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
not a very large range of motion as you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.630 
not a very large range of motion as you
can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.770> want<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:17.009> do<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> put

your hand on your pelvis to make sure
the<00:01:20.460> pelvis<00:01:20.700> isn't<00:01:21.180> moving<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.229> oftentimes

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
the pelvis isn't moving so oftentimes

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.010 
the pelvis isn't moving so oftentimes
what<00:01:24.570> I'll<00:01:24.960> see<00:01:25.170> see<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.580> clients<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.600> come

what I'll see see see clients do is come

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.690 
what I'll see see see clients do is come
up<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.350> they<00:01:29.070> want<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.340> go<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.520> bit

up and they want to go a little bit
further<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> they'll<00:01:30.869> actually<00:01:30.990> hike<00:01:31.409> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
further and they'll actually hike the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.090 
further and they'll actually hike the
pelvis<00:01:31.950> up<00:01:32.130> towards<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> ribcage<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.290> that's

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
pelvis up towards the ribcage and that's

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.679 
pelvis up towards the ribcage and that's
actually<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.850> what<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.150> want<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.540> we<00:01:36.659> want

actually not what we want to do we want

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.350 
actually not what we want to do we want
to<00:01:36.869> keep<00:01:37.079> all<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.380> motion<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.860> hip<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:39.299> go

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
to keep all the motion the hip so you go

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.789 
to keep all the motion the hip so you go
ahead<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.600> put<00:01:39.780> your<00:01:39.930> hand<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.320> pelvis

ahead and put your hand in your pelvis

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
ahead and put your hand in your pelvis
just<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.220> sure<00:01:41.250> it's<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.670> moving<00:01:42.170> keep

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
just to make sure it's not moving keep

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.139 
just to make sure it's not moving keep
all<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> motion<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.579> hip<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:44.970> I'm<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
all the motion in the hip so I'm not

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
all the motion in the hip so I'm not
going<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.390> come<00:01:45.540> up<00:01:45.659> very<00:01:45.810> far<00:01:46.110> again<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.189> pretty

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
going to come up very far again a pretty

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.090 
going to come up very far again a pretty
small<00:01:47.970> range<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.360> motion<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.920> can

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
small range of motion and you can

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.749 
small range of motion and you can
continue<00:01:50.810> continue<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.079> exercise<00:01:52.759> until

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
continue continue this exercise until

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.590 
continue continue this exercise until
the<00:01:54.060> muscle<00:01:54.360> fatigue<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.700> certainly<00:01:57.860> in<00:01:59.600> 25
