00:03:43.240 --> 00:04:03.310
 corner is a camera 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:06.840
 it is a camera with fingers then 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 again so liquid 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.880
 as a team we have a lot 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:50.060
 By these customs the bond pretty much 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:56.690
 Limited is not able to afford you one 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:05:05.600
