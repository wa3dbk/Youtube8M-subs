00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.350

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.800
 just put in the description as 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 you want to see it and today I have the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.170
 starbucks is always caramel mocha latté 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.970
 and I don't think it will get in 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 Netherlands sold but correct 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 if you 've already seen it 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.450
 but in principle this is bad here 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.399
 popular in america and there is salt and 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.469
 caramel combined and that is real 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 super tasty well what do you need for 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.789
 this starbucks drink is of course something 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.200
 coffee is the best thing about being very strong 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.090
 make coffee 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 you need sugar cocoa powder 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.829
 caramel sauce I have business coach here 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 dress and in principle times just as well 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.750
 use caramel sauce and this one a little 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.530
 more fluid further baby nice salt 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 needed and whipped cream of course 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.030
 to finish it all and milk it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.470
 I will start immediately with the milk 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.380
 well here i already have the coffee 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.159
 and what I'm going to start with is one 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.350
 tablespoon sugar it is just a 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.759
 so in that power also do less so one 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.380
 little to taste 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.220
 city ​​goes in then I put a tablespoon 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 cocoa powder 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:50.090
 so and i do this 2 scoops of the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:52.320
 caramel sauce in that one is about two 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 so and this you all go 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.540
 mix so that it's a good one 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.049
 liquid mass is without all 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.049
 lumps 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.420
 coffin all the ingredients I have now 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.560
 all mixed together and she is 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 just a liquid good for your sins 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.220
 otherwise lumps of sugar and the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.290
 cocoa powder and then we continue with 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.720
 the milk well I have some milk downstairs 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.150
 warmed up on the fire because yes a latte 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.709
 is of course not a latté without milk 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.720
 so the milk is now hot and i have it here 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.230
 such a handy on button machine of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.400
 ado road surface douwe egberts that is the euro 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.900
 and latte 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.880
 and then I go along with the milk 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.140
 on knocking it will be a little more fluffy and 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.140
 becomes creamy and fluffy 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.440
 ok now it's time to mix with the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.840
 coffee and milk go together 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.400
 pour into the cup from which you want to go 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.720
 drink yes I have just a moment 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.220
 weeks that I just love the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 got starks from because of that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.100
 is just really really nice and me 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.110
 fortunately not handy 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.240
 spouts or this small bowl 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:12.360
 sit so I pour the whole mixture 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:16.010
 in and there I will pour the milk and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.010
 of course also nice to foam 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.450
 there just completely until he 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.010
 heaven is full 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.010
 well how it goes on with a spoon 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.950
 and then it's time to finish 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:37.200
 with the whipped cream 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:38.940
 They inject a beautiful stamp out 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.580
 help do perfectly as with starbucks 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.110
 they time the caramel sauce again there 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.630
 to pick it up and you go there so yummy 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.060
 do it over as much as you do yourself 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.030
 and then I would not be ready because 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.490
 then it's the turn of the salt 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.070
 and with that we go a bit on the 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.320
 sprinkle the top and seriously 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.840
 maybe you think salt and caramel and 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:05.520
 just get terrible but i'll tell you 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.330
 it is really delicious and you have to 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.330
 really give it a try 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.530
