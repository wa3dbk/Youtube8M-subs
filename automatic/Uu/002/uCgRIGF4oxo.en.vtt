00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.529

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.039
 this is the tax and a gentleman skin of reboxer then c 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.300
 alain perrin beatty but then we come in the very very very very 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.349
 along the basket 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.099
 working already is all that does not spoil anything and then especially do not talk 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.460
 pretty likely oldham and say they want to see brief on the market at 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.060
 the current time 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.920
 which explains its prohibitive price but 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.240
 I wanted him to live to say more but it's really bluffing 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.390
 you will see on this video that was made without vote rigging 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 marchal hide behind anything 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.680
 that's why turning into typhoon 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.190
 like that who is not afraid of anything 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 the kind of debt continue 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.290
 incidentally com beyond this simple use 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.530
 right volume of veto so far 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 the apprentice switch 2 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.670
 the post of the passes 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730
 which is rather nice French 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.220
 nature 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 and then for its doors proposals every year the exhaustible character 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.520
 as for the fish marchal in the middle that boosts tehran bafa are weak 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.830
 69 years 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.730
 - this country 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.870
 and then that's it 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.230
 the blue tongue 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.230
 to point out that this is one of the small tactics for the rest 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.790
 we make you listen to basic 25% 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.640
 mm merkel 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.210
 mother's day mr 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.440
 what you think you 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.810
 and then hop on board the city 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 it's clear 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.150
 thank you 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.540
 haberdasher 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.720
 nothing 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 but 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.419
 May 11 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.419
 there 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.899
 you listen now 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:24.899
 the same thing without a win 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 karim 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.919
 no 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.579
 because she 

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:48.339
 we can see margins if it's false 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.429
 the program is still wide enough we talk about his life 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:59.369
 for its part even dialogue for that godfather 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.779
 shit then 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.019
 Ah yes 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.219
 go to the arena 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.309
 ml 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.069
 we were unable to conclude 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.949
 a superb finish 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:17.919
 each month 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.069
 a respect for the pressure bill or even at levels well like that 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.659
 obviously all the variations 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.659
 dynamics on the part 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.369
 for sure 

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:32.749
 but the paris floor 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:36.989
 let's go my dad and my 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.279
