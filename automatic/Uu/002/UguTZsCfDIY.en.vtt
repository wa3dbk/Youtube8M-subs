00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
him and work with him I guess and I

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
guess that pissed off Floyd and now it

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.750 
guess that pissed off Floyd and now it
looks<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.900> he'll<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.140> letting<00:02:34.530> go<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
he'll be replacing him with I mean you

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.780

after his one-year contract is done with

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.500 
after his one-year contract is done with
CBS<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.340> Showtime<00:04:32.700> because<00:04:32.970> he<00:04:33.060> only<00:04:33.240> has

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
CBS and Showtime because he only has

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.350 
CBS and Showtime because he only has
on<00:04:33.570> your<00:04:33.690> left<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:34.080> fights<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:35.030> him<00:04:36.030> signing

and Alex Ariza signing a two-year
contract<00:04:38.610> makes<00:04:39.180> me<00:04:39.360> wonder<00:04:39.620> there's

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
contract makes me wonder there's

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.230 
contract makes me wonder there's
probably<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.010> good<00:04:41.130> chance<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.700> flow<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.090> will

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
probably a good chance the flow and will

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.810 
probably a good chance the flow and will
continue<00:04:42.570> boxing<00:04:43.260> or<00:04:43.500> fighting<00:04:43.860> after<00:04:44.370> his

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
continue boxing or fighting after his

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.070 
continue boxing or fighting after his
contract<00:04:45.390> is<00:04:45.540> done<00:04:45.690> with<00:04:45.840> Showtime<00:04:46.260> and<00:04:48.080> yeah

contract is done with Showtime and yeah

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.180 
contract is done with Showtime and yeah
very<00:04:49.320> very<00:04:49.490> very<00:04:50.490> bizarre<00:04:50.760> moves<00:04:51.390> by<00:04:51.690> Floyd<00:04:52.190> I

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
very very very bizarre moves by Floyd I

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.300 
very very very bizarre moves by Floyd I
mean<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.150> mean<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:55.140> would<00:04:55.830> think<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:56.130> he

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
mean I mean you would think that he

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.040 
mean I mean you would think that he
would<00:04:56.460> never<00:04:56.670> change<00:04:57.030> his<00:04:57.270> team<00:04:57.480> because<00:04:57.840> it's

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
would never change his team because it's

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.350 
would never change his team because it's
a<00:04:58.170> working<00:04:58.560> formula<00:04:59.190> at<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.460> moment<00:04:59.880> I<00:04:59.970> mean

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
a working formula at the moment I mean

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.090 
a working formula at the moment I mean
he's<00:05:00.480> currently<00:05:00.840> undefeated<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.440> mean<00:05:01.710> he<00:05:01.800> just

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
he's currently undefeated I mean he just

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.510 
he's currently undefeated I mean he just
improved<00:05:02.700> to<00:05:02.820> sub<00:05:03.030> 47<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.720> oh<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.340> he's<00:05:05.340> been

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
improved to sub 47 and oh and he's been

on<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.730> finish<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.090> entire<00:05:06.330> career<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.020> if

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
on the finish the entire career and if

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.790 
on the finish the entire career and if
the<00:05:07.980> formula<00:05:08.400> has<00:05:08.490> worked<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.750> past<00:05:10.110> decade

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
the formula has worked this past decade

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.310 
the formula has worked this past decade
pretty<00:05:11.280> much<00:05:11.490> with<00:05:12.420> Al<00:05:12.630> Heyman<00:05:13.170> and

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
pretty much with Al Heyman and

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.140 
pretty much with Al Heyman and
everything<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:14.460> looks<00:05:14.610> like<00:05:14.760> he's<00:05:14.910> skipping

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
everything it looks like he's skipping

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.280 
everything it looks like he's skipping
on<00:05:15.390> him<00:05:15.570> and<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.780> mentioned<00:05:16.140> in<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.230> previous

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:16.290 
on him and I mentioned in a previous

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:17.870 
on him and I mentioned in a previous
video<00:05:16.740> it<00:05:16.980> looks<00:05:17.130> like<00:05:17.280> he's<00:05:17.400> not<00:05:17.580> letting<00:05:17.850> go

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
video it looks like he's not letting go

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.820 
video it looks like he's not letting go
of<00:05:18.000> all<00:05:18.180> him<00:05:18.420> and<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:18.960> looks<00:05:19.110> like<00:05:19.230> all<00:05:19.380> him<00:05:19.710> and

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
of all him and it looks like all him and

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.440 
of all him and it looks like all him and
his<00:05:19.920> his<00:05:20.070> main<00:05:20.340> guy<00:05:20.580> that<00:05:20.820> he<00:05:20.940> wants<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.270> keep

his his main guy that he wants to keep
and<00:05:23.390> yeah<00:05:24.390> look<00:05:24.570> it's<00:05:25.350> just<00:05:25.560> kind<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.800> hard<00:05:26.100> to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
and yeah look it's just kind of hard to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.700 
and yeah look it's just kind of hard to
believe<00:05:27.210> that<00:05:27.390> he's<00:05:27.540> changing<00:05:28.080> all<00:05:28.290> these

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
believe that he's changing all these

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.970 
believe that he's changing all these
members<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.370> his<00:05:29.490> team<00:05:30.380> after<00:05:31.380> the<00:05:31.530> success

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
he's had in his career I mean it's not

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.380
