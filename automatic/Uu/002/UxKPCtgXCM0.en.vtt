00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.409 

here<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.589> have<00:00:01.709> a<00:00:02.159> serial<00:00:02.760> transmitter<00:00:03.240> and

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
here I have a serial transmitter and

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.070 
here I have a serial transmitter and
receiver<00:00:03.689> these<00:00:04.589> are<00:00:04.740> both<00:00:04.859> receivers<00:00:05.370> and

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 
receiver these are both receivers and

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.470 
receiver these are both receivers and
down<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.319> I<00:00:07.350> have<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:07.620> transmitter<00:00:08.120> the<00:00:09.120> idea

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
down here I have a transmitter the idea

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.799 
down here I have a transmitter the idea
is<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:10.230> have<00:00:11.010> these<00:00:11.460> levers<00:00:11.820> which<00:00:12.240> serve

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
is that I have these levers which serve

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
is that I have these levers which serve
as<00:00:12.840> inputs<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:14.900> these<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.529> series<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
as inputs and these the series of and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.790 
as inputs and these the series of and
gates<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.730> repeaters<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.500> this<00:00:19.500> pulse

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
gates and repeaters and this pulse

oops

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.519 

they<00:00:26.039> transmit<00:00:26.750> the<00:00:27.750> state<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.079> each<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.470> these

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
they transmit the state of each of these

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.710 
they transmit the state of each of these
levers<00:00:28.849> over<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> single<00:00:30.150> piece<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.419> redstone

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
levers over a single piece of redstone

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.330 
levers over a single piece of redstone
in<00:00:31.199> sequence<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:33.620> for<00:00:34.620> instance<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.070> first

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
in sequence so for instance if the first

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.630 
in sequence so for instance if the first
bit<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.870> strip<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.350> off<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:38.460> line

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
bit is on the strip it is off the line

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.590 
bit is on the strip it is off the line
with<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.620> serial<00:00:40.620> line<00:00:40.800> would<00:00:40.949> be<00:00:40.980> off<00:00:41.600> then

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
with the serial line would be off then

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.740 
with the serial line would be off then
it<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.900> on<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.440> on<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.120> off<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it would be on and on and on and off and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.000 
it would be on and on and on and off and
off<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.220> i<00:00:48.320> start<00:00:49.320> each<00:00:49.440> transmission

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
off and so on i start each transmission

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.840 
off and so on i start each transmission
with<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.820> pulse<00:00:51.720> where<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:53.220> redstone<00:00:53.640> line

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
with a pulse where the redstone line

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.750 
with a pulse where the redstone line
goes<00:00:54.089> on<00:00:54.239> for<00:00:54.690> three<00:00:55.079> tix<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:56.370> tells<00:00:56.609> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
goes on for three tix and that tells the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.639 
goes on for three tix and that tells the
receiver<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> start<00:00:57.539> listening<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:59.609> then

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
receiver to start listening and then

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
receiver to start listening and then
spaced<00:01:01.649> three<00:01:02.219> ticks<00:01:02.460> every<00:01:02.910> three<00:01:03.089> tix<00:01:03.329> is

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
spaced three ticks every three tix is

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.820 
spaced three ticks every three tix is
one<00:01:04.229> bit<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.110> sequence<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.590> would<00:01:07.710> be

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
one bit so for this sequence it would be

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.279 
one bit so for this sequence it would be
three<00:01:08.130> takes<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.550> for<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> start<00:01:09.330> three<00:01:10.080> ticks

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
three takes on for the start three ticks

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:13.310 
three takes on for the start three ticks
off<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:11.369> ticks<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.899> another<00:01:12.899> three<00:01:13.110> ticks

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
off three ticks on another three ticks

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.279 
off three ticks on another three ticks
on<00:01:13.640> another<00:01:14.640> three<00:01:14.850> ticks<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.179> three<00:01:16.050> ticks

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
on another three ticks on three ticks

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:23.430 
on another three ticks on three ticks
off<00:01:16.440> three<00:01:16.860> ticks<00:01:17.039> off<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.759> on

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.470 

this<00:01:24.440> pulse<00:01:24.710> generator<00:01:25.160> generates<00:01:25.880> a<00:01:26.240> short

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
this pulse generator generates a short

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.750 
this pulse generator generates a short
pulse<00:01:26.750> which<00:01:27.200> is<00:01:27.350> expanded<00:01:27.920> to<00:01:28.190> three<00:01:28.220> tix

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
pulse which is expanded to three tix

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.140 
pulse which is expanded to three tix
here<00:01:29.120> and<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:31.310> delay<00:01:31.610> is<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:32.060> to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
here and this delay is just to

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.930 
here and this delay is just to
synchronize<00:01:32.600> things<00:01:32.900> and<00:01:35.230> each<00:01:36.230> of<00:01:36.500> these

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
synchronize things and each of these

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.040 
synchronize things and each of these
torches<00:01:38.080> turns<00:01:39.080> off<00:01:39.350> in<00:01:39.620> sequence<00:01:40.100> as<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
torches turns off in sequence as as the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.680 
torches turns off in sequence as as the
pulse<00:01:42.290> passes<00:01:42.770> through<00:01:43.430> each<00:01:43.550> for<00:01:43.729> Peter<00:01:43.910> so

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
pulse passes through each for Peter so

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.150 
pulse passes through each for Peter so
there's<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.110> repeater<00:01:45.440> separating<00:01:45.950> each<00:01:46.010> of

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
there's a repeater separating each of

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.090 
there's a repeater separating each of
these<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.460> gates<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.710> depending<00:01:48.710> on<00:01:48.830> whether

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
these and gates and depending on whether

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.700 
these and gates and depending on whether
the<00:01:49.810> input<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.900> this<00:01:51.080> side<00:01:51.320> is<00:01:51.800> on<00:01:53.410> when<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
the input on this side is on when the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.820 
the input on this side is on when the
pulse<00:01:55.310> signal<00:01:55.700> reaches<00:01:56.119> that<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.869> gate<00:01:57.080> it'll

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
pulse signal reaches that and gate it'll

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.940 
pulse signal reaches that and gate it'll
turn<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.460> output<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.590> will<00:02:00.710> power

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
turn the output on and that will power

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.900 
turn the output on and that will power
the<00:02:01.009> Redstone<00:02:01.490> below<00:02:02.080> which<00:02:03.460> provides<00:02:04.460> the

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.740 

right<00:02:08.590> here<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:08.830> have<00:02:09.069> I<00:02:09.640> do<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.330> eight<00:02:10.509> bits

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
right here I have I do have eight bits

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.680 
right here I have I do have eight bits
here<00:02:11.220> I'm<00:02:12.220> only<00:02:12.400> using<00:02:12.640> seven<00:02:13.150> right<00:02:13.300> now<00:02:13.450> I

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
here I'm only using seven right now I

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.930 
here I'm only using seven right now I
have<00:02:14.200> had<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.500> working<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:14.890> eight<00:02:15.100> but<00:02:15.490> it's

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
have had it working with eight but it's

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.030 
have had it working with eight but it's
kind<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.300> pain<00:02:16.330> because<00:02:16.780> of<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.410> 15<00:02:17.800> block

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
kind of a pain because of the 15 block

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.820 
kind of a pain because of the 15 block
limit<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.610> transmitting<00:02:19.440> redstone<00:02:20.440> signals

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
limit for transmitting redstone signals

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.030 
limit for transmitting redstone signals
so<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.459> have<00:02:21.610> with<00:02:21.970> her<00:02:22.350> with<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.560> eight<00:02:23.770> blocks

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
so I have with her with the eight blocks

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.500 
so I have with her with the eight blocks
rescue<00:02:24.790> me<00:02:24.880> with<00:02:25.000> eight<00:02:25.120> bits<00:02:25.360> take<00:02:26.080> 16<00:02:26.470> blocks

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
rescue me with eight bits take 16 blocks

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.240 
rescue me with eight bits take 16 blocks
to<00:02:28.510> implement<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.800> goes<00:02:29.980> over

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
to implement that and that goes over

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.979 
to implement that and that goes over
that<00:02:30.400> limit<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.150> have<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.420> add<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.540> repeater

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
that limit so I have to add a repeater

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.270 
that limit so I have to add a repeater
and<00:02:32.050> that<00:02:32.319> screws<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.130> timing<00:02:35.160> okay<00:02:36.160> up

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
and that screws up the timing okay up

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
and that screws up the timing okay up
here<00:02:36.310> i<00:02:36.580> have<00:02:36.819> the<00:02:36.850> receiver<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.900> and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
here i have the receiver for that and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.430 
here i have the receiver for that and
keep<00:02:40.300> in<00:02:40.420> mind<00:02:40.600> these<00:02:40.810> signals<00:02:41.170> are<00:02:41.260> only

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
keep in mind these signals are only

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.650 
keep in mind these signals are only
coming<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.550> over<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.300> piece<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.870> redstone<00:02:44.340> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
coming in over this piece of redstone so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.540 
coming in over this piece of redstone so
this<00:02:46.660> one<00:02:46.900> wire<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.350> transmitting<00:02:47.890> all<00:02:48.070> seven

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
this one wire is transmitting all seven

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.699 
this one wire is transmitting all seven
of<00:02:48.730> these<00:02:48.880> states<00:02:51.000> all<00:02:52.000> right<00:02:52.380> here<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.680> a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
of these states all right here I have a

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.100 
of these states all right here I have a
pulse<00:02:54.160> generator<00:02:54.580> with<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.060> memory<00:02:55.390> circuit<00:02:55.840> or

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
pulse generator with a memory circuit or

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.990 
pulse generator with a memory circuit or
the<00:02:56.260> RS<00:02:56.950> latch<00:02:57.130> right<00:02:57.340> here<00:02:58.320> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
the RS latch right here and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.660 
the RS latch right here and
so<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.840> torch<00:03:01.110> under<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.500> torch<00:03:02.340> above<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
so the torch under it torch above and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.059 
so the torch under it torch above and
pulse<00:03:05.670> generator

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.679 

and<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.609> output<00:03:08.909> of<00:03:08.939> that<00:03:09.030> pulse<00:03:09.299> generator

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
and the output of that pulse generator

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.250 
and the output of that pulse generator
goes<00:03:10.879> one<00:03:11.879> place<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.269> goes<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.689> into<00:03:13.170> these

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
goes one place it goes is into these

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.750 
goes one place it goes is into these
repeaters<00:03:13.709> which<00:03:15.139> are<00:03:16.139> each<00:03:16.980> separated<00:03:17.579> by

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
repeaters which are each separated by

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.660 
repeaters which are each separated by
three<00:03:18.030> tix<00:03:18.889> with<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:20.010> exception<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.519> this

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
three tix with the exception of this

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.349 
three tix with the exception of this
eighth<00:03:20.849> one<00:03:21.120> which<00:03:21.329> has<00:03:22.109> the<00:03:22.530> extra

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
eighth one which has the extra

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:28.809 
eighth one which has the extra
conditions<00:03:24.359> for<00:03:24.659> handling<00:03:25.139> that<00:03:25.260> delay<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
conditions for handling that delay and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.860 
conditions for handling that delay and
so<00:03:29.819> every<00:03:30.209> three<00:03:31.049> tix<00:03:31.969> each<00:03:32.969> of<00:03:33.239> these<00:03:33.329> torches

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
so every three tix each of these torches

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.099 
so every three tix each of these torches
is<00:03:34.650> turned<00:03:35.219> off<00:03:35.389> like<00:03:36.389> a<00:03:36.419> normal<00:03:36.780> aunt<00:03:36.930> date

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
is turned off like a normal aunt date

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.649 
is turned off like a normal aunt date
would<00:03:37.260> be<00:03:37.730> this<00:03:38.730> is<00:03:38.909> a<00:03:38.939> slightly<00:03:39.359> different

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
would be this is a slightly different

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.089 
would be this is a slightly different

seen this used anywhere else I kind of
came<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:45.989> with<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:47.040> solve<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.370> problem<00:03:47.609> of

came up with it to solve a problem of

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.110 
came up with it to solve a problem of

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
line for each bit all right and then

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.020 
line for each bit all right and then
this<00:05:13.740> this<00:05:14.990> kind<00:05:15.990> of<00:05:16.080> bridge<00:05:16.409> here<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:17.030> powered

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
this this kind of bridge here is powered

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.899 
this this kind of bridge here is powered
from<00:05:18.360> the<00:05:18.629> pulse<00:05:19.469> generator<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.460> it's<00:05:20.639> used

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
from the pulse generator and it's used

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.159 
from the pulse generator and it's used
to<00:05:21.150> reset<00:05:22.310> each<00:05:23.310> of<00:05:23.610> the<00:05:23.789> bits<00:05:24.479> before<00:05:24.840> the

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
to reset each of the bits before the

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.450 
to reset each of the bits before the
data<00:05:25.349> is<00:05:25.500> clocked<00:05:25.770> in<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.900> just<00:05:28.250> clears<00:05:29.250> out

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
data is clocked in that just clears out

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.240 
data is clocked in that just clears out
anything<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:29.879> was<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.180> there<00:05:30.300> before<00:05:30.449> I<00:05:31.250> also

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
anything that was in there before I also

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.589 
anything that was in there before I also
have<00:05:32.659> after<00:05:33.659> the<00:05:33.840> data<00:05:34.050> has<00:05:34.259> reached<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.069> end

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
have after the data has reached the end

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.050 
have after the data has reached the end
so<00:05:36.599> after<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.379> polls<00:05:37.560> has<00:05:37.800> traveled<00:05:38.279> missing

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
so after the polls has traveled missing

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.050 
so after the polls has traveled missing
after<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.389> pulses<00:05:39.810> reach<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.169> end<00:05:40.610> it<00:05:41.610> gets

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
after the pulses reach the end it gets

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.649 
after the pulses reach the end it gets
lubed<00:05:42.270> background<00:05:42.810> and<00:05:43.050> sent<00:05:43.289> back<00:05:43.560> to<00:05:43.590> the

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:44.659 
lubed background and sent back to the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.590 
lubed background and sent back to the
pulse<00:05:45.659> generator

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.380 

and<00:05:49.250> comes<00:05:50.250> up<00:05:50.400> there<00:05:51.650> and<00:05:52.650> is<00:05:53.640> used<00:05:53.850> to<00:05:53.970> reset

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
and comes up there and is used to reset

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.720 
and comes up there and is used to reset
the<00:05:54.660> latch<00:05:54.840> on<00:05:55.170> the<00:05:55.320> pulse<00:05:55.500> generator<00:05:55.890> so<00:05:56.580> that

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
the latch on the pulse generator so that

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.790 
the latch on the pulse generator so that
way<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.180> next<00:05:57.270> time<00:05:57.420> we<00:05:57.630> receive<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.020> start<00:05:58.620> bit

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
way the next time we receive a start bit

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.950 
way the next time we receive a start bit
or<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.580> start<00:05:59.820> pulse<00:06:00.950> from<00:06:01.950> the<00:06:02.010> transmitter

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
or the start pulse from the transmitter

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.170 
or the start pulse from the transmitter
will<00:06:03.960> be<00:06:04.110> ready<00:06:04.290> to<00:06:04.560> to<00:06:05.400> generate<00:06:05.730> a<00:06:05.760> new<00:06:05.940> pulse

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
will be ready to to generate a new pulse

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.010 
will be ready to to generate a new pulse
here<00:06:06.650> so<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:07.950> reason<00:06:08.100> for<00:06:08.370> this<00:06:08.460> latches

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
here so the reason for this latches

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.210 
here so the reason for this latches
since<00:06:10.020> this<00:06:10.230> is<00:06:10.290> connected<00:06:10.710> to<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.040> input

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
since this is connected to the input

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.160 
since this is connected to the input
signal<00:06:11.640> we<00:06:11.820> only<00:06:11.970> want<00:06:12.210> it<00:06:12.270> to<00:06:12.540> create<00:06:12.840> a<00:06:12.870> pulse

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.170 
signal we only want it to create a pulse

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:16.250 
signal we only want it to create a pulse
the<00:06:13.830> very<00:06:14.130> first<00:06:14.430> time

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.260 
the very first time

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.290 
the very first time
that<00:06:16.830> the<00:06:16.950> input<00:06:17.070> changes<00:06:17.580> it's<00:06:18.000> like<00:06:18.120> as<00:06:18.270> soon

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
that the input changes it's like as soon

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.870 
that the input changes it's like as soon
as<00:06:18.510> that<00:06:18.630> start<00:06:18.990> pulse<00:06:19.230> arrives<00:06:19.920> we<00:06:20.700> don't

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
as that start pulse arrives we don't

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.700 
as that start pulse arrives we don't
want<00:06:21.030> it<00:06:21.090> to<00:06:21.210> generate<00:06:21.540> pulses<00:06:21.930> every<00:06:22.170> time<00:06:22.380> I

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
want it to generate pulses every time I

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.270 
want it to generate pulses every time I
you<00:06:23.580> know<00:06:23.670> a<00:06:23.880> bit<00:06:24.210> turns<00:06:24.570> the<00:06:24.840> line<00:06:25.800> on<00:06:25.980> and<00:06:26.160> off

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 
you know a bit turns the line on and off

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.850 
you know a bit turns the line on and off
for<00:06:26.820> the<00:06:27.120> inputs<00:06:29.540> but<00:06:30.540> then<00:06:30.720> at<00:06:30.810> the<00:06:30.840> end<00:06:30.960> when

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:31.860 
for the inputs but then at the end when

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.010 
for the inputs but then at the end when
we've<00:06:32.610> clocked<00:06:32.820> in<00:06:33.060> all<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> data<00:06:33.510> then<00:06:33.900> we

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
we've clocked in all the data then we

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.390 
we've clocked in all the data then we
want<00:06:34.170> to<00:06:34.260> reset<00:06:34.590> it<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.100> that's<00:06:35.250> what<00:06:35.370> that

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
want to reset it so that's what that

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.420 
want to reset it so that's what that
does<00:06:35.670> all<00:06:36.230> right<00:06:37.230> I<00:06:37.500> have<00:06:37.830> another<00:06:38.070> receiver

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
does all right I have another receiver

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.340 
does all right I have another receiver
here<00:06:38.820> which<00:06:39.120> is<00:06:39.300> similar<00:06:39.510> in<00:06:39.750> concept<00:06:39.960> but

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
here which is similar in concept but

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.400 
here which is similar in concept but
i'll<00:06:40.470> discuss<00:06:40.800> that<00:06:40.980> in<00:06:41.070> another<00:06:41.130> video
